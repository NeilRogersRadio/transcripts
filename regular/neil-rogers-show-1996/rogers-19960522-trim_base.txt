And near my queen, God.
All the spigs are brown, out here in LA.
I've been sharing for a while, and I plan to stay.
So why won't hesitate to close this day?
Love you, if your name is Jose.
California's screaming, it happens in LA.
If you cross the border, or you'll touch on you,
you'll pay to touch on you.
I'll make you get down on your name, on your knees.
But you won't have time to pray, won't have time to pray.
You'll be too busy getting by to the end, but tell you won't walk away.
You won't walk away.
California's screaming, it happens in LA.
It happens in LA.
It happens in LA.
So happy what day is this Wednesday.
We're the hell of Spencer.
Oh, Spencer right here today, because it was raining.
He show up today.
The sun is shining, no Spencer.
Grab a mic over there, Rick.
What?
Thanks.
I thought you had a special announcement.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, it's this one.
Try that.
Try that.
Hello.
Oh, okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Test.
Give me the off one.
What do you mean by that?
So we just had a little meeting across the street, and I guess we better tell you before.
It wasn't a hair that Barry Jackson boy.
This little pimple had that fat little putts.
You know, he just takes stuff that he hears rumors on the streets.
He listens to the show incessantly, which I know you're listening now.
Barry, your fat little slob.
And he writes an article in a paper about it in the business section.
There's a sports turd, and he's writing in the business section in the herald.
There's a little more than what he heard on the radio in here, though.
What?
As in, have been summoned to a mandatory 830 AM meeting.
Yeah.
Well, that wasn't heard on the radio.
That was, came from a little.
In some other words, you say there was like a little.
Sorry.
Oh.
Close the complete.
Ha ha ha.
Had it drawn to right under floor and so anyway, I guess everybody's dying to know what was said at the meeting this morning.
actually transcript, that's it.
Now, who was that talking?
Well, we don't want to get into that.
No, exactly.
Yeah, we had a little meeting this morning.
W.I.O.D. has been sold, which of course it's still got to go through the FCC.
you see whatever those letters stand for but uh... you know as of today we're
still uh... being paid by Cox we're still working for Cox
as of today yeah
and about three months that's gonna change when we're working for a buddy but
paxon
our good close personal friend seem like a great guy didn't he
hey listen he remembered me from uh... from saras odyssey to my even pay
of that one eighty bucks
and he owes such fifty we've got to bring it up which that's about three weeks
pay for him exactly did bring it up
while he said last time i saw you you were saying that that we don't see
you later get out of my place and he said you remember that snake you saw
from a y and d that last sunday that was no accident the last that's great
it's gonna be nice working for you
so anyway we're gonna be a uh... paxon station which that's the way the business
is going you know he said something very uh... intriguing over there very
disturbing
and that is that in orlando there are three companies that own with the
exception of one there's one guy that's like the odd man out
because he if they bought him he'd be over the right
three companies on all the amfm stations in orlando only market the whole
country where they happen so far
to be a far
and so like i've said that your government is really interested in protecting
the airwaves we can't say crap more than once an hour on the air we can only
take one once every two hours
but uh... you know if a handful of companies want to buy every guy damn radio
station in the country that's okay
i mean that that's
see i don't care what anybody says that i'm not talking about any specific
a company that's bad
because that goes that goes so far away from what the original concept was of
serving the public good and getting diverse ownership and having a whole
bunch of different people owning the airwaves instead of having just a
limited number of people controlling like some big propaganda machine
every piece of crap that comes out on the airways and radio television
it used to be that radio stations were licensed to serve the public and the
commercials are now basically what it's boiled down with like baseball cards
i said that the other day it's like we used to do when we were kids going out in
the backyard and everybody had a big stack of baseball cards and we would
flip them and we would trade them and that's what radio stations have been like
now that's the nature of the business and of course you can't blame the people
who are in it because they're in it for one reason that's to make money that's
the one thing i've been telling you folks for the last 20 years don't think we're
here to entertain you baby we're here to make money if we can you know if we can
give you a couple of laughs along the way give you some information whatever it is
kill a few hours that's great but we're here to make a book
so you can't blame the people that are in it to make a book but you blame the
goddamn government for turning it into a uh... uh... a trading card thing
which is basically what it is
so what did i just say i don't know what it may take a very well i think i did
very well because i think we haven't uh... having to be put in this position of
that i'm always the one they always do things right before ten o'clock and i
see it to bob niel is we're crossing the street i said okay why don't you go on
here mr. smarty pants and you say your thing because here we are
well don't say this and don't do that and but by and have a big smile on your face
and let's have a and then bob green of course comes up with his usual great
line have a good time
the path through
yes matter fact he was just on his way in shut in the door he was on his way and
i thought i heard the sounds of a bad bout of diarrhea there is what i heard
i got to look up that word marketing though they mentioned so the bottom line
is we're still here we're still a do what our thing and w i d will not the change
so they tell us so they tell us so they tell us and we're still going to you
know say crap and taking occasional one
when you chow cheese oh that's right you weren't here okay i'm sorry sorry about
that you weren't in here i was waiting to come in here and done that now he's a
good one to blame so anyway let's take a little break i have no idea what i'm
going to do today because you know then bob niel says well you know just go
along and do whatever you were going to do today well of course what what what
was i going to do today you what was i going to talk about all day today i mean
does it take a rocket scientist to figure that out i mean this was the big
announcement this was the big good day this was the day we were going on fm we
were going to do this we were going to do that we were buying a uh... what
everybody right right but we're not at least not now well not now it's ten
twelve oh at w i o d oh thank you so much don't rush off anywhere by the way
haha because these people might not call yeah so no it was the me
well they'll call you can't help you if you had if i gave you like a few brief
words how would you describe the tone of the meeting no no smiles well even
but paxon said that he said well looked like a bunch of sour pusses or something
like that and i said watch your language but but uh yeah well yeah because it
was well one was down beat one was up beat they're very excited about getting
us and they're selling i o d in the bottom line is that this company is lost
money on it every year since i think i came here as what he said he
exactly put it that way but uh... there was a reference about something about
that fat fact we've you know ever since we heard him we've lost our ass
but regardless now i said they love us i mean they bought us they spend a lot
of money for it and they said that they want me here which i got a
title that to me is so shocking it's uh... when they brought this
milling so i have to convert that's true but i don't know it was a small
life course we know i got a lot of your car he has he has two fishes on his car
this morning right you talk about covering your ass so you got one on each
uh... over each tail light and i want to eat things i suggest you love that
you know something there's nothing like a corvette with a big fish on the back
ten fourteen at w i o d oh brothers to the rescue yeah this is for the health
castrow you know you guys can eat my shorts cut it mark that's tasteless
fill Henry two to six p.m. on news talk entertainment radio six ten
w i o d okay ten sixteen at w i o d
a m a m a m see all these rumors all you uh... rumor mongers out there
including a lot of you assholes at other stations in the market blow it out
your nose okay blow it out your rectum because seriously i mean i have never
been involved in anything like this were every day there was another rumor and
we were going to f m and we were buying uh... big one oh six and we were buying
y one hundred and uh... we were buying bouquets we were buying everybody okay
and this one is buying us and uh... and then i was going to get paid off and i
could never have to work again not only do i have to continue working again i
have to come in here and sit down on an impossible day
impossible day and they said you're the guy to do it mr. fat so you're the
guy to do it go in there and uh... doing impossible thing that's a quote that's
exactly what they said as matter fact well let's take our first call
of the day here's a model in del Rey hello
hey good morning yes sir i'd and you sound great this morning i'm feeling great man
buddy bud slip me a fifty said here's what i owe you from sarasota minus uh...
tax and recapable tire notice he has susbia change for a hundred and yeah back to
a real quick well just tell the new guy don't change a thing yeah don't mess with success
don't mess with that basically what they said is they like the programming and they
don't want to change anything and of course they're new owners always say that
and as soon as they take over it's like uh... you cranium polka's you know they like to that
ten eighteen yeah do this to that
hey listen yes the panthers are not i can't get them on that like that that's
fucking uh... pn tonight
what you got a great you're kidding me yes pn's not curing a panther game tonight
the fucking baseball games on can i tell you why why
he said the freaking baseball game is on beeped himself that was great yeah i got these
bastards playing perfect in fact uh... in about four months you're gonna have to say the
fn uh... in fact you're just gonna have to say the baseball game is on it anyway uh... there's
no game tonight we're not playing again till friday oh christ will be but you just put your
you just put your finger on it the reason that there's no panther game tonight is because
he s pn is manipulating all the weekday games weeknight games and because they got Monday night
i mean Wednesday night baseball they couldn't play the night and then they couldn't play tomorrow
because of a rena's good showing so we're not playing our first home game to all friday we get
nice rest now uh... friday and then sunday afternoon not a good thing you want to get the tempo up
you know you want to keep them now i don't agree i don't agree with you i'd like to see gordy
murphy get that ankle completely healed up another few days can't hurt and the dwarrior acutely
over that flu and uh... we'll be okay yeah but the whole thing when teams got the flu good
they can only get they can only get sicker
okay and by the way how about you talk about boring detroit losing did you see any of that last
time i didn't i didn't see much of it i'm gonna try it out i really mean this i think
treit which is i've told you this the biggest choke franchise in all the sports they're gonna go

the average i'll give them that but detroit couldn't score into an empty net izerman can't play
uh... ester pulled his groin again he can't play he's uh... uh... paul coffee got hurt last night he
got a hang the other something and they're just uh... they're done they're finished
yeah coffee's probably related to ken coffee yeah
he's in mourning all right and i'm good to go okay enjoy the game tonight
that's okay see you now see if you would just go out and buy a dish you could watch a game
tonight i just make a note i fear the more i know about sports better off i am here what is
that mean jolly some of the paxon people are very sports in texas that true

keel argo yeah coast to coast this uh oh my god there you host two us which is about six and a half
feet if you measure the uh wall and hallway down here poor fadick man he didn't know whether
the screen rate of an ant how would you describe that meeting what one word would you use to describe
the tone in that room besides morose what would be the uh one word great um funeral like oh well
morose comatose well you know paxon said that he said i know you people hate me like poison and
you're really depressed and psychotic but you know well i don't want to know how much is apprehensive
there you go because i mean it cost people certainly were awfully good to us anyway let's take a
call sorry let's take a call on hollywood hello good morning guys how you doing great it looks like
that west coast game is going to be a real boring one and the east coast game is going to go to seven
panthers winning overtime there you go sounds good to me you see that game last night parts bits and parts
oh god did he trade red wings for a team that got 131 points and broke all our records during the
regular season they're the most boring damn team they make my maple leaves look exciting they're
they're a comica they're they're a sleeper well the record indicates we'd rather have
uh Detroit now but yeah we might to handle the avalanche although i do remember that four one
lead we blew against them that was the beginning of our downfall there for about three months remember
you blew that four to one lead but we'll be all right we can we can handle anybody hey also on i
seventy five yes sir i bet we can't wait to the uh or hey cranking that 1962 mac truck up to about
seventy five miles an hour now unbelievable oh they did the thing with the speed limit
well you saw i think i think i just i know they're covering the signs covered now what but i
didn't know what it is so i just go 90 now i just thought i saw like a half of a seven and a
zero it's gonna be 70 it's gonna be 70 and then i see where it used to be 55 it's gonna be 60
exactly right there already unwrap that one well those should have been 90 a long time ago on that
thing oh boy the wheels are gonna be falling off now yeah just get right behind that gravel trucker
right behind the a little alien you're talking about would that beat up old corolla that's good
you guys have a good day and back to you have a great life all these people are great today they're great
if pax was right he's about what he said fatal care that's not in serisona besides that
what i love care who won't you look like like i've always said when people started about wane or
about this one or miki iris and of course i'm not that crazy about miki but the bottom line is
nobody goes to a sporting event because they like the owner people that go to see the reds play
they don't go because they like marge shot head people i listen to the station doles and because
they like cocks well uh cocks broadcasting that is so i'd be surprised if you got five calls
concerning this today it's business is usual you're here they're happy it's getting calls in
there well people in a business over there say i keep hanging up on the court i'll compete for you
didn't call us yet and then welcome us to the uh the paxing family
huh how come mr. ego didn't call yet and say welcome i think it was that line checker on line
five that keeps calling him oh that's bolder yeah yeah he won't be doing that no more okay so it's just
they don't care that there's nothing else going on you got t-shirts the panthers are coming
back to town for the playoffs yeah it goes on and i got my tickets from what he has today and we're
not changing anything as of 10 30 and 20 what he was the operative word when he came in here and
i saw those tickets i'd get one if i had some but you don't i don't now i got to go talk to
Bob green now that i don't work for him anymore maybe he'll you do work for him for another three
months or so well see that's uh figure a speech uh see i know when have you ever been put in that
position i don't like that see the one the one good part about it in recent history what they do is
they have these local marketing agreements it's called an lma and when a station is sold the two
companies that make the deal of the new company gets an lma and they agreed to run the station
at least to a certain point until the fcc approves the deal which now takes about three months
and then then and by that time then you're like kind of eased into whatever's going to be going on
now we're still under the one banner head anyway you know it's kind of like a lame duck thing here
plus the fact that next time Bob greens is a you know that show this more you just go
like that that's all you got to hey you're a walking rectum Bob that's uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
yeah something like that what's wrong with that well see they won't even notice any difference
yeah that's true that's a good point so we're not going now do you want to go well it's i
enjoy standing i feel like i need the aliche on me something you know i have a new line
i just uh i know well it's kind of a shocking thing and then to stick my ass on the ear here
afterward like i'm the old pro you know like i'm some kind of a uh this is not good i don't mean
that the deal isn't good but although it might not be you've told them everything but the whole what
you've told them everything yeah that's that's all right there's nothing else to tell we know
all right i forgot to tell him because he's a bud's holding a presscon my good buddy bud right
uh it is holding a press conference it uh hey listen i'm easy if they the paychecks are good
at 11 o'clock this morning uh 13 million dollars they bought the station for
which seems to me like an awfully low figure doesn't it i would think
didn't they just pay like 57 million for she wasn't that the deal yeah but they must have been making
money oh but 13 million sounds like an awfully low number doesn't it yeah everybody else
i don't talk to the guy huh unless there's something else going on that doesn't meet everybody
else has been talking 40 50 million for this property because w i d not for sale that's what we've
heard not for sale not going to be for sale we're happy with you we're going to stay here oh you
got eight bucks okay we'll take it yeah it's not a real high price but they're very excited they
said this was their best acquisition their biggest AM their most monumental well i got i and z
in the light bulb on a m exactly so and then the other one bud mentioned that i never heard of
before what is that wacoc wacko radio and date it's uh what is that boy he's got properties that
even the commission doesn't know on here hey he's got some maybe he's got some of those um um pirate
stations that are on that's what they can do they can put that might be it i'm going on a pirate
radio baby i'm right i better say all the words you've got paction owning pirate radio
oh yeah i'll just sit here and read the paper for a while okay it's a good good i don't go anywhere
okay in fact we ought to have a big party in here let's get food from florist today let's make
ourselves really extra sick see that's that could be your punishment they he can send you to work for
bubble yeah they've got bubble radio in panamo city there's nothing wrong with panamo city other
than the people and it's beautiful there with the people what are they suck kind of like here i can
relate to the exact oh we're taking a car are we how do we do this here's mirror mar hello good morning
when is deus uh welcome to the wonderful world of buddy bud oh please you know i don't have
home shopping on my channel like well you better get a good talk to you can't listen to this radio
station anymore yeah and you better buy a bunch of stuff you better get a little too to get some
of those pubics there koney is i miss some of the details they only bought iod and not the fm correct
that is right 13 million dollars so next question is what building are you guys can be operating out
of we're going to be moving and not seeing out a little bit well i guess there's nothing
to do with that are you no we're well uh i don't know we're going to be in their new building which
they're erecting if i can say that it's going to be done in a few months and it's going to be up
by four forty one and what skylight mall he said skylight uh my my my garden what do you laugh
about it's a lot better than here brand new can be all digital oh yeah you on the toll too
and if they install any tape machines for playbacks wouldn't like best of i'm a toll on what
uh the turnpike there's turnpike exit at the stadium you could take that yeah oh that's a good
so who cares about the toll when you're making the big bucks uh when you're at least still employed
well that's why they probably like pay 13 million because with the real estate that property would
have been lot more i would think yeah i could have gone up to three two one i never thought that's
right i never thought about that they're also dumping off this building that right excellent you're
lots smarter than we are oh well because uh cox is dumping off this building which is going to be
worth at least another four hundred thousand oh easily easily well listen i wish you well and i
hope they don't mess with it but i guess history has proved well what do you think you're all you're
all experts out there you're all amateur program directors what like the one we got there's only one
other thing they need to eliminate from your station yeah perfect the sports programming yeah but
these people are very smart oriented hey look more of it oh look for a lot of sports yeah one station
with that entertainment one is one station with news yeah we're gonna be the sports dudes in the
morning no no hey they love sports good to do sports on that station okay yeah i think you
got a good point okay pal i will find a go panthers oh we have an open line of brow art oh god at five
two four nine four six three i'm all choked up i really am by neckestiff i feel like Linda Blair
will be all right this is going to be a great thing just keep saying it it's going to be great it's
going to be great it's going to be great right on the blackboard four hundred times could you smile
when you say that it'd be a little more convincing yeah but we're on radio okay so anyway uh well
of course they put us be you know just just keep one thing in mind i'm uncomfortable with this just
no i'm i'm i'm i'm uncomfortable being on a year with uh with rigid guidelines in other words i
can abide by realistic guidelines but when you know you got to have to be careful what you say about
this company and then the other company uh as far as i'm concerned now even though they're not
saying in our paychecks and even though this company still owns this place and they're calling
the shots we work for packs and now that's where our league is not that i'm too faced or anything
like that so when some little twirpy guys is to me be nice to us why because you got a paycheck
coming tomorrow good point i like this company you know what it's like i like Cox it's like one
comes out of secret it's like one company says don't talk about any of this any other company says
and arrest that stuff you're going to talk about don't talk about any of that right but just go
on a year and do you have a great show yeah and have a good time doing it i'm having a good time
every line in the board is like how do you like that but are you impressed we got every line let's
baby no seriously from a technology but the air no matter what i want to say but what i started
to tell you before just keep this in mind yeah just keep this in the top of your cranium and that is
this that three months down the road about the first of september ballpark when this thing goes
through the commission and the sale is complete and uh you know we got to do it at that point we
can say whatever we want about Cox broadcasting that'll be a great day and at that point we can
really uh you know what i'm saying i see because they are great guys they're good folks i love the
sisters of all till super at that point it'll be really interesting because you know i've never
knocked them before ten thirty seven at w i o d lu when you talk live on six ten w i o d you'll be
recorded and we'll play the tape back whenever we feel like it oh is he done okay one forty one
god is damn thing is flying by god are we having a good time or what is it going to go this fast
every day now that buddy butt owns this oh i'm sorry yeah see now you know how i feel in the
way when you sit there in the middle my switch ten forty two at w i o d don't get a new place
we got food from florist coming in we're gonna have a big party here the fm people are safe they
all got up and ran out of there it said i na na na na na na na na na na new people well guess what we're
going to a beautiful new building it's gonna send a new place we all digital you'll have to count down
clock yeah i'll tell you know like here the only digital they come by and i can't say in it

got sensitive all the olic dameini started crying you can't tell the truth that we have a tonight
six computer that everything we get everybody knows that is a joke we have a computer that the
most little kid most five-year-old kids have better computers than i think you're being overly
sensitive i think buddy butt paxon is probably the greatest human alive in cocks well you know
that looks good yeah exactly god oh what's that you are shabling i'm cutting out some more
face he's got a fish on each wheel now yeah what do you want sir what do you want we did not give away
that one what is that that goes back we got it signed out for hey we're doing important stuff in
this car don't worry about some pittly crap in your little one-man promotion

meeting okay let's go to uh dania are we on the air is this just it's kind of like yesterday
yesterday was the preview of this today it's like the afterbirth here's dania hello hey Neil
yes sir how y'all doing i'm we're okay i think i'm correct hello sir how you doing Rick all perfect
okay good hey listen what a relief man godly i thought there was gonna be a major up people or
something like that yeah and it didn't happen i mean everything's normal pretty nobody you
said we were all gonna disappear well i was i didn't know what to think i mean i didn't know
it took three months for things to happen you know with the FCC yeah thank god it was all a little
further close on in other words you think in three months were all gonna disappear is that it i
hope not i don't think so i love you guys well i'll tell you this much that they certainly wouldn't
have assumed our contracts which uh in some cases happened to run into significant amount of cash
if they that no no seriously if they plan on blowing us out in three months what would have been
the point of that no it's pretty dumb they're buying iod because they like it
they got the money yeah because we're in because we're in oh you're the you're the
when it comes to a m everybody else is doing ones and twos we're sitting here with numbers y'all
the boss with the hot sauce exactly exactly what else i picked up lady marathons pretty happy
y'all ain't going remember that lady marathons well that's right all you people that were calling
belly that's a very good point the people that were calling belly it can yesterday screaming
caring on about you're not going to be able to hear us anymore up there in uh
where we're in how they were in marathon and up in uh viro and uh all those red necks up there
all indos uh you still got us now whether you like it or not and of course i said here yesterday
telling you that a m radio was like nickers and it was out and of course buddy bud told us this
morning a m is great it's a great medium and i had to do agree with them i think i think
i think i think you were mistaken yesterday we all we all make we make premature evacuations
that's what mario said the other and we just uh you know spoke too soon a m's where it's at
that's right even those pickers got an a m radio and they're old pickup
that's sure right not everybody can afford a fancy high-floot and fm that's right thank god
right anyway i thought that's what i said yesterday you better be sending us a whole mark card
oh god well anyway how about one of them t-shirts now oh sure no problem all right you'll love it
thanks man okay hang on uh lion six send that uh y'all who one of these are gonna have a dozen of
these damn panther things they say beware panther country and they got the rats and though there's a
big one there and they're like parachuting in baby by the way there's a toll lady blonde toll
lady at the glades who you've probably seen who's got a rat posted this morning she's a nice lady
she always has a good morning sign that had the um the night after the last win against uh
filanofia the uh sixth game she's the one that had the uh get cup crazy sign on air and had her
panther flag sticking out the uh her thing she's the best yeah rat up this morning she had a
rat up her thing oh yeah maybe it was a rat tail whatever happened with that by the way today
ever contact us uh since we gave them such nice coverage here we gave out their phone number the
rat tail people they didn't are they cellinos yeah there's cellinos damn things and they said the
first two hundred bucks goes to the Jimmy Rice Fund and the yadda yadda yadda and uh that was the
and so i finally broke down to give their number they're probably too busy taking orders right now
they don't have time to call and say hey we got a ton of uh i don't know if anybody wants those
i mean do those really look like rat tails to you they'll put on anything nobody listens to
the show anymore anyway so you know we don't yeah no they you know they're good enough i thought
when i saw them that they would go and you said add don't never catch on yeah i bet they do
by the way can i tell you the only person out of all the rumors the only per he won't mind my
saying this because he's a professional yadda anyway that gave me the correct information and he
had just heard it out on the street like at a bus stop somewhere was rimmer really yeah yeah our
overnight guy was so far off and everybody else who's got us buying this and going over night guy
just to see what's going on well that's true but but he has a good feel for things
no seriously all that crap about uh fm so so the bottom line it's kind of strange too because you
realize now that within the building for those who've never been in the building which is almost all
of you we have the three radio stations the two fm's in the a m right you said we up and uh us them
up and down the hallway so now hot 105 and the coast they're staying as cocks properties they're not
going nowhere because they love did i tell you that's what cocks loves is fm right they love those
music jukeboxes that's how they know uh make their money make a lot of money don't make any trouble
right and so we're here too in the same building for at least uh well that's going to be
interesting too because even after the ownership change comes through we're still going to be here for
a while because he said about eight or nine months before the new buildings done they got some
neat stuff down there that's good work we're like to step children of this building right and tip the
goddamn pd of the coast and stand out there and all like nah nah nah nah nah you little twerp
he said that yeah what a twerp what an overgrown child weeny man 13 year old pd on the coast and by
the way that Gloria Estefan sucks tip oh i should have put a comma in there so anyway it's 1048
that was bad even for me that was bad but i did mean it 1048 at w i would be lit
so
Alex Bennett Steve chain Nick Lauren Scotting shape in Mike Glora Scott Swartz Herman and McBeam

Chermahoney Johnny Dolan Aileen F.D. name is global and Hummel Stan major Darcy McIntyre
surprise very Larry Potluck honey for Sharon Francis Joan Hans sisters we gel in the pair apart
we can't forget the people though we try to hide them and forget we knew them they used to work

Clark Johnny darken Joseph Gacky Hank Goldberg Mc Green Marvin woman

let's have that
and we're out there giving just a make a living we are all just people you don't even want to know
okay 10 55 at w i o d so anyway if you want to fax us some good stuff you got any more good rumors
to add to what we had in the meeting this morning 7589 463 maybe Barry Jackson would like to fax us
over the latest on what's really going on 7588 w i o d these are the only one that knew
you're that's a good point and they put it in the business section yeah and i guarantee you the
herald was probably dancing a jig if i can say that figure oh yeah well a paxan by zio d that fat
faggot's gonna be off the air that don't like the herald guess what guys i'm not going anywhere
and buddy bud said he's gonna double my pay something like that he mumble something or was it
half double something yeah mumble double so anyway let's do uh oh look at that wait a minute wait a
minute don't go stepping on a superstar here who's got his own show Nick Lawrence good day you have
a good day welcome to the radio ma yeah welcome to the wonderful world of buddy bud i had almost
forgotten yeah nick is part of the family yes he is you're part of our extended family man hey bro
oh bro yeah i heard john levitt on here this morning this guy used to be my producer
you guys are really scraping it yeah john levitt used to be my producer yeah he's grown as a talk show
how he indicated me if he's grown any boy there must be a so-and-to pair of pants together room he's
grown i didn't hate Rick yeah you did no you didn't like me got me fired i didn't get you fired
that's because that's just because you were black don't take it personally yeah it wasn't anything
you did it's just because you're skin color right uh oh don't say that he didn't like the haircut
so let me ask you this now has everybody over there known about this for some time or do you
just get the word or how does uh get broken down to you you're going to find out in the future that
secrets are very well kept and they don't say anything until the last possible seconds so nobody
here knew anything nobody here knew it either i mean nobody i mean even people that you would
think would have to know nobody nobody knew anything everybody was paid off to keep their mouth shut
the only one and like Rick just said the only guy in town i knew it was Barry Jackson
which is a hell of a sad comment so what's the scuttle vote over there what's the reaction now
that we're all going to be sucking out of the same trough some people are panicked yeah panicked about
why i know how a radio people get they don't like change and some people are in vacation right now
so they're upset because when you're in vacation just just just just just just tell me what your problem is
so mr. came may call you later on today uh now you're getting carried away i mean i'm my 20th
anniversary that was one thing i mean that was hard to swallow but uh you know let's let's take it
slow let's ease into this nick it'll be fun why would you be panicked over there what changes could come
i don't know right now i think everything is cool everything will be fine well let's get into some
of those rumors because while our imagination has been stagnant the concern of you i'm sure that
you probably have come up with your own we've got back to topics that's what it is
everything that i know for sure is that everybody at ftl who's on the air today at 1057
tomorrow right okay and everybody who's on io d today will be on the air tomorrow if they show up
right that's right in the future holes that were going to all be one huge big building right
and now let me ask you how can you guys also keep though and you don't ask me because they
didn't sell the property i guess which is kind of a joke no that's not true because these these
people uh... i'm were desperate to get out i guess is the way to put it let me ask you are you
in the building now the old i and z is eight of building no i'm still up here for a lot of
there ftl yeah they have a restarted the new building i thought you guys moved into the uh
old i and z where i used to work no the i and z building they sold that out right to some record
dubbing house out of the in uh... called calisity are you kidding so they make records out there so
they don't have any stations that building anymore now it's empty got to go to the
know that i don't know i was going to go there to show up for work tomorrow yeah so you're in
still in the state of low who the case all right
hey welcome aboard well thanks so much we feel like i'd invite to appear as a guest on your show
we can uh... attack you show like we used now we can have kind of an incestuous relationship if
you pardon that expression this would be absolutely wonderful yeah hey hey hey hey steve
steve still got my old police record
oh yeah yeah i look forward to getting together with you steve yeah i want to go and show
we're going to appear in the couple of things out maybe we get maybe we get maybe we can get
hearing on your show listen maybe we can get Alex Bennett and they're gonna get a three way
that would be great yeah so Rick when you really had just a few people think what they can i
just just just just just just just tell me what your problem you will have just like a big
celebration party when the whole thing becomes final log it together and we'll just uh... air our
gratitude how's that wonderful yeah yeah Rick says we'll put all that stuff in our behind is what he
said whatever that means i look forward to a great future together okay steve oh thank you see
you so anyway all this is this is disgusting it's so sick you hang on across see how you like it
w-i-o-d Miami Fort Lauderdale use talking entertainment radio six ten w-i-o-d
she looks like a lady like a lady like a lady like a lady like a lady like a lady like a lady
oh yes there is a dick between the thighs you showered me with kisses i thought you were my queen
but i noticed something funny i saw the bulge in your jeans she looked like a lady like a lady
like a lady talked like a lady but i got why oh
oh there was a dick between the thighs oh yes there is a dick between the thighs
you were my perfect lover but how i was surprised not only do you have one but you're not
circumcised she looked like a lady like a lady like a lady like a lady talk like a lady but i got why
there's a dick between the thighs oh yes there is a dick between the thighs oh
w-i-o-d
no no no okay 1107 at w-i-o-d well yesterday at this time we thought it was going to be and then
of course redberry jackson's column who evidently had some loose-lipped source over there at some
place to tell him that there would be no changes at w-i-o-d programming and that everybody's
uh whatever and i'm thinking to myself oh my god bug paxons by the station i'm going to get
bought out because he sure don't want me on a year and they're going to give me like millions of
dollars and i'm going to go off to italy in the room the world and live a life uh sure
i already told you i don't have that kind of luck just ask the fat man at the track okay he'll tell
you i don't have that kind of luck it just will never happen for me even for uh Mikey over there
hey by the way how you doing Renery Renery is listening right now Henry Barrow he's out there
he's high five and with Roger saying oh there worse off than we are how do you know that i mean
we might be okay here's a matter of fact look you've got Dennis Collins in there of course you know
what's the uh this they still own at Jefferson pilot as of today or what waxi
because i know that beasley is using that to throw the panther games on there but i don't believe
they have any lma with them or any spca or wpa or uh anything so who knows like i said just go
out there buy a big box of trading cards baseball cards hockey cards whatever you like and just
start flipping them around say hey here's my own radio station here's a waxi here's i od here's the
coast and just uh you know that that should be like a new board game better than monopoly man because
that's what they're all getting is a big juggernaut god damn monopoly but hey we're glad to be a part
of it aren't we because we like to be employed oh thank god so anyway here's uh bokeh bokeh hello
good morning Neil yes sir uh my would have surprised i was looking forward to you know Neil unplugged
every day on fm and now yeah and now it looks like the opposite the only thing i know about buddy but
paxon is what you is that memo you once read us over the air oh yeah and uh the the station uh
reflects he did mention that they were going to be getting that guidebook the uh paxon guidebook
right off the bat this is going to become a Christian value radio station no no it's just that i
have to put a fish on each side of the car but other than that it'll be okay but anyway you know
i know you know in fact dean goodman is the uh general manager so you got to have a few token
Jews in there so he winked you know dean winked at me in the meeting said hey welcome aboard
well that's a good thing yeah but i'll tell you what i said hot dog hopper board i hope that they don't
try to muscle muscle any of uh the people that i love on uh w i don't think so because not only did he
buy a station but he bought the audience well they know that okay i mean he went on he made a uh
lengthy i mean a long ponderous i mean a drawn out thing about uh how they love the station
and the station is the people on it and the programming they've done all this research and uh
they don't plan of course of course they're always going to say they don't plan any major changes that
doesn't hold any water with anybody i mean that's not a knock at him but it's just uh everybody always
says that but uh well you know what would be the purpose of buying this station if you didn't want
to keep the people who have the numbers on the station you follow what i'm saying what would be the point
uh i hope that that's logical yeah i mean there wouldn't be a point unless you were trying to
unless you had an agenda you were trying to buy a big station to to pursue that agenda no no i don't
hear too much religious programming on a like ball or an i and z okay no the the agenda is the
dollar bill that's all these people in broadcasting today that's their agenda regardless of any
personal stuff trust me when i tell you it's a business well no i don't want a t-shirt or
anything i just want me fifty dollars yeah okay thanks a lot thank you have a great day so
everybody can take a big deep sigh a big breath of relief except my friends at the herald over there
except for Barry Jackson who happens to be okay for a fat little puss yeah he actually sniffed
this all out he's the only guy in town you got to give him a little bit of credit not too much but
he actually went and doubt he sniffed it out so when's bow camper going to q a m we have an open
line on a green line now was he wasn't at the meeting was he and man which wasn't there of course
not full-time employees but they were conspicuous by the rapsons defo was there he had a beer in one
hand in a golf club in the other hand kept winking at Steve nickel i don't know what that was all about
oh boy talk about an incestuous relationship god almighty uh did i just say that i don't think so
it's eleven because we want a super service each other here that's what it's all about bring
JC and here i'll show them what super services it's eleven after eleven at w i o d get also anyway
you know the thing that really gave me the most confidence in the meeting this morning first we
had bob niel and bob green from cox broadcasting breaking us the news and bob niel reading his prepared
statement which i thought was a little kind of a stiff reading their bob and then but paxon and his
people came in iridana clock and the thing that really gave me the utmost confidence when all the
fm people left it was just as a m people sitting in the room and but paxon is kind of a big guy in it
and imposing presence stood up there in front of the room and said the worst talk radio i've ever heard
my livers on w out the worst talk radio i've ever heard my livers on w out yeah and we all say
he loves us he loves us he lads you we have an open line on the green line one eight hundred nine
four four nine four six three one eight hundred nine four four w i o d here's north mimey b
chill out good morning yes sir i'm going to ask you a question here like a really wise person
i'm going to ask you this why is that the state continuously attacks the pyramurial industry
i don't understand that you know what do you mean by that well they're always giving them a hard time
i don't understand because the state of a bunch of bozos don't you understand if if the state
weren't a bunch of bozos we'd have had full card simul casting in card rooms and all this other stuff
five years ago when everybody else was starting to put it in i don't know we're always the last and
the worst i don't know if they realize every time you make a bet you're helping to stay out i don't
know they don't realize that but you're asking me like it like i'm supposed to make sense out of
finally they got it through the legislature and they also the same debra miller who was holding
it up for months and months and months and while as long as the legislature passed it let's expedite
it and allow it right away now instead of waiting till the first of july so we can take advantage of
all the extra revenue that's coming in yeah i was that is that brilliant or what how about the extra
revenue that could have been coming in for those months while they were holding it up well you know
i don't get it i'm going to ruin the call by asking this what do you think about carry mills as pd
like i said we have an open line and date seven five one nine four was that gary mills boyfriend or
what jesus sounded just like him seven five one nine four six three and date we got an open line
on a green line you better call on those green lines because now that we got a new outfit coming in
here they're going to want to know okay which lines work which ones get the calls they're not
going to be spending a hell of a lot of extra money wasting money down a drain they're going to
make money with this turkey okay they're going to show the cocks people how it's done trust me when
i tell you they're going to show these folks how to turn a damn big profit are they okay so
anyway it's eleven seventeen it's just an amazing thing boy and if you've never been in no matter
what kind of business although i guess in radio it happens more frequently than any other business
you know what the entire staff is called in and they sit you down and they say well uh guess what
today uh we're uh decided we're you know for a whole bunch of bogus reasons we're selling this
place and here's your new owners and some of you are working here and some of you are not and if
your name is still on the list on the that kind of stuff it's a very very gut wrenching experience
anyway eleven seventeen let's do four-letter deal hello hey male yes sir how can you work for this guy
you know you hate him why not what do you want not how about the present owners how about them
hey you've ripped him and you haven't ripped them well not as much as you've got a
well you see that's called survival is what it's called i got you yeah yesterday i was looking
to fat Hank and he said you'll only work for cock yeah yeah you know something let me tell you
again i don't care about the hummer okay i'm not interested in what he has to say all his cute little
lines i'm sitting here making more money on one job than whoever make doing ten jobs and uh he's
sitting over there on a radio station it's got one and two shares with a little pimple face kids
on here and you guys out there worried about what the hummer says i don't care i'm not interested
all right doesn't phase me i consider the source a bitter frustrated fat old man that's the hummer
all right well listen you give buddy big packs in hell okay don't let him intimidate you and
don't i'm gonna i'm gonna make him Jewish i'm gonna convert him to trust me but he's not going
on your show is he no chance all right too bad you guys aren't going on to big one or six that
would have been an awesome line of how it's turned you well that that was the rumor you know that
was the rumor do you think it could happen still no no chance no way Jose he's shown me the light
a m is where it's at just when you hear all that crackling and puking and popping just this
regarded a m is where it's at come on Neil don't i mean i can't believe you're saying this now it's
just a joke it's just just lighten up okay just no i don't want you to i want you to still be the
the angry profit denouncement hypocrisy of our time do you want to be an angry profit denouncement
the hypocrisy of our times what's wrong with being an angry profit denouncement the hypocrisy of our time
okay get lost pal we have an open line and powered five two four like i'm sitting here sucking
up or something i'm just doing uh what is uh necessary to be done that's all it's called survival
and to be quite honest with you i'm ambivalent about the whole thing right now anyhow
it might turn out to be great it might turn out to be crap we don't know how the hell do we know
if i had crystal balls i sure wouldn't be sitting here i'd probably be a therrologist
but uh you know it might turn out to be fantastic what can i ask you a question and why is it that
lights are lighting up that don't even have phone lines i mean putting people on hold while i uh
talk to cigar Dave cigar Dave we don't have nothing to do with them anymore if he wants to
horror this show he's uh whistle and dixie that's lob boy oh boy cigar Dave and i got news for it
buddy bud paxon came up to me after the meeting this morning and whispered and i first in my ear
the first show that's gonna be off this station is that stupid cigar show from Tampa i don't think so
uh nioh because uh we're on on a paxon stations in Orlando and Jacksonville he says he says just
like a big cigar that show blows hey i hear we're fighting the full hinder show in the afternoon
it's gonna be off cigar talk in the afternoon funny you're a real clown hey nioh i you know is in my
any yesterday unfortunately i couldn't come by to uh you know to drop off some cigars because
probably you wouldn't let me in the studio anyway true i know that true and you know something nobody
who listens to the show listens to your show on Saturday nobody what are you talking about i'm
just telling you you've got your own select little audience there on Saturday i'm not knocking
you you're making uh something out of nothing you're making gold out of chop liver i commend you
for that but don't think that these people are making gold out of chop liver for years nioh i'm
just following you yeah talking about bad chance you're the best there is at that umum i'm telling you
hey listen what are you eating out nioh you get some uh rascal houses and wolfies or what
let me ask you a question to tom pala veta put you up to this car well tom pala veta is sitting
right here yeah just walk check this i was a geek he comes in a mind i know he comes in my prime
office beyond spoken of cigar here you know and he guy's got to come in and bother me i want you to
tell him convey a message to him is one of the things as we sever our relationship very soon with
cox broadcasting on this radio station one of the things that i'll never ever forgive i mean
forget is and that was a Freudian slip was the great opportunity we had to be on ws u and had the
great association with toddler eastern tom valvita for those two years whatever was of agony and hell
well i won't relate that to him yeah you know they miss you up here now bet they do everything do
i wish i could say the same you're gonna stay with uh iad yeah i hope yeah i'm going nowhere
you're sticking around they have uh assumed my uh deal which has another three and a half years on
it so i assume that i'll be here you know um i hear he's got a big got you out and no problem since
you're such a big parent and you get food delivered into your studio yeah and you got a studio where
you get to hold your own microphone and you have to wear headphones like me right that they're
gonna let you fly in the big uh packs and yet i wouldn't be surprised at that in fact if paxon
on us already i guarantee you that next Tuesday i'd be on my way to pittsburg and the packs and
yet for that penguin panther game you probably would especially if you bought the team
there you go that's something to think about him you know you know you could be the official spokesman
of the uh for the panther yeah well we're working on it hey uh nila i've got some cigars that i'm
going to send you and George great yeah George is George is the on George is in their yawning profusely
i was just bad timing i'm not already told i need a crate yeah he says he loves your show and it's
the best on radio and sent him a bunch of cigars yeah he likes sucking up because he's only got one
that's it okay Dave you're killing a man you're killing and you're killing me too
i know i'm killing long asses to you pal you're killing me now you see it see it say goodbye
oh that guy now how does he happen to call today what what what did i do to get the uh you know
to deserve the honor of that it must have been something really bad cigar Dave who's on smoke
this every Saturday between doing it too and is that a show oh oh baby wow that's on right
before suck this isn't it it's 11 23 at w i o d if you but at six ten w i o d we talk a lot about the
dolphins but this week they'll have to wait big burly guys smacking each other and slapping a
little puck around get the spotlight in the west for lord standlies cup the best panther coverage
is right here on news talk and entertain the radio six ten w i o d many of us may not be getting
enough when you were young and you looked in your sister's draw you probably tried her dresses on
and now you figure it's okay since you saw brave hot and saw skirts on a guy
but you killed us too high
it killed us too high put some underwear on will you miss the one hundred world
we just are playing golf with difo windows Steve i'm sorry it's 11 28 at w i o d happy
Wednesday to you we're starting to you know it's one of those things it's like a shock in the
beginning you know that starts to sink in and you realize that you're in the big packs in
family with mr. ego and with Nick Lawrence and with john levit and with norm and cat and Alice
rantell and with now who the hell is that i and see do you know that people i worked with years ago are
still over there mike wolf doing the news Lori shepard huh whatever happened to frank motek i know
he's not it he went to california he's a good guy but uh... mike wolf's a good guy great new guy
pizza box Andy yeah close the pizza box will you slobio i know you didn't but close it anyway slobio
so who's the um no who's the guy who used to remember the guy from Detroit that we had over here
the one day that i think is the greatest was such a great news guy and he was on channel seven
for about two weeks he does news over at i and z so then great he's great he's like a real news guy
he's at i and z i'm not saying turn on i and z because quite frankly forget that but uh... it's just
we're just trying to see who were in bed with now so to speak you know when you're like in the middle
of this big radio orgy and you kind of look around just to see who's uh... toa is sticking out
there in whose armpit and whatever and what is that object over there here's plantation hello
you yes sir uh... i was thinking that uh... maybe paxon put a put you on one of the fm stations
they all like uh... she or zeta there's no possibility of that
because she just had a format change in the blue i will you know i never really thought about that
there's no see this guy this guy's a lot smarter than we are george i never really thought about that
on on she there's no telling it all it's just michael luis comes on there and you hear his voice but there's no
i figure there when he when he told the deal goes through and uh... we just lost this guy dammit
got a call waiting we like he better call back he's the only guy that we call today when we
think we're talking about you my favorite thing on she is when the music ends in michael luis says
brachum and that's you know that we do this it for me but anyway yeah i don't know that's a
possibility huh because he's got some fm's in the market he's got love i don't think we're going
on love ninety four but he's got she and he's got zeta and uh... he's got some cash yeah she needs help
yeah yeah that's right so anyway here's uh... pember pines hello pember pines
you mind a wrong line you might do something wrong yeah i went to a green line that's what i did
wrong here's my me hello hey how's it going here okay i think if i can say that yeah i think we
got over the hump today we're still employed yeah um did you check your voice mail today i never
check it george did you check it nothing there you kidding no no we've been kind of busy here today
bill was doing something yesterday afternoon uh... just before the end of the show he was just
going through the voicemail and he was doing that for four hours yesterday there was a message in
there for you it was an old blue hair yeah they called up and said i hope you're not leaving
kneel or really by the way do you have any t-shirts i love it yes so by the way do you have any
t-shirts yeah all right i'll take one okay old lady hang on line one i was cute
now that was worth it he'd earned the t-shirt how many we got three left by the way thanks to
Lewis and Linda sanchez no relation to rick i pray from dragons den costumes in pember pines it says
please enjoy the t-shirt design and thank you for the many listeners that you sent by to buy panther
rats how do you like that so i guess i'm going to have to get the lowdown on this whole packs
in organization now we're going to have to find out dean goodman what he's all about i still can't
remember the name the one guy his name is hoker was that his name because he said it's like hooker
without the other row j j j but is the name hoker is that it yes are you sure hoker with one of
hoker but i mean is that my pronouncing it right hoki j hoki he said what's the
subcession with hoki and i said shut up bald he said on and then there's the tall guy al uh
alan something or other alan something or other and then there's dean goodman which i know him
because he actually would be right yeah al niri yeah he's bringing the chocolates to the
pope yeah but anyway um i did know dean goodman because he used to be general manager of love 94
back in those days when it was like everybody had one station or maybe two stations and then all
of a sudden he got involved they passed and bought up love 94 and he was like the general manager
of 175 radio stations so now i guess it's 176 he can't be all bad he's Jewish how do you like that
oi here's plantation hello hello nil yes sir good morning wait as deas listen i wanted to ask you the
the avalanche what was our record against indoor in the season not good not good at all huh i remember the
last game we played out there we blew the lead and we wound up with a tie the game here that we had
a four to one lead after one period we wound up blowing a game and losing it over time so i don't
remember the whole i don't know what the overall record was although maybe that's all we played
him because there are any other conference we may have only played him twice yeah which would be
o one and one and what's with the red wings they seem like they're in a coma they are in a coma
and steve iserman is all spent all this time in a hyperbaric chamber holding on to his groin and
paul coffee left after the second period last night did not come back and then bob eerie got nailed
and he didn't come back there they're done they are done better off he seems like he's not into it
at all do you know he scored one goal in the whole playoffs i know i mean for a guy with his talent i
mean it's like he's but i don't like he's in the fog or something yeah and see like there are real
choke team they are i didn't i am i not the one that told you this many months ago even while
they were winning every day in game and i said you just wait everybody laughed at me they said
they're a force they're like a dynasty i said you wait till the playoffs somewhere along the line
and probably before the finals they will choke the big one and they're they're gagging on it
yeah no one's gonna have to tell you mentioned the she isn't there station in davi
and
kind of yeah at least it was now what it's in davi i thought that was a q a m q a m in kiss
well that's miramar the reason i asked that was because i was out that way about a week ago
and it's riding through a trot trailer park there where it is and at the back of the trailer
for it isn't a trailer park right there radio station right you know that's exactly correct
seems kind of a nod spot that the radio in the center of a trailer park unless you're going to go
country i don't know maybe any chance again a t-shirt oh my god are you kidding me no problem okay
thank you line six take care of that fine settlement right there huh
so i'm not getting 80 million dollars i was that to deal i'm not getting like one big check

what was that?
mobile one cellular and AT&T wireless customers do it for free pound iod
one load baby one load one load on a baby from mobile one cellular AT&T wireless and news
talking entertainment radio six ten wiod
what the hell was that? that's a spot with the wiod sounding out q on it followed by a promo
well what kind of garbages that won't be here and that kind of sloppy stuff anymore once
uh we get you know what i'm saying exactly once we get our crap together won't be here no
sloppy a bull crap like that speaking of sloppy bull crap what do you want Brian?
how you doing Neil? this is Brian the board op from uh FTL who continues looking for an audience?
i have moved up and beyond being the board op at FTL. yeah? who are you servicing now?
i mean what are you doing now? oh that's that's funny the only sassing is that no one can't
does an Amsterdam he's missing out on all of this good news. yeah well he'd probably be too
incoherent to understand it right now anyway. that's probably true. uh huh? probably true.
but i think we're going to have like the coolest Christmas party we'll have Rick and
suds we'll have you we'll have uh Steve Kane and we'll have Paul Castron over we're going to have
like the cool you know i forgot about castron obelivert that about him oh my god. number one in the
market now he'll probably number one in what? well right behind Howard's turn by a point or
something. no actually he beat him out. did he beat him out? yes he did pretty badly two as a matter of
fact. i never thought i'd be there. we got number one in midday by heads and shoulders which you're
talking to right now and uh we'll see. and i'm number one overnight. well that doesn't matter but
you know what do you got a point one? no. number one. i had a four five. a four point five share
overnight. at ftl. oh my god and if only some of them were under the age of a hundred you'd be
right in the ballpark. that's true. well you're no john levert just keep saying that to yourself.
i don't know what it is. nick warrens is dragging all of these talk show hosts from the 1970s and
having them fill in for the norm can't while he's on vacation. yeah that's it's sabotage is what
it's called Steve probably put him up to it. well i want to see your next time next time you see john
levert just steer him in the face and go uh-huh and see what he does. i think he's still wearing the same
clothes he was wearing when he worked at w n w s. he used to sleeping him. i never thought that we
would be working at the same company but you're not going to be in the same building as us though.
yes we will. aren't you going to be up there on four forty one? yeah. yes we will. oh how do you
like that? that is just very bizarre. so you better get your knee pads ready Brian. oh yeah that's
right. okay. all right but we'll be looking for you. okay believe me. we have an open line. yeah
that's Brian. he's a good guy. he's okay. he looks pretty good. yeah that's right. we'll have
JC in there. he'll be like hanging around just being there from around. that's it's going to be a
great thing. you know what? just keep saying that to yourself. no i started to say this before.
and then i kind of interrupted myself which i've never done before. and that is when something like
this happens and of course you have these preconceived notions about everybody. although i'm
the last many years of my life i've been much less in other words i don't care about jay core about
this company about new city. i don't care about any of that. it doesn't affect my life. in other
words if ever they should buy the station one of those companies then at that point i start figuring
out are they good? are they bad? are they assholes? what are they? but all these people that spend their
whole lives worrying about what? and of course most of the people that spend a lot of time worrying
about stuff like that are people who are always looking for a job like pd's. oh yeah well clear
channels doing this and jay core is doing that and my ads on pades 28 and r and r. oh sorry
stuff like that. but uh you know you can't in other words you can't tell what the water is going to
taste like until you drink from the well right? isn't that the way it works? something like that is
it. yeah i just made that up. it was kind of like a half a line from the godfather.
he must let us draw the water from the well. is that what he said? if he's our pizon, if he's our
friend. must let us wet our beak. exactly that's what i just said. he must let us wet our beak.
what a chicken shots comment that was. so anyway buddy bud said you can have all the water you want
as long as it's so late and they keep bringing it to you for free and i said thanks a lot pal.
hey listen the man is from Rochester, New York okay right off the bat. he's mentioning
w-h-a-m-w-h-a-e-c. w-s-a-y. right off the bat we got this great relationship okay. he's a big sports
fan. he loves the panthers. okay so we can't all be a goyem. i mean what's you know some of us are
gotta be Jews just to keep the word going. i don't know but like i said it starts sinking and you really
don't know you get to that point where you're kind of like in that and i'm sure by later on like
it detracted him i'd be really confused. here's pember and of course talk about yenthas. oh won't
that be great favorit. you'll be there. here's pember pine. hello. hey good morning
my dear Roger. how are you? i'm doing okay. listen i- uh i would listen to Rick and
sir this morning going to take about nine or fifteen. i've kept over the i and z because i wanted to
get a traffic report. oh that was a bad mistake. well i drive for a living so i need a traffic
report now and then. yeah. well anyways i heard the lady say hey Neil welcome back and i said
are you sir? i bet it was Laurie Shepherd. no it was the lady and then she said
well i know Laurie Shepherd's a lady. yeah and then she wouldn't want to say that how you had worked
for two other stations and she wouldn't also want to say that how many stations that just
packed them home. right. how did i be that going you know and how do you like that? yeah so then
but i i never heard it on on your station you know until until you came on. well that's because
the other thing was on tape we were having our meeting we were holding our meat across the street
and anyway how you know about six months ago Rick and sir had a down that was a psychic. yeah
and he mentioned something about this change. are you kidding me? honest. oh i had to
Rick the wrong warning about it. did this psychic we could you know if this psychic was on because
he was trying to it was something concerning the dolphins you know and uh yeah i guess you wanted
to you know get the dolphins in the in the winning spirit of something right but this psychic
well i know i know the guy you're talking about right right. where did we i'm doing your show and
i'll still be listening. thanks a lot pal. bye bye. have a great life. yeah we're still employed.
we're still here. how do you like that? uh uh some people don't like it too bad blow it out your
ass like those people over there at the herald. huh we got a real surprise for you guys.
we have an open line in uh brown word five two four nine four six three although we do like the
mimey heat a lot and we especially like mchererson i never thought about that right because the heat
are on uh several of their stations like five or six of them so everybody can hear them at night
i never thought about that. that mchererson's a hell of a good guy. oh right if you think we're
gonna start singing a company line on this guy damn show you got another thought coming but you're
probably right i'll tell you that i'll see the color of the money is what i'll see i'll see what that
check looks like that big corporate check on thursday starting in september i'll like hold it up
against uh the cox one and see what they look the same you know i'll rush that thing over the bank
and see whether they're smiling or pushes any bigger like oh this is a paxon check no problem

news talk at entertainment radio six ten w i o d
mochope jejo pero no tengo bunta

tootaco okay eleven fifty one at w i d we got a nice party in our pants here from floras our
friends up the street on seventy nine just uh on piscayne on whatever that is seventy nine
just uh east of piscayne nothing like floras baby they are so great to us now they're going to
still keep coming here even after i think so just tell them to bring the fish sandwich we have
an open line and broard five two four nine four six three we got one on a green line one eight hundred
nine four four here's my amy hello hey nil yes sir i love that bet the tootaco i bet i'll bet you
do and it's getting close to lunchtime how do you like that a few questions yeah you're still
going to keep your six ten calling right we're going to keep one takes forever
ever going to be on the sick to get that taste and smell how do you system yeah we're still going
to be on fixed and we're not going anywhere yeah um good also now are you going to re uh are you
going to redo your contract with uh paxon or are you just going here they're they're they're
assuming it they're assuming so George's not going to get any more either oh i don't know that's
between him and him no i heard doubt it you don't you don't put your fingers in that they said
they they pay by a height so and he's in big trouble oh and my last question being um actually not
my last but uh what about the i got you down lady is she uh are they going to blow her off
i i don't think so they said they were buying out all these contracts and she was the one of
them so i assume she's going to be here yeah but with the right wing mentality i mean with
the sex and all well if they had a right wing mentality that they wanted to put over
on a year why would they keep me here in other words if they want to draw numbers she doesn't well
so i rest my case i don't know i really can't tell you i know she was in the meeting i saw her for
about a half a second and uh nobody said goodbye but i i to be honest with you i think her deal is um
i don't know whether it's expired already or if it's up in september somebody said yesterday her
contract is up in september and that's about the time when the uh the uh fcc would approve the
so i don't know well we're asking for something so i do know i do know this and i'm not letting
any cats out of the bag because paxson said this in public many times they're very sports oriented
they've already got the heat they've already got um you know their sites they would like to keep
the dolphins on a station which they'll have this dog the dolphins for this next season and i
think they would like to get the panthers in the marlins and the whole ball of wax so maybe we can
have you from uh ten to two and then from say six to ten with uh panther talk yeah there you go
hey that's it and last but least uh could i get that t-shirt oh my god do we have any left by the way
George oh we have three left okay no problem hey i appreciate it hang on have a great one he's on my
three we got we got what one left now or two left one like i said we have three left because
i sent six and you said five earlier no i said they sent six you just weren't paying any attention
you were busy doing your yenta routine and there were all these other underlings i'm sure you said five
i said six mister okay five i said tinkway what does that mean
mexican nickname i said we give things away the tinkway
so anyway like that so when you receive them in a male the envelope will be on a slant i don't
know what the hell that's all about just cut their crabs quick quick try to be cute okay we're trying
to like clean up our act a little bit here okay we're trying to be a little more prestigious like
who's our guest gonna be tomorrow Nick Lawrence is gonna book some great guest for us right that's it
maybe he can get some more of those goddamn male models off soft beach like he did the last day
he worked over here that was a show Nick that was something okay that was really a great job i'll
tell you one thing about Georgie porgy over here he don't get no guests like that of course we
don't do any guest but here's Miami hello how are you doing oh we get his that ugly rumor yes sir
nil i got a question right uh
he put her off right do you think that's Russian mafia has had to think going on because i remember
they had a story about that so you think there's something going on with that oh well i don't
no no okay i think i think it's the big choke i think Don Sherry's right about these Russians i
think when the pressure when the go and get stuff the Russians take off right and um all the
Haitian say go Pate's okay i'll read the urge say one we have an open line and did he say all the
Haitians say go Pate's right all right uh the bandwagon's big enough for them to hang on to the
edge they're probably used to that you know there's little rafts we have an open line in date 7519463 751
wiod one on a green line one 800 in case you missed the big news this morning i don't know where
the hell you've been this is a very momentous day Cox enterprise this as sold wiod radio to
packs and communications ink and the sale will take effect in about three months or so probably
about early september when the FCC approves same and in the meantime Cox enterprises retains the rights
and we still got the same sad looking people wondering around a building because guess what were
the stepchildren now see that that's the interesting part to us on the a m we'll look at some of
those people and say well you know they're ancient history but in the meantime we're in their building
we're in their building do you understand what i'm saying isn't that a very uncomfortable feeling
like even though Cox still owns it we're like a stepchildren and it's any day that we're going to
be belonging to somebody else but even after we belong to Paxible still be in his building for
some months because it's eight or nine or ten months before they get their new building finished
and we move into there boy that's really going to be something huh now can you okay oh man
i just had a great vision of what's going to be like on the first day after the transfer of the

bear with me i'm called from the payphone uh huh our quick fire report Shapiro had the mic
length calls of from game two on tv last night well isn't that great and uh your last week central
of all four goals from fillies game six was one of the best intros you had and it and a little
brainstorm came in them up in my head why don't you package with uh rimmer and sunshine a season ending
video tape uh all these highlights you know the you know panthe highlights for all seasons showing
some of the spectacled goals are you well the team does that i mean i'm sure they must have one i know
i thought you could do it without letting you know what the pros from a profit going to center one
but we don't have the rights to that that's never going to fly the each team has the uh right
exclusive rights to that stuff and they put on their own tape at the end of the year and i can
sure it'll be a great one this year oh well all right well i didn't know that they had the tape

wishing around when we take a bath take all the spot that makes me laugh you so right to be with you
i'll then older folks for you
oh there's buddy box thanks let's get the audio upon it
hey
an individual uh choice of individual preference but i might remark these
so the morning they're basically connected with the nighttime program so what do you say to
say that Aaron covers my people who go to the job uh that at this particular time i can't make
a comment on well the word of the three right now is Aaron's summer is going to be being out of
a job and a very short time uh this deal is expected to be consummated sometime uh the end of
all right from that time i am i don't know the news for south florida so David what are you going to do
at night now just kidding just kidding i don't get it i got you down now what what was that
that was bud packs and as far as now that guy on channel four that reported that he just had on
there that guy needs doggy downers i mean have you ever seen him before he's your gyms around and
he's out of his mind this guy he's just a maniac talk about overacting uh at least 20 years
for that guy but anyway he's interviewing buddy but our good close personal friend and new godfather
and he's talking about Aaron's summers and is she going to be out of a job like this is this is a big
story i mean i i wish you're all the best in the world and she still got to get up in Orlando but
would you and now i didn't see the first part of that news story how long was that thing on
george like five minutes it was on for five minutes i don't know about four five minutes it was
it was a long piece i don't think so they said you weren't going anywhere though buddy bud did
hi guy you want me to tell you the story right now okay i don't want to sound self aggrandizing
without me this deal don't happen okay i don't want to sound arrogant egotistical and self-serving
without me there ain't no deal and that's what my friend bud told me said without you and the dolphins
that station forget it i said something like that something about i don't know what that meant
i think and the way he said is as far as your concern that's what it was but uh that's the deal
everybody knows that if i go somewhere they might as well take this thing and just shove it out into
the bay i don't want to sound like mr hot shot we got the big numbers there we got a long here we
got spots up the ass we got spots in front of our eyes and if we ever had any goddamn promotion around
here but if i say that of course then it sounds like i'm ripping the cocks they'll get upset and uh
get all of a sudden now they're very sensitive how come the last eight and a half years or seven
and a half whatever it's been i've been here they were never so sensitive now all of a sudden they're
very sensitive they don't want to get rid why not that sounds like a new deal to me and also
sounds like that thing is bleeding through one ear again whatever pot you got open and there mister thank
you what i just turned it up all the while there's something bleeding in there
what well maybe it's just rf i don't know please get us out of this building bud will you please
this is a toilet but hey these are nice people to work for they've been nice to me especially
bob green that's why i have nightmares about them every night we have open lines in
powered five two four your laughing i'm serious five two four nine four six three five two four
w one because i always knew that when push came to shove bob green we're like you know what i'm saying
it's not a personal thing it's not a knock it's just an observation i've told you that before
ready to come on in my army oh walking downstairs
oh you didn't see hangs like a stick and out
by the grab the handrail but Gary greased it good
you won't be signing anybody out okay oh feeling pain is typical and working in this place
nothing you ain't worth nothing less you're working for free
oh bust your ass or bust your arm it's all the same to me
busting it is good enough for me it's good enough for me and bob green
it's 12 past noon at w i o d and that was a momentous day when that man came into my life and now he's
getting out of it oh we have two open lines and broard five two four nine four six three five two four
w i o d the eggplant sure why you can what is it oh it's chicken well everything to oh it's that
alligator everything tastes like chicken but it's trache we have an open line and a broard five two four
nine four six three i think it's that stuff they imported from spain that bull stuff you know
hey least the bulls got appear so anyway here's a memo from our friends a note of facts from the
people of the sports depot one ninety four eighty seven soft xe highway in my army it says
George spelled like with a g i just got twelve dozen six inch rats with extra long tails
they are also squeakers therefore free for you a meal oh you better call
Roger okay and we get these we'll give them away on the year tomorrow wouldn't that be nice
how many do you say you got oh a twelve dozen other words if we want some we get them for free

a piece or as many as we want call him up you got the number there can you see the number do you
have it yeah I got it call a goy up the over there and see I mean he wouldn't just send us one
of peace he says he just got twelve dozen they are free for you and the other means one of
peace of course that isn't what it means no but I don't think it's going to give us the whole lot
why not you know how many rats we saw for this guy this guy can probably retire before the
playoffs are over thanks to us you sell yourself short George and by the way how's the water coming
how's the water coming see huh don't you worry don't get your nose into it okay it's bad
enough rick rally keeps trying to muscle our free water you just you stick with the uh

swear to God on your great-grandmother's grave well that's going back far and I yeah exactly on your
great-grandbubbies grave oh boy I don't know what to say I'm still evaluating in my own mind you
know see the first couple of minutes is Bob Neil is standing up there reading that prepared speech
which is kind of tacky and he's reading that thing and I'm thinking oh my god I'm getting this
gigantic check I'm getting like I'm I'm I'm I'm a set do you know what I'm saying like I'm being
bought out because when you assume that no you wouldn't assume that with bud packs and buy
this radio station that he would buy my contract out and give me a big fat check and say have a great
life you do best didn't go to Italy and have a good time huh of course he would you think that
and then he gets to the part about the the contracts being assumed oh Jesus you gotta be kidding me
but then it got better from there it got a lot better didn't it okay so when please
and that go ahead it's a party we're having today we're trying to make ourselves happy because
even buddy bud said you all look so sad you look like your dog just died here's a mobile in
Pemberpine hello Neil yes sir how are you I'm doing great man I'm I'm getting myself all
psyched up for this I'm not gonna I'm not gonna take the negative to rely on his stuff absolutely

hear myself up absolutely I want to start off by thanking you for for giving me the hockey
fever yeah I just want to come down here and lick you all over please don't um I was absolutely
apple plectic the other night when they when they made it three two I was jumping screaming
last time we made a game out of it man I'll tell you and I'm gonna tell you another thing stand
savoring at home or they're on sports beat in Pittsburgh on KBL last night at least they gave us
credit he said finally said yeah you got to admit we were lucky to get out of that first period
alive they were all over us after the first two minutes they created all the good scoring chances
and they outplayed us badly in the first period so even that boy up there in Pittsburgh is finally
staring to admit we got a real team down here damn straight and it's about time I was
set up all of this bull crap I had a sore throat the last time I screamed like that was when the
giants won the Super Bowl yeah and um hey did you hear of Phil yesterday that was the the
bills game right that's when he missed the field goal the giants in the bill no the bills missed
the field goal what that was a game that's right yeah come on get with it mister sports I'm not
with sports Scott nor would he miss the field goal there at the end of the game the bills
choked again anyway what was it um did you hear of Phil yesterday yes what was he smoking
are you are you suggesting that Phil Henry was on some hallucinogenic substance no he's going to come
does that answer your question he I really turned Phil off yeah but it was ponderous I mean I
kept putting on then I'd go back to him and he he kept the heartbeat and he was totally out of
control I'm going to tell you one thing he kept that thing thumping for four hours most guys can't
do that yeah he loses listeners when he does well it was it was it was a you got to understand it
was a very traumatic day here we were getting ready to be sold okay and he was he like bought a show
with bull crap something I'm used to doing every day it was reminiscent of that classical four-hour
exactly that's what I was thinking every time I got in the car and I tune it back in and he was
still doing the same thing but you got to admit there was some good voicemail stuff in the background
though absolutely you couldn't hear it hey can I stuck around for a shirt you got another
rest of your inner buying chance oh now one of those though god I wish great big block bow
no I don't want a big cigar I want a nice small you what do you want I told you he was just

25 dozen rats what do the guys say Ralph did you talk to him yeah it doesn't so what's wrong
with that you were saying along with that yeah I didn't expect 12 dozen rats you really believe
that I think he's going to give us the whole inventory just got in because he's a nice guy

moments uh with you in radio yeah when you worked with on zeta right exactly and uh
Steve can mention that you are going to be going to an fm station and that uh WIOD is becoming sports
intensive and that's going to be a sports station uh doing uh competition with W2 a.m. really
and there were really intense there was a lot of conversation about you and uh so in other words
this could turn out to be fantastic in other words once this deal goes through by then the she
thing will be through the FCC and buddy bud will officially own she of course i'm just speculating
on on nothing and then he might put us because somebody mentioned this earlier put us all over
there on uh fm and then take i.o.d and make it into all sports and knock you away him right out of
the water yeah they have a game plan and everything even though they're not really divulging it i mean
they gave some uh information that's really beneficial to you great uh i mean it's almost the same
thing as colorado playing Detroit it's a total avalanche on Detroit i love it i mean i and can you
see the panthers playing colorado in this daily cup why not i'm saying one of the media the media
people have an nervous breakdown oh oh boy and it serves them right okay it serves them right for
not giving us the build up that we deserve how about the goal telling who is better at this point
in time patrick waw or i'm going to tell you something patrick waw couldn't lick the beazers ass okay
patrick waw did you watch the game last night yes i did did you see that phony routine he went through
when it allegedly was injured so bad he starts flopping around like an injured whale and a crowd
is carrying online then he's the biggest phony man patrick waw oh my god look at this guy this is
that hyperventilating guy from channel four that you walked in the studio man i thought you were talking about me
well you know seriously tell us got to come down you'll never i don't know how old you are pal but
you'll never make it another six months if you don't come down just a little bit come down to
him a doggy down her i'm so i'm worried about you man he's out there in the everglades he's
hopping around a goddamn ground is giving and he's hopping around so much like a mexican jumping bean
one more thing you'll miss her one okay we're now we hear what i just said though yeah
patrick waw no but i want to tell you this what he is most famous for is taking an ordinary
save and making it look great in other words he has a showboat he's a hot dog and he'll take an
ordinary glove save and all of a sudden he'll throw that glove up in the air and he'll juggle it and
grab it again and take just the most routine save and make himself look good i will grant
you last night he played extremely well okay but over the entire playoffs the beas are so much
better no contest i know but do you know what they say about a hot gold tenor coming into the
playoff yeah especially Stanley cup well how hot can the beas are how much hotter can he get oh no
john don't fire there's no doubt and john's one of the greatest uh... he's smoking he is smoking right
now and now changing subjects i mean even though we talked about you in the panthers which is number
one and two and what it is uh number three pop in a park yeah are they going to be open for
time casting when they're closed no
okay because you know how to get the lord of the old which is unfortunate because another states
they're open every day of the week even on the dark day exactly because highly is going to be open
on the dot days highly is closing on wednesday today yeah i'm going to be opening for time
casting when called the result of how can they do that because they're taking the signal from
called to the range that why i see it is actually in uh... what's going to happen is they're going
to have full call call that whatever called the takes highly is going to have it's going to be like a
big off track uh... betting facility but why would anybody go to higher lea
uh... because it's close in proximity to where they live and they feel like some of the lost people
from the uh... you know i noticed that highly a randy daily attendance out about twenty five hundred
here at the end of the meeting of i've never seen anything like this in my life
yet for a thoroughbred racing twenty five hundred people a day
that it's like thing of like for even out of the
unbelievable okay pal at nale listen congratulations thanks by by
yes some good stuff is going on we see we don't know all the details yet we don't all the details
are the rat tails but i have a feeling that these people they weren't born yesterday
they've got some guts they've got some creativity they got eighty billion stations that they got their
clams on and as a result there's going to be something happened for us you know i just have a
feeling this guy's right we better get people to run the phone to divulge all the inside information
get his ass fired he's okay that people do we had they you know we had a couple of bad moments but
i think that was it that was that they can do whatever they want it's
spider what they did the barberslone they can do whatever they want because my good friend
who do i have over there that's a friend do i know anybody left the channel for
seriously do we know anybody left a well doctor steve but he's busy doing his uh you know

make a buck and to fake our way through life okay and i'm the only one in the business who's
honest enough to tell you that i do the best i can some days it's great in fact most days out

coming to an end yeah he didn't he didn't even have a hang nail and you notice how fast all of
sudden he got up yeah yeah not only that he that happened when uh there there the trowels hotter on
the net and everything like that so he cool them down right and you notice also how he's
equipment is always falling apart yesterday he got a snow cone in his neck and that had a kill
about two minutes to stop the game and the first game uh the other day he's like two or three times
in the game his mask is falling apart and they got to fix the helmet they got to get six guys with
a screwdriver over there that should that should be a trivia question how many Canadians how many
frogs does it take to fix Patrick was mask yeah the bunch of old bunch of thoochback yep uh well uh
you know the more you have serious going uh Detroit win one game that's that's too much that'll
be a surprise and uh it'll probably be for straight and thursday uh colorado yep it looks like it
yep and one thing and i want to tell you something about the avalanche a lot of people sell them
short but man they got a lot of great players on that team they got a lot of players on that team
and that big ugly man uh clolomy what an ugly man hate him i cannot stand him he makes me physically
ill well then we'll get him um i got a party sunday i need you to do me a favor for the game i want
to play a song can you play a song at the up play of uh rock and roll song i play off of the one
o'clock hour the what the up play of song the hockey play of song which one uh the uh not the
Saturday night thing the uh the other one the cbc probably the cbc one right the chance may never
come again beautiful you got it thank you have a great day pal bye see ya okay we're getting a little
enthusiastic as in build back up we'll get over the sale of the station thing and by friday we'll be
back on the important stuff which is the panthers which by the way i don't want to say that rimmer
let us down with mike laying this time but he did and it's one of those things you know you go to
the well too often and guys who come through in the past they just uh you know fall a little bit
short of the mark and uh you know we're gonna have to start arranging our own guests you know
or else uh do better lunches thanks guys good guys in air from channel four uh coming in here
asking me questions about things that i thought were supposed to be top secret see that puts me
in a very precarious position because we have a meeting this morning and everybody saying oh this
is top secret and don't let the cat out of the bag and the meantime these guys uh walk in here
and each one of them is holding a cat the radio station where gibberish is the official language
w-i-o-d my army fort-lawter day views talking entertainment radio six ten w-i-o-d
so now depending on which uh station you're listening to do you know what what do you mean
well evidently w-i-n-z a paxon station is going on here and broadcasting all sorts of things about
this transaction today that we were sworn to secrecy about that are not supposed to be common
knowledge and also buddy but says he's offended by some of the language he hears on w-i-o-d
what language exactly it's the one to do
and the way to the song and all but the chance play and come again
oh no the chance play and come
okay
so anyway it's 107 and w-i-d hope the guy got that on tape I hope he has a good time with it I hope
uh I go home and blow my brains out is what I hope two open lines in day seven five one nine four six
three see you know it's very interesting as usual a talent were the ones that are put on a hot spot
the audience out there they don't hear the uh the meetings unfortunately I wish you could
but they don't hear the management people the hot shots and the suits the owners the big
of billionaires they don't hear any of that stuff so were the ones who are really we got our
feet to the fire and you sit down with people and you say okay give me an idea before I go in
here at 10 o'clock how you want to present this what do you want to say et cetera and so on
and then you come to find out all the things that are not supposed to be common knowledge that are
supposed to be kept under the uh table now all of a sudden they're like on the year with other
stations in the market wouldn't you think that when two companies of this magnitude make a transaction
there'd be some kind of an understanding either implicit or in writing that uh some of these uh
said same things would be like uh unsaid you would think so but hey I'm just here man I'm just
doing my thing a rolling along singing a song we'll have those rats to give away from our friends
tomorrow have a dozen of those and we'll just do the best we can here's a mobile implantation hello
oh good meal yes sir god I just kissed the cup you just kissed it huh they have the uh Stanley
cup of JC penny and a briar ball I thought it was going to be two to seven well well it was
actually supposed to be twelve to five yeah and a cup got there at about twelve forty five they were
waiting there they're gonna be there until five o'clock okay but it's pretty cool maybe tomorrow
it's two to seven and having sure of the JC penny it could be yeah but uh there's most
security around that cup then uh they're present in Clinton they're better be especially in this town
but uh it was funny to see the crowd because you have these old ladies with their pant their
shirts and jackets and hats right unbelievable yeah we're all on the bad wagon now man oh real fan
they're all kissing it and and and then not to be discriminatory but you get too black guys to come
walking through the mall hey man anybody got tickets there you go swing by and away home it's
pretty cool okay see ya we have an open line and Broward five two four nine four six three five
two four but it's good to see they're all nealies over there at wion z that's good that's good my
good friend Laurie shepherd and Mike wolf and who did I leave out there must be some people
still alive over there boy there's a lot of dead people from that building man just Jennifer and I
uh we just we come what do we count up to about 172 dead people just in about five seconds there
in that last hour man a lot of people didn't make it through that place so evidently those people
over there on the other side of this deal they're getting a lot more straight information
to know what's going on and we're over here like uh well what uh what do we do what do we what do
we say what do we you know you know you're all talking about yeah that's what we're getting
here's west Palm Beach hello okay i can't believe it's caught you off guard
what what is that you didn't have it inkly what was your happen when you walked in there no
i think that's the main well i mean there are so many rumors going around it's like column eight
through c or d you knew it was one of several different options but uh who's your gym
who's our general mangler Bob green yeah he's gonna be leaving you said yeah obviously well he's
not gonna be involved with this station right so maybe ready to come back i doubt that i thought
that's the only thing hanging her up from coming back now that's what she's saying up here
i wouldn't hold my breath okay uh hopefully go over if i'm a sound a lot better um i was down to
path of practice today yeah i couldn't find a parking spot great because i was down there it's like two
people right yeah um but when you're on vacation Italy i was up in Georgia near Atlanta i hope they never
ever ever give another team in Atlanta they didn't say one thing about hockey the whole time i was
telling me that they said that they were up there in fact Dennis are good hockey friend who moved to
Atlanta with his girlfriend uh he said that you know since he's been up there other than that bogus
team they got up there the nights or whatever they are there's not a stink a stink on the board
about the Stanley Cup or the Panthers or anything there wasn't anything the newspapers don't talk about
it yeah none of the tv stations nothing hey rimmer is doing bobcat's game those last night is
watching replay of it it soundly he has to hold his nose the whole time he's doing that i think
that's a commentary about uh rena football anyway he does a good job but he just couldn't wait to
get the heck out of there but why would you blame him he's missing he's missing a he's missing a
Panthers beating the penguins five to one and he's stuck there doing a rena football yeah but you
know who owns uh the uh bogus buddy bud that's our buddy that's right okay pal have a great day he
owns everything this guy everything he'll be buying a florida pretty soon so we can get cheaper food
and we get it for free all red but got it but and at the in fact bud isn't that what's her name on
the guiding light she calls a Joshua why does she call him bud i always wondered at riva riva
parshane hey that show is getting kind of interesting again because uh dine is getting poisoned boy
if anybody deserves it 12 minutes after one at wio deak ladies and gentlemen we're flying at an
altitude of three feet that mark kill that i better not feel hindry two to six p.m. on news talk
entertainment radio 16 wio
okay that's our new format little preview therefore that should be good for two and a half
share beat the hell out of the light bulb oh sorry guys we love the light bulb we love high
and see we love love 94 we love that bobcat arena football team who else do we love real quick we
love she we love uh what's his name in the morning over there we love uh micha luis
well we loved him before okay
because he left us he didn't leave us with that much but he left us with his
breath boom so anyway who else did they got they got i must have left two or three the light bulb
and then there's another station we never heard of wac or wacko or whatever it is now somebody
what is that report about that they said it's mostly talk with some religious oriented talk
well where is it on the time and a sponial other didn't say that i never heard of it
it's not what used to be mbm and sb uh sobay uh whatever is it i don't know i mean you got all these
little uh nickel and dime stations all over the place i say just uh you know give them a rest
we have an open line at day 7519 463751 wio d this is the home of the mimey dolphin
oh okay let's go to a Cooper city hello nale yes sir uh when not if the panthers play the avalanche
what determines who has a quiet it's not a question of if it's a question of when that's a very
good point well said even bob green couldn't have done a better one who did or how is it determined
who has first home ice advantage you know something that's a very interesting question and we
were mulling that over at the arena the last uh Philadelphia game there were a bunch of us were
having a discussion about that and i do believe that they alternate the years one year the eastern
conference has the home uh you know advantage in the next year it's the west and i'm pretty damn sure
that last year um detroit had home advantage against new jersey so the panthers would have it so i
do believe the panthers would have home ice regardless of the record which needless to say
Colorado's got a better one but i think they do it on an alternating basis i believe i could be
wrong but i don't think so somebody will tell us somebody really knows for sure
like defo okay thanks no panthers have a great day yes somebody who really knows about that but i just
i i pretty it's kind of like the world serious you know we have an open line in date 7519463 we've got
an open line in brown art 524 wild and you know evidently they're not an awful lot of people listening
to i and z thank god oh thank god for that because i don't want to have to be the one who confronts
this other stuff when it comes down which you think would be all that long you don't want to say
and what do we do then what do we do then or did you uh huh i would really like to ask you that
question what do we do then when we're confronted with all that stuff that's uh being blabbered around
i don't know okay here's a lady in the gable cello hello the lady in the gables is gone
how can the lady in the gables be gone okay see that disturbs me tremendously
uh what oh we got the answer to the ticket thing online oh hello hello hello nil yes sir
how you doing i said online three oh online three hang on would you get with it there mister i'm
going to come in here and uh stick that cigar in your nose hello picking up its butt right nil
john fiber here did you get your season oh don't tell me we just lost him too is he gone
oh when you listen if you people would you call mobile one for crying out loud but you go and
give yourself a decent cell phone too did i get my season i got my hockey tickets if that's what
you're asking what the other thing he's asking i have no idea oh and you know something else by
the way that i'm just thinking about here as part of this deal what's going to happen with those
hockey tickets yeah that's part of my deal with cox huh which will be a long gone they'll be out
of the picture come October what's going to be happening with my season tickets for the panthers
which if i have to pay for myself that's okay too because i bought an extra pair this year
oh my god hello hello yes sir hey how you doing nil okay hey eastern conference on my
this year that's what i said you're the man they alternate right you're the man yes sir last year
devil's wanted at home game force swept the wings right and the wings can swept this year too
up tight oh boy they're brutal okay thanks pal i pick up a go and see i was right for once in my
life they alternate just like the world series one year it's in the nationally thing one year
it's an american league one year they do the dh one year they don't et cetera and so on
course one year they they do the dh in american league home games right isn't that the way they do it
who cares about baseball give me a break even though the marlins win basically every day there's
still ain't nobody that cares and uh so so the latest deal is buddy bud was referring to the
sex show there every night which i think she's in a lot of trouble is what that's all about i think
she's gonna be history which uh quite frankly i think she was gonna be history in it but i don't
know i wish you're the best okay she's a nice person she's okay she never stole a freight train
she came in she aworked her ass off so to speak and uh you know there can be no question there
might be a few changes here and there as far as the other one that i was uh asked about before
we're sex and children from predators and we're there to let you know
the established sex offender registries of convicted silence sexual predators and that the parents
in a community and law enforcement have the right to know that these individuals have moved into
the community on bus news talking entertainment radio six ten w-i-o-d it's not just Hank Goldberg
it's a hippopotamus
uh
so anyway it's a one twenty six at w-i-d so what about that guy that's uh
casted over sidekick what the hell is his name omelet and what did he put on the ice
at all oh okay we have two overlined but what but oh but oh he didn't put his ass on
the ice he put his big fat here's the mobile in four-letter deal hello there was ever
a match as a manager just played yeah was that them together uh-huh the panthers do not have
home ice we got our season tickets they only give you three games if they make up of that means
there's no fourth game here and i just called the panther how can that be well that's how it is
i just called the panthers also and they said we do not have home ice the other the west conference
does well maybe they do go by points then because caloretto had a hell of a lot more points than we
did yeah well i'm not sure how they do it in hockey but there's no doubt that the west has home ice
damn it see i never even looked at that because i'm busy looking at my uh you know jk and whatever
these other ones are for this round but after we sweep through the pissberg and we went to
in uh-caloretta we come back here and sweep them and it's over sounds good to me it's it's the plan
sounds acceptable okay okay thanks for the bad news see ya we have an open line in day seven
five one well how come the guy that called before him was like so absolutely positive i mean he
could have been full of crap because people who are full of crap always calling our very positive
too and like they know what they're talking about and very often they don't seven five one w i

an open line on the green line two of one eight hundred nine four four nine four six three
yeah you see if you just went to that meeting this morning and you walked out of there with kind
of like you felt a little better when you walked out than when you walked in maybe and then all
of a sudden now it's like things aren't quite as simple and cut and dry as they may at first
make them appear and now we got all sorts of other like fallout like we you know like we got
damaged control over here and we got a big hole in the wing over there and it's you know
here's four waterdale hello nail yes sir how you doing okay all right if you're going to make
the move to one on three five who says that well that's what the rumors are going around today isn't
isn't isn't buddy but buying one on three five or bought it already yeah but the sale hasn't
even gone through yet well because i was just thinking if if for some reason you did end up
going over there maybe rimmer could get his own sports show on six ten yeah wouldn't that be nice
well he ought to have a sports show on somewhere i know i better than the hummer any day yeah
at least you could get somebody with some actual hockey knowledge but he doesn't play enough
golf with the Steve Nicholats why is that working here oh really yeah that's that's the answer
to that question with with D4 to take a crap in his pants if he somehow got a job at six ten
twice he would do a big mario man oh man really he's really that jealous of rimmer
paranoid little paranoid and psychotic that's right well let's just hope you don't bring the
niece along okay all right have a great day for you okay i guess we're all done huh i guess we're done
i thought you know i gave the numbers out there and i thought it's a little something we're finished
we're all done we managed to keep this thing afloat for nearly four hours today which if i do say
so myself was quite a major miracle out of the circumstances but that's basically it we got all
the day lines wide open seven five one w i o d we got two and powered five two four we got two
on a green lines one eight hundred nine four four nine four six three that's the end of the
rumors that's the end of the interest that's the end of the insist that's the end it's all over pal
it's finished here's sunrise on a purple line hello hey Neil how you doing okay i figured you'd
like this one i know you don't like it because he knows down a nap saw right because i talked to you
a couple months ago you know that's all sucks okay they can take that saw and blow it off the face
of the globe but i know you like this yeah i was down there at the beginning of the stand-up play
off so into the sports book down there put a ten dollar bet on the panthers twenty five to one
right so i'm waiting for them to just finish up now okay so that's not very good odd so
huh what when was this this was at the beginning of the stand-up playoff i think they
just started the first game because i think at the beginning of the year they were doing like
five hundred to one somebody sent me a a photo copy of a thing he got in Vegas back in the
beginning of the season and he made a ten or a twenty five dollar bet at five hundred to one
that's unbelievable yeah i wish i was there this was just the beginning of the stand-up playoff so
you know samler was like still two fifty to one i'm not so sure that they have it's kind of like
uh some of the old racetracks they have windows where they sell the tickets but i'm not sure if they
cash you know i'm going into bohamas you can cash them here for a lot of you you're sure of that huh
i'm fine okay okay hang on to a tight pal good luck to you thanks Neil good luck to us
daydeline are these lines working or what huh this is impossible it's been a uh uh hell of a long
time since we've seen a development like this seven five one nine four six three maybe they all
turned over to nine forty to win to try to get some real information about what's going on i wouldn't
blame them myself seven five one w i d we got an open line and broder five two four one on a green
line and man all of a sudden they're playing hard to get on one of the worst days in the history of
everybody's life around here and they're playing little games with us little cat and mouse little
cat and rat going on here here's a mobile in bokeh hello hey Neil how you doing today okay i guess
over the week i'll know if you caught it you know i always admired yager stickwork and everything but
and i never could come up with the reason to hate them and on sunday they showed it they showed
an interview with him and he's wearing a cowboy's jersey yeah well maybe he likes the white house
i guess so maybe that's why he's moved so quickly on the ice could be yep well see on friday
okay go there i'll be there two open lines in date seven five one one and broder five two four
what was that action they were in date counter we got a bunch of assholes out there or what yes
really we got assholes w i o d are you an ass holer like a real collar i'm a real collar okay all right

hey nil yes sir yeah are you doing okay hey i was listening to the guy uh no q a m at midnight
and the guy would talk with a funny voice yeah uh that's a shame because that guy sounds like he
knows something about hockey you know yeah okay but who the hell can listen to that no you know
because uh that feral on the radio nobody can listen to that that's the most obnoxious sound i've
ever heard in my life it's like listening to somebody scrape their fingers on a on a blackboard
for four hours but the thing is he knows more than than all those guys who work in the daytime or
there but it's very sad because like you just got through saying who the hell can listen to it
yes so why doesn't he ditch the act already and just do a damn sports show
yeah stop trying to be a comedian yeah and uh last thing what's your prediction for fry uh for
a fry i can't i can't tell you to fry it a morning okay i say uh i got to sit in it i got it
i got to sit down on his chair and just the right position get my cheeks just in the right posture

sounds good to me okay so there we go that uh kind of kick this baby in the teeth here today and i
feel like i've been kicked in the teeth several times it feels like just like Alex Bennett said you
know what Alex what did Alex Bennett say as a matter of fact there was another good talent they
brought in here maybe that's why they lost so god damn much money but hey they're smart and we're
dumb and we're just peons we're just pawns in this gigantic chess game in the sky have a wonderful
day and the better day tomorrow and open up your mouth and let the rain be your umbrella and stick
it up to always ask a cd rom of every fact coupled with a tv test pattern mornings with rick
