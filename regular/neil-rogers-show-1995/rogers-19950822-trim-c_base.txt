every knee and a thought backwater state god damn in a country in canadicate
that these places are passing gambling and rake it in the dough while we're
sitting here catering to all these ninety-year-old info on board again
i mean how long can this go on we can't survive like this all we got is old

yeah just like there was no just like big as man people having a good time
and there was no rift wrap around you know they seem like they had it where
the control and the Indians are running the thing
yep yeah and that's a lot of money that they're getting just from the spot
alone so have a great day and the back to you
rest my case but it could happen i keep telling you that not to give all your
so negative i'm just being honest with you do you want me to blue sky do you want
me to lie to you and tell you that all of a sudden people are going to get a
mental animal and they're going to wake up in the sniff the pansies it's not
gonna happen my favorite ones are the ones who get on a plane these old people
they go to Vegas because they know they're going to have a great time they come
back and they say well oh it's great there but i sure wouldn't want to have it here
we don't want to disrupt our lifestyle you don't have a lifestyle you have a
death style and you want to share it with all the rest of us you want the rest of
us to be moldy and have toe jam all around our goddamn bodies like you do
oh we don't want to have it here it's great there but not here
put them all back on a bus and send them back to New York send them to the
Bronx they'll take care of the rest
here's Carl Springs hello
Carl Springs you know yes you suck you know you you suck great
not lately open line of brow art five two four nine four six three five two four
there's brow art for you at probably coming from a david Ross's or office
here's hi alia hello hi Neil yes sir
what's my opinion to what you said at the top of the hour about
you're really ranting and raving yes well i have something to say about that
but i don't think you're gonna like what i'm gonna say yes sir okay
i think that i tend to be the type of listener that that you have a lot of
yes and we don't we're not the ones that call in
and i hear you asking for opinions and my thought was that you really don't
need our opinion so i mean it's like so wait wait wait let's slow down this is
interesting so in other words what you're saying is let's take the phone out from
10 to 2 and i'll just hit her in ranting rave every day for four hours
essentially the people that call in are the jerks and the ones that you make fun of
and that's what makes you so enjoyable i mean people like what i think people
like me who have opinions i mean who cares i mean who cares what my opinion is
like the sex bitch at night when she takes all these surveys what does she do
with the survey she throws in the garbage and gets a
i'm not taking a survey i'm having a discussion
i'm having a discussion i'm asking i'm asking a question and people like
have an opinion sometimes it's something serious sometimes it's something
off the wall and in between that's it that's what i've been doing this for 20
years and last 10 years i've been doing it not so serious and with no
guests but nevertheless i mean isn't it possible i mean is the mic
tyson fight a real serious topic no at least it's something that happened it was a
major of it and i guarantee on talk shows all around the country they're discussing
it except in this town but you know what what i think is great about your show is the fact that
you just kind of get on in ranting rave and you kind of speak into my uh... you know you're you're
you're the conscience of what i feel i mean sometimes i feel like but what are you saying for
under one hand you're saying that you want to hear the show because i ranting rave and then the
other hand you say that the colors who are assholes are what you enjoy hearing on the show
essentially i mean those are the ones that make it interesting the ones that are boring and have
a guy that just called a punk the ten-year-old kid that calls in your your your your show sucks or
whatever that's that's an entertaining call but all k you want to be honest it's something like
that i'll set you off for at least two or three minutes no it didn't i did it send me off for
like five seconds and i picked up your call well i don't respond to you suck like i said not
lately and that's the answer and so what what else is new well i did my feeling is you don't you
don't need people like us to call the ones who just love you so listen then who do i need to call
just assholes right i think you could do the show so in other words basically what you're saying
is how to do screenless every day just have people calling one after another saying hey you saw
going uh first thing i think you need to phone it all you're crazy now you don't i'm going to come
in here every day into a four-hour monologue that's essentially what you do no i do not come on in a
whole hour with a crazy about ten minutes worth of calls get on in a whole hour right now it's your
dreaming okay all right i've been on twenty-one minutes this our okay fifty uh tolla are you there
yeah yeah fifteen minutes this hour after the news right yeah how much of a monologue did i do i
came on i played uh a bit or whatever i did i played a record because like it's a threat and then
i came on i've been taking calls ever since then true yeah i haven't read that look you got me
there but i i don't know i think the call you i think that you're overriding the calls or the
the contribution of the call i think they're overrated but i'm not asking for intellectual calls
because there aren't those kind of people in this town very many of them i'm just asking for somebody
alive that's all that's a start and besides most of the people agree with you like the cops like
their cops implantation i agree they shouldn't lose their their health coverage and their
and you know something you may have hidden i may just come in here and just uh pontificate most
of the four hours every day take an occasional smock okay and also put on a song or two from the
okay there you go okay see you i think this guy has his finger on him man
and i think a lot of you would like to have your finger on it too but he just he just left
how about a thumb how about your index finger how about your forefinger your thumb and your index finger
okay i rest my case if that isn't the greatest record ever made i discovered that on Zeta when
i was doing a morning show on zeta i discovered i don't mean i discovered that you know what existed
i just discovered that in my opinion that the Alan process uh process uh prospect the Alan
Parsons project and i in your fly flying this guy could be the greatest i just i just i'm obsessed
with that so i just love it i could i could put that on tomorrow from ten until two just
interrupt for the commercial break put it on a god damn endless loop that song is just uh it's haunting
i hate when they used that word haunting you know what song they used to describe a haunting it was
the police and uh every breath i you take i take we take haunting and see you don't like that record
i love that so i love it i love it you don't like the police that's your problem because you're
a guy damn anti-semit you know like police oh man every breath you take that is such a grip but
it's not like uh not like this this is more haunting huh in fact when you go to the wax museum
you go to the haunted house thing this is what's playing in the background
12 23 at w i love it i love it i love it i'm telling you that does something for me i feel
better already i feel like a brained by the way tomorrow we're getting charod i just i mentioned it
for lunch six ten w i o d stress really without lithium okay wait till you hear this so
okay now where did you hear this from your wife crystal just called George to and where did she hear it
from she heard it from somebody who heard it from somebody else who heard it from somebody's best
brand who heard it through the grapevine heard it from Nancy Reagan it's the emis it's the emis so from
the is see why am i waste of my time because the people to watch the young and a horny all got to
turn down right now it's coming on in two minutes and 38 seconds is counting but anyway mat and
Amy which isn't that ironic because in the story she shot him but anyway mat and Amy are in real
life an item and they're both they were both on some one of these good eat too probably on janipal
crotch they were probably on a crotch hour and mat and Amy are an item in real life and they're born
again christians and guess what he's a now what did you call it she's a virgin and he's a re-virgin
a retread a retread they read declare themselves virgin he's got a he's got a tattoo on his asses don't
tread on this yeah they redeclair themselves virgin once they become born again and then that one
other words nick cut them off is that what you're trying to say he's got it back he got a refund
oh yeah i give it back to him but with that much pancake makeup on their push and they're going to
stay virgin's until they get married isn't that sweet so mad and Amy our version so all you
born against can watch the young and a horny now not have to feel bad like think that they're really
doing it in real life oh you ought to see that picture in that Italian bag that the fashion magazine
where that guy is on the balcony with nick and eyeing his ass i mean he's got that flap up there
it looked like a finesse debris and the guy is a god is ion is ass now what the hell is that the
is that the same one that we were just playing oh that's the name in that song the i and your ass
aha you see i'm the only person in the world like a tie all that crap together in the last
guy by the way an excellent boy and why didn't he start with this flavor you're not going to
like what i have to say why do you say that why are you also defensive once in a blue moon somebody
says something that almost makes sense besides me now i think you had a good point screw the callers
here's a lottery hello
now that's no i in the sky that won't make it here's uh Miami hello

had excellent point let's hear from the audience man let's hear let's start getting some guy
demo opinions on this okay let's have an opinion on something they don't kind of see this is what
is to answer his question i wish he were still on the line but he knows what i'm talking about he
just doesn't want to admit it they don't have an opinion about anything
so just like this is this not the greatest record every quarter i risked my case to say yes
don't try to like the camera
turn tables instead
this is what's the line they're older stuff too they're great now in part they are great but this
this but you know what the problem is it's commercial it was a hit oh jeez oh it can't be any good

what about the smuck who's not doing a great job and you know gets drunk and falls down
why he's working he's gonna get the same benefit you give these people say who one they got to

seven five one w i o d in day two open lines on a green line seriously man you people collectively i'm
not talking single if you're gonna take it personal go ahead i can't stop you but collectively this
is the biggest bunch of deadheads and dodo birds i have ever encountered it please please it's the
end of august don't insult my intelligence by telling me you're all busy working because i know
better there ain't almost anybody busy doing anything except maybe a rip it off of you cars and
knocking off of you convenience stores please please no lame excuses like that we don't got enough

Emmy hello yeah near how you done okay this out your time is perfect on that comment i think

y in Alaska come on yeah listen now first of all i want you know i go worse than other people you
do make our day okay we can't call but you make everything go a lot quicker a lot easier well thank
God for the rain now with this fight you can't really tell me you thought it was gonna be some kind
of fight of course not everybody knew it was not gonna be but that's the point why do they spend
the money then exactly who would pay the money that that i don't feel sorry for any of those
people that was just crazy it's first fight out you know then i'm gonna put them up against anybody
that would be like if i said i got for you this big beautiful diamond ring for ten dollars and
you knew a printer was gonna be paced it was gonna be a pubic zirconia and you gave me ten bucks
today's oh gee this ain't for real i had to check out when you knew you were gonna get ripped up
off up front yeah of course but i guess some people there are i don't know they're dreaming or
something yeah i'll forget about the stuff on there i don't know so maybe you can explain this to me
how is it they can tell me i can't put these little tiny earphones on and listen to a radio on my car
but i can have a freaking cell phone glued to my ear going 35 miles from my top
absolutely right man those people are the worst i have seen the last few months i have seen so
many people getting close to wiped out by some asshole and if you're on the turnpike what they'll
do is they'll get in the left hand lane the fast lane and they'll be going along all of us and
they'll slow down like they're paying more attention who's maybe they're calm on those nine
seven six numbers you know they're speeding up and slowing down they're paying no attention to the
driving because they're embroiled in some guy then phone conversation outrageous yeah but so
you ever been to a restaurant you're sitting down the guy next to you he starts getting on his phone
he's making telephone calls getting called even even i go out to relax i don't go out to get off
even worse than that how do you like when you go to a ballgame a baseball or a hockey game and some
a hot shot all of a senior and all of a sudden this guy whips his uh asperatus out of his pocket and
he's sitting there at a ballgame yack it away on a phone like mr hot shot yeah i don't know i don't
like it i'm like and get away from things i don't like to bring my problems with me i don't know
what it is let's be more like you're a crack clapped in the unplugged they're like his kid right
out the window but anyway listen don't get discouraged with these people here they're a lot of
jerks in Miami but you got an excellent show you damn right have a great day pally bye bye okay don't get

By the way, the this is very interesting because Jan and Dean had a record called sidewalk surfing and of course
Jan Berry was good buddies with Brian Wilson. They used to like sleep on separate sides of the bed for days at a time
together and so anyway
They stole the music from I mean, I guess he gave it to him
But I mean if you once upon a time I played them together on a year sidewalk surfing and catch away. It's the same song
I
Okay, you got that are you saying yeah, catch away that uh you're all up keep popping it back and forth all over the place was
Only got one CD deck sidewalk surfing Jan and Dean
You
But that vice you got a lot of work on those record didn't they all those keep it or nuts in a vice so anyway
Guess who wrote sidewalk surfing Brian Wilson and somebody named Christian some good Christian wrote to that song and ripped it off from his original song
At a boy Brian. No, what are you stating bed with your teddy bear or a boar of a bear? He stayed in bed with teddy bear all the time
What that's when he was drinking and doing a lot of drugs and wouldn't come out of the house
He wasn't drinking and doing a lot of drugs now you're confusing them with Jerry Garcia again. Hello
Hello, yes, is that you? Did you notice how those two songs were exactly the same?
I don't know you don't know
Wait a minute
Yeah, yes something happened to me yesterday. Yeah, I tell
In the bedroom on my head
Dad take me to the hospital really 14
stitches they put staples in staples did they did not get any sense in here or what I always have
Okay, and I have to go to the doctor tomorrow for what to see is
It isn't infected. Oh, man. That's disgusting and I had to hire a nurse to stay with me. Oh, really? Yeah, how was she?
Yeah
I know well. I want to keep you in stitches. Yeah, I am I know I am
Okay, baby. Well, take care of yourself. Yes, I will and don't forget happy
Thank you. Hang in there. Yeah, okay. How do you like that?
Can you
You'll never guess what else is on see this is one of those real late after they were desperate and on welfare
And they had the accident they need the money this best of Jan and Dean. It's called surf city
Which is just a ripoff of all the uh beach boys
What
Well actually that would but Brian Wilson wrote that but that was their song he wrote he did a lot of stuff for Jan and Dean but they're still bankrupt
Here you go. Here's a little ripoff
Jan and Dean see a thing to be
Wait for you to do it. You got a touch it's a piece you won't need to get it for money
You're set it on
Can and Dings ding seeing songs that were hit by the beach boys all right
Let's go to Lake Worth. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing great. Hey, uh, I wonder that guy brought up the
Casino up in Connecticut. Yeah, is anyone told you that they have a casino now and Windsor Ontario?
Yes, they have and that's why the that's why Hazel Park is only racing five nights a week
And that's why their first structure is way down and that's why Kevin Wallace has to drive it Windsor on Sunday nights
To try to make up the money. He's losing that Hazel Park
But can you imagine
Windsor Ontario is straight laces they are they have a casino. Well, what do you mean by that?
They got all kinds of because they got the big one and wait a minute in Montreal
You kid me they got a big casino up there. They got them all over Canada. Yeah. Okay. I didn't know that but they do
But I know the people in on terror in Windsor are really you know, they're good people they're
they're
They're everyday people, but they're
You know, they have two murders in Windsor Ontario a year right
At once a knife and ones of baseball batters. Yeah, and not all its sons and crap. Well, they murder him gently up there
They feel right
and now I know
Detroit and Michigan was looking at they had they were gonna have a commission check out whether they should have gambling casino
Well as usual see that's what happens when you wait too long somebody gets the gets the jump on you and your dead man
That's what happened. Yeah
One other thing I was growing up. Yeah, long time ago
My dad used to take my sister and I on Sunday nights the guy had his bar clothes and he let his
personal
Customers in and we used to watch a red wing games Sunday night. Yeah when there was able in Zian
At the Olympia right at the Olympia. Yeah, he only was playing right all him good guys
Alex Delvecchio
Alex Delvecchio yeah Marcel Pronevol right right and when you play them tapes
Say and with the
Native announcer it just makes you all hair stand up on the back of my neck because I really used to love listening to people
Bill Hewitt. Yeah, oh, there's nobody like Bill Hewitt right really great
And by the way, I mentioned that I had dinner with Brian Murray the other night and the Jeff Rimmer
And we were talking about Bill Hewitt evidently all these people give me these bogus stories
He's doing just fine. He's living on some farm up in the northern Ontario and his wife is alive and they're doing great
And whatever all these people keep talking like he's uh some kind of a recluse. We've got a drinking problem there full of crap
Yeah, Brian said that he's doing great. It's what Brian should
As we're Brian should he says Bill Hewitt is doing great. He's okay. It's good news, eh?
Yeah
Well, I don't wouldn't it be nice if they could have hockey like they used to though. Yeah hockey's good
But here rid of all these expansion teams except the apathas we need them but to give it to everybody else
Just like the baseball
It's watered down man. It's like life. It's all been watered down. Yeah, they
Used to watch him game zero to zero, but it was really good
You know, it was all good defense and got a plobbering on them
But anyway, yeah, see they say baseball is boring. It's not boring. It's just most of these guys who are playing a game today are boring
That's the problem. Oh man
I think of the money they make and I probably could have made a
Four five hundred thousand myself being a bad boy, you know, there you go. Yeah, okay, pal
Okay, thanks me. I'm a real life. Take care of my see you
What the hell happened to my bill you with stuff here? Jesus. I'm
Stolen and stalling cuz quite frankly last part of that call wasn't all that well any of it wasn't that it was okay
But uh, what's going on over here?
What the hell is going on with this thing man? You talk about people fiddler around
Probably that god damn Jeff the forest. He just poked his head in here for a second or two
He said well was an ice-freebie in Vegas again
I said man you got a rough life default and then he's telling me how much he likes Larry Letterman
Callin' Erases in Atlantic City Larry Letterman
I'd rather hear David Letterman call away than Larry Letterman who makes a mockery of our great sport

Yeah, I appreciate what you're saying today. How discouraged you get frustrated aggravated
I think it's like it's just depressed
A cytolum roast, but okay absolutely. I understand yeah, let me tell you something
You know that a lot of us out there to listen to you
Unfortunately, we have a type of jobs. I only get to call if I get to call me one day a week because it's only the
I'm off
At work can't call it's a lot of it out there that are there we're concerned about what's going on like with the police officer
Yeah, things that are taking place there that gentleman that called earlier that said well
He's gonna get disability and it's in that
Neil would like you said the guy put his life on the line
Well wait a minute first of all when a guy says they all those other couple of guys that called sounded like sergeants
I mean at that point you just discard it anyway
What does a sergeant sound like that's the most stupid thing?
I mean, I know what dick sergeant sounded like but he's kind of dead now
But other than that what does a sergeant sound like I don't know Neil. I thought that was the most
He is the guy ever heard
Professional jackass you know, we're so desperate to find good cops
We got the Mark Furman's in the world. We got all these jackasses out there
We just want to harass people and we finally find some good cops who put their ass on the line and nearly get killed
And this guy starts doing his union busting crap. Absolutely. No, you know
Scourging and I know how you feel. You know the idiots out here. They make those kind of comments
Yeah, I'm not a police officer. I work in a restaurant business
Matter-facke I talked to you a long time ago from Boston market. Yeah, and I only get a call like once in a while
But when I heard that I was on my way home and I heard that I got I got really annoyed
And I can appreciate where you're coming from about the attitude and the intellect the people around here
It's incredible
But that comment really just got under my skin because these guys whatever they are aren't they're out there putting their life on the line
Yeah, and there's good and bad and everything okay in every field and you know
This guy put his life on the line to try to save two kids and addition to which I lived in plantation now for the last
I don't know seven eight nine years at least and believe me there aren't too many
Poverty-stricken people the city of plantations got lots and lots of money
They got a big tax base that they can't take care of these guys then there's something really wrong somewhere
I know, they're when you consider all the money they spend on on crap. Yeah, you know a camera is on middle name
That's right. They spend more money on on crap and then they don't do something. It's really important like this
I'm I live in Hollywood, but I can't achieve. I will be in plantation. I will be there good for you because something needs to be done
Okay, pal Neil. Thanks for your time. Thank you. Bye. Bye. See you
Uh-oh
You're not allowed to do that
Didn't you hear the lyrics there?
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard in my life. No one of these got no one of them kept him in bed all the time locked up
See you weren't even paying any attention listen to the lyrics
Squirt squirt I rest my case
You never heard Jira Garcia sing any kind of crap like that. That was disgusting
Okay, let's go to a sunrise. Hello
Hello, who's swapping down the deck? Yes, sir
Hello, Neil. Yes, I am. Yeah, I just want to first of all agree with the last call. I'm going to be
Even though I live in sunrise and I'm below the age of 50. I'm going to be at the
Good tomorrow great, and I also would like to talk. It's not tomorrow. It's next Wednesday
Okay, yeah, I'll go over there by myself, but I like to thank you for the past 15 years
My wife has been trying to get me to go to Las Vegas. Yeah, and I kind of listening to you
I just got back and we stayed at the Luxor right and it was amazing
I've never been there before and you're right. You don't have to gamble to have a good time
How is it possible that the people in this state can be so stupid especially ones who have been out there and see now
Graded as how little crime how can walk the streets and they come back say oh, we don't want to have that here
How is it possible? I don't know in fact
That's all I kept saying I can't believe it was two o'clock in the morning. Yeah people addressed with all kinds of goals and diamonds and
Money won't go over the streets and nobody's even battening night. Yeah, I mean it was it was it was one experience
That was just fantastic and I really have to thank you for it because you know you keep speaking about how
Greater it is there and you really don't have to be a gambler to enjoy it. Yeah, you're right. I mean there was so many things going on
It's really
I
Over here, you know, you know, you would have had ten o'clock. They're all on the streets
Over there. It's it was just incredible. I don't really have to tell you about it
But for any of your listeners he's right. You do not you cannot believe what it's like to walk around three four o'clock in the morning with the streets full of people
Everybody minding their business. There is so much security around there the streets are so clean for the amount of people that are there
The Latinos outrageous. You could just stay in nothing and in the hotel for one day and just
Not taking all the sides from just the one hotel. I'm glad you enjoyed it pal. Well, thank you. Have a great day. You too. See you
Oi
I got you there
Squirt Squirt
I like that. That's the very original right there. I mean these are all original on this particular CD
But some of them they've poskyed around when they did little fine tuning a little reach channeling
I give me the original okay
Don't try to butcher them up so much when you do these best of collections and you spend 14 or 15 or 12 bucks for a CD
Don't go dittling around okay. Don't go dickin with my music and just leave it the way it was
The ruling stones and something else we played but anyway, we're gonna play them right together
We're gonna play sidewalk surfing by Jan and Dean and
Can't you wait by the beach boys? Okay, and a count of when I say one. Okay. Got it ready got your finger on in there three two one
Okay cut it see we're too slow
You're too slow man. I hit it when you said this thing has got a hang time
So I should wait I'll wait I'll wait a pause okay three two one
You
I can't take it. I can't stand it. Jan and Dean kill him. Too bad about that crash. Here's
a parkland. Hello. Yeah. How was that? Yeah. It was something else. That was pretty close.
Already done to my life. Pretty close. Yeah. I would say. Listen, I would have called
sooner, but I'm on vacation and then the beat on vacation. I'm painting my house. So I've
been listening to you guys about the 630 this morning. Yeah. I'm probably getting to
before the rain care. What I want to say was this guy from Carl Springs when he
called up and he had our tamarind stand up. I think what he was trying to tell you. I mean,
am I in my eye is that you can sit down and talk about things like I heard you're
talking about spoken secures earlier. Yeah. What you're about to. Now to you, you're
just being yourself. You're just saying something to my mind. But to me, it was funny.
The way you say it. Yeah. But you can't appreciate it because it's coming from you. I appreciate it.
Well, I'm good. I appreciate this end of the show tremendously. I'm not laying down. I'm
lying to the job. I'm fantastic. You don't think about it. Okay. I got more weight in one
in one people in my ass. I got more brains and more weight in there than most of these people
put together. Believe me. That's a good mistake about it. And I know it. Okay. So what he
he say is that you really don't need those calls. Yeah. Of course. And then I can see your
point of view to it. You don't want to do all the stuff talk, you know, talk for four
hours straight. Of course not. Well, I don't blame you. So anyhow, I mean, then you feel
like you're talking to yourself. Of course. I come in here anyway. Every day. I feel like
I'm talking to myself. So what's the difference? It's a good point. Yeah. Okay. But like,
you know, with me, I was the only time that I can actually call you up is one of my vacation
or not working. You know, you just gave me a great idea. You know, I think tomorrow I'm
going to come in at least in the first hour. I'm going to talk to myself. In other words,
I'm going to do. No, listen, I'm going to do both sides of the conversation. I'm not going
to do it like some fake voice. Like I don't want to mention any other names. I don't,
because I don't do that. And I don't rip off other people's routines. But I'm just going
to talk to myself both sides of conversation. You follow? I think it could be pretty
god damn good. And it might just set me a whole new format. I got you to thank for it.
Well, I'm going to have, yes. One question though. You know, you're always I, I reckon
so that I think it's great. Because you really have to the show. Yes, they have ever been
on your show. Oh no, God forbid. I think I want to know when Rick comes out of show man,
people start impaling themselves. I don't know what it is, but there's just something
about him. Now, plus when you get up that, at that hour in the morning at four o'clock
at the morning to come into a show, you don't want to stick around a minute longer
than you got to. You know what I'm saying? Well, that's true. I'll keep him off here.
Well, I'll keep him off here. I'll take care of him. Have a great day. You too, bye.
I'm going to say it again when Dennis Wilson drowned. There was so much of a greater tragedy
than when Jerry will Jerry Garcia Jerry Wilson Garcia died. I mean, not even a contest.
Like this. Did the Grateful Dead ever give America a song like this? That every man, woman
and child can sing on the tip of their own thing. My god, it just makes your breathless
and makes you want to live on your upstate.
Dennis, Dennis Wilson.
Yeah, there's sure no Grateful Dead. I'll tell you that. I mean, you know, we can like
different things. I've said that before. We don't all have to like a vanilla ice cream
or Jerry Garcia or any other boring stuff like that. But it's just, it just fries my ass
that there are people who are, and of course most of them are fried, which is why they
like that crap in the first place. See, immediately you say the beach boys, there are
like 6,000 different song titles that rule, you know, in the mentally, the melody runs
to your brain. Instant recognition. You say the Grateful Dead is, what do you got? What
is that? Here's Hialia. Hello. I definitely agree with you about the Grateful Dead. It's
just a goulash of, I don't know what goulash is a good word for it. Goulash in the goulog.
But I hate to say this to you, but Jan and Dean came out before the beach boys. Yeah, but
you don't understand. Brian Wilson wrote the song. Oh, he did. Brian Wilson wrote the songs
for Jan and Dean. Right. I didn't know that. Yeah, there were good buddies. Jan, very
in the Brian Wilson. That's trivia. I did not know. There you go. I mean, Hialia, I'm a
happy. What does that mean? I don't know. I don't know whatever happened to the English
language. I know a typical lecher. How long have you lived there? Well, I've been living
here for 14 years. I own property. And you're just discovering this. There you go.
There you go. He's no. Yeah. I go everywhere. And that's what I hear. H is the papel.
And I'm totally hope is a dupe. Oh my God. George is getting a sour look on his
post because he figures you're starting to rip Holyos again. It will be a god turn. The
whole of the whole of him is starting to rise. That's the only thing that's right. Oh,
my God. I think we should just have the multiple one time. I'll let him hear Rick and
such 24 hours a day. Okay. They're on their way right now. Have a great day. Let me go.
I still away. Go. Okay. He's just kidding around. What else wrong with you, George? And
one good thing. You know, I very rarely drive the Palm Middle. Once like on a way back
from the airport, from Miami International, that's generally one of the ways to go. And
you drive through highly on the Palm Middle now and you look around. All the signs are
in English. And I think I'll be God damn. The signs are used to be not too many years
ago. You drive on a Palm Middle anywhere by Halea. No speak of the English, baby. Everything
in Espanol. And now the signs are all in English. Yeah, but this guy seems surprised
by it. Oh, he's not surprised. He's just having just making just to have a little conversation.
He's slow. He's not slow. He's having a little conversation. No, no, no, no, no, no,
and he's having a real problem with that cheese aroma in Halea because the cheese in
the Spain falls mainly. Here's, they're gone on air W I O D. Neil. Yes, I worry about. Okay.
Just got back from the great white North last week. Yeah. And I guess who has the book?
Remember the big M Frank Mahavali is got what book? He's got the diet book. No way. I'm
sure I had a lot of the hovelets. He's on the Edgens diet. I had lunch with them on
the way. Number 27. Frank Mahavali. You got it. You got it. He's got Harrison Mahavali.
It's okay. Here we go. He did it. He did it just for the blood pressure. Neil. Yeah. Because
he had a blood pressure problem. How's he doing? He's doing great. He's just getting old and
getting slow. Yeah. I've seen him in some of those exhibitions. Yeah. He's a little
ponchy. He could use the Edgens. He would love to. He loved it because of the blood pressure.
And I told him about you and your blood pressure. Yeah. He said, damn, he says, I'm going
to give it a try. Are you serious? Yeah. I just thought I mentioned that. I just got back.
All right. Neil Rogers saves Frank Mahavali's life. He's got. All right. Take care,
Frank. Thanks, Pally. That made my day. He heard the best programming consultant. All I could say
is Neil God. I'm going to go to hell. 610 W I O D by Emmy Fort Lauderdale. News talk and entertainment
radio. 610 W I O D. Good.
