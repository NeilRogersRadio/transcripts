indeed
i just want to ask you i know you don't like to do it very often but i would like
to do it a lot
so i but you know
things that they are um... anyway
i would like to ask you to play something of a dedication to all these
grimly
to self delusional credence
who evidently believe that there's anything but the power of money
at issue here in the trial
what i
you've had it so many times today i think it's appropriate could you play
i'm an asshole

for already had it uh...
uh...
i'm so sick of it yeah
but you but you follow what i'm saying how is this going to change any our
lives
it's not
you know it's not all all these people are basically admitting that they got
sucked in by the media and that uh... they're immersed in this
and that somehow they've been convinced that this uh... is some significant
event which it is not
and the reaction what you were saying about the reaction
i was a paul i was i was
going about my daily business and of course the whole world stocked and it
stopped in the middle of a meeting that this group of mine had
and they moved a tv in there
and when when the
verdict was announced
my god people were cheering in there as if they were spectators at the roman
coliseum
and their gladiator had delivered the final blow yeah
it's it's ridiculous and then on the other side
you know i was driving home the other day and i heard this woman i mean i'll be
it she was very very well spoken but my god when she said she cried for six
hours give me a break
and he cried for six hours because it's over now she's gotten all life have a
great day

about me
about the way our american heart speed
way down in the bottom of our chest but the
about that special feeling we get in the
cockles for our house
in the bowl of the cockles maybe in the sub-cockware
again
maybe in the liver
maybe in the kidneys
we start with it without any cold
we don't know
yeah

this is your last chance today when it out get it out of your system just
give a big blow it out and that's it
aventure hello go yes sir yes still how are you today i'm great okay uh i want to tell
you first of all i know i'm a 39 year old black male
yes sir and uh i'm a college is a kid of young men
and that means that i like everybody else who went to school
paid my dues right okay
well you're not that young i mean compared to me who are you have it okay now i
want to i want to say to you that um i've i've enjoyed your show over the years
yeah but i want to explain something to you regarding uh where most of the people have
tell my people came from with this uh celebration type thing that everybody's talking about
okay i've been asking for that for uh i'm gonna tell it to you straight okay first of all i
want to tell you that we only have uh in this market one uh black station i think this wbr
what about hot 105 last time i checked it's right up the hill of hot let's have a hot
well if i have a lot of listeners too but for the most part um how many five are one of the top
four or five stations absolutely i want to commend those jocks over there that uh
monitor this program when they have the uh the announcement of the verdict when the people
were calling and and they were extremely ecstatic about his his acquittal um the station manager
the program manager and director and at the dj told the told the people there that it was nothing
to really be jubilant about okay and that was a word it wasn't that they were feeding out the
frenzy for everybody to jump up and have a great time and start cheering this guy on yeah because
we really felt and i know most of the people that feel the way i do that this was a uh sort of
bittersweet victory so to speak we really don't know well they're all these people uh
cheering about him wasn't just a mind we think it was all over the country i'll tell you exactly
where it comes from you know and i mean i hate to say this because a lot of people think that when
we say this we're we're coughing out but there's thing called a blank experience and only black
people have experienced that and i think you'll agree if you have always met with disappointment
and dismay and the criminal justice system which for the most part has been just that for us
here was an opportunity for people they came from a community it was just every day people they
were nobody in particular you'll find out the love of people and jury were mixed back they came
from places like one one of these that she came from krennishel that's not a luxury area that's
know where we're owed a little bit right okay these people have an opportunity to really voice
an opinion through the fact that they were registered voters that really made a major major change
or difference in some event and i think because they had that in that i mean there's nothing nothing
extraordinary about blacks being on juries when our black people on juries every day anywhere in the
country there's juris that was on edge jury that were people of color black people in particular
that is relatively unusual i think you'll admit that for the most part most highly proof of our
cases have not had that when ronnie king was beaten to a pulp and we all saw it on video yeah but
we went through that ronnie king the million times that the last time got nothing to do with that
that was that was the mean reason why everybody was was jr i do not know if oj some some is innocent or guilty
of committing a crime i do know this i do know he is definitely definitely guilty of beating his wife
yeah and that is not why are people making a hero out of well i think what happens is again like
i said before i think they're not making a hero out of them i think that most sure they are well
most people didn't want to believe he was guilty me because he was a public figure that was a hero
to begin with it is very difficult to take that feeling that you had that strong emotion and just
totally erased that from your mind as if it never existed he was on other words of michael jackson is
sleeping with little boys and if uh... oj killed you know two innocent people in cold blood because
their superstars it's very difficult for us to accept that is that what you're saying i mean but
most people have been fed this type of data this information to them every day over the airway
oh well of course that that's the whole thing with this here that was your whole crap that's right
their programs to do that i mean you know uh... you know that might be about a history of of abuse
and that you can't you can't look the other way and i know that well you know something when david
burker which was on trial and i realized i don't think that he himself uh... practices religion but
i mean his parents were jewish i didn't see jewish people who've been uh... oppressed for
years and years far longer than blacks in america by the way thousands of years before there was any
america i didn't see any groups of jewish people gathering around and saying oh my god this is a
grotesque injustice because david burker which is uh... you know been convicted of being the son of
sam in killing all those people in new york i didn't see any uh... jewish backlash against it
well i don't think that was the same type of i didn't see that gays who are who are far more
in america today than black people i don't say i didn't see them when uh...
john wain gacy was convicted and sent to the electric cheer in chicago murdering all those kids
or when jeffrey dommer was convicted of uh... killing all those people i didn't see any gay group
skiing together saying this is outrageous and we've been discriminated against they didn't get a
fair trial none of those people in the old had the notoriety that oj sentinat and being a public
figure for so many years doing what we would call major accomplishments the highest maturity
a great athlete a superstar so what does that have to do with it i would have been gacy i want to
want to have been trophy in college i would have been made it okay i think i was okay i'm not saying
what i am saying to you is that it's hard for people to turn their back on their emotions
when it comes to a predisposed emotion and that's what it is people program i tell you i feel very
bad about what happened and i my heart goes out to the people that were murdered as well
i think that the exportation from this trial was absolutely ridiculous should never been tell about
everything those carat should have been out of there the first every single person if he came near
this trial made a bundle and you can tell me that's right all this probably this trial was not
about race it was a trial about money it was not a trial about race but the thing is who
commercialize this trial i tell you one thing you know a lot of people say that johnny car uh...
talker and play the race car but i can recall back when uh... when old jay somsibos first arrested
and time magazine published his picture and darken the picture which which a lot of people object
to i'm i personally objected to that well what do you think the purpose of that well you think
that you can't you think time magazine is the racist magazine no i think the purpose of it was
that that was a subtle racial overtone i think it was done that way in that man and it was a
apology that was given from time magazine openly for doing with the i don't think it was a
conscious thing i think that it was just i just i just i just tell you i mean you can start looking
for uh... all kinds of stuff everywhere you know if you want to come this is true i can tell you
this i think that this whole thing has been just been based upon the fact that uh... you have
the people sent them this jury for a little so long they were there for nine months that's a very
long time yeah and a great great portion of the prosecution's case no i don't want to argue the
case i don't want to argue that part of it i don't want to discuss that it's a
mood point it's already but my point is that how can people come to a fair conclusion that they don't
even understand this so all they have to rely upon it all think of the bitter life on was their
emotion i think that they want to see this guy a quick like i said let's get the dummies off the
jury's and get professional jurors and some get get emotion out of justice there's no room for
emotion in the justice system but they're not always going to change the ill yeah if first of all
my people began to understand the importance of voting registering to vote to come in an active
member of this system which is the only system that we have unfortunately like a lot this is the
deal i got to go said that we were we're hand them out okay all right appreciate it
six ten w i o d so offensive we offend ourselves 1229 and w i d everybody here loves Phil Henry
including me but the quits low and down our lunch order where you're filled go get your own god damn
lunch we have two open lines around the green lines 189449463 189444 w i d here's Miami hello
Miami is gone okay like i said open line in day 751 here's the hollywood hello
hollywood hello yes hi you all new listen i just gonna gonna press myself my feelings about the
whole thing oj and then i gonna shut by now i'm gonna talk about anymore okay i really wanted to say
that everybody is knocking down oj's money and money you can money you can money the money the
fact guy is saying he earned it but nobody says about the persecution has the same amount of money
they all j have because they say pay for condom so you could have done it you had the money
and i would have done it if i had the money besides that nobody say the money did have a spend
in the brown family to put them in business to buy them the house and manifest in houses
they will have to leave now nobody says about that yeah okay now they worry about because she has been
bar listen to me any woman they have now emm to be the lady not a hard the first time go back to him
and i hate to break the news today so in other words you're saying she deserved is that what you're saying
no she had a comment that a nice big house and therefore she deserved it
she would have been here and then you got to hurt so franchise for dan
okay i don't want to talk to you lady we have an open line of brown five two four i mean you just
hysterical okay and just shooting off a big mouth so like you said dummy up and zip your lip and
get out of my face and nicks getting really pissed off on a young and a hung here

boyfriend there i think there are a couple i think they're gonna will open
the judge didn't say anything about me taking you come on manly off and that's brilliant okay that's
really smart get your ass out of there see this is just so they do these things to infuriate you
because there's nobody who's really that stupid especially if he wants to stay out of jail and keep
getting some of that good stuff that he was getting that's a good idea and he lets uh
now that we had a wait all this time for Phil that's good our lunch out there and start eating
and stop listening to these hysterical people with their oj droppings here's a medley on a purple line
hello hello neal how are you okay listen most of the day and morning part of this afternoon a lot
of people have been just giving out their own opinions uh i don't think anybody has given one thought
about those two people that are dead yeah i think everybody has called in to say how guilt
deer or not how not guilty oj Simpson is yeah but i think they've forgotten about i don't think
everybody has said that well let's not say everybody let's say the majority of the people are
worried more about if he's guilty if he's not guilty it's gonna be a big ride if not gonna be a big
riot i'm not gonna be any riot of course not you know after they found the man now guilty
we use guilty as hell where's my sauce by the way Andy you're running out here with my sauce you
it go ahead so i'm sorry but anyway uh the only thing really sick really sick pal you're the
biggest jackass you make mark firm and look like a guy damn Sunday school preach that's what you
look like you're an asshole and if you think it's gonna get on the year surprise guess what it
doesn't get on the year surprise oh god i wish what line was that on too bad we couldn't have done
a cool call uh came in and blocked the line quick call us so fast today okay because
we don't have a online anyway it was done what oh that's right we couldn't know that's why he's
doing it mr macho there he does it on the pound line because we can't call him back on the
mobile line so he calls it it makes a disgusting grotesque racial comment sir you're a piece of
walking turd okay really beautiful like that's gonna get on the year right here's the four-letter
they'll hello hello yes sir how do you like that oh man it was beautiful yeah i heard it but i
can't repeat it right that's right okay well see oh nils did you watch kid come on i guess it was
right after the juice tripping after what after the old day trial the juicy trial yeah why did they
have to come on and give that statistic about one in three blacks are locked up now oh they've
been hyping that a lot lately one on three a blacks between twenty and twenty nine yes i'm a black man
mm-hmm to me it seems as if it says how come we don't know how many white people between twenty and
twenty nine hour and twenty is there's a lot of there's a lot of young people out there
committing a lot of crimes that's not a line is the number of white men in jail so
this is i mean it's like one in twenty billion or something i don't know i would have been
interesting to find out but they never gave that i didn't see that several times i mean that says
to me like don't worry white america we didn't get old jay but we got the rest of them yeah yeah
like everybody who's been putting jail is innocent exactly mm-hmm well i got another point okay um
i want to give white america a chance to to say that i feel old jay was guilty for one thing
let me get that off my chair yeah but they don't have anything to worry about because we as black
we don't own any major food or retail outlet we have no due disaproved what are we talking about
how about churches chicken okay that's that one yeah all right and what about that watermelon patch
down there at homestead well what about the guy that looks like ross for oil all the all the chicken
we there you go we get it from the home so hey yeah we got no political power we frank Purdue no
major corporations yeah i'm Purdue and no major media or tv we don't own jack because i mean
we're still the same situation we always been for the last eight million years nothing's changed
and what's the what's the reason for that well i feel as if the reason for that is that
i tell you what the king's message it wasn't carried out the way i don't know if he even king knew
what he was talking about because the message wasn't carried out yeah we took businesses out of
our own neighborhoods out of black neighborhoods and when we were able to go into the white neighborhoods
and shop and do our and do our businesses there on the beautiful marble floors and the air condition
buildings we left our neighborhood yeah and they did cheer you read and we just have it overcome
that we haven't gone back into our neighborhood and rebuilt them and did anything i mean no maintenance
within our you know own system on black i think that's one reason for it also too did you see
our loose faircon was on donny you the other day no i wouldn't watch i wouldn't watch him for more than
10 seconds but it was interesting because the lady stood up and they were talking about political
issues and everything and the lady stood up she said well what do you feel about a guy in politics
that's a womanizer and a drug abuse and Lewis say oh who you talking about on
Jonathan of course you talk about Marion very but you know i thought that was kind of cute
but that's all Neil okay pal thanks here i never trust a guy named Marion
1237 i'm gonna do this puppet i got a mouthful of food what am i gonna do about that
um oh man this is really good the sausage thanks again carol and uh Lisa and Stan
Stan's age deli man they got some good stuff they got all this uh Lorenzo stuff over there
they're pretty smart see not like Frato or sunny not um they're smart and they get the good stuff
and that's why they're doing some business down there 16 W I O D radio freestyle Florida
1241 at W I D so here's a facts from somebody bugsie in west Palm Beach and it says today's
Palm Beach post no blackout wine oh comment i'll tell you why bugsie and thanks for sending me
this article because our papers here for some reason don't have any clue what's going on
because the Sun Sentinel has got a big article blackout deadline is today dolphins get to 24 hour
extension because it was you i'm kipper on Wednesday and supposedly juiced on by dolphins eats on
Wednesday and there it falls they out and it says at the end of this article uh channel six was
prepared to buy out their remaining tickets for sundays game on thursday but when station officials
heard about the extension they decided to wait until the deadline today to make a final decision
they bought out less than a thousand tickets to televised the home opener against the jets in the
Palm Beach paper it says uh any implicit burden on the Jewish community to buy up their remaining
tickets was removed when channel six and Miami guaranteed that it would purchase any surplus by
Friday afternoon that means no blackout which means channel six and five in Palm Beach will show the
game so depends on which paper you read but uh what can i tell you okay little rumble there at the
Asoda joint they're on a young and a horny man and they just can't get them out of there just turn
around and put your tail between your legs or whatever and get her out of there to and cut the crap
look at this so anyway it's a 1242 a w i would be so i guess you know depending on which paper you
read don't worry about the blackout it's said when i just uh try to con you people into buying a lot
more tickets but whatever's left to they'll buy them up because they want to get that game on here
get all a revenue which will more than compensate for whatever it costed by the tickets right
whatever you say wisechester hello i had a nil okay uh i got a report a spire report on uh OG and uh
his uh his uh getting his money back uh he's he's selling the um the pictures of his reunion with
his kids to a tabloid yeah to star magazine for 1.2 mil isn't that nice that is disgusting how
could you sell out your own kids like that yep but and we're supposed to feel so sorry because
it was separated from his kids for 15 months and he wanted to be home by christmas and yadda
and his son and and he sells the pictures to a tabloid it's incredible yeah and uh the brown
family uh finally considered custody to him because they don't want to make they don't want to make
their children suffer anymore they did what was that uh um yesterday uh the interview uh
then he sprung the Nicole Brown's father and he said that he gets along with people every day that
he doesn't agree with and he says he's going to have to deal with oh j
but he they haven't seen it custody wrong about that really no no i i could have sworn i heard
of say something like that but no well he doesn't want to make the children suffer anymore yeah but
that doesn't mean he's going to give up the kids uh well that's gonna be a major fun
well it's gonna cost him you know he's got that one hurts franchise now maybe get another one
and in closing uh johnny cacchard is seriously thinking of running for a lame mayor i heard that on
cnn this morning oh i'm serious right in the middle of my lunch you did that have a great weekend
all right see you so yeah open line at day 751 can you imagine that johnny cacchard mayor of los angeles
here's uh boca hello wait a minute it's a wrong line boca how can it be a boca online nine
hello there's never anybody on it line what are you dreaming or what here's a cutler rage hello
hello nil yes sir hi i'm i'm an african american i'm just calling to say that there are just too many too many
black people who are calling and making excuses for oh j yeah oh j is a grown man he can make up
his own excuses he doesn't need a whole country behind him the thing that really i felt bad about
for the whole jury is because of the fact that the whole trial was televised and everything and they
did feel a whole about a lot of pressure who knows the jury the many members of the black jury they
might have actually thought that oh j was guilty or not they said the someone said they did
yeah but the thing is is that they knew i mean even if they were on the jury they can't it doesn't
matter if they were on there for like maybe a week or so they know that the the trial was
highly publicizing everything and that you know once they did get out onto the streets and everything
everyone would know that they were on the jury because the media they were as soon as they got a
hold to it chances are they probably would show their faces right and so i think many of the jurors
probably felt the pressure of it because i know as a black person if i was to be on the jury one
thing i would have to consider was how would everyone else feel about me giving my own opinion
and if they didn't feel the same way about my opinion then chances are that our who knows something
could go wrong so the jurors many of the black jurors they probably did feel that as black people
they should support oh j not just because they think that he's innocent but because of his color
and some of the other jurors i think there are white jurors yeah in order for them to feel that
they aren't being racist or anything you know by voting against oh j even though they might
think that he is guilty they probably voted you know towards his innocence because they did feel the
pressures of it but i don't think that um any any black person who is calling up this show should
make excuses for oh j you know it's not it's not right they're calling up saying that he's
innocent and everything no no they don't even think about it they're looking at the fact that he's a
black man who had a white wife and everything and they don't see the fact that she got killed or
anything they just look at the fact he's a black man okay have a great day pal okay open line in
day 751 w i o d we got two on a green lines it's bokeh pomegranate river a beach jono beach uh

an open line on a green line one eight hundred yeah Craig knows my number one eight hundred nine
four four nine four six three give me a break here's a lady in hollywood hello hello nia yes ma'am
hi how are you okay time i call you but i always listen to you great um i've been living in the
united states for five years and i still can't figure out americans i come from argentina um
argentina is a country made of it allians the people from stain there's a lot easier a big colony
of germans right right it's the fourth country in the in the world that has the most Jews and the
most Nazis yeah you're right well kind of balanced it out uh but when an argent when you ask an
Argentinian or a person that has lived there for a long time or their their children who have been
born there you have some what are what nationality i'm Argentinian why do americans here make such a
big issue about race and where you come from oh i'm Cuban-american i'm African-american i'm
Jewish-american um i still and it's just plain stupid it's just stupid and and the media have helped
to create this and perpetuated and it's just it's just the way the establishment likes it it's called
divide and conquer that's just the way they love it but it's just that i don't see america is
going to make it as a as a society ever if they don't get all together and say you know we're
American it's not gonna it's not gonna happen it ain't gonna happen like this like with this
oj Simpson by the way i didn't even know who he was before all this started and you know something
a lot of the people especially these women who are calling in on all the shows including this one
who wouldn't know oj Simpson from oj Schwartz who were never followed football who haven't got any
idea what team he played for what the only was all about all of a sudden they got an opinion because
it was a big media event that was on television every day like a never ending soap opera that's why
they haven't got any idea who he was and everything has to fall into a racial issue yeah and
that's america welcome to america it's not only it's not only racist there there is no solution
there is no solution i mean it's institutionalized it is institutionalized whether you're black whether
you're gay whether you're Chinese whether you're this we're gonna find some reason to hate you and
that's america that's why this country blows everybody makes such a big personal uh the american
people are extremely parochial people most of whom have never been anywhere related to real
civilization they think because we got the best strip shopping malls anywhere in the world that
that makes us a great country and because we got bigger color tv sets except for the japanese
and so that makes us better than everybody they haven't been anywhere they don't know what
you yesterday and so because i'm glad that i can talk everything i can because we live in america
right and all kind of many countries in the world you can say whatever you want you can even
curse on on the rating that's right that's right even the puritanical british on the bbc any
worth it's ever been invented on those bbc comedies nobody gets uptight about it the same thing
all over western europe there's no censorship of language uh there's no censorship of like a body
parts uh breast stuff like that it's in news magazines it's everywhere the american public man has
been so brainwashed and so kind into waving the flag in his pseudo patriotism and bullcrap this
country's in deep deep deep deep deep love i agree with you and and since their children at school
all they learn about is the united states they they they don't know anything about other parts of
the world they don't know anything about this country they can they can't even find a state that
they live in on a map they they they're educated to believe that this is the best best place in
the world yeah that's it they don't care about anything else well they're getting just what they deserve
okay good luck to us man okay say yeah open line of dates 751 wiod
anybody want to write me a check for like two three million i'll be more than happy to get out my
passport hop on a plane you won't see me no more it's just a stone age man it's in the dark ages
and apology loving or leave it baby i'll fight at flag yeah yeah okay whatever you say
freedom is just a state of mind they're very little freedoms in this country we got a police
state that's going on here mark firmman is living proof of that that's what people ought to be up
in arms about is police corruption mark firmman isn't uh he's not an isolated case
police corruption brutality beatings murder we had the mimeo river cops here we got every kind
of drug deal every kind of beating every kind of murder going on it's a god damn good stop
out there but we're all arguing about you know is it a black and white issue because that's the way
the media have orchestrated that's why every every show you get on you got your black experts on
there and your uh oh jay apologizes and you got your white your path you can it is on there you
know and that's what it is it's a media circus and that's going to change it i don't think so
here's uh davie hello and back to you uh agree with that last caller she
guys write on the money as far as you know those people that feel like they got short
changed or jip with with this decision you know i just cross oj off your christmas card list and
you know it takes some comfort in on that you know what i don't know what the status but you know
most people go through the uh judicial system i don't know what it's 75 85 95 percent go back
into it you know once they're in they go through jail they usually come back through it again
anyway so it takes some cover on oj oh probably be back okay thanks for the abriant observation
we have an open line in brown or five two four one on a green line one eight hundred nine four four
like i said we got an hour and four minutes to go in and on monday i got a whole new agenda baby
in this ain't part of it forget it because the uh inanity just uh keeps on coming here's sunrise hello
nail yes sir what's going on you tell me that lady should get her passport and go back to where
she came from why is that because this place you know how stupid you sound man no this place sucks
you misunderstood what i was saying i thought you were going to give me one of those
the go back you know what the place where he's from is probably much better than here i'm not
so sure about that our continuous like some very very very serious problem this place is going to
hell in a hand basket yeah and it ain't going to get any better yeah everything that is going on
right now is just going to get worse and worse and the thing that upset me the most well thanks for
you rock mystic view the same thing that upset you about everybody jumping around and screaming and
which not only was black there were also white people doing that's right i think a lot of the people
did it because it was the thing to do but what really struck me as weird was that how do they know
was the thing to do is a spontaneous thing that happened immediately yeah but i think there was a
buildup for i think that you knew that was going to happen anyway no i did not i i never expected any of
that i expected a lot of people to do that but the thing i did not expect was college educated people
people at Howard University right that was university my aunt that was puke well you event that's not
a real school anyway but the people that were college educated people that are supposed to be
leaders in this community were were applauding it just as much as the people that were jumping around
on the streets and that's what upset me the most was that i thought this was going to be an isolated
thing i knew the people out front of the courthouse that was that was they were there for that they
were there to cheer that's why they went down there so i expected that from them yeah but when we
were seeing feeds from around the whole united states nauseating it was just i couldn't believe it
and i want to make a comment about what you were saying before about police corruption and
brutality yeah i was a police officer in a city in Palm Beach county and we had a predominantly black
community i don't know if i can say the city why not that's up to you it was city of belgley okay
we had a predominantly black community and the rest of the community was made up primarily of
different ethnic groups mexican we had a lot of migrant workers a lot of Haitians right and
in the time that i worked there i never once saw somebody beaten and i never once saw somebody
falsely put in jail i don't know if you i'm sure you know but i don't know if a lot of people
have a listening know what probable causes it's an affidavit that's written by a police officer at
the time of the rest to the document why he believes that the person should be arrested and i
can tell you there were numerous times where we had people incarcerated for witness statements or
for suspect interrogations and upon completing all the statements if there wasn't enough probable
cause we released them we wouldn't send them to jail and let the state attorney work out we did
what we thought was right in house and didn't get anybody else involved yeah and i do not think
that mark firm and or police corruption of brutality represents the large part of police officers in
the united states i know a very big part i'm sure there are maybe not in belgley but in big cities
all over this country maybe it's different in bigger cities maybe because we were in a small
town it was you know it was a lot more um run the right way because of the fact that we knew the
community was watching us but you know i can't speak for bigger cities but from what i have seen
and also riding with other departments like to point out you that there were a lot of lynchings going
on in small towns in mississippi and the georgian places like that that's true but i think that we were
maybe we were a little bit more scrutinized than other places but it it is from what i have seen
it is not as widespread as everybody thinks and well whatever amount it is when you got a gun in a
badge and a power to law behind you man it's got to stop that's a bottom line you're listening
and we're getting paid 610 w i o d by m e fort lauderdale news talk and entertainment radio 610 w i o d

been left out in the trial of the century and old jay is killed okay whatever you say 107
a w i d and the hits just keep on coming baby they just can't get enough of it man no matter what
you tell them it's like it's like if you put lunch on the table and you said to somebody you know
it looks really delightful but there's arsenic right in the middle of it and plus what looks like a
stake is something that phyto left in the backyard this morning and if they had been convinced enough
that it was going to be a delicious chateau brion i guarantee you man they bit ooh look at their
chops unathgothed up here's a i'm telling you that's just the american public man it's it's a 95
percent of the public in this country there are so brainwashed and they're just it's hopeless
because they're brainwashed and they don't know it that's the sad part here's a mobile and candle
hello nale yes sir how you doing sir i'm doing good uh just before uh i guess this will be like the
last hour that we're going to be touching on this on this show baby this is it this is dde good
by the old jay and johnny and bobby and the gansomish bubble and i'm not going to change anything
and marcha and chris and the cardation and gilgar city and the gilmick dukel goodbye to all of them
nothing's going to change is everybody's going to ravin ray but uh as time goes on things will
always remain it's just another hobby it's just another thing to kill some time that's all
like how it feels said we're in the board of killing business and look at this deal i killed it
for like 15 months exactly i do want to make one comment uh to mostly black people uh the after
what about all black people who are all black all black okay okay all black i mean you said
people are mostly black i know i'm just i'm just giving away i know i know try to calm you down
uh when uh when the radeen king vert came down i'm an anglo-american and uh when uh i was
disgusted by that verdict but i did not and i don't think not one i don't remember any white
burning their house going into streets and riding yeah and the only people who were cheering were
probably a mark ferment in the raleigh but the mainstream america i mean people that have a little
bit of common sense they were disgusted now i don't know but i i don't want to sound a little bit
too ignorant but you know are the blacks forgetting all the whites american and the americans that
helped them throughout the years of their car wasn't it their don't start don't start making
a complicated now man uh you know i'm serious because i don't start talking about the juicer
wait a minute don't start to have me about the jewish civil rights workers are got killed in
Mississippi and about the uh n-w-a-c-p was founded by jews and about the acl you and all the other groups
that have worked so hard to protect the rights of black people and to give them progress because
it ain't going to do any good man because when you want to find anti-semitism in america you will
look within the black community there is such rampant anti-semitism that it's a frightening thing
it is a frightening thing rampant i think i just know i look at it and uh i'm going through a
okay you got a bad thing okay call me back maybe open line of brown or five two four nine four six
three five two four w-o-d which points up that like uh you know the song says like tom lear says
this one hates that one and everybody hates the jews and this one hates the blacks that's a
that's the american way that's just the world in fact it's not just this country it's in a lot of
barbaric places all over the world like in bosnia and in indian pakistan and in northern
irlanda and all over the god damn place baby the Protestants are aware of what the Catholics and
the jews with the Arabs and the blacks with the whites and the Indians with the Pakistanis and the
croat the Croatians with the Serbs just everywhere man and you want me to solve it here i'm going
to give you the answer sure here's a lady on a purple line hello hi now hi hi how you doing i'm
well i want to get this in before your last hour is over and i've been listening to you often on
all week and i don't know if anyone has mentioned this but do you remember the color davis murders in
texas and uh... this uh... his trial was like nineteen seventy six but this was a wealthiest man
ever tried for any kind of a crime much less murder he uh... murdered two people he murdered his
wife twelve year old daughter and her boyfriend and there were three witnesses at the house he shot
two of them one of them with his wife one of them was another uh... young man who happened
upon the scene who is still paralyzed for life and shot at his girlfriend who was running away
but uh... to make a long story short he was tried and three witnesses at the scene identified him
and he got off and he is still up they made like a tv movie of it in fact this year yeah but
it was one of those things where he became a celebrity because of the trial and though back in
well look at all the celebrities that this trial spot i know that people identify with celebrity
right and that's why they're so hyped up about this whole thing because he had such a following
a people people gathering around the court at all and one other thing to while he was in jail
pondering all this stuff is going to happen to him all of a sudden guess what he gets religion
oh don't think like god really you know turned on the god
he's a lot of the stuff in half of the jury and my nice and too my ties in that religion
oh yeah just like that god that's good to get like that just like that and i'm not putting
anyone's religion down but it just so happened that so many people on the jury were these religious
bible bell people this was in texas to don't forget and this was a really really wealthy man
and he ended up he had this great attorney race or tain and he would i don't even know if he's
alive yet but out of Houston and this guy race or tain is a real colorful figure and he
was like johnny cockran back in the seventies and he absolutely got him up well there you go
making his wife look all the justice money can buy have a great weekend see a open line on a

here's a lady in North Miami Beach hello hi the address is 1000 dash this avenue it's a lovely
apartment building and some years back the what the button the what is it's a lovely apartment
building what is one thousand fifth avenue in New York what is it John Lennon wanted to move into
this apartment building John Moon John Lennon of the Beatles or John Lennon yes the tennis
conferred and Warren Moon and would not allow John Lennon to move in why is that it would be too much
confusion too many people then they're around now I think it's because he was British maybe so
so then leave around so let her learn later on one so best of the loan tried oh keep him out
and he was kept out too yeah he's hung like a buttertop do you think that the five million dollar
crop tower apartment that OJ wants do you think that they will allow him do I think so yeah yes
because money talk yeah there you go all right okay because we know that slice the loan in the
John Lennon they didn't have no money what is she talking about what oh and by the way is he really
buying a house a manala pan or is that just a rumor they're starting up in Palm Beach County it's
good luck to you guys oh definitely Bailey went over there he bought him a house a manala pan
which I know that if I had all that money I don't know what would he want to look oh manala
pan Jesus OJ God which means he'll be listening to the show pretty soon so like I said Monday
forget I lay off of him baby I've always had an aversion to sharp knives here's a Delray Beach hello
hi I know yes sir I wish Lorenzo had a branch over here in Delray quick comment
when OJ called the show Larry King yeah he mentioned about leaving the house on
front in the dark yeah in the dark and then we're back in then put the lights on no he didn't say
at the point yeah but the point I want to bring out is did you notice Johnny Carpenter just saying
yeah I wasn't watching it I wasn't that our axlery let me tell you what happened uh Johnny
Carpenter is is yesterday him to death you know everything OJ say and he's yes and yes and yes and
but do you remember in the trial when when um Johnny Carpenter got up and he says yeah that was
OJ that was going into the house he admitted it he says that was OJ and what was he don't he was
coming back from heeding golf or hitting golf board right that was the out by he was uh
slicing the wire like that and and well but don't you remember in his statement to the police which
of course never was uh read in the testimony he said that he was taking a nap during that period
oh yeah the the preach while Shapiro said got up and said he was taking a nap now let's face it
from a quarter to ten when it came back from McDonald's for his big Mac and the drugs or whatever
they bought there from that time till a quarter to eleven uh I don't think he had time to go out and
play some golf and take an out and admittedly admittedly he went in the Bronco and he called from
his Bronco in the car phone at three minutes after ten so we know he was out admittedly what
that he called he was out of his Bronco no he was out of his cell phone outside he went out to the
Bronco and he had his cell phone at three minutes after ten he went he calls from his Bronco from that
car phone yeah of course because when you're inside the house naturally you're always going to make
a call out in the car you're going to if you're in a house right now when you want to call
me right that's right otherwise uh somebody might be overhearing it but the point that I wanted
to bring out yeah here he here's Johnny Cochland agreeing with him when he when it's Cochland himself
you got to understand Johnny wants to be the mayor of LA you're you're nitpicking now man listen
it's all over and just just keep just keep thinking of that picture of Johnny with that uh
schmata honest head and make it give me a good laugh who is lying yeah well who do you think

She's down, I go some and I pinch him
Cause me it's just a game
I grab a little poke and man they're giving me a name
They call me the fondler, yeah the fondler
I feel the round around around around around around
Oh!
And I'm assistant on my left, my secretary on my right
There's a cute little page that I'll be driving home tonight
Okay!
And when she asked me, the secret of my success
I rip open a shirt and try to do it on my desk
Cause I'm the fondler, yeah the fondler
I go around around around around around around
Well I'm known all over town
I gotta watch but I don't care
And I'm attacked, come and lie around
Just give me two sips of wine and I'm lying here

128 to W.O.D.
Speaking of Mary and Berry and I'm thinking of Jerry Studz and Barney Frank and Ted Kennedy
Unless you get like Mel Reynolds, he's going to jail from Illinois
The Democratic congressman who got caught with those young ladies pants down and some underage
But generally speaking, people don't care if they admire somebody, if they like their politics
If they admire what they did in sports or in the media or show business
And movie star, they don't care
They don't give a crap about their personal lives
Look at Clinton for crying out loud
I'll never forget that he and Hillary were on 60 minutes
And everybody, including me, we thought, okay, this is the end
We had all the Jennifer Flowers crap, I mean it was pathetic
This is the end, this man will never get the nomination
Never even if he did get a chance to be elected, he's El Presidente, baby
People don't really care about that stuff
That's why all you people like Denise and I don't know whether she's sincere or just a good act
But who really believe about this battered wife thing and about how people are so
Their consciousness has been raised and they're so outraged about the you know battered and abused women
They don't care about that, they aren't interested
And maybe the one juror who said even though was a disgusting comment
Maybe he was honest though, it was just a waste of time
They might as well have saved the 911 tapes, we didn't care
We don't care what a rotten son of a bitch he might have been to his wife
We don't care, we're not interested
That domain he killed her
So you can go through that long list of people you know and their constituencies
Whatever it might happen to be, they're gonna keep electing them back
Or they're gonna keep giving them their support
Because people in America don't care about these things
That's why it's a new story one day and the next day nobody knows from it
Whether it's Warren Moon or Bobby Cox or Irving Spikes
Or the two guys at the University of Nebraska, the two-punk football players
Nobody cares, that's why Hugh Grant, what a schmuck he was man
Goes on and apologizes, he should have been high-fiving with Jay Leno and everybody else
Alright, there's another one for Hugh, everybody likes that
They like the fact that all these people out there are sleeping around
That's what they want to read in the goddamn inquire and the star in the globe and all their tabloids
They want to find it who's sticking it where
Here's a cruel gable, hello
How you doing Neil?
Okay
Oh man, I'm going nuts, Neil, I know what I'm gonna do
But at any rate
Half an hour on the show, baby, half an hour in his audio, so I'm gonna see you all again
I have a good life
I am waiting for Monday with Bated Breath
Me too
But at any rate, I think I could adjust right, I think you know
You got to let it run its course and this is it
I think I don't even want to talk about it anymore
I'm as sick and disgusted as just about everybody else what the brain is
The reason are really caught Neil is that bitch that caught in the last hour
That Argentinian bitch
Yeah
Okay, there's a reason why she's hearing not an Argentinia, okay?
You want to talk about a racist country?
Argentinia baby
There are no blacks there, no blacks in Argentina
Why is that?
Don't tell Mark Ferman that
Yeah, well, I believe I don't know
I'm sure he's checking for his passport right now
So listen honey, if it's so good over there hop on the next Iberia flight and get the hell on out
Have a nice day
Okay, well
Where's that, remember that song that the guy did at Cemetery Village
Which I think was number one for about two minute and others must be to money
There's please don't take my penis
Some of our great to hits here in Iraq, but where's that you know the one I'm talking about?
Oh, gee, oh here it is, alright
This is just for that lady and this guy
Alright
Oh
Are you?
Puzzle
I saw you
My heart began to flutter, tried to speak
And then began to stutter, and you walked by
I knew that this was really long
Oh, hey
Said hello
You turned and smiled so sweetly, then you spoke
And I was yours completely now I'm just gonna ask you a question
Is the title where the song is called?
The title is my Argentine
Well, I think you get the message, I can't stand anymore of it
Let's go to, I told them if they would have played that on the coast man
They'd be number one with a bullet
For Lauderdale, hello
Hello
Yes sir
Now what's going on?
How you doing?
Okay, let me just say one quick thing here
Okay, if anybody falls this trial
Okay
If anybody won?
If anybody falls this trial closely in the beginning of the trial
Okay, Johnny was losing
Yeah
He had the only thing
What's going on there in the back?
Are we having like some kind of a level back there?
Oh yeah
Okay, Johnny was losing
Johnny was losing
Okay, the evidence was against them
Okay, the motive was
All other defense witnesses get blowing up one at a time, right?
And, okay, well he's got somebody did live in the back there
And I don't have time for it, okay?
We have an open line in Broward 524
And here's West Palm Beach
Hello
Hey Neil
Yes sir
How you doing today, sir?
Great, I've called with Noah Jay today
Good
You know, it's...
Although he will be a neighbor of yours very soon
Yeah, I hear that
And what really ticks me off, Neil, is like you said, you know, you stole my fire every day, which is okay
You know, this thing was over long ago
Like you said, we knew he was going to walk, who cares?
Right
It's over
Yeah, what are these bit like that woman that's called yesterday, she cried for six hours after they read the verdict?
You know, she needs mental health, she needs a psychiatrist
Which incredible is Neil, the football season is in full effect
Right?
He season starts tomorrow
Poppano Park opens tonight, we got some heavy-duty stuff coming up here
You got baseball...
Playoffs are heavy-duty, they're exciting games
What more could jazz for in life, and here we got everybody crying
Not me, not me, like I said, man, I'm going to be at Poppano Park tonight
I got the Leafs in the Penguins tomorrow, I got the...
And of course, at one o'clock tomorrow, I got the Panthers at New Jersey on TV
Oh, it's a beautiful day
And then Sunday, I got the Panthers open or at the arena
So it's a full weekend of important, of course, to play off games again tonight
So what the hell is wrong with these people?
It's a beautiful thing we got here with all the sports going on, and then these assholes calling it
And what can we do to solve it? They're crazy or what?
What kind of la la land are they living in? It's not going to change
It's like standing there, and when you hear somebody calling this, hello new, no, oh Jay thing
You feel like every time they open their mouth, you're being kicked or something
It's like killing the cold
Yeah, you know what I mean? It's just incredible
Well, Neil, I can't say that
You know something, 99% of these people are people who I either have never heard from
Or, you know, like once in a blue moon
But no matter what else I'm talking about, they will not call
I said here day after day after day, discussing every goddamn thing that's ever happened in the history of the universe
And most of these people, including especially these women, never would take the time to call
They all got a busy life, they can't, they're listening, but they'll never call
But boy, nothing's going to stop them on this deal
Neil, they're probably the same people that are calling when you give away the tickets and stuff
But you know, Neil, I have a shameless request
Yes sir
And a small card for you
You got a little one, yeah
And a small one, this shameless request is Phil's twisted
Yeah
And a small card is when I moved to West Palm, I listened to Neil Rogers every day
All right OJ
Have a good one, see ya
Open line to the green line, yeah?
OJ probably be listening to the show so we better be real nice
Like I said, after Monday, we don't mention that name on here again or Eiffely Bailey or Johnny Cochrane or Carl Douglas or Buster Douglas
Or Barry Shek and Bob Shapiro, we don't, it's banned, okay
Unless we change our minds

Approaching critical mass
O'Neill, my queen, God
The manager told me that I was right out of my head and then he said Phil Hendry was using a voice instead
Such lies I didn't listen to his jive, I knew all along
He was all wrong and I knew that he thought
Are you sure?
That I was crazy but I'm not, oh no
Yeah, but wait a second
The manager told me that I was a little confused and I said, hey Bobby
Yep
I didn't call to get abused this way, I heard a show just the other day
I think you ought to know what he did on his show, I was very upholed
That's the reason why I call
Yeah, but let me say something, Frist, let me say something
This woman named Margaret calls you, she'll quite a lot
And I don't want to listen to the suck up folks
Not I know you think Phil is a genius
And that is okay, I just feel that way, but here what I say
I didn't think it was a bit funny
Especially when he talked about the aborted baby fetuses
With the cocktail sauce on top
Yeah, but did you, are you sure?
The manager told me that I could use some couch time but I should have made me
Yep
You let me speak my mind, you'll find I didn't think it was very kind
When baseball was played by the crippled and blind
And to make matters worse
Passion phones with Sunny Hersh, oh no
All right, all right
The manager told me that I was right out of my head
And then he said, lady, your true easily misled
Cause you should know Phil Henry shows you naked new
So why don't you relax and have a value more too
Cause you don't know if you've got to talk to Bobby Green or not
And you know three voices are better than one
141 at WID Final, scored tomorrow by the way Florida State 56 University of Miami 10
Let's go to Miami
Hello
Hello
Yes sir
Hey Neil, hi, my name is Darrell, I'm a first time caller
It's a pleasure to speak with you
I'd like to touch on something concerning the OJ trial
I really haven't heard anyone say anything about this and to me it's the primary reason why he got off the hook
And it's not necessarily because of the money that he had
Although that had a lot to do with it to me
To me the primary reason he got off the hook is because of a bunch of inept and competent losers on the prosecution
There was idiots dropped the ball in the biggest trial of the century
Because they acquiesce to penalizing the jury that they penalized
In other words, nine blacks on that jury that didn't make a big cast
Didn't bring up the Bronco chase, didn't make a big case that an innocent man wouldn't flee
All of that
All kinds of stuff that mysteriously we never saw
But see if they had at least half black house land on that tree
It would have been a hung jury at the very least
In addition to what speaking of witnesses there was the one woman who says that she
And she seemed like a pretty credible woman
And lived in the neighborhood over by Nicole
Said that she saw the white Bronco with OJ in it driving away
And this was way back in the beginning
And Marsher was such a goody tooshu as well
She sold her story or she was going to sell her story to a tabloid
Therefore we won't put her on a stand
Well it seems to me that just about everybody else we saw
Sooner or later wind up selling her story to a tabloid
And they still all managed to get on a witness stand in the teller bullcrap
Absolutely and also I read that there were fibers that the scene found from a 93 or 94 Bronco
And they couldn't enter that into evidence because they didn't tell the defense about it soon enough
Great. I mean on and on. Are they sure that I'm telling L.A.
If you want to if you ever get angry you want to kill somebody go out to L.A. and do it man you'd be okay
No because those losers deserve to have their legal careers ruined for the rest of their lives
Because they embarrassed the country and they embarrassed the city of Los Angeles
And I was outraged, outraged when I found out about the racial make-up
I'm not a racist don't get me wrong
But just because OJ is black doesn't mean he deserves to have and I'm blacked on his jury
That's crap
Yep, that is crap
I could understand if it was like in DC or somewhere where there's a you're in the inner city Detroit
You know 9 or 10 blacks on a jury that makes sense
Yeah exactly
When you live in Brentwood 9 blacks on a jury is not a jury of your peers
Exactly and yeah that's about all I had to say about that
And I'm surprised I haven't heard really anyone else in the media talking about that
I mean to me that's the career
You're trying to cut to the chase and make it too simple
And if you do that then there's no excuse for having all these people on
And don't spoil the party pal
I guess not, Neil, it's a pleasure talking to you
Have a great weekend
Don't spoil the media friendsy man
You thought that it was all over
Surprise even CNN has special show today to tell us it's not over
They're clinging to this man or hanging on to it like oh geez
They're hanging on tight even John Bob it is embarrassed
Here's a mobile hello
Neil
Yes sir
I've been listening all week
And like a lot of other people I'm kind of disgusted
About hearing all the racist remarks from everybody
It's I was kind of like Rick I think
I didn't I don't say that
I don't say you were like Rick please
I knew it was it wasn't great but I didn't think it was this bad
Really?
Yeah
You thought that race relations were Hunky Dorian America right?
Yeah Hunky Dorian but I thought that we made a lot of progress
I had from 25 years ago 30 years ago
Yeah but no
We forgot about Ronald Reagan you see being an era along with Bush for 12 years
So I mean they helped to turn a clock back 50 years so we're like already back into 40s
Yeah sucks
But other than that I want to get off OJ but I have one thing for you
Yeah
Let's see Johnny Cochran said if it doesn't fit you must acquit
Yeah
And they did acquit and I will admit that 77% of white
How come he couldn't do that like you know what I'm saying?
And save me the effort there
We have an open line on a purple line that used to be the cellular one line
But now it's the AT&T wireless line
And no matter what you call it it's a free call if you make it in the reason I'm stalling is because this guy just said crap
But anyway if you pick up the your thing pick up your instrument your apparatus
And your cellular one and your AT&T wireless and dial pound IOD
Miraculous in the photo ring like it's suing right now and maybe George Lanserick
Oh my god don't forget we got Pompano Park opening tonight 630
In fact we got a couple of baby races there so it's a good idea to get there early
Posttime is 730 tonight and tomorrow
We got new ownership, new management
We got they want they want living and breathing people out there
They want the young the old the hung the unhung the uncut
They want everyone of any age to come out learn about harness racing
Have a good time. It's a great place great new food in the dining room
It's going to be sensational
And fat rich is going to mind his own business keep his nose clean and stay in his place or guess what rich you're out
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Hey. Thank God sometimes that we live in a bush town
All my fiance wanted for her birthday was ticket to the dolphin I bought him today. All right
Thanks to this guy he put us over the top now you can see the game on Sunday
Unbelievable man tickets available. They I think they were giving them away
The channel six are going to buy them all up again. I guess yeah, that's that's what they said there yeah
They didn't want the announcement to be too obvious because then they realized everybody stopped buying them
Every time somebody says oh well, you know, there's always an issue. All I remember is that playoff game
Wave I think it's like an 85 or so and they couldn't sell out a playoff game
It was blacked out. I can see it. It was embarrassing and that was embarrassing
Unbelievable. Well, this is a playoff game for God's sake. Yeah, they love it and they're out
And they started off for no other the only undefeated team left in the whole national football league
Everybody's talking a big game Super Bowl and in the meantime they can't sell a game on what does it take my god?
They push it back to four o'clock at the NFL must have I
There must have been embarrassed to say hey all right. We'll give them one more chance. Yeah, they don't make it now
I don't know what's right one more time. Okay. How about if we give you a ten dollars and a ticket and deal with Wayne
If you sell it up by kickoff will give you
A
Jesus and next time Wayne gets them insider trading information. He'll give you a phone call. Oh, there you go
Okay, enjoy pal
We have an open line at day 751. Let's see who the who the Patriots play or the Broncos
Geez
Patriots do suck, but you know you got to stick with your loser no matter what it is just like the angels
Okay, how do they do I guarantee the angels would have given the Yankees a better shot than these mariners or they all
O'Randy Johnson will mo am done. That'll be that's the no-brainer

Okay, turn that baby down
I'll turn it off
My husband and I were watching night or the town meeting the other night
And one thing that really bothered me that no one ever even brought up
There were black men coming up there on part of the back black business
League and all that other stuff
And on the black men's association
Nobody you know if a white person would have gone up there and said
I'm part of the white men's association or anything like that
That would have been racist or bigoted or air
Yeah, okay
Let's go to Hollywood hello
Dale, yes sir
I was reading the sentinel today about McDonald's and Uproar
With Israel's
Well that's right you know something I brought that in
I never had a chance to bring up about the cheeseburgers in Jerusalem
And of course you can't have cheese with the meat man
And they're pissed off over there now it's trade baby
They're going crazy
How do you like that?
And also I think they're going to cheeseburger today
Huh?

You're going to burn in hell Mr. I'll tell you that right now all I can say is
Oi

You don't eat the meat with the milk products and you separate them
I mean OJ
