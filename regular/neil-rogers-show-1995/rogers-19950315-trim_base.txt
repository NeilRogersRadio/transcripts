I don't know either. I've never treated anyone unkindly in my life.
Obviously. Like no mistake about it. You're a real sweetheart.
But you know, even my girlfriend that works at BA and Jackson, she has a secret story to my...
So what do you think it is? What's the reason for this?
I think it's after the hurricane. I think everyone wants to jump.
Yeah. I think the hurricane literally blew their brains out.
I think so. Yeah.
People have really changed.
You're right. But all I know is, I still love the broadcasting business.
I used to be a member of the TV staff company of Art and Science.
Yeah. I remember and knew that it came very well.
Yeah.
I started to keep in touch with a lot of the people in Baltimore and Washington.
Long me $50.
Yeah.
See, the audience is wondering how come a lady you go on?
So I'm just curious is how long this can go on. Go ahead. You got all the time you want.
I know. I think you are super terrific. And I'm glad you're not really leaving.
Oh yeah. Well up until this call I had changed my mind but I may have to be considered.
Okay. Have a great day.
Okay. Talk to you again in the body.
Okay. I've seen him come and go.
Thank you.
Okay. I'll do it. Say goodbye.
Bye-bye.
See that was nothing wrong. That was a nice short call right to the point.
We have an open line in date. 751 is payphone thing. I'm telling you.
There's some on the enterprising person out there in this audience. It's got a little bit of electronic expertise.
Man, that's where it's at. Somebody come up with a guy named payphone that you can understand what's on the other end.
Can't understand a god damn word there. Say it on any of them.
And that was a Southern bell one. Oh, what are always saying? Well, everybody, everybody their brothers making payphones.
That's got nothing to do with it. There's just something basically intrinsic and a whole goddamn thing.
They just suck. They blow. You can't understand. And didn't use to be that way.
This is just something that started very recently. Probably Castro got something to do with that.
And you'll be finding out about that during coyote this weekend. Still haven't been invited by the way.
And I feel really pissed off. You think I would go if they invited me to coyote. You're right. I would not.
Here's and it's got nothing to do with ethnicity. It's just what the hell am I going to do there? What am I going to do there?
Dance around like some kind of a little fruit cake. I can stay at home and do that on the treadmill.
I don't have to go down to coyote. I need a bunch of ethnic food, which I don't like Cuban food.
How come we can't have don't they have a thing called in Fort Lauderdale? They have a thing called a taste of Fort Lauderdale?
You know what I'm talking about? I don't know when it is. And of course when you're trying not to gain any weight,
that's not the kind of thing you're like, oh, while here here's what it is, please come and eat everything inside.
But that's the kind of thing that's fun when you have like an ethnic festival that has all different ethnic stuff.
As opposed to just kind of like one dimensional with a lot of beans and rice and oh, those black beans, man, just a thought of it.
It looks like it's already been eaten. Trust me when I tell you. It looks like it's been pretried.
And it wasn't so good the first time. It's like that refried beans. Oh, God. Mushy.
You like that crap huh? Like refried beans? Yeah. And black beans.
What does that mean exactly? Refried beans. First they cook them. Then they fry them.
Yeah. And then they blow them out there. In that order. Yeah. They're mushy. Refried beans, yeah.
Oh, yeah. And they fried them. Yeah. And I thought that Mexicans were bigger than that, which is why so many Mexicans are fat.
They are. That's a nice thing. Cubans don't have refried beans. Oh, they don't? No, we just have black beans, which are great.
Which are even worse. Oh, which are even worse, man. Like I said, the black beans. Oh, is that a dish?
Just a look at that. You could puke all over your shoe. You're looking at black beans. On these steaks. No, I don't.
Cuban food is not good. It's excellent. Mexican food is good. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
Puerto Ricans don't have any food. They're too busy with switch plates. They haven't got any food. Canadians don't have any food. They got their spam.
No, no, they have what do they call it? They're smoked meat. They call for stromney smoked meat because they're kind of constipated.
Today and for stromney sounds too Jewish. Anyway, it's 11.35 at W.I.O.D.
I don't care where you're hurting. I bet it is, sir.
Well, that's what he said. He said he's going to go to the different point things that I found. You know, I mean, there's been true points already.
That's, you know, some, that's the thing is, B.S. radio from sign-on to sign-offs. And I can't believe how many suckers there aren't at that.
For it's sitting there listening, laughing, even though you're not feeling well. Even though you're watching the end of the interview, B.S. radio.
Excuse me. Lastly, they said Neil was leaving, didn't they? Yeah. Is he leaving? No, but I was a fool. That was a... Yeah, right.
Yeah, right. Getting very emotional and very upset. I can tell the difference between posing and reality, man. That's the real thing. He's letting it get to him.
Here's Mime Beach. Hello. Yeah, some clients from Mime Beach. Happy anniversary and welcome back. I'm glad to know that you're not leaving.
Thank you so much. There's something going on on Mime Beach at the Recreation Department that I think the public needs to know.
Well, wait a minute. We have a celebrity guest in the studio there. I got you down. There she is. She's working on a shower pick right now.
Oh, is that what you came in here for to get one of those? I thought you'd already have your own library at home. She's got every model they've ever made.
And her husband ate too happy about it either by the way. Go ahead sir. What is it? I can't understand a damn thing you're saying. What is it?
There is something going on at the Recreation Department at the city of Mime Beach that is somewhat unorthodox.
There's a gentleman named Charlie Newton that has been working with the city of Mime Beach and coordinating all you sports in the 1978.
Is this going to be something really ponderous and terminal because it's starting out that way. Like really boring.
No, actually it's quite interesting. Channel 7 was going to do a new story on it last night and it got bumped off.
What is it? I'll tell you one thing. If her show is as good as she looks, she'd have a hell of a show. I'll tell you that.
Yeah, there's. She still looks pretty good. There were kids that were told that they were not allowed to play.
Yeah, okay, well listen, go on work on it. Okay, you're killing me and you're killing the show. This guy get out of here.
We have an open line in date 7519463. Here's Boka. Hello.
Neil God. Yes, sir. What is it? Get out of here. We have an open line on the green line 1-800-944-9463-1 in the day 751-W-I-O-D.
It's interesting. That wasn't the Italian nice man because I saw him at the game last night.
Now, does that, have we ever met him before the husband?
Okay, I think we've just solved the entire problem.
Now, I haven't seen her in summer since the day before she started whenever the hell that was.
A couple of months ago. At the time, I said she looks great. She's got a great ass. She's got the ample whatever whatever you want.
She's got plenty of it and she looks pretty good. And you know something she does. The only problem is she looks fake.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
She looks fake. In other words, there's something about that face. I don't maybe I'm not putting it in words, but forgetting about what she looks like.
She looks pretty good. But her husband, now is anybody remember Tiny Tim? His name is Tim. Exactly.
I read my case. That's why she ain't doing it no more. That's why she's so against everybody else doing it because she's afraid they're going to be doing it with somebody looks like him.
Oh my God. I feel so much better about myself already. That is a strange looking dude. That is a bizarre. That is what is it?
He's got blonde like frizzy. It's tiny Tim and drag maybe just lost 30 years. It's a young tiny. It's tiny Tim Jr. Make no mistake about it.
So next time you call Aaron, go easy on her. Okay, because it's tiny Tim. Let's do a pop it. Oh, hello. Hi Neil. Oh, if you could have seen this guy.
Neil, don't you get nervous when you talk all this stuff about people in the meet-up face to face? No. You're not a great guy. She was just standing right in there. What are you talking about?
I know, but I'm just telling me what if you saw Joe Serella in person? Did he jump that you and tried to strike? Let me tell you something. When they announced the lineups before the game last night, they announced not in the lineup tonight.
Number two, Joe Serella. There was an ovation in that crowd, the likes of which I've never heard in my life. So Joe would have to take on all of Section 125.
Yeah, well, I don't know. I know if I talk bad about something. He sucks. Look at let's face it. When you're getting paid a lot of money to perform, don't you think that you're open to criticism? In other words, people are only supposed to say good things about you.
Yeah, but if you go out there and you think that you're going out and somebody says you suck, then you either try to improve your quality of play or you go out and do something that you can do.
Yeah, it's like big ditches or something. I just, you know, it's one thing to say about it. Trust me. I call you all the time and I rip apart Joe Serella, but he doesn't know who I am. So I can.
I don't care if you know who I am. I met Joe Serella, Poppano Park. I think Joseph. Hell of a good guy. I like Joe Serella, but that's personal and this is business. There's a lot of guys I like, but that doesn't mean I want to play on my hockey team.
Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Absolutely. I like this guy Steve from plantation that we met at the game last night. They don't mean I want to mount their playing on left wing with this three barns.
You never know. It might be an improvement. It could be. And by the way, speaking of that, how come we got this great kid Garpent Love, which they had the original line set up last Saturday, which we still never have seen that line?
You know how most teams that have a coach with a brain, they have one big line like the like the penguins. They got Francis, et cetera, between yogurt and robot.
And that's what I'm going to tie, which is that's their great line. Those are right now. They're three best players on one big dangerous line. Okay. So why don't we have the original line was going to be stew barns between Melan B and Garpent Love?
We've never had that line. They've never played one shift together. That's because Roger Nielsen's a moron. Why do they have Andre Lamakian out there trying to?
Why do they have him out there? Why do they have him out there? Period. They have him out there in the power play when they should have their best guys out there all the time.
And how come we didn't get that Rob Goodrow who looks awful good to me for Ottawa man. He was out there on air power playing. This kid's a great player. And we could have had him for nothing in the waiver draft. And Brian Marie says, Oh, well, there was nobody that we wanted. Give me a break.
I'll be still working on that marvelous. That will be all that. Oh, no, he's good though. I like Jason. Well, he's playing pretty good. He's pretty good player. He's no Rob Goodrow. He's not. You're right.
Last but not least, Niel, did you get a chance to listen to the tape? I sent you. What? Did you?
Of what? It was a story that I wrote. No, no, you called me there. You're going to call me every day about this or you just called me yesterday about it. I'll get to it, man. I'll get to it. I'll get back to you, Diana.
All right. I just, you know, it was important to me. And I want to just, you know, give it away to people see if they like it and your opinions very important. Well, just relax.
All right. I'll keep holding in. I'll relax. You know Joe Serella hanging there. Come down. Please. We have an open line and Broward 524. So yeah, Aaron was in here with her husband. And he's a very. Oh, geez. I just.
I can't imagine that she's doing it with that. No, what? And she went in there and George has got all these water.
Ox. She wanted it. She wanted it right there. She said she wanted it. And if you were married to something like that, you'd probably wanted all day long.
No wonder she sounds deprived and depraved. No wonder she hangs out all day with her water pick. She did really want it.
Yeah. So I gave her Matt's card. Oh, man, when she saw that power, that power switch. Oh my God. Absolutely. When she saw that turbo pulse, she just went apeshot.
She was jumping up and down like Rumpel still skinny. You could almost feel it in the here. If she, if she lost weight or my memory just bad, she looks awfully skinny.
Oh, she's the same skinny. Yeah, tall, six feet tall tall and skinny. So how can she be tall and skinny and have a great ass? That part isn't skinny. Oh, she has a great big ass. It widens at that point. Oh, I see. Kind of like the Grand Canyon.
Okay. So George said that she's a tall and very skinny and her husband is ugly and she's got a big ass. Anyway, 130. That what you just said at WIOD.
After my life, I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers. Tonight on ABC, experience Christmas, the NYBD Blueway, Bucknaked and wrong. Sylvia, I'm f***ing home. Whoops. You're naked. And I'm so f***ing glad to see you. I have a f***ing surprise. Of course you're f***ing naked.
Not that. It's all bad. Oh, you got me a f***ing Christmas present. That's so f***ing sweet. Thanks, you s***, it whole big ass.
Tall bagging, sucking mother f***ing poopoo head. My pleasure. Hey, let's f***.
I better remove my holster. It's launching fun for everyone and NYBD Blue, the Christmas special tonight right after Luther Campbell's Christmas Carol on ABC.
Oh, by the way, better clarify something from yesterday because we don't want to give you no misinformation on this show. And that is that U of M graduate. Did he graduate? Well, whatever.
What is that? Listen to that thing. That baby's going nuts. Warren sat. He did not do no drug. Well, that's what the U of that's what the NFL says.
Times, the New York Times says he did and ESPN says he did. He tested positive for marriage.
He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did. He did.

so i thought i'd get in the one place
but in the meantime
no just throw it away
just throw it away
how can these people leave
delina with one minute left to go
one leg at a time
one leg at a time

you're gone in no problem at all
you think you've sort of changed
when they moved that place
so it's like you'll stay the same
no, why would it
what does it got to do with where it is?
it's the mentality of the public here man
when it's time to go
they go
it's time to go
when a game starts
and you see all those thousands of empty seats
last night i was going nuts
i thought, god, how can this be?
i mean, this looks like heart food for crying out loud
it's incredible
game starts and there's like maybe seven or eight thousand people in the stand
and there's six thousand other assholes wandering around somewhere
showing the baby to you
yeah, it wasn't that great
it wasn't that great
i left what i thought
shampoo polish there with his little baby
i need him like i need hemorrhoids
how can that be as real a politician
i mean, i thought i couldn't believe it
i thought i said pinch me i'm dreaming
i know i just i i was
pithed off i was really forming it to mouth
so what is that?
what kind of a greasy goal is that?
what kind of a way to end the game is that?
we outplay him the whole game
they're in a coma
and then they get one crappy shot
the guy just shooting it in really just a bouncing little piece of crap
from the blue line
there's nobody in between him and the beasur
and oops there it is

Yeah, boy, this calls cost me six, six dollars.
Why is that?
Why am I to tell my boss at the time?
But anyway, couple of things I thought about seeing that movie, Fatso.
Yeah.
Well, it got off the pretty bad store.
My name's Sal.
Yeah.
And I've been overweight most of my life.
You name him Sal?
A lot of my life, yeah.
But anyway, uh, that's the Nazi cops.
Yeah.
During the summer, I was on a 4,000 mile long journey.
On a 4,000 mile bike ride between Europe, Vermont, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.
Yeah.
And I met my cousin's husband.
He's a Newark New Jersey cop.
Yeah.
And we rode our bike up to Lake George, New York.
And his friend, he has a license tag that has an SPA, which is mission not so far.
Yeah.
And, uh, he's all in my cousin's husband's house.
He has all this power for an area.
All those things that clinched his power for the Nazi was in the most developed in the Lake George, in a copy of mine, Tom.
Yeah.
And, yeah, I've been a wealthier.
The Nazis are out of the supply.
I am not a Nazi.
Okay.
Well, thanks a lot for your scintillating call.
We have two open lines in both on the green lines.
I think that guy just cleaned those babies out.
1-800-944-9463-1-800-944-W-I-O-D between now and noon.
We're giving away those great Panther tickets and the dinner for two at the 1800 Club and the round trip on the bus and a partridge in a pair of three in a day with the Nese Pot van and et cetera and so on.
And some silk panties once worn by Wayne Heisen, I finger.
Here's a Pompato Beach.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay.
Well, I've come here at home for a day and a long time there.
I was wondering if you could tell me when the Calgary Flames, if they're coming here at all.
They're not, because they're in the Western Conference.
Why would they be coming here?
We got the shortened season.
And if you were in a stuid hockey fan, you would know that we're not playing a Western Conference.
Oh, sir.
Okay.
Well, those wondering if you could tell me I heard the other day when I was looking for...
They're coming here at the same time.
The Maple Leafs are coming and the St. Louis Blues and the Black Hawks and the Winnipeg Jetson and Vancouver Conucks.
And the Mighty Ducks and the San Jose Sharks and the Black Hawks.
Okay.
And the Dallas Stars.
I was wondering if you could tell me...
Hello.
I'm here.
Okay.
I was wondering if you could tell me the other day I heard some rumors about them wanting to treat Ben Beesbrook.
I was wondering what you think last night's performance would affect it.
Nothing that they do makes any sense.
I mean, I have no idea.
Roger Nielsen continues to love Joe Serella and he puts him out there and played one good period in the third period last night.
And actually, through a couple of checks, so on right now he'll be playing every damn day.
I can't explain what they're going to do.
They should have traded as much as I like him as good as he is.
They should have traded him a long time ago.
This team needs scoring.
They got the big defenseman from Sweden, the Swenson guy coming to go to play maybe tomorrow.
That's great, but we don't need more defenseman.
We need scoring, baby.
That's what we need and have a great day.
And I'll see you at the Calgary game.
We have an open line in Broward 5249463, 524WID, 524 Jim Dory is God.
So anyway, they blade run a girl.
She and Janet never miss a thing that Esther.
Remember, yesterday I was talking about Craig Simpson and Alexander Mogilde on Buffalo?
And she comes there breathless between the periods.
Well, between her, between somebody's periods.
And man, I said, well, I'll check out Craig Simpson during the warm-ups.
She was hyperventilated.
Oh, my God.
She couldn't even speak Esther.
She was speechless and breathless.
And poor Craig Simpson, man.
His pretty push almost got messed up by Serella last night.
He let him have a shot in the chops.
It was a beer.
At a boy, Joe, we knew you had it.
And now pack up and get out of here.
You suck.
It's 11.35 at WIOD.
In the time, it takes to say pro-paging.
You could have gotten your message already.
A gift idea.
You got somebody in the family who's having a holiday, a thing, a birthday coming up real.
And the next thing I want to say is that I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I'm going to have a birthday party.
I have a golden retriever.
Yes.
He's 13 years old.
Wow.
We had a problem with the ears when she was a puppy.
And I don't remember what he gave to her or what he did to her.
But 441 animal hospital.
Dr. Matthews.
441 and where?
It's on between Broward and Peters.
Oh.
On 441 by the old Jeep dealer there.
Dr. What?
Dr. Matthews.
Yeah, Eddie.
Eddie Matthews.
So, play the means of your base for the braids.
Exactly.
Okay.
All right.
Thanks.
Have a good one.
See you.
Open line on a purple line.
Now we're starting to get some doggy help here.
That's what I want.
Forget about all this other crap.
God, that gets to be so ponderous and you're going to waste all this money.
Well, we got this operation we'd like to do.
And it's really very safe and it's only $700.
And, you know, the vet's eyeballs are rolling around like a goddamn pinball machine every time.
Oh, it's only $700.
I know it's quite an investment.
But if you love your dog, give me the money now.
In fact, forget about the operation.
Just give me the goddamn money.
You know, the other night the game was so enjoyable, even though, you know, it wasn't the greatest game in the world that we won a bluesing it.
It was enjoyable till we gave up that greasy goal.
And I kept wondering why are we having such a good time tonight?
And it's because there were some people who weren't there.
Can't we all just get along, Neil?
Yeah.
What do you want, Andy Moss?
Just calling to say hi and the...
Chronic.
Huh?
I said, how you doing?
Actually, the reason I'm calling you.
I know you're the other night.
Where were you on Tuesday?
I had it.
I had it to be somewhere.
Somewhere secret, clandestine?
Very clandestine.
Okay.
But I'll be there tonight.
Oh.
And I expect a big panthers when Panthers four caps won.
Hi, I news for.
If we score four goals against Jim Carey, you can put it on the front page of the goddamn New York Times tomorrow.
Four to one Panthers.
Anyway, I was the only one who got the chance.
The reason I was calling.
Now, is Roger Neilson going to play that sweet, that Swenson kid tonight, because if he doesn't,
they're going to be massive revolts in the stands.
I'll tell you that.
I don't know who they're playing.
If we don't have Keith Brown and Sven Svensson, whatever his name is,
playing defense instead of Joe Serello and Brian Bay tonight, there's going to be serious trouble in that goddamn arena.
And I'm going to be responsible for it.
Good.
I'm telling you.
Anyway, I was calling because I realized that Jeff is probably on the road.
I wanted to call them Jeff and all his little panthers, buddies, a bunch of them.
Okay, get out of here, Andy.
Let's go to a lady.
Now, see, you know something you talk about said.
We were, John was telling me about this.
It was a game not too long ago.
Andy Moss invited himself to sit into a Bob Green seats that were empty with some butt plug friend of him.
He was sitting there and Jeff Moss, Mr. One, same brown suit for 20 years punk, is standing over there by the next section.
No, in the doorway.
The whole game, this one is looking at the other one and they're waving back and forth.
Not like brothers, like kind of boyfriends or something.
What was that all about?
And now he calls up so because he knows Jeff is on the road and him and his little asshole buddies can hear him on it.
Cut the crap, Andy.
And grow up already.
You stupid bastard.
Jesus, God, all my quick use in the show is a play toy.
It makes me nauseous.
And don't come anywhere near our seats tonight or you'll be escorted out.
Here's the lady in Miami.
Hello.
Hi, can you hear me okay?
Yes, I can.
Okay, because I have to talk.
Can you hear me okay?
Yeah, I'm in the office.
Oh, that's why you're whispering, okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, do you remember why you don't do, um, plastic?
Yes, I do.
But I don't care.
I still have no regrets.
I think the last couple of days, if, uh, what I had to say was important even if the colors weren't.
Yeah, just, just, um, there's this, let's face it, and the color of the project is, we all have it.
Right.
That's my point.
That's my point.
When, uh, Furman the German sits on there and makes the statement that he's never used the N word in the last ten years, you know he's full of crap.
Well, maybe it's the pronunciation of it.
Maybe it's a, maybe it should be a snake.
That, maybe he says spooker, something like that.
Oh, no.
Or smokey or cloud or, uh, cune.
Maybe he doesn't like to say nigger.
Yeah, maybe he does.
Maybe with a black head.
Oh, here's my role being spot, yeah.
Maybe with a therapy.
Uh, excited, not too, uh, that might have done it.
He might have gotten a new word.
They might have done a little lobotomy there in the, uh, yank the N word right out of his brain.
I just, I just don't understand it all.
I don't know why people can't just admit that they aren't having a-
They can't do it.
They cannot do it.
I brought this up yesterday.
You would have thought that, uh, I had leprosy.
They were running away from the show like, uh, they were terrified.
This is like, uh, when you find out you have a problem, you're on your way to solving it.
And they don't even know they have the problem.
Right.
Exactly.
So, I can't get hit now.
Have a great day.
Bye.
The whispering lady.
We have an open line in day, in 751.
Where's that guy from the Rogaine spot that was just on the weekend?
He said he wants to know.
I'd be glad to tell him.
Anything he wants, baby.
And just the money that I blew up to track last night.
You know, that's fair rich.
I'm going to tell you this guy, and he likes to play Mr. Innocent.
He lost his ass there last night, which he would lie about that, too.
But I know he did.
And he just keeps giving me this bogus.
Just shut up and do all your little numbers and talk to all your good little friends.
And let me lose my own way, okay?
Love the Seven Horse and the Metal Ange at that one race.
Oh, no, the A-D-A-D.
He's got the A-D.
It talks me off of that horse.
The Seven was getting claimed.
It finishes second one.
It's a hell of a race.
The A-D is nowhere to be found.
Starts talking to China.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You know what I'm saying, Fatsell?
146 at W-I-O-D.

Okay.
Just home like the guy at BonoVenture doing the Mr. Mom thing today.
Yeah.
That call before.
Yes, sir.
I got a couple things.
One request that I have, I'll get this out of the way.
Take that jack in the box and put it in the box and bury it.
Yeah, that's getting a two month reprieve.
Wait, two months.
Wait, two months.
You know that I had a couple of two factors today.
The one I'm going to hear that again.
Oh, no.
I mean, how can that still be funny?
How can it even be remotely humorous at this point?
I got admit when they could take the jack in the box and stick it with the fries.
When you put it on, I change the station.
I can't handle it anymore.
Well, I can't do it.
I hate tuning out.
I have a woman that works for me and I turned her on to you last year.
Yes.
And she absolutely loves you.
She says her day isn't complete.
If she doesn't hear your voice and she wants to compile your house,
you know it's where you live in the acres.
And she says she's willing to even give you her 16 year old son.
Well, a little bit too young for me, sir.
He's a good lucky looks like Orlando.
Well, a little bit too illegal and too young for me, sir.
And tell her to get a life.
Okay.
You're a Michael Jackson's number.
Yeah, two quick requests.
Yeah.
One new and one old.
The new one, Uranus commercial.
Yes.
And the old one, the magic bite.
Magic bite.
Sounds to me like your head is in one place.
Have a great day, pal.
And put you up and we'll help you bail out.
Yes, he wants to give me.
It's like that woman on the heraldos show.
I'd be proud to have my son molested by Michael Jackson.
If your car's life is over,
Go see Ben Dover.
You'll realize what you had was pain
Is when you hop in and ride your head.
Oh, yeah.
You've enjoyed driving Mercury.
You loved your Saturn.
Now come and dig Uranus.
Love that new car smell.
Nothing smells like Uranus.
Dependability.
No one has ever got stuck in Uranus.
Save the plunge, there'll be courage.
Ben Dover and ride your Uranus.
And if you like a car that holds the road,
You couldn't wipe out Uranus if you tried.
Uranus.
Powerful.
Yet great with gas.
Need trunk space?
Rest assured you can pack anything in Uranus.
And if Uranus is rear-ended,
Our well-lover kidded joints will soften the blow.
Come to our showroom and pick out Uranus.
And leave that messy paperwork to us.
Check out Uranus.
Take the time, light grey,
Blue Gain has been over and ride your Uranus.
Here's Volka. Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hey, listen, first time I call you is a couple weeks ago.
I wanted to one of the videos, the Boy or Two.
Yeah.
Kind of tell you it was a great opportunity to call you and speak to you.
And I took that tape on first thing.
It was a shot that right in there.
Then I put the tape in.
And my wife was a little appalled at first, but I'll tell you.
Appalled at what?
At the fact that I want a...
What kind of guy is it?
It gives away porno flicks.
What was wrong with that?
Well, once you watched it for a while, Neil, she loved it.
There you go.
And it changed our lives.
Your show.
So it was great.
Yeah, your lives must be pretty boring if one porno tape changed.
I don't even know how to play a couple of guys on there.
I think I had a ham and hat on.
It was a forum theme, and I'm not sure.
But there's some big individuals there.
Good tape.
Great.
Thank you.
Okay.
See ya.
Boy, oh boy.
Didn't take much to satisfy some of these people.
Literally.
Cutler Ridge is gone by the way, Georgia.
I just thought I'd mention that.
Here's porno.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes?
Hey, I got two things for you.
Why are you screaming?
I'm sorry.
You're shrill, man.
You're freaking.
I got a cold and I didn't want to sound, you know.
Naisel.
Yeah, two nasal.
They don't want to sound plugged.
They're called today.
I got the fungus among us.
Oakland Park and Andrews, there's a great, great animal hospital.
Shank animal hospital.
Oakland Park and Andrews, I'm not going over there.
Well, it's a little out of your way, but I tell you what,
they got a guy that grooms the dogs there.
Wouldn't believe, unbelievable.
What?
He looks good?
Oh, that's a tremendous dog.
Now I'm going.
First I got a woman who's bringing me her 16-year-old son
so I can go straight to jail, and then I'm going to go over to the vet.
I'm going to take my dog over there so I can look at the guy who does the grooming.
Yeah, your dog you walk out with a little pink one.
Yeah, I bet.
He's already got that and not much else, believe me.
Absolutely.
And it's a problem taking a hit.
Funny story for you.
There's a little video store called Beach Video, right?
Where I live in Pompo-no and by right by the beach.
And there was a trainer from Pompo-no Park who ordered four gay porn-o-flicks.
Really?
On Thursday.
Incredible.
So you figure out who that is.
And Vincent's going to kick ass tonight.
I hope so.
Game on, Pally.
See you.
Have a great day.
Bye.
Okay, well, we'll probably ask Wally.
He'll know the answer to that.
By the way, I want to say it again.
If you were watching the driver's showdown at Pompo-no Park last night,
the first week of our eight-week competition was very exciting, very competitive.
Jeff Gregory did a great job.
Wally Hennessey did beat him out.
And I'll say it again, Gary Mills gets two assists.
Just like I got a goal in a hockey game, he gets two assists.
And it'll be interesting to see if Wally can win some races when Gary Mills isn't in the same race
during the rest of the competition.
Here's the Hollywood.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
First time, Collar.
All right.
I live from every day to you.
Everything that you say about people is unbelievably true.
It is.
I cannot believe it.
I'm a very pre-ambicacious guy.
Absolutely.
Correct.
Yes.
We went down a key west in my wife.
You get away from everything.
You did a turn around and come to ride back.
Yeah.
Those people's Canadians are living down there.
It looks like they're packed everywhere.
Well, it's a good place for them.
Yeah, all right.
I'll never go down there.
I've never been there.
I have no interest in going there.
I've got a question.
Well, the comment I had was, you talk about events.
Any service place you go to for anything, your car or anything, they don't know anything?
So what does that mean?
So where do you go then?
You don't go, I don't know.
Every time I try to get worked on or ask somebody a question, they're just, they're a litter.
They don't know.
I really don't know.
Yeah.
I guess you just get it out.
I guess you just ditch your car and maybe just leave your dog in it would be a good idea.
You end up doing it yourself.
Yeah.
All right.
Nice.
That's a good show for the uplifting comment.
Thanks a lot.
See you.
Okay, there's a guy that's got me very optimistic about the future of the human race.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am.
Yeah, I had the same problem with my dog a couple of years ago.
Yeah.
And no veterinarian will ever recommend any type of nutritional therapy for any kind of infectious health.
Oh, you're not going to start pedaling with your dog food, are you?
No, no.
Well, what I started using was calcium ascorbate and it got rid of it in about three days.
I just sprinkled it on his food.
Calcium ascorbate?
Yeah, it's easy on your stomach type of vitamin C.
Yeah.
And it's also the cheapest kind you can get.
You mean like human?
Yeah, human vitamin C.
Dogs make their own vitamin C.
Yeah, but I mean, you need it in large doses to kill an infection, but it works real decent.
And I've used it on my horses.
I've used it.
Really?
Oh, it works.
Calcium ascorbate.
It's about two, three thousand milligrams a day just sprinkling it on his food.
Now, let's think of it as diarrhea.
Because I'm concerned about his ear, but I'm also concerned about my carpets.
Well, no, it might a little bit.
My carpets are a lot more important to me than it's stupid dogs ear.
Yeah, well, I kept my dog inside.
I had to let him out a little more often.
It wasn't uncontrolled.
Well, you had to let him out a little more often, not sounding too good.
But if you don't want a human being takes too much vitamin C, you know what happens immediately, don't you?
Yeah.
But it worked within three days.
Look what it did for a line of his pawling.
The infection started to go.
It stopped dripping.
It stopped having a clean his ears.
And within like a week, he didn't tilt his head anymore because he was in the back.
Oh, yeah, that drives me nuts.
Oh, I know.
They walk on a sideways, and he's kind of side-settled.
He's got a shake his head, and you are.
You know, but anyway, I got rid of it within a week.
Okay, I'll give it a shot.
He's just a bit for everything.
Thanks.
See you.
See you.
Okay.
Why did you get your vet painted yellow?
So if anybody out there has got a problem with a dripping problem, little calcium ascorbate, I got you there.
We'll make it go immediately.
Yeah, leave a note for Aaron on it because a lot of the guys call her show, I've got a dripping problem.
So tell them about two milligrams, two grams of calcium ascorbate every day.
Just sprinkle it out.
It would be good.
And of course, don't forget the one other ingredient that will really make it go over the top.
So look at that.
But this thing is the biggest piece of crap.
I wouldn't wish this piece of equipment on my goddamn little dog.
Get the honey, Junior.
God.
