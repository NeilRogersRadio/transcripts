Hi, this is adult film star Victoria Paris and whenever I'm in Florida I always listen to passion falls with young
summer news talk at entertainment radio 610 W IOD presents the Neil Roger show to talk with Neil call 751 W IOD
and date 524 W IOD in Broward outside the 305 area code it's toll free 1 800 944 W IOD
and I'm just a person called pound IOD at no charge now the Neil Roger show
I got you to use talking entertainment radio 610 W IOD Jimmy Carter is looking for a miracle the former president is trying to push
push in Bosnia and my biggest problem is I own a ball since the 70s revival it's a common scene in many doctors offices
you gotta tell me please why can't I dance well I'm afraid you have white man in
jidus white man in jidus a tragic affliction causing so many to give up trying to get down
the symptoms are easy to spot the inability to snap your fingers or clap your hands
anywhere near the beat of music or singing causes an instant gag reaction to all those standing next to you
oh my god and of course when you're out no one wants to stand next to you
hi guys wait wait up we wish we could say there's hope for white man in jidus
but there is it the only recommended course of action in rhythmic abstinence
well there must be something you can do no just stop what you're doing you're embarrassing that hell out of us
at 1007 a W I do you're welcome and happy Tuesday to you man we're gonna be burning it today I'll guarantee you that
just like what's his name Warren sap and James Stewart they were burning a few
I mean how smart do you have to be like go for a drug test this is your big chance in life
you're gonna be a big star in an NFL baby you're gonna make millions of dollars and now you got to go to your drug test
of course you don't really make any difference because as it says later in the article here in the paper
it says well testing positive for drugs does not prevent a player from entering the league it just makes them look like a real dummy
which we knew in the first place anyway so the u.m. scandal continues everybody who goes through that nut house
that crap factory over there is just another piece of walking to it and like I said what are they gonna do now
what's Deon gonna do when all these other hot shots now that they banned the schmattas from the NFL
are you aware of that that this coming season they have banned all those banned Danas and schmattas and all that stuff
even wellie Nelson's pithed off about it he not too happy so how are they gonna have that same old spirit without wearing
M schmattas I don't get it now we're gonna zip through these calls today man like Grant took Richmond hello
hello yes sir I shot when he the pool yeah okay you sound like you're full of it too man he shot when he the pool
alright speaking of who shot when he the pool that thing yesterday the one point that nobody wants to talk about
because all they're watching is whether airfully Bailey is as brilliant as everybody said or Mark Ferman is gonna crumble under the pressure
and start making racist comments the thing about him talking and walking at 5 30 in the morning in the middle of June in LA
and I don't care what anybody says it's just not that light out at 5 30 in the morning in the middle of the summertime anywhere
and from a distance from yards away he spies this small spec above the I said spec above the door handle on a Bronco
and he goes over to further investigate and has to use his flashlight to look like inside it's so dark that he can't see inside
but it's light enough so that from yards away he can see this little spec which turns out to be blood above the door handle
is anybody buying it WIOD yes sir I wanted to ask you a question yes I've ever been to St. Louis very briefly very briefly
I want to go I'm going to go this weekend to see the arch yeah yeah you're going to go to see the arch
once you just go to McDonald's and say a lot of money man to same damn arch it's just bigger there's nothing to see man
going to middle of the summertime when humanity's about 140 percent it's a swerveering it's a festering you'll have a great time there
what's the second question I've ever been asked no I have not been down under yeah okay any chance any place you get to go man from here just grab it don't pass the chance
I'll fly and I'll do it I love you okay I have a great time paly there's a guy that's a smart guy he's getting out of here
let's get these phones cracking baby or we're shutting that transmitter off at about two and a half minutes and we're going into that
uncle Niels music and calls show that's the new format uncle Niels music and calls that business you people pulled here yesterday
and then I had to come in here this morning it's Tuesday so you know the maid comes on Tuesday I get in here real early
and this place man was like a morgue the phone was dead as a door nail Rick is sitting here looking at suds
he's looking at Bokobrion they're looking at the ceiling they're looking down at their puppet
and we had to go through like a herniotic thing just to get some of these bastards off their dead ass if you think we're going to sit here and settle for this
you're probably right I'll tell you that right now and also speaking of Vegas speaking to go in somewhere good the Vegas trip is on
it's definite I spoke to Bob link colon yesterday and he also tells me that that Hank thing is a real ripoff so if you want to get sucked into that
Hank thing for 600 bucks and stay off on that side street there at the Hilton so he can plunge his brains out at the sports book
you go right ahead baby and it's on the 12th of May it leaves on a Friday comes back on a Monday that's the Hank Goldstein trip on QAM
if you want to pay 600 bucks if you want to pay 489 and go with us on June 15th on a Thursday night leaving Thursday and coming back on Sunday in the afternoon

like me and go out there and do a whole bunch of things and have a great time at a good price 489 bucks per person complete also there are

room or the it's the Alta Cocker flights if you want to be out there with all the people with their teeth in a glass that's the
flight to be on don't miss it 12 past 10 at W I O D W I O D we hired the best programming consultants in the
business and then told them to go to hell get push some time that life is passing me by some time
I feel like life is passing me by when I listen to your show it just makes me smile when I listen to your show

music I thought the music and calls was we play the music on this and they're playing the music on and that's good
okay every line of date and brow it is wide open 751 W I O D and date 524 and I've I got a believe
seriously I said direct this morning and I wasn't joking I don't think the transmitter is on I
think whatever calls we're getting are just a few loyal people who have no life whatsoever and are just calling out
a force of ram it I don't think the guy that I'm stationed is on the year the last two days I got Friday
off for that you and basketball game which was a real piece of crap and then here we are again yesterday
the worst the not just an ordinary Monday and not only that then I leave here and I discover that it's raining cats
and dogs out there usually on rainy days what else are they going to do going to go out and play golf
are they going to play tennis are they going to grab their balls and go out and do something with them I don't think so
and by the way Brian at least cigars ears are killing me man these are the worst oh talk about tearing up your throat
we got about 1500 tickets left for the Buffalo Panthers game at the arena tonight 730 we'll see you there
get in your seat early right at least by eight o'clock would be good we're only like almost at the end of the first period

consideration oh give me a break will you you're talking about this rich
southern kid that they don't his brother traded him away to Tampa Bay and even
they didn't want him yeah I'm just wondering why the least sock man I watched part of
that game last night that was another embarrassing performance they couldn't
stick it in an empty net and they're getting 41 shots on goal they stink they got
there's no there is no there's no team there are no consistent lines there's no
nothing they screwed up the chemistry of a great team that was in the final four
two years in a row right and as much as I like Matt Sundine this team without
Wendell Clark it'll a favor Bob Rouse and this team has got no balls it just a
bunch of riddly is out there and then my crank is out there for two minutes and
Dixon Ward whose belongs in Montgomery Ward this they screwed up a just they
remind me of the station man they screwed up a good thing there's no continuity
that's right right what about this other kid there are 500 team and they look like crap
yeah you know you're getting 41 shots on goal and you only put one puck in the
net yeah and they had 40 on Saturday and you only scored two goals they can't they
can't finish something's wrong where about this new kid Jim Kerry with well you
don't play for the main belief he plays for Washington yeah I'm great he's coming
to town on Thursday yeah and I think we're in a heck of a lot of trouble here
just can I got news for a mister we're in the heck of a lot of trouble no matter
who's coming to town if Roger Nielsen doesn't discover that you got to score
some goals to win a game you can't keep playing hard for an Ottawa every game
but the only real team that we beat all season was Boston the two games up
there got their little rank because we got them frustrated as hell and they
and put him into a coma including Fred Q6 and we're never going to be playing
in the garden again that was the last game will ever play in Boston garden
you're going to play in the shaman center next year and and that's it that's
the only real team we've beaten all year well I'm everybody's all excited oh we
won three in a row we're doing it with this this team can put you to sleep man
they got to start waking up and playing some real hockey they do I mean Roger's
idea of offensive power is the joke is a joke just I bet you the most the best
team in the league for icing and and it's going to come back and haunt them
nobody wants to see that okay no that's why you know the town in this crowd is
comatose to begin with but you put him into that arena and see the kind of
hockey we've been playing in here lately and you can hear a pin drop and I can't
blame those people what are you going to get excited about it's minor league
bush league it's minor league and let's open up and stick some in here tonight you
got it well let's hope for and let's see what happens Thursday okay okay
now look to us we needed open line of days seven five one two and
proud five this is the day man either you people are going to get off your dead
ass or we're going to go to all music starting tomorrow giren damn tea of that
even though they stole most of my CDs back there we got we got thousands of
hours of incredible crap back there this is the deadest yesterday and today I
have never seen this town it's usually dead but there is something in the
drinking water there is something in the year they got nothing I asked that thing
about about this the damn old J thing that they're allegedly all worked up
about and about how can Mark Firmann see this little speck of blood in the
almost in the dark at 5 30 in the morning from several yards away and nobody
wants to talk about that that they got all the answers all the experts out
there and by the way speaking of all those people defending OJ on the other
hand Mary Ann Gurchis guess what they're not going to use her now they were
showing some of the opening statements again yesterday and remember we're
Johnny and his cock and his up there telling the jury oh well we got eyewitnesses
first we got Rosalope and he starts talking to China about that crazy old bitch
and of course we all know that they're not going to use that video tape because
they were embarrassed as hell and then there's another woman her name is Mary
Ann Gurchis and he says a very interesting lady yeah she's a very interesting
lady alright she's a flake she's a maniac she's a nutcase a very interesting so
interesting they decided that they're not going to use her to testify because
she's too busy writing bad checks and being a flake and a fruitcake and making
crank calls Mary Ann Gurchis this is the this is the case they got is the
did the for the defense they got two crazy old women who all of a sudden are
seeing the Virgin Mary on a pop up to a tortilla and that's it so they're in
big trouble man I don't care what you say and if they just got like one more
white person on that jury they might have a chance of getting conviction but I
doubt it here's Miami on a purple line hello it sounds like whatty to me we
have an open line on the cell line pound I OD here's Miami hello okay
hey let's talk about those hard-stricting panties man yeah they're hot oh man
I'm so proud of them yeah and our number one I'm gonna go to nice game and then
Brian screw last last night you said if you see some booze from tonight's game it's
got to a hockey stick or the whole defense did he yeah where do you say that
in our five sixty do we carry them they had brand screwed on out saying that if
he hears booze he's gonna throw his stick in a crack why does he go out there and
do something for crying all out Brian screw lids been sticking the joint out all
he does get a lot of stupid penalties yeah really go out there and stick it in
the net Brian don't stick it in the stand stick it in the net would be a good idea
what's that you're gonna beat tonight same one is always there 125 goodbye I'll
give you a big kiss okay goodbye open line and date 7519463 you got some
nerfed crowd chewing the fans out Brian screw Lynn you piece a third man you don't
do anything this man he can't skate he can't pass he can't stick it in that he
just gets a lot of really stupid penalties that cost us a lot of games is what
he does basically he's the captain the C stands for choke here's Hollywood hello
how you doing sir yes sir listen because the guy to call before about fill show
yesterday it wasn't a guy was an old bag I mean a woman all the way to yeah he
was absolutely right that fill was I was in it out of the car all day yesterday
and he took very few calls I don't know if you took any call yesterday you know I
want to tell you how bad it was here yesterday okay he came on here he said to
me as I was leaving he said I'm gonna do a thing I'm gonna just do dead air and
see how long I can let it go before somebody for the first ten minutes and for
the first ten minutes this man left dead air and I think you only got like three
calls with dead air yeah he was going how one of five to be right right and then he
would answer it like he was doing the switchboard you know I mean I'm serious we
must either be going out of business here and Bob Greens walking around here I
might actually share funny you know a patching around in the control room instead of
taking care of business this place man is on death's door or something I don't
know what's going on here with this audience I think our whole audience died or
got sabotaged well that's why you you go to the market call from the Q.A.M.
people all I had a bit with a guy about Rush Limbaugh like they're fooling me
okay they're trying to pump up Rush Limbaugh they can't pump up anymore he's
gonna burst for crying out loud who the hell are they kidding the audiences had
three years in this town to hear his crap they don't want to hear it plain

of myself God I know I had a rough day but this is unbelievable then he gets
some Julio on there oh babooie how it is I mean it's just it's it's amazing

a kill in the cold a kill in the cold a kill in the cold here's the lady mobile in lighthouse point hello
hello yes ma'am um listen kneel yes i just have a real problem with these people taken over in my
amie and with these people taking over my amie who are these people in her home talking about you
address them quite frequently who are these people well the people from Cuba the Haitians uh
foreigners the foreigners okay when are they coming to town foreigner yeah well you know what
yeah well sounds as cold as ice listen yeah uh so what does that mean taking over let me tell you
something when people move out you know why the whole area right up the street here at 79th in
biscayne you know why that area is the way it is today because everybody else moved out that's why
no because we have weak representation no it's got nothing to do with representation of anything
it's got to do with people running away and moving out okay and moving up to places like a plantation
acres way out west there well which by the way it's pretty nice there yeah believe it i like it but a small
solution to something that i read it and guess what if you think you're going to move away from anything
go out of the saw grass mall which is right next door to my house and you'll find every foreigner
who's ever been born nobody in their speaks of the ingles so what are you talking about well this
is a small solution that i came up with i read it in an article it's great cater to them there

them available to those of you who have a desire to be as handsome as i am with the van sustrin
school of beauty girls are you troubled by those full luscious lips in the center of your face
well here's our simple method for correcting that problem just take a look at some of our first

the man sustrin school of beauty help remove those ugly scabs from my face and put them back on
my legs where they belong and remember girls if it's the harry worried about there's plenty of
italics to go around i love it and of course the timing could be better because we heard from
red of on brown only uh... moments ago in a last hour that disgusting smelly german bitch
now i will confess yes i do have many prejudices but when it comes to germans that i put very up high
on the list i'm not saying that there aren't some nice german people i haven't met too many but i'm
sure in fact when i was a little kid we had germans their name was shults lived right on the corner
next door to our house those shults as they had a even their little dog was an ozzi i'm serious
they had a little nasty uh what they'll kind of a dog was it a German shepherd no no little
dog little like kind of like tiny only a more obnoxious if that's possible a little white dog and
that he would bark out and it would sound like seagulls you could you could hear it in a barking
the dog was trained to be a god damn not saying used to put his paw at a 45 degree angle up in the
air as you would come outside and make anti-semitic slurs because we happen to be and the people
live next door to us their name was flyshire which is a very Jewish name and it was a very uncomfortable
thing when you stay have those rallies out there in the street corner boy it's too bad that pat
you can't it wasn't around then and rick riley here's plantation acres on the purple line hello

minor towards the end of a shift while that man's in the penalty box can we make a line change
well when he meets in their make a line change i mean it stops play of course you make a line
change they do it right when that penalty is assessed again well the guy doesn't just go into
penalty box in the game keeps going on they stop play right right generally when there's a penalty
when the one team gets the power play another team is short handed there's always almost always a
shift change because you know you want to put on your penalty killers and they want to put on
their big line if they're not out there already okay that ain't okay we have an open line on

yeah
to hack the wire
yeah
hack the wire man
how come i made oh jay so black yeah but
huh 1117 and w.w.w.w. here's a very disturbing fact it says dear Neil i have a deep dilemma
that chronic Greg from pompano slash boy and b2 keeps faxing wallet and trying to call your show
and is over at q a m and dragged me along with him on sunday uh has got a crush on me and keeps
trying to hit on me right during the uh show at q a m he tried to penetrate me right in front of
the talk show host feel atman it was a very embarrassing event and i don't know what to do about it
all my friends are discussing this although i'm quite attracted him and perhaps may allow him to do
it next time he tries what do you think your friend andi in bonna venture you think andi should
get together with gregg maybe that might work out their frustrations together
we probably have some penetrating thoughts on this here's a pig report of mobile in western hello
hey good morning Neil yes sir pigs are out and bowed on tablet club that's it sound club road in
western yes that's it thank you so much sir take care i have a great day bye bye
open line at brown art five two four nine four six three so maybe we can get some kind of like
advice to the lovelor in the comments from our audience out here for andi and gregg
obviously are having a far-dare parting of the ways or not maybe they're having a meeting of the
minds a meeting of the meat here's my me beach hello hello yeah yes i am i'm very disturbed you know
that that obviously that bitch that called up about the Germans you know i was a POW in germany
ever shut down and uh believe me that that you've got to be careful when they smile boy watch out
boy yeah watch out be honest with you that i was in berlin once and i never saw anybody smile
well they felt very confident they smile but believe me they they don't like it
they they may think that we're good and they tell us how good we are what do you mean us
either the Jews or the american well i could do that yeah well i you know the man i was a
Jew in germany in POW camp and believe me it was not comfortable yeah anyways about uh that's
what andi from bonniventure city said it was not comfortable oh yeah you know about uh oh jay
what the stirris me is i think he is guilty but however there's no blood there's no lot of blood
around him me what where is all his clothes in a bag somewhere you have to ask out callings about
that it's in the bag man yeah well as the bag man killed in the coliol i don't know i i doubt very
much of he could do it that fast because what do you mean if he had a shovel and a big plastic sack in
the uh bronco why is it unreasonable to believe that he had a duffel bag well that's possible
yeah yeah that's possible that he had a change when he was driving back because there's very short
time frame right between the act and when he was back to his house in the in the limousine right
about 15 minutes yeah well that's you know that's a 20 minutes to clean up you know yeah they must have
been blood all over this well there was a bloody sock upstairs he kind of left a little trail you
know he went outside and he tried to bury the he tossed the glove and he went into a panic and
then he ran inside and by that time he'd obviously taken all the stuff off and the tossed the sweater
whatever he was wearing in the sack yeah well you know that also the tossing the glove that that
that's no sense i mean what the hell i mean he didn't toss it he just to probably dropped it
you think he really dropped it he dropped it or who down those what he did because that's that's
the stirris me i know i know he's guilty but you know how do you get these facts together that's
i think that's going to be a problem he's going to get off anyway so i don't worry about he's
going to he's going to walk you right yeah and then he's going to run like a son of a bitch trust me
well he's going to make a lot of money he always could run like hell even with those bad
arthritic knees you watch him run yeah he's going to make a lot of money too much damn thing in
the book you'll have a movie he'll have his own god damn show he'll be bigger than Jenny Jones
i'll tell you that's right in this well have a great day amigo thanks a lot see
yeah we have an open line in day seven five one i mean guys Jewish and i'm calling them amigo it's
they county it's part of the ambiance here and all you Cuban haters man call up sandy patens
you'll be glad to have your call and she'll probably reinforce everything you like everything
you want to say man she'll repeat it boy oh boy some of these people that just keep harboring this
this this bitter this have a nice day exactly sandy lovely lady you tell them bitch let's talk about
sandy paint in a while okay and about how all the people that worked here including Roger McElan
and Mike Reneerie they probably wouldn't admit it now because they're over there with her on on
waxy on waxy junior but boy when she was here they hated that bitch like the producers hated her
the engineers hated her because on the air she came up with this real sweet sugar coated
phony image but in person fact the only person that liked her was a sharel was the only person
to build an actor and that's because jabs of a feather go shopping together so 11 22 at wio
there's no reason 16 wio d listen longer and you'll get an attitude too don't
then listen and i would jump in front of a bullet from the cold
oh
oh
but the the um
that night when she turned off all the lights there's no place where she could hide
oh no oh jay was gonna get hurt oh jay went out to kill her oh jay went out to kill her oh jay
went out to kill her oh jay went out to kill her oh that night one day the jury's gonna set free
oh jay
bro we know he's gonna head you're with me oh yeah
and oh jay's gonna get you
you've heard it's true oh jay is gonna come after you
and then he'll get away with that one too oh yeah oh jay's gonna get you
oh jay's gonna get you oh jay's gonna get you oh jay's gonna get you oh
oh jay's gonna get you one night
are you
unreal
I'll kill the cold
I'll kill the cold
Are you?
Are you sure?
I'm going to get you
I'm going to get you
I'm going to get you tonight
OK, I love it 28 and WI.
We got a little dilemma here because I guess Mark Furman, the German, is going to be back on a witness stand today before he takes off for Northern Idaho.
It's really interesting by the time the trial is over, Rosaló Pez will be in El Salvador, Mary Ann Gurches who will not even testify, she'll have a race in the federal prison somewhere.
Mark Furman, he'll be in North Idaho with the area nation.
And of course, oh, Jay, he slipped out again.
Jay, we forgot about him.
We're trying to keep track just like when he was in the house that day.
Remember that famous day in Vegas?
We're all out there on our Vegas trip last year.
You know, something it was our trip with Bob Lincoln to Vegas that incited this entire event to take place.
It was the inspiration for America for the OJ business was our trip to Vegas.
And I'm sitting there in my room sick as a dog and I turn on the TV and there's this car chase up and down the freeway.
And I said, what the hell is that?
Where's Piggit?
There's the freeway.
And it just went on and on and back and forth.
And then the next day we had the thing at Bobby Shapiro was in there and he's making this plea.
Oh, oh, Jay, give yourself up.
What's this all about?
Come out of my house.
It was a beautiful thing.
And here we are months and months and months later and we're still, so I don't know what I'm going to do when Eddam things starts.
Because Eiffelie Bailey is going to be grilling him again.
They say that Eiffelie might actually take a little oxygen because his performance yesterday was a little on the stale side.
Here's what Bob Shapiro said.
Here's plantation.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing, buddy?
Pretty good, sir.
Hey, I factually last night because I'm going to be at the Panthers game tonight and usually during the daytime, you know, I lay tile and marble.
It's real hard to call you, but you lay pipe during the daytime, you know.
Yeah, I lay pipe in the daytime also.
I believe it.
But besides that tonight I've come by and check you out at the game, you know, because I've been wanting to come to the game and see you.
And I'm a loyal listener, you know, I'm only 23, but I listen to you every day at work and I just think it shows the greatest and need to wake this city up, man.
That's right. They need a goddamn animos what they need.
They need a blueberry anima.
They would know definitely if that came around for a wall because they need something.
They need somebody to squeeze their bag tight, hard and fast.
There's nothing like tight, hard and fast. Believe me.
You know, and I've come tonight and I'm going to come say hello to you with my girlfriend and I'm going to be very rudy.
You know, show it's Florida, what it's all about at the game.
All right. All right.
So you have a good day and see you tonight.

all afternoon or maybe not here's a facts from somebody i love the ones where
they don't put any name on it but i'll be at the game but anyway what section
you sit in and where will you be and can i take a look at it and how big is it
p s did you hear the good news this is the best news of ever all your french
Canadians who are listening out there get ready just like Jackie Gleason would
say you're going to the moon baby frogs can reproduce in outer space
so all the frogs are going in outer space we're putting them in a gigantic time capsule
and sending them into space and guess what the air is free
where the hell is that damn thing are we never going to find that that honey
monor sting that Jackie Gleason with the bobbit god damn everything as soon as we
find that they take it away from us again let's do a Miami hello
hey Neil this is a young Cuban and nearly in Miami
all right a miracle out of the closet baby and into the streets by the way that lady that
German lady sounded kind of sexy i wanted to see if Georgia traced her phone number to give her a call
yes she said she likes cheese
hey Neil i wanted to talk about a martyramans testimony yesterday yes sir
the reason why he needed to lie a little bit was because they were supposed to be there for
notification now for investigation investigation or palpitation or masturbation right because
they jumped offence because after he saw the blood they thought that there might be a victim inside
and they didn't wait for the search warrant so right it's also interesting that he he just
just went around the corner to look at the at the other gate but the the spec of blood was on
the street side of the uh of the uh broncos and yet to be in the street um to see that side of
the broncos but still i they're just lying about a procedural investigating a prognol policy rather
than guilt yeah i think uh oh jay is guilty to begin with guilty itself but he'll walk he will walk
so let everybody worried about see everybody we know he's guilty number one and all the people
who want to apologize for him and make an excuse is even though the evidence is overwhelmed
i mean keep it mine they haven't even come close to gated the blood evidence yet to the
dna and the rna and the spc a they haven't even come close to that that that's right but i have
a feeling that that jury is just uh if they say that uh superman uh committed the murders and
floor out of there that's why he didn't leave uh any uh footprint uh they say you see that's it
that that's the reason it was superman and he's not guilty so whatever i think Clark can't
was there on the night that's what marie and gritchis said all right Neil have a great day of me go
ask the cameo v just see you we have an open line and date seven five one nine four six three there
was a young spick right there man there was a good guy right there on the phone who comes out of
the closet isn't embarrassed like Jose where is Jose god if i could find Jose right now my next

stick with the pasta okay thank you but we have two open lines and date seven five one and one on a
purple pound line at pound iod all i had to do is mention oj and mark firm in a right away they start
getting nervous because it's getting close to noon time they're starting to rearrange their lives
now and as i was saying to rick this morning you know i keep blaming the women which we have very
few women callers anyway on a whole radio station so what's the logic in that they're ain't none
i keep saying well it's the women in this oj thing if it's only the women then how come a 95
percent of our callers are male and they're all disappearing too every day like yesterday it was
weak okay it was a bad Monday for everybody here but it was really weak as soon as the god damn
eftley baili started cross examining mark firm and you you can just watch the phone and see
what these people are doing so don't lie to me and tell me that you don't care and you're not
watching it you're watching every god damn second your whole life revolves around it this is
another closet past time in america it's not just a Greg and Andy up there are doing each other
up there in the bon event you're aware of it is that they're in the closet right now doing
each other playing little grab ass with their radio cranked up real out getting sexual excitement
from the good vibrations that's not bad enough but we have all these closet oj watchers
and when you get the small dish by the way you'll be in heaven because it's on court tv it's on cnn
it's on e it's on a it's on i it's on oh it's on you it's it's on like a half a dozen different
channels constantly so when cnn goes to commercial have no fear just slipped down from two o2 to
two o3 next channel over there's court tv and you get to see Fred Graham with his white here at
no extra charge here's hollywood hello hey nil yes sir nil two thoughts on what did you think about
that kaya yocho first of all the the crowd they were saying was like a million an hour i wasn't
invited so i didn't go there no but here's here's the thing that i thought was most amazing is
that there was like one girl got cracked on the head with a bottle somebody was throwing it
yeah and there was like thirty seven arrests which to me is like an incredibly low number considering
all the but wise there was slosh and around that's right while you deal with some very civilized
people well i don't know that part of the other part when i get pissed off they just you know drop
a bomb somewhere that's all they don't go around shooting people yeah well i'm just saying that
though that number of people okay a pipe bomb here in there like maybe in your mail box you know
the other thing is that have you any comments on what the state has got
with their sentencing guidelines that they've just reduced some of these things like pretty
incredible like if you have one second a person convicted of grand theft with six prior felony
convictions including aggravated assault yeah are you okay one year county jail maximum
mm-hmm what's your thoughts on that what's my thoughts on it yeah what do you want me to give you
my thoughts and what is there to think well i mean what do you want you kind of a question
that what are my thoughts on that our rapes convicted in three separate arm sexual
batteries yeah arm he gets what a half half an hour in there i mean if i can
well they don't want them doing danger the other inmates think we have cut it as close to the
bone as we possibly can there you go there's your governor man how about two counts of how
about free drugs for every politician sounds good to me well even at that okay check it out with
Warren's app have a rate day pali just locked the door from the inside we have an open line
of pride he wants me to try to rationalize what's going on out there i'm not going to do it it's
it's in the sick it's sick i say lock newt gingrich up is what i say i think it's free for all time
lock up newt gingrich stromthurmond jesse helms William danemire and of course that god damn
Pete Wilson the governor of california is turned out to be the biggest racist fascist bigoted pig at
history of mankind there's a real good one for you man they always talk about how liberal and
radical california's see california is a mix of the far right and the far left and those are all
confused in between and those who don't give a crap because it's who busy fighting gang wars

is here's point and beach hello hello nil yes sir hi i was listening to your show today and it's great
i could agree with you more about deont sander's and more in sap and most of the things that you say
why don't these guys cut this crap up and they're the worst rule models and they make people
and people are laughing at them they are laughing at them and i don't care if they're laughing all
the way to the bank these guys are crap they're crap on legs well they glamorize them on tv and then
they can't exactly that's right just like they're glamorizing this demo j-thing everything that's sick
and twisted and disgusting they glamorize and then everybody wants to be just like them well it comes
down to this if anyone's not getting a fair trial it's the state because these lawyers keep pulling
more and more crap over on people and uh... he's probably gonna walk which is really sad
yeah i overheard well i was to show you if you have ten million bucks you can go out and kill a few
people too get away with it uh... well as i'm holding notice you were mentioned in uh... uh... people
well said yeah what specifically don't you like about
the fact that he's breathing that that's for a good start he is the most
bigoted the most racist the most homophobic the most right wing the most the biggest piece of
turd i have ever seen in my life he makes ed davis who at least the so i got ed davis at least
that came around a little bit he got very goldwater syndrome you mean one proposition one of you said
every pro everything that he comes down with man is it comes from a big it all he does is appeal to
bigotry he's perfect for the republican party in the nineties man he's just a full-fledged
card carrying bigot do you disagree with the position when he's ever yes i do
why in other words these kids shouldn't get an education what are they gonna do they're legal
they don't belong in the country they know something i don't i don't agree with our whole
immigration policy but that's a federal thing the state hasn't got a right to just say well we're
just uh... screw these people and we're just going to ignore them and then they go out and we can
have like five hundred more gangs all over california that's a way to solve the problem
they should carton right over the fence that's what they should do they don't belong just like
and for the same exact problem card them over the fence our tax dollars are paying for a legal
immigrants to get free hospital care and education so forth which most working people can't afford
themselves something wrong with that yeah and you disagree with that disagree with what i just
got to say in the immigration policy sucks it's a joke and what are you going to do make up your
own immigration policy now what would you do i would go to the news right now
so we fire people so what news talk and entertainment radio

at w i o d we have an open line on the green line house oh j doing baby the game is on game on
there we go okay won't be long now but this long here's westchester hello
hello yes sir hey nia how you doing good listen i mentioned i heard you mentioned something
about your dog getting out from underneath the fence this morning yeah no exactly what you're
talking about i got a call last night about three thirty in the morning waking the dead in my house
and uh telling me my dog is out in the middle of sunset of course i live right on sunset dry nice
yeah exactly i like to put my dog out in the middle of sunset right in rush hour would be a good idea
well you know my first mistake was i going to chase after the dog here i am at three thirty in the
morning no showed about thirty pounds overweight yeah couldn't find my shoe chasing after this little
dog i couldn't find so i uh decided to go back and get my bicycle look around for
well if i couldn't find a dog for about uh about an hour i decided to return home well i'm put
pulling my bike into the uh gate what do i find is stupid little dog is in step back inside the gate
oh yeah they always do that that's what my dog does if you just ignore him if you chase him he
just keeps going if we just ignore him and threaten the pain of attention he comes running back
you just leave the door open he runs back in the house well you know i'm getting a little nervous
once the dog gets about two or three blocks away i figured i get nervous is why i seem coming back
in the direction of the house i get very nervous yeah well i figured their brains are so small that
once he gets two three blocks away probably wouldn't find his way back no chance but if it wasn't
for the kid i'd tell you i would have let that dog just run in the damn street but i'm play have a
good time if he lives great and if not uh you pack him a sandwich right exactly i got three you
know i got three more i know the thing uh well you know the people that put your fences in when i
bought my house and i spent a lot of money to put a big beautiful wooden fence in there and they did
generally speaking a pretty good job however they really and i you know you tell them i have they
can see you got two dogs one's a big one which you don't have to worry about one's a very tiny little
dog that weighs about ten pounds you have to make sure that every one of those slats is down
into the ground not not several inches above the ground not an inch above the ground but down flush
like right into the ground so the dog can't dig his the way and i'm going to tell you every few
months he finds another spot i take boulders i take rocks i take every damn thing that's ever been
invented and then a few months later he finds another guy damn spot where they did a crappy job
sure well i did that you know i went and i bought my my bags of sand and i put them all along the
fence and then the association now for creek association decides they're going to dig a pipeline
right behind my fence yeah nice force with trench when they fill it back in they must have left
ten new new gaps of holes with this dog can get out beautiful like you said every time i fill one
in the dog gets out from from another damn hole yeah so what i what i have to do now is i get i
lock the damn small dogs into so small i have to lock them up in the cat box in the cat box and i
tell you a little about half hour in a microwave is always a good idea not with it turned on
necessarily but just as kind of a warning i don't think he'll do it again yeah well you know i
kind of got improvement in this damn dog if i leave him out of the doesn't get out he barks all
freaking night yeah okay well good luck to pal okay okay back to you we have an open line
and date seven five one one and brown or five two four all our friends with their little dog
he stories like me it's one of those things you know it's one of the one of the problems of having
a little dog if you have a big dog then everybody looks at it and they're proud if you have a little
dog people laugh at it here's a bokeh hello hi Neil yes yeah i was talking about uh we just
said about Pete Wilson and Mark firm and how they're racist right i don't know that Mark firm
is a racist that's a lead Pete firm and Pete firm and i know i mean uh Pete Wilson well what a
Freudian slip that was Pete Wilson is a racist that a bigot and he appeals to all the worst these
kind of like a Ronald Reagan with the memory well it appears to me that you're racist because you
call these you know the spags the daggers and all that right i'm a racist because we're using
that to make a point sir are you too stupid to understand that you're just a corksucker yeah you're
just a cork hole man you cork liquor we have an open line and night you know who that is by the way
that's uh your buddy again you know just because we brought you guys out of the closet i guarantee
that Greg and Andy are doing each other right now well it's almost Wednesday tomorrow is hump day
let's go to a Miami hello yes sir uh i'm an immigration attorney here in town i just want to say
i think all these people are cut off you're an immigration attorney yes yeah i think all these
people want to cut off illegal aliens from benefits or morons yeah simply because i don't
understand what they want why because they would put you that would put you that would put you out
of business is that why i don't you go and defend like real americans and do something for people
who are like like uh like oh jay go out there and make some serious money i think these people are
outrageous they're saying that they what do they mean they're outrageous what's wrong with taking care
of your own people first we can't take care everybody in the god damn world is desperate should we
bring in all the people here from ethereum from bosnia hurts the govina and everywhere in the god damn
world where they're starving and killing each other i like these people think of the cost of labor
going up in this town what if we have right let's keep good cheap labor let's keep bringing in
illegal aliens so lawyers like you shisters can keep making money defending them and they can keep
taking american people's jobs and we can keep exploiting people at slave labor get out of here you
creep just what we need is another god damn lawyer what was that about a 12 year old lawyer he's a
lawyer like i'm a damn brain surgeon go back to new york use slime ball bastard we have an open
line in uh... day seven five one on the green line one eight hundred nine four four how though jay
doing well game off game off it can't be long now man can't be too far so just stay tuned well
we'll give you a good look at this a good dose here's lotter day lake sell out yeah no i just
happened to uh... be listening to your show and then i had to get out of my car but while i was
listening on uh... um... hold here i happen to think that there's uh what's called an electric
that you can get for a small dog like that because they do have a tendency to turn around and it's
like that they put a special collar on the dog and then until all very low voltage
wire that they can't have a hybrid did you know if you don't like your dog i guess i would work
anyway uh... the reason why i call this to the well one thing that i want to tell you another
thing they're trying to make i think uh... don't you know uh... national celebrity at the uh...
really both fight thirty-night they were showing jack nickles and and a number of other
actors and celebrities and then they also showed down to you we need some help
so you know everybody got a big thrill out of the end on to our
yeah but the reason why i call you since it's you know my spot
exactly but it only depends on what direction that you're going
mm-hmm uh... but the reason why i call this just as i got out of the car i heard you talking about
california and somebody had told me once that california is like a granola bar if you take
out all the fruits and that's all you know that's older than that's older than my great great-great-grandmother
well maybe we got a few words and notes maybe we got some young listeners i don't
i don't i don't know i've been to california and you doesn't impress me anymore than sub-floor
that uh...
oh now you're dreaming there
you're dreaming no california at least is got to agree with you i absolutely
not well for you i'm not talking about living there but just in terms of the people there at least in
california got a few million people
that they got an IQ bigger than their jox eyes florida manage just a bunch of uh...
retards and uh...
you know rubber rafters and uh... mister it's about like maybe maybe 15% of the people in florida
got like some intelligence and the rest of the people here are moron i got to agree with you
to the point where this this this state is uh... this state is a thousand years behind the behind
the stone age maybe that's why i get along so well with people up north
yeah or maybe that's why you're fit in so well here we have an open line and date seven five one
one and brown or five two four one on the green line one eight hundred nine see their draping off
now like flies we have sustained a tremendous a euphoric and incredible level of activity around
his phones today not too many good calls but nonetheless and then of course they're trying to
suck me into getting into a serious thing about immigration and illegal aliens and peat davis and
they would know peat wilson from a re wilson these people how's oj do i
okay no no cost of panic just stay calm we'll tell you when to start screaming
here's candle hello male yes this is an argentinian nearly when is this first time caller

like yesterday after he asked he asked him uh... how come you were asking uh...
kiddo for the keys to the bronco we said i never asked him for the keys okay it's so that time
your honor let's go home and let the jury think about that about that lie
speaking of having a good memory let's test now first of all remember how they lie to you when
they come in and they buy a station and they say oh we're not going to change anything your job is
safe what was the guy's name don't tell me i'll give me a clue who was doing the morning show on hot 105
and he uh... when they came in when this company bought hot 105 they said have no fear you're safe with us we love your show and
it's an he did this
he left the job man running up and down courts of the young man wearing really tight
mower what a mammary man when they jump but when i heard how bad this was
all done by the media
is another way
where my man
it's time again for some
way and be
can't wait to watch a more
way and be
they think it's all gonna watch a play
oh i'm so happy that it's
the ball it's time again for some
way and be
okay
can't wait to watch a more
way and be
so to make a long story short they lied that they have everybody in the building knew they were lying they hated them like
poison they blew his ass out of here then they gave Rodney the morning show who was doing real great they
lied to him and they said hey you're doing a great job Rodney and they uh... they kicked his ass into like uh... doing some
funky thing and brought in time the fly jock joiner
who is gonna have one of the worst shows in the history of the human race that is the most embarrassing show
i'm embarrassed for the people who listen to the time joiner show if there are any
the worst so mallow he's gone
and why did i play that other than the kill like two minutes that was a good idea
here's a mobile in my me hello hello yes sir

something about it and give you a good one open line on the green line
yeah anyway listen you know i'm an attorney
yes i i stop practicing probably two years ago practice makes perfect that's right
because there's nothing i hate worse than than than the field of law in this town
and boy did that guy sound like a jerk yeah uh...
they use another he's another ira kruzban he's another guy who's making a living
forcing foisting illegal aliens onto this country and uh... creating hardships for the american citizen
absolutely and all this money is going to pay them and now they're yelling and screaming
that they have to uh... get citizens now they're running to get citizenship status
and complaining saying well we've been residents for ten twenty years and we paid our taxes but why do we have to become citizens
you know as far as i recall his ban is concerned i thought we just went through that
whole business we've been sent to dot ring jimmy carter over there to hatey and though we got
the the goofball back into power well how come everybody's not going back

i mean you can't one of those things you can't stop looking at that thing on her look it's so big
non-sensical allegations that they that they've brought out the Kathleen Jones uh and others uh
of her ilk her then it will be denied because it is indeed false and they know that and they should
that means they reasonably and they're calling you know when you come right down to it this
defense with all the money he's spending they're doing a one crappy ass job and they were saying
yesterday which is absolutely correct sir and man and anybody else that when she does her closing
statement to the jury in about fifty five months if we ever live that long that she's gonna
they might even show the videotape of his opening statement where Johnny and his
conference says oh yeah well there's this rosalópez and she saw this and she was walking her dog
and she saw the time and then there's this very interesting woman Mary Ann Gurches and of course
the fact is that they never got to hear or see either one of them because they both turned out
to be deadbeats and the full of crap and i'm sure she'll uh lay that on and very heavy duty term
that's the defense man there ain't no defense the alibi is he was taken an nap oh he wasn't taken an
nap he was batting some balls around ron goldmins he was batting some balls around right he's our
three-dick he can barely stand up he could never have killed anybody but he was practicing his golf

better if i could hear it though you sound like you're on your anus
no i'm not there but uh you were looking for something
for uh...
that not too big to use
i think i got away for you to get around it
you can use an old york cop smear not fit
and say something like uh what a country
yeah that's uh... got a pod george just looked at his head up for the first
time about an hour and a half so that uh... that kind of tension yeah
all right not bad
all right i talk you like to care see uh... okay hang on with tight
or as oj would say this is mine oh i'm sorry and then when he said this is mine
something like that
he said this is where uh... if we barely come from and that this is mine
and it was something about his checkbook i think it was squeezing a real tight
and if we was getting picked up because he ain't getting paid for this anyway
if we
and uh... bob shepero wants to make sure that everybody knows that the token
goy on the crew there the token white goy uh... he ain't getting paid for this
and quite frankly his performance uh... speaks for itself
here's hi alia hello
meal yes sir first time caller all right
hey listen i was at t-c-i cable and hollywood yes
a bunch of people there bitching about the price the quality yeah
about ten feet away they got little flyers for the new little dish thirty nine
dollars
oh that's for that prime star cred
is this yeah thirty nine dollars yeah what do you know i want to see this is
the deal that the cable companies are involved in this prime start thing
is that available now
uh... i guess all
are they peddling it
god i sure like to see one of those flyers if you get hold of one for me
i sure uh... you're wearing uh...
but just mail it to me
all right w-i-o-d-my-me three three one four one
because that see this is a deal where they loan you it's like a microwave
uh... micro like a micro relay thing
where they microwave you the mind why do i keep saying microwave well that
that's correct but it just sounds like my dog in the office correct
the microwave you the uh... the signal
and uh... you don't own the equipment otherwise they just put it in there it's a
three and a half-foot dish and the problem is that most people who can have
like a big dish a six or seven foot dish they're not also going to be able to have
a three and a half foot dish so what's the big deal see the dss the uh...
direct-tv thing that's an eighteen inch dish
that nobody even sees you know right but i'd like to see the thing
oh send it to you so send me your thing all right okay thanks later we have an
open line a day seven five one one the green line yeah this is cable companies
they saw the hand writing on the wall they knew that the parties over baby
no more crappy pictures people are not going to continue paying for crappy
service for snow for all kinds of garbage and uh... for all kinds of outage
to downtime when uh... you know they can have alternatives so they got together
these cable these grave robbers t-c-i and cocks and all these other assholes
and they started this prime star bit
but i haven't seen any uh... tangible evidence that anybody has got it here yet
have they this is probably like the dss the same thing
remember how long that was oh my god we had all those verbal brawl on the
air about it it's coming it's coming it's not coming i thought we were
listening to the empassion phones is it coming or not you know
and finally it got here and it turned out to be one of the greatest things in
history now went out and got mine i'm going to say it again i don't care what
you have my hand he doesn't give me no give me like a you know a five dollar
discount this guy he's the cheapest air i've ever met
i got him like eighty five thousand jobs he come you know it gives me a two dollar
discount but nonetheless he does do great work
but if you get a standard brands or brands martyred there's a jillion places
everybody in their brother is peddling these and installing them now
and you're really ought to check it out instead of just calling me and belly aching
or calling up the cable company now my pictures out again you guys suck
and having to put up with the kind of the with the food channel all the other
crap they give you and take it away your sports channel they are and by the way
all the regional not the sports channel yet but that'll be in a matter of time
the regional channels like pass from Detroit and kbl and a whole bunch of other ones
the one from the west coast that they had a king's leaf scheme on last night whatever
you know what one is they have like seven of those on there on your sports package
when you have your small dish so if it's moving if you just want the basic thing if you don't
want any of that stuff for like thirty bucks a month you'll pay less than you're paying for cable
now get a beautiful picture and say screw all you cable people better than

hey but it's it's the one to two hour
hey man what's the 70 sound that we're hearing we travel around town don't you know man
so days were as I think we all live through water take now color
one of the main presidents Jimmy Hopper found a very cement polyester
was on every behind as we sat in real long gas lines
it makes me wonder just why are they back the 70s are going
no bring them back
big and wasted with hot oxygen water is rude people speaking
the
wonder just why are they back I can't believe the stories they have come back
I am talking with me Billy bill is the joke and we all had to watch it
Jason screaming I know my future Nixon
through the words and that right telling lady to speak around me that night but those
two's made up two all right
and now I understand why they are back I'm going to cook it down all day I'm back
I put my chances to go hope I don't ring my neck cause I get to do one step
I'm trying to cook it down now that is time I'm trying to do one away to W.I.O.D. all the rocket scientists all the time baby and of course
oh Jay no coincidence by the way that it all happened around the same time because Kathleen Bell
Andrea Terry Phil Coleman and Max Cordoba all worked in the same area and knew each other
and so it's not a real surprise that they've all cooked up wonderful and a lot of stuff not at all
and what you will see really test it by trust me your honor is going to be very different from what's
been offered today at some point this gets cumulative and it gets ridiculous we have Andrea Terry
statement that isn't even probative because it does not go to the issue that loud and
well the court compelled the court to say that's the word that he's got the Elymphanis Bell statement
he's missing that probative value Philip Coleman has nothing but your safe
probative my ass folded arms to offer which is under 352 of no probative value whatsoever
she goes into them big probative baby gesture invests it ever believed by the way which it will
not be too much knowledge and with respect to the statement by alleged by Max Cordoba we have zero
reliability to that we have no statement we have no notes we have no take and every
mister hot shot mister multi-millionaire mister the most famous one in the world he says oh well
I don't have any notes on that conversation because I don't ever take any notes there is a man
there's your typical lawyer man and he says as marine to marine I'll get him up there and
to stand and I'll tell the truth and he'll tell the truth in the adi adi adi adi
okay here's a but of it you're hello hello Neil yes sir what is that thing on our lip
it's a chanker this and uh it's a chirpy I want to talk to you about the uh a week go Saturday at
pompano I don't know if you already talked about it put the big rack at the finish line no I wasn't
there did you see that no I was not there taking a few days off yeah big rack and uh I think I
believe it was uh albin yeah slipped over the top of the horse landed on the track turned around
and jumped right on the horse's head probably saved its life yeah uh fabrics was tell me about that
I was quite a quite a mark-albin the great horseman man he's the best out there make no mistake
about it we love mark-albin he's the finest horseman the finest gentleman a great driver mark-albin
is a credit to our sport well the card him away in the ambulance yeah comes back and wins the
that's what I heard never phased him uh never bothered him once in Crabley listen my big problem is
with the panthers though yes I sit I got season don't forget Buffalo tonight Buffalo and a panthers
be there seven thirty we got fifteen hundred tickets still on sold I got season tickets right next
to the press row up upper deck yeah and on either side of the press row they blocked off one half
of the aisle you can only use one side because they don't want you walking next to the people who
didn't pay to get into the game why not I don't know they got three uh...
what you know are arena they don't want you to get out they don't want you to close to the broadcast
thing there because they want you to send uh Denise pot fan blows stuff like that
well i don't know if you know it's the new print that's the media guys and the and the players
from the opposite team that are scratch well i got news for you man it's the fans who pay their
hard earned money for those tickets they're the ones that pay their damn salaries not these media
freeloaders that you're talking about that's right we can't use the i will we sit because they got
a black top they got three people sent out you got to walk on this side because you don't you don't
you don't want to get next to the media that's a pile of crap so we're correct so uh... you know
anything you could do to talk to that rimmer tonight i'm going to see him before that game and
i'm going to tell him to get this straight out or else all right and uh... hopefully we can get
a win at home here okay we needed bad man let's let's play some offense tonight let's go out there
and stick it in the net okay by the way those of you are like uh... blade runner girl of course
i guess this is buffalo's first appearance here this year i do believe i uh... am i right or
am i wrong i think so and you want to check out number seventeen crags simpson of the buffalo
sabers and number eighty nine Alexander Mogilli there's a couple of guys that he'd probably like to do two
or three rounds with blade runner girl and Janet who are busy right now probably outside the arena
sniff it around oh i can i can smell it these guys are circumcised honey don't get tuner
service you won't smell the cheese that far out are they circumcised or not 12 minutes after
what a w i o d are they circumcised or not six ten w i o d create offensive or obscene the staff
management of qa m apologize for their transgressions but if i am guilty of anything it is of giving
all that i have all that i have to give my penis my buttocks my lord torso thighs and any other
error that they wanted to help children all over the world femphitao sharen stone is doing a
western meaning really doing a western a fist full of booties you're hurting you're not you're
naked you're not full of booties when you're at a showdown with sharen stone you know you're going
down with your boots on there is she carry 45 you mean me not that big they were now right
perky which is a cool hand with a gun who really knows her smith and wesson are you mr smith
yep well i brought the wesson yeah a fist full of booties starring sharen stone it'll give new meaning
to the term cowboys okay i just saw i fully barely get up from his chair which is quite an
accomplishment i'm reading their own screaming and yelling and just articulating and pulling
the mouth what does that mean i mean isn't that clear when we write draft we write incomplete we write
first version same thing it means there's a second version it means there's more or at least there
are additional notes yeah let's put mr mccanon the witness can i want to m under oath that sounds good
no we're not going to do that uh miss klerk at least not at this point the thing is i've given you
the opportunity to review the statement i will not allow cross examination as soon as martin
statements unless and until you've had the opportunity to review this i'll give you the opportunity
to talk to mr mccanon uh to see if there are any other notes and my my recollection is that this
is listed in the discovery index and with regards to availability notes and other things so we can
take that up later i don't really we've kept the jury waiting uh yeah let's keep on doing my
perfectly be to since i'm recruiting cross examination on that issue anyway at this point
why don't we just move along your little jab okay let's go to uh Jupiter hello hello nil
yes sir i'd like to straighten out that caller from the continental get these guys and went in
the continental they saw their little flyers it was t-c-i all these saw same difference
always saw was uh they keep the tv book in there and they have a flyer from national
habitives thirty dollars thirty nine dollars a month for the prime prime star that's all
it's not the prime star it's the dss it's not all i see thirty nine bucks a month that that is uh
the dss right and uh well why do they have that in there they they just keep the tv book in there
because it's um cableized oh i see so in other words they uh probably don't even know that's in
there so they don't have to print tv books for themselves they just use some sentinel tv books
got it and one more question about that the uh user talking about a hockey game on the uh this
last night right all four of them aren't they uh isn't that in the package you got to that's
separate to the sport yeah but i think it was only sixty nine bucks for the uh you know for the
short and season but they don't have every game on but they have like over two hundred games on
oh i understand but it's great and the picture is incredible man like i said last night there
were four games played they had every one of them on and the channels are right next to each
other soon flip back and forth and up and down in and out no i understand that but you were saying
on that sports channel package they they black out those games just for your information
what do you mean they black out what games you know those regional sports channels no they don't
yeah the the professional games are blacking out in our area in what area and unless you're in
that local area they blacked those games no they don't i got the dish now you got the small dish

did you decide and he and his environment as a detective to try to resolve the issue
as to what it was and how it got there
at that point i was just looking for a person that left it okay now let's talk about the person
left yeah i'm sure that as you stood there looking at an instrumentality of a brutal murder
who seen you had just visited a short time before i killed the cold again to think about the
nature of the person that might have had control and custody of that glove correct control and
custody how do you get custody of a glove no you have to go to court for that well did you think
a big some victim you probably have to interrupt after the custody hearing on a glove scene of the
crime and deposited on oj sentence property sorry i had no knowledge of anything at that point did you
think that no okay did you think that possibly someone who had been involved as a killer might
have deposited that glove wittingly or unwittingly on mr. simpson's property i did not think of any of
these things at that time you didn't think of any of these no did you think that possibly
whoever put that glove there if it was put there with somebody dangerous
possibly what training do you have about what to do when you sense danger what's your first
out of the oh my god i don't really understand that you don't know the safety of the officer i believe
you said yes is a paramount consideration in police work if you could praise it like that and
it's big of Warner brothers too okay let's do a break here because this is really ponderous and
he's basically doing the same thing he's brow-beating and like he did yesterday and saying how come
you were out there for 15 minutes and you didn't draw your peace and you were like you're just
wandering around and matting up the grass and the leaves and all this he's patching around the same
stuff he was patching with yesterday and it's really ponderous man two open lines and date and
to it brides see what i mean about these people we have been smoking here today and i was about to
congratulate the audience on their phenomenal comeback even some of the colors have had something
almost interesting to say today it's been almost a real goddamn radio show after yesterday the
worst the most depressing day all day long on this radio station we felt unloved and uncared we
felt like we were going out of business yesterday and all of a sudden today they make this big glorious
comeback and now that we got this firm in the German on a stand in this old fart standing up there
pretending to be a hot shot lawyer which he was 40 years ago now all of a sudden well now we got
other a fish to fry baby open line and date 751 and a two and brown or two and brown or five two
four and if you're gonna fry some fish by the way get the honey junior 135 at WIOD

why don't you go back to Canada you do bastard why don't you go back to Cuba you speak best why
don't you go back to New York you want bastard 22 till two at WIOD so i go through my little
spiel there and as soon as i finish that like half of the people around there drop off again
so who down are you kidding here's a note here it says please excuse the impersonal form of my
communication with you but i'm afraid if i called in my ex husband heard my question he would
flip out on april 7th i'm heading to Las Vegas with 16 friends to get married was wondering if
you could recommend a nice Italian restaurant out there that may not be so mainstream p s last
week the responses for the um oh i see in other words the call what is that p s to be
responses for the teledine shower massage you were extremely lame i wanted to call but was
driving and know you hate payphones any real woman should already have what installed in her shower
so here's another woman who's big into shower power and she's going out to Vegas to get married on
april the 7th and wants to know a great Italian restaurant in Vegas let's get some call
in George he'll take it okay call in George with a great Italian restaurant in Vegas like
what does she say a great uh that's not so mainstream like off the beaten path like kind of beaten
off you the past emergency and we need to act now yes did you not say that
don't lie to me this is only one statement to you the men the women the children the old
the young the firm the healthy and you want sure to be the one that hurtled the wall yes
did you realize when you hurtled that wall that the might someday be a legal challenge to the
propriety of your actions no did you realize when you hurtled the wall that you were inexorably
a part of this case as long as it might last i don't think i was thinking of those things sir
didn't occur to you no okay
had you run any numbers of cars out on the street other than the bronco or had they been run by someone
to your knowledge i might have run the uh vehicle that was just east of the iceberg gate
it might have been a foreign foreign car might have been a 280 or a silicon i'm not sure which it was
okay japan east car of some kind i think so what do you remember about it i think it was dark colored
and uh quite cluttered in the interior you always playing up to the judge now japan
east car of some kind now probably go to a thing about how some what remember i think it was
registered somewhere in uh west hollywood or hollywood okay and when you ran it through the computer
did it just gorge a name as the register go i don't recall that you remember hearing the name
brine cavan before you ever went over the wall no i don't recall that no okay
when you went over the wall and let the other officers in who proceeded ultimately to kato
cavan's room correct yes did you hear any of the other detects environment cavan if he had seen
this prescription that he i'm not sure if it was uh conversation that affect more like you know
mr. Simpson's in the in the house or the main house but you did not hear any question about the
whereabouts mr. Simpson has mr. cavan might be able to attest to it during the relevant
no when the others went to are nil kato's suggestion
okay
no this is something you decided to do on your own yes you've got to lead detective or any of
them since they were all your superior and a permission to interrogate kato's case no did you
ask permission of any of them to test you it's a bribe no did you ask permission of any of them to
search no now when you began to talk to kato said he didn't know that he was you represent that
you didn't understand that no i did not you have a question about that
you know do you have crimes i have every other thing you do have to continue in coverage of the
Simpson murder trial so anyway it's a 143 a w i did we get any Italian restaurants in Vegas

everybody everybody watching the tv now seeing this lawyer trying to trying to talk about this cop who
is it's it's everybody sees it is ridiculous and it's not everybody sees that it's ridiculous they
still got about 40% of the public think that he's not guilty and you got about 70 or 80% of the
blacks out there who think that he's not guilty and uh huh that's a given right it's it's a racial
thing it's a racial thing and it's a superstar thing he's a black guy who happened to have been a
big superstar therefore there's a whole bunch of people out there if he stood up and he said it
right now like i've been telling you for weeks they still won't believe it you think he's gonna be
able to hold his head up yes he'll hold it up but i wouldn't look down at the urinal you might be
surprised let's go to um look at that we got two open lines and date what a brownie to purple line
they want to hear this crap man is it something you just need to learn about to commercial break so
they feel real deprived something i wasn't asked was there any other reason to interject question two
about the bronco there was a question that uh we wanted answered i think it was important
to know if mr. Simpson was home it was important to you it was
support to all of us had you been directed by anybody to make that inquiry of catered
with no so i take it now at this point i think then to the bronco and turtle ball you're
interrogating kiven you viewed yourself as a detective very much in the case oh i'm always
a detective yes in the simpson case is that your perception of yourself yes i was asked to assist those
detectives now oh said empersema again hold that that car was driven by mr. Simpson yesterday
they were green today by yellow he's regressing yes i believe he said it was ojsp and you asked whether
he had driven it that night i believe i did yes and mr. kiven responded he thought so but he wasn't
true he wasn't one in school correct i believe so let me go back to the question

promotion every Wednesday and they're finally doing it again which i'm very excited about
well maybe it's going to happen on top probably yeah probably on hankshow right probably next week
it'll be a kevin because it's they they go number one against number eight they got the top eight

somebody who could take it from more than thirty yards and can it is from more than ten years when i
