The annual email from mr. Ego
Maybe not every year, but every every couple years when he gets bored when he realizes
He's on a station and nobody ever heard of that they don't even show up at all in the ratings that he's basically
Falling off the face of the earth with his right wing clap trap
Here's the email that came in at 4.27 this morning
See you know it's got to be for real because nobody would wake up in the middle of the night
But when somebody works mornings in his up at that hour it makes all the sense in the world that it's real is real

Ego show and
The challenge you to Brian Craig wants to debate George a lot of things

And that's what they're praying for oh please Neil please dignify me with a response put me on let somebody really hear me no
No, you're done. I think you ever was much, but you're done
I wish y'all the luck in the world and continue to grind out a living and during these tough economic times
I know you got 45 kids to support, but I got one
I got one unofficially adopted uh child and it cost me a lot of money lots of money plus a couple of other people that I have to support
I don't have to but I do willingly and lovingly because I'm a great guy
And I sure as hell not interested in promoting mr. Ego with contrived garbage with clap track
I'm gonna keep promoting it every day and this way go ahead
What I really meant to say I'm sorry
What I really meant to say was
Go ahead
In fact, uh, I was skinny on the elevator last night in my building and
There was you know somebody else at the elevator door way to get on right at the simultaneously with me
And I said go ahead and that's that came to my mind as soon as I said it I
Yeah, I say it all day long. Do you go ahead? Go ahead
Well, here's an astonishing piece of news that goes to show you the old man isn't as far out of touch with reality as some of you think
Thank you, Steven Jersey for sending me this by the way
Maddo forced to glam up. Hmm
I don't know what this is from but nevertheless it's a story from some publication Rachel Maddo's reluctant makeover
Rachel Maddo has been forced to glam up says Louise France in the London Observer with her six foot frame
Boyish appearance. I think what they mean is ducky appearance
The MSNBC host is long joke that she has a face made for radio where she started her career
I'm an unusual looking person Maddo says. I'm not a TV anchor bag babe. I'm a big lesbian who looks like a man
But now that Maddo is in fact the anchor of her own program
She's had to make adjustments reluctantly agreeing to wear a makeup and what she caused lady clothes
You see it wasn't just me imagining that she looked real ducky
And that she wasn't wearing any makeup and she was going out of her way to look as manly and gross as possible
As it turns out many viewers men and women alike now consider her a sex symbol judging by her fan mail and all the internet chatter
You consider her a sex symbol
Me you talk to me. Yeah
Yeah, people are kind and flattering. She says but it's remarkable and weird
Part of my life that I try not to dwell on the fact that she's a real pasty looking
Ducky and goes out of her way to accentuate the negative
She doesn't admit that she's become more aware of her appearance even if the issue is still great on her
I get exasperated my goal is to do the physical appearance stuff in such a way that it's not comment worthy
I don't think very much about my appearance and when I do it's not how would you say strategic she laughs
It's not strategic she laughs
But it's a visual medium and it really does matter what you look like she's finally come to that conclusion
They've convinced her it does matter. We don't want some pasty looking dyke on the air with no makeup no
lipstick no nail polish looking really butch
butch
Just because you were a dyke. I mean there's nothing wrong with being a dyke
But Jesus that doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to prove it. We believe you
Don't we don't we believe she's a pasty dyke
Yeah, we believe it but that's a put out a little bit of lipstick and mascara and rouge and look like a who are you to tell a
Well, she's doing it. How's she doing it? They told her already
Because they know for damn sure that they'll cut you know, it's got at least one eye and can see can see the crap they put on there
Not to mention the fact that she's a very weak
Keith Obermann the second that was up 61 points

Let's see here's a one from Rooley
After hearing the email you read about her glaming up the commercial I heard yesterday makes sense
I heard Rachel Maddo last night doing a radio spot for cosmetics. I figured it was a comedy bit
Common her doing beauty spots common
Her doing beauty spots is like George W. Doing spots for men's uh by the way happy 33rds is Rooley
Thanks Rooley. Pulley whoever you are
When you hear this next one it's going to make the mr. ego email pale under one significance
Neil at nearogers.com by the way for all your emails observations commentaries and crap
Get let me give you a guess who this next one is allegedly from
Connick caller Joe Rocho
Story yeah
Excellent job George with very little just a tiny clue
Hi, Neil my name is Stormcat. I'm a big part of the Joe Rocho. I call every day and Joe and I have little conversation and that's all
I don't know why you have an issue with that because your calls suck. That's why
Because nobody wants to hear the same jackass call the same show day after day after day and pretty much at the same time usually too
Nobody wants to hear that whether it's richie from Boris head mark the jets fan stormy nobody wants to listen to a radio show where the same idiot calls every I'm your friend every day
You've been calling me off for two weeks and I didn't want to email you but I'm tired of it
Yesterday you were talking about something in the word storm came up
And all of a sudden you started to go off. No, I did not the word storm never came up and I didn't go off on anything. Did I?
No
No
Stormy stormy don't ever call the station stormy. Please leave me alone Neil
You even talked to the beast about me when he was there. I was listening
I'm a sports guy. I's whenever called you but you've been hating on me man. You've been hating on me
If I've been hating on stormy
Yeah, you're a hater
To drink in that heater aid Eric still hasn't corrected the pool. I'm not chatting with him about that as we speak
I mean, we got it. Otherwise, it's meaningless. And let's uh, we get the poll question on there, right
Right
How does that happen all of a sudden? We don't know
What we don't know
Well, so what's he gonna do that? I don't know fix it
How can he do that with magic? Okay, techno magic. Clunk your magic twang or froggy
Please leave me alone you leave it talk to beast yet. Uh, I haven't even called you in two days because of you
But I'll start on Monday again, but you better leave me be thank you storm you better leave me be something a threat
I better leave you be or what storm that was up 26 points. It was up uh, well over 100
And now it's giving away those gains
You know my cab guy and I we talk about this a lot my lesbian ease cab driver
About what a what a fraud the stock market has become over the last many years
You know what really started becoming fraudulent when CNBC went on here those people belong in prison
Including you Maria with diarrhea you belong in jail on death row
Pedaling crap. Oh, it's a buying opportunity. It's always a buying opportunity. It's never a selling opportunity
It's always a buying opportunity
In fact, I got an email about her about some crap she was peddling the other day
It's in my pile. I'll get to it Maria
Since they went on a year and they're nonstop 24 seven peddling peddling peddling peddling peddling and the reason they keep peddling is because if people stop buying stock then they're out of business
Am I right? You bet
Abso freaking lootly a fool and his money are soon parted
Once upon a time when I was like a little kid you'd invest, you know, in the stock market was for investing in making money
You would invest in like what were really great companies back then, you know general motors. Oh
Kodak
General electric and you'd make money you you're in dividends you'd make money and over a period of years your your investment would grow and
You'd make some cash now big scam
Every time you turn around to housing bubble. It's the tech bubble. It's the uh soap bubble
It's some other damn bubble. It's bubble the love sponge who didn't do squat by the way
Now realize he was only on one month of the trend and the arbitrage is usually a month behind
So the next trend will see if he made any progress
But Paul and Ron actually went up and he did nothing he did squasky they have Paul and Ron had a 5.1 share and the state
He's on whatever the hell it is had a 1.7
That's that's more than triple isn't it? It's triple. Okay
I'm a cripple if it ain't triple. I'm telling you
Well, what kind of a number is that 1.7 that he was supposed to goose up their number above it lost bunch
I guess they're not promoting him at all because you know who's got money to promote and I guess uh the people in the trailer park seven discovered him yet
The trailer trash the Tampa crowd, you know the red necks the Yehu's
I don't know I can't comment on his show because I've never heard it all
I know as I've heard some commentary from people who've got an IQ larger than their thumbnail and they say it blows
It blows it blows it blows and if Paul and young Ron are beating the crap out of him. What does that tell you
using recycling my material
The pole still says the same thing
Oh, there we go. That's why Eric. Thank you. Which occupation or trade though mochomacho is also a breeding ground for those in the closet
Very good. Thank you Eric. What will we do without Eric? We wouldn't have a show. We wouldn't have a life
Oh
This is hysterical

There show used to be six hours long and five hours long in this week

He also says there was no hassle about it either
Everyone knew who was gay and who was straight and nobody really cared that was his experience anyway back in the day happy Friday

woman enversed by McNugget meltdown
Florida woman calls 9-11 three times after McDonald's runs out of McNuggets
Fort Pierce
She's been called McNut by TMZ.com and loco for poio by Perez Hilton.com
Now I have to be coming to an internet sensation for calling 9-11 three times to report an emergency after McDonald's
They run out of McNuggets a Fort Pierce woman said Wednesday she's embarrassed by all the media attention
I'm embarrassed to show my face in pubic La Trierse a Goodman told WPBF news
A day after her McNugget meltdown was first reported
Goodman 27 was issued a written notice to appear in court for misusing the 9-11 emergency
Communication system
According to the police report Goodman called 9-11 three times Saturday to report
A McDonald's in Floyd wasn't giving her a refund for the chicken McNuggets
She wanted
The manager just took my money won't give me my money back
I'm trying to make me get something off the menu that I don't want goodman said more than 9-11 calls
I ordered chicken McNuggets. They don't have chicken McNuggets
So I told her just give me my money back and she tells me I have to pick something else off the menu
She's not going to give me my money back and she doesn't have the right to take my money
Goodman told WPBF news 25 she didn't have a right to jump across the counter and snatch the money
So she chose to handle it another way
Inside edition was where was there when WPBF news 25 spoke to Goodman on Wednesday
She said all the media exposures resulted in several profanity-laced hateful messages on her personal cell phone good good
Crazy bitch
God it goes this goes on forever
I'm not going and just giving up my money like that
I'm going to go and ask them when they please check and see if they have what I wanted on the menu
And if they tell me yes, then I'll order she said and if not she'll make a big stink about it again
Oh, here's a really a great email. I hate the emails bring back the colors at least they were funny
At least you were funny then what happened get out of Canada come back to banana republic where we all love you
Yes, screw you
I don't take orders okay on the internet or any place else. I'm not taking the instruction
Do this do that don't do this. Don't do that. Bye. Bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye
Screw you and do it twice
We're doing just fine. We just saw those January numbers. I and down to clearance say great job guys
Did he say did he give you a big kiss on the buttocks clearance isn't here
Well, we'll give you these trends flea. He went and got a key and broke into his office
Flea went and got a key. I always like that flea
Let's have a sitting ovation for flea.
Nice going, baby.
He's all right.
He's got a pair.
He's got a testicle or two or three.
Now are you understanding how we did so well in January?
And the sports nerds just, oh, yeah, you're not
seeing the cartwheels.
I got it out.
I mean, we had what?
We had a one three in the afternoon, persons to, oh, no,
that's men.
Let's get back to that person's 2554.
That is startling.
That is staggering.
That's a feather in our crap.
Yelp.
Isn't it?
Yelp.
You don't seem pretty excited.
But the prospect, the prospect of maybe some bonus money.
Wait a minute.
Six to 10 a.m.
A one point is what we had.
Person's 2554.
Whoa, that would be about a two in men.
Just double it.
Two in men 2554.
That's weak.
We had a three nine.
That's about a seven point eight in men 2554.
That would qualify for numero uno.
Trust me when I tell you to put that life in their place.
Bastards at life.
They should only croak.
And the afternoon we had a 0.7.
Zero point seven.
What kind of a number starts with a bad one, I guess.
Bad, bad, bad one.
And January is not on here.
I guess clearance couldn't have scrapped
late at number that low.
The number I gave you for seven in midnight
was December.
The number at night was solo.
Mighty low, you know what I mean?
Feeling mighty low.
I wonder if peg like baits ever said that.
I got an email about peg like baits.
Which I'll get to eventually in time.
I feel like almost like there's a chance.
Like there's a shot.
Like there's a light.
Now if they ever get that new signal cranked up
and somebody can actually hear the station, then, then.

with phone numbers that don't work for everybody i'm not doing that anymore don't ever ask me to
do that with that number again okay i'm just telling you i don't like it i don't like it
i don't TR says i had a continuous busy signal i tried maybe 30 times an automatic redog
i think what you have is maybe one or two working lines and rollover lines are not
operable this is what explain people calling getting a bad number of this is getting a steady busy
tone not that qam would ever have technical difficulties he says thanks for the entertainment
oh my god i didn't know the numbers came out i just heard that can i ask how you did week all
we just found out in january we had a big month we had a big trend in january i told you

something in men 2554 very very weak very weak for sports talk sports talk and we're talking two
what we're doing sevens on this show in the non sports today and labaster is just wiping the
walls with his ass my god you think that they're missing something here lady like what a sliver of a
slice of the audience i mean can you imagine if we actually had a signal that anybody could hear
we've been we've been doing like double digits again like the old days thanks to the fact i got
rid of those dumbass calls i'm your friend they were killing us they were destroying the show
and some people were sitting back and allowing it and participating in it and encouraging it
and relishing it and lapping it up and loving it
Teresa says i'm yesterday show you said a joke i don't think anyone caught this is this is very sad
you said 308 three votes on a pull our goal is 389 i don't think anyone caught it Neil but i was
laughing hard i see i tried to call that number for that free coup on was getting a message telling
me the number was disconnected yep if somebody as astute as Teresa was getting it then it's
certainly can't just be something people are making up she laughed very hard when i said our goal was
here you go Jimmy syphilis said i have the number two rated morning show in the market rush
as the number one show midday your time for eighth or ninth at i and z and Todd is number one
of the afternoon we're kicking tail yeah good that in 40 cents of buy you have a cup of coffee
at tim horton say you suck Jimmy let's face it how's that how's that wine business coming huh
how's that play by play business coming at 86% say you suck you're the worst not just that you
suck but you suck the most well worst who is the worst local radio play by playing out through
Jimmy syphilis 86.2% and that includes a lot of our people too because obviously that number
went skyrocketing up once i mentioned that pool skyrocketing yeah you guys across the street if
you really want to get a lot of response on your polls just let me read the poll every day and
i'll get you some votes speaking of a challenge shouldn't we challenge them to put the number of
votes on there as opposed to percentages percentages are for pansies i would either lie same thing
they don't give you the number of votes that's right and then they say oh well we had 48,000
votes yeah i sure you did and of course they got a poll you can vote as many times as you want i've
already voted five or six times for Jimmy what what kind of a laugh was that oh our our what kind
of a sure was that was a snortle a snortle yesterday when michael savages was reading the story about
the beheading in canada which was perpetrated by a Canadian named Vince Lee he was playing about
betz mister Lee in the background you couldn't come up with anything that creative and having in
decades it's just a matter of course for michael savages oh yeah he's a real creative guy couldn't
come up with anything that creative give me a break does not create it playing mr. Lee in the
background oh brother frank says 800 numbers disconnected well cherries is the contest line
number isn't working well john says 1 800 227 05 60 is not working well boy what a waste of paper
for all of that crap huh a humongous incredible waste well Teresa we got 540 votes on the
pool our goal is 541 ha ha ha whoa it says you might think the ratings would be available for
public consumption just like tv ratings oh well i'd appreciate if you read how 560 faired
against 790 specifically we already did that i'm not going to go through the whole thing again just
because you weren't listening that'll teach you to listen on the day when the ratings come out
that same clown oh Greg butel says your pool blows also he's got Obama written out one big ass mistake
America and please be where i'm the real Greg butel not really how do you like that
oh i know you read butel isn't right in colors okay
yeah in colors in red and blue and purple and pink i didn't know well i'm just i'm smelling
you right now the real Greg butel hey don't let me forget about that our horse racing thing
i won't cliff is the contestant today let me make sure the t r n is on there there it is
blue blinkers and the purple silks on the outside he was a horse that i know the purple
six on the outside in the maroon blinkers oh and well eventually put the horse to his inside
away and was cut down late by five demon bag who for 7500 to 10,000 going six pro longs not the
worst horse in the world i'm here he would be favorite here there's no question about it after
scratches and i'm hoping feel like felon can get around pwe's peak at the start and just
why this field oh my god well least the thing is working anyway okay it's more than you can do
there you ain't got no racing thing on you we got nothing well that's really sad because they do
have like on comcast they've got um or no i'm not on direct tv yeah they got a racing channel you
don't have direct you know that i'm going to do indirect tv indirect tv yeah you have direct tv but
there's Ken star is a crazy person he's now the dean of pepperedine universities law school
and an advocate for conservative causes we want to restore the traditional definition that has been
in place since this state was founded and almost every other Nazi crazy person Kenny star he says
oh a simple vote majority vote by the supreme court could undo the first amendment how do you like
that this is the kind of crazy person you're dealing with Kenny star all you write wingers man
i think y'all are going over there in debate mr. we go have a have a cookout with Richard
s and mergay and s and s and gay and me yada yada what do you think that sounds great
off to lock us baby oh no you're listening to neo-vogers it's quite a you best do
yeah what is he good for absolutely nothing uh-huh uh-huh more good yeah he is such a far he ain't never been
funny look out hope they showed you out the dog ship you do i've got to stand this is a me more
i despise because the way it took the terror side my will lie to the safest lipstick face he thinks it's
a sticker in a similar i said ma uh god y'all what is he good for absolutely nothing say it again
ma the oh lord he has done too far and absolute moron
hey man he is pathetic oh no he says all the things that you say neo i don't care he's pathetic
you see there's this concept this mentality out there that exists widely permeates society
and that is this that if somebody says stuff that you agree with that makes them great that makes
them wonderful and that's bill marz that his claim to fame oh well he knocks religion like you do
him about you know something he sucks he's a twerp his his addition is subtraction you know i'm saying
in other words the fact that he's part of the cause that's a negative not a positive
it's kind of like madeline oher i mean granted he had big kahonis and big boobies but um the fact
that she was the spokesman for the atheist movement in america uh-was it was really not a positive
thing because she was an offensive old bag she was real cut off though i heard or or or or or
the roman catholic church he was that she was fun she was fun roll the art she would roll her
ours on the roman catholic church she was great she had big kahons and she got a lot of good stuff
accomplished but she just i don't know you know i'm saying yep here's one from john ztr wow
who's busy playing himself lately have you or George seen the wrestler i know you hate miki but his
performance was great no i haven't seen it i'm not going to see it you seen it no i probably
well for free when it comes on cable for free yes well you know i pay for the cable not to mention
at one point marisa tome who plays the strippers practically new great movie also check out before
the devil knows you're dead where she uh-becomes completely new i i didn't i recommend that before
the devil knows you that discuss that we both saw it and uh liked it and what like it it yeah it was
great philips before the devil knows you that it was not as good as um oh what though was that
flick i just saw siblings oh oh i am such an old faggot man make no mistake about boy what's wrong
with that at least if you got good taste you know you can google whatever you like it if you like
it google away like that genius k j says sorry it took me a week to finally email my congrats on
your 33rd anniversary in this town? What an accomplishment. You're amongst the
small free of legendary characters who will always be part of our radio history
down here pretty much even Rick Shaw. Oh yeah, I'll always love suds. Rick not so
much. I'm of the Chicago era of Larry Lujak, Uncle Larry and Little Tommy and
John Records Landecker. I guess there's still alive too. KJ has a book of
Clark Weber's Rock and Roll Radio in 1955 to 1975. Mostly people have never heard
of including the aforementioned Clark Weber. A lot from WLS. I cannot say that
without hearing the jingle WLS in my head. Some people from five 60 W I
and D W C F L. Who the hell is Clark Weber a legendary DJ from Chicago. Love
you, honey, wishing you 33 more at least when you die, we all die. Accordingly
adoringly, Jeanne and KJ. And that's sweet. It is sweet. Adoringly. When you die,
we all die. Well, let me say this. I'm dying over here. Yeah. What's the
temperature up to by now? Paulie's probably on the edge of his seat.
Congratulations again, Paulie. I never thought I'd say that. 15 already. It's
supposed to be a high of 15 and the sun's going to come out this afternoon. They're
saying, although now it's murky, won't that be something almost 60? Almost 60.
overnight low though 34. That's not too toasty. And a high tomorrow like 43. Sunday
46. Monday 38. Oh geez. Once you get a day when it's like 60, you wanted to stay
that way, don't you? Right. And then just increase gradually, you know, and small
increments of the 62, 63, 60, you know, like that Theresa. Joe and Carl spring says, thanking
me, thanking you for laughing. Let me try it again. I'm having a little problem. What? Take
to. Well, I know why you don't read stuff because you're not a good reader. Right. What
you tell me that's what I said. So you don't read the emails. You don't read bedtime stories.
You just take those great calls. I'm your friend. Don't take any more. Take all the calls
you want, but don't talk to him. I don't. Don't talk to him. Don't let him on for a millisecond.
I don't. Good. Good job, George. I'm your friend. Joseph, thank you for making me laugh
out loud the other day. Pegleg Bates. I haven't heard that name in years. We're about the
same age. Oh, right. Joe. Old ancient. My old man used that name all the time. Look
at that guy. He's walking like pegleg Bates. Thanks again. No extra charge. You're welcome,
Joe. Pegleg Bates. He was a dark, complex guy in showbiz with a pegleg. Kind of figured
it right? Sure. Did he tell you what I read? He says, go ahead. Go ahead. Everybody's saying
that yesterday. I heard you mentioned Clark bars. This brought back memories as a kid going
to a pirate's game of three were stadium walking past the Clark bar factory. You could smell
the chocolate and peanut butter in the air. It was an orgasmic sensation. You know, I
had forgotten that there was peanut butter and Clark bars because ordinarily I don't like
peanut butter all that much. And especially in candy like Reese's peanut butter. Oh, fat.
That. But Clark bars, they must do something special with it. You know? Yeah. The way they
whip it all up and yank it together. Now the factory's been turned into a sports bar
between Heinsfield and PNC Park. I bought candy bars online at the Vermont Country Store.
They carry many other old candies as well. I belated happy anniversary. Do you have enjoyed
your show the past 22 years? Keep up the good work. Go ahead, Jeff and Boiton Beach. Go
ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Thanks. Clark bars. Well, I don't want to start getting involved
with that. I got to lose some weight. I'm getting a little. Good idea. Chunky. I mean,
561 votes on the pool. Now, let's see. Neil, I'm ashamed to admit that this is from
a sunny, but I tuned into George Sedanore yesterday. He was ripping Joseph Gackie all day. This
turned in him asking the callers who was the best and worst game broadcaster in town. He
read the article from the U.M. student newspaper, Joe is my cup of tea, but at least he gets
the players right. Jimmy is horrible. Just a bismill says sunny and winning their pool
hands down your pants by a mile. Nigel says I agree with that crazy bitch for calling 911
three times. What was she supposed to do? Those pigs were just ticked off because they
had to get off their fat asses and do something. Furthermore, those grave robbers at Mickey
D should be ashamed of themselves. They couldn't finish her off with their death-inducing
food so they stole her money instead. Come on, Nigel. Be nice. Al Vente says. If you don't
put you up in the next 10 minutes, I'm switching over to Rush. Now, he's a real man. Love
him kisses Al. Yeah. He's a real man. A real pill popping fat phony. Phony, Nazi. All he
needs is a paste on mustache and lose about 200 pounds. He'd be a perfect eight-off number
two. You see him sweating and screaming and carrying on and just like Hitler and there
are all the Republicans sitting around. Oh, yeah. And a boy, Roger. They're desperate
now. They got Paiusha, Paiusha, Jindal and they got Sarah and they got Crazy Rush. That's
what they got left. And of course, the whole crew over at IOD was kicking ass. All the right
wingers all the time. Doesn't that kind of like scare you a little bit? A little bit? In a market
that's supposed to be like a little bit to the left of a till of a hunt and evidently is not
maybe just all the Nazis get the diaries. Maybe they stole them. It happens.
564 votes on the pull-witch occupation, though Macho Macho was also a breeding ground for those
in the closet. In other words, gay. Lifeguards 131, firefighters 81, football player 75, boy,
they spent a lot of time nicking the shower together. Marines 60, cops 42, soldiers 41,
paramedics 38, sailors 36, late edition, but it's zoomed on up there. Republicans 30, also late
edition, what did I tell you? Allah, Larry Craig, a lot of toe tapers out there,
bouncers 19, they're tapin' it and the toes too. Karate Blackbelts 11 and personal trainers
to where did that come from. Oh, I got an email. Well, I guarantee it's an excellent choice.
This dick chained me. I'd like to relax by having Mary Magdalen massage my balls while listening
to the Neil Rogers 12-Hour movie.
There's only one way to win the gold. Every swimmer must get stoned. Well,
the ston you win the four by 200 meter freestyle relay. The ston you win the 200 meter individual
met me. The ston you win the 100 meter butterfly. And the ston you win the four by 100 meter
medley relay. There's only one way to win eight goals. Every swimmer must get stoned.
Well, that's good news that I was only down 20 points. I think we're in the week on a real
uh, note, sour note. I mean, top noon at QAM. We got the big old coming up in a couple of hours.
I can't wait personally. Can you? Neither. That's right. Oh, man.
Now, maybe he was responsible for our big January. What do you think? Lighty? I don't think so.
I mean, I could be wrong, but that's a real, a real fly opener that three nine in person's 2554,
a seven point something in men. When's the last time we had a seven point anything in anything,
right? And under the Joe Bell regime, huh? Once upon a time way back in the early part of
because I remember him sending me email, all congratulations on the great book. New above me. I like that, you know,
till they decided, Oh, we can't let them do that. And until Fidel decided we can't let them hear
a five 60. Why couldn't he have put that on like a five 90 or something or like on seven 90 would have
been good. 13 cents serious. It's hanging right in there. Maybe it's a real buying opportunity that
I was down to least seven and a half point six point eighty five, making a recovery as we speak down seven point seventy two.
651,000 jobs lost in February. It's a real buying opportunity. Just ask Maria. She'll give you her diarrhea.
Haven't heard from Maria today with any excuses about the way everything is going to hell in a hand basket.
Mark and Miami says, I still listen to Mad Dog, but I have to turn off the radio when the big old comes on. Oh,
he is terminal. And I'm sure there are many people who change the radio at two o'clock to seven 90 leave it on for the
remainder of the afternoon. Personally, I can't listen to La Bastard. He has to gots impersonating Ed McMahon,
laughing at everything he says, even when it isn't remotely funny. I realize he doesn't always talk about sports,
but that doesn't make him a good radio personality or is show enjoyable. It says Mark and Miami. Well,
that's maybe true, Mark, but he's kicking some ass. He's kicking some big fat bloody ass.
That amazing. Yep.
Goes to show you. Well, we're slow to learn on this stage. We just, oh, in fact, where's that thing I just had here?
Oh, here it is. Mark and Kendall. You'll be just made to hear this.
Well, you won't be this way. You just don't care. Right. Good. That's a good attitude. We don't care.
Just, you know what we'd like to have a lot of wired diaries. Now that we're going to that PPM thing,
right? You can't wire the PPM. Sure you can. You can sit the meter in front of the radio on one
stage, not your favorite station and just leave it there all day. Just walk away. Even though you're not
even in the building. Right. But we could use some wired diaries. We could use a real big bogus. I mean,
a real big month, like in whatever's going on right now. March. Yeah. March has started now in the
train. Well, whatever it is. Get us some money on it. Get us some money. It'll be the last time
we ever get any money out of these grave robbers for ratings bonuses. Until, of course, they crank up
that signal. That's going to happen sometime this year. That's the rumor. The century. They're cranking
it up. They're getting a big power boost and they're going to crank it up. They're going to pee on the
tower. You just wait and see every day. They're going to send Gary Sarner out there to pee on the
tower since he ain't inside the building anymore. He'll always be part of QAM. It's in his blood.
In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing a whole bunch of his blood up and down the hallway before he finally
goes for the last time. Wouldn't that be great? Sure. There will be blood and it will be Gary Sarner's
little be kosher. You can guarantee you that. There won't be nothing. Trayff in his blood.
Mark and Kendall says I turned your station on last night around nine expecting to hear DA.
Even though his rating suck, he has a pretty good show. To my dismay, it was Kim Bo camper and some
sports writer conducting interview with a high school kid. Oh, Jesus. The speed at which I turn
off would rival the time it takes you to hit the door at woodbine. They need to change the station's
call sign to WQA seven. Now, can you explain that to me? What does that mean? No, I can't explain it to
you. WQA seven. A mistake? You think Mark made a typo on there? Maybe. What does that mean, Mark?
Is that how many listeners we're going to have left? Lots of Kim Bo camper, man. Lots of stuff that
people don't want to hear. Wouldn't Kimba wouldn't it be nice if he was not again? Wouldn't that be good?
They're obsessed with him just like when when Charlie Joe put his boyfriend, Kenny Walker on with
Kim Bo on that Kenny and blow morning show. Oh my god. Remember those days? Yep. I'll never forget.
Or not gay. The square table. I mean, that show was just that show gives the word blows new meaning.
I mean, just it's just blue. Even cat blue. I'd never seen nothing like that. Rick says,
planning a trip to Toronto this fall. I'm wondering what your opinion is on visiting the hockey hall of
fame. Well, if you got little kids, little kids, not teenagers, but like little kids, they might
enjoy it. I've been there once. Disappointing. That's and I'm a huge hockey fan, make no mistake
about that, but it was disappointing to me. It was like for kids, you know, George will be going
there. Oh yeah. Go to the sea and tower and jump. That's going to be a great place to jump from.
You betcha. I'm a little nervous even about I've never been to it. And I'm nervous about
taking that elevator that goes all the way to the top, you know, or close to the top. And at night
time, they light it up all these different colors like fluorescent, you know, it's really neat.
And you can see that elevator going up on the side of the tower and it's like a bug like a
jaguette, a kukaracha. And kids, my drift. Are you drifted? The fake Tom Jika has a long, long
email here sent yesterday afternoon right toward the end of the show. He says, I watched the first
Jimmy Fallon show on Monday night, not good. I'm kind of rooting for the guy to succeed, but
truth be told, I never found him to be exceedingly funny on SNL. I don't think he's going to have
the likeability factor to win over large audiences in late night TV. Says Tommy, fake Tommy.
I found the first show to be pretty painful for the entire hour. I won't judge him on the first
show though because I remember what Dan's first show sounded like. And that was truly painful,
really, really painful. Dan, who? I don't know. Dan? Dan, Dan the monkey man. I don't know.
Fallon's opening monologue was okay at best. The slow jam, the news, I thought was extremely
painful. It was probably a funny idea on paper, but it didn't seem to come across that funny.
And why is the roots the house band? Aren't they a little better than to be the house band on
a late late show? The roots. Are they akin to the grassroots? No, no relation. Oh, who's the roots?
Abandoned. You know? Yeah. Oh, personally, you know, I thought the show got really painful
after that little time. He says the Robert De Niro appearance was embarrassing. He didn't want to be
there. He was obviously doing a favor to someone at NBC by green to do it. He obviously wanted to
promote his Tribeca film festival, but he didn't even do that well. The skit with Fallon and
De Niro was just dreadful. Then Justin Tinkerbell came out and tried his best to save the show. But by
that time, I think it was already over. Tinkerbell is funny and talented. Oh, I'm thinking a Tinkerbell
show would be way more entertained than a Jimmy Fallon show. And why exactly was Van Morrison there?
That made as much sense as us doing sports flashes every half hour. Now, I want to read that to you
again. That last sentence. Okay. That made as much sense as us doing sports flashes every half hour.
We have sports flashes. You're not following it. This is the fake Tom Jekker saying that made as much
sense as us doing sports flashes every half hour. Yeah. I didn't get the first time. I'm sorry. Give away.
Sorry. Yeah. Give away. Cross the street. I hope the show gets better, meaning Jimmy Fallon. I'm
not a huge late night TV fan, but I have sent the T-Vote record a few more episodes of Jimmy Fallon.
I'm excited to see him with Tina Fagan when she comes on. By the time you read this blog,
they probably already will have been on this blog. This is a blog. I don't want to sound old here,
but late night TV was at its best with Johnny Carson. Well, guess what? Not even close. That dude could
do a late night talk show like no other. Wrong. Steve Allen, Jack Parr, they were the kings of late night
TV. Johnny Carson was weak. He was like the rascal house of late night TV.
Yeah. I find it sad. He never agreed to allow his old shows to be rebroadcast and syndication
or released on DVD. An entire audience of young people will never know the pleasure of watching
Johnny Carson before bed. Thank God. Here's Johnny. I feel like I can safely say Jimmy Fallon will never
be the Carson Letterman League, but it wasn't as bad as the Chevy T-Show or the Magic Johnson Show.
Anyone remember a thick of the night with Alan Thick? That was supposed to be the next big thing
when I was a kid. It says, Sign the Fake Time Jikker. That made as much sense as us doing sports
flashes every half hour. Us, us, us. Got it? Got it. That sounds like a simple typewriter to me,
little Tommy. Yeah. Yeah. Not good. Some of these fake people, the Dow is up eight and a half
points. All right, man. It's going to be a great Friday. You'll see.
Here's one from Rebecca. Are you going to do it another appearance in Miami? I didn't do an
appearance in Miami. I did one in Halendil. We moved to North Carolina like all your other
listeners in George. I'm looking for an excuse to come to Miami. I missed the Cuban food.
Says Rebecca. Yeah. I'll be around. Cliff and Kendall says the bus to Taco Hill.
Oh, this is that story about the beheading guy. Do we really care about that?
I'm not sure. I'm confused. It's stabbing beheading and cannibalizing another man.
A Canadian judge ruled yesterday the man accused of beheading and cannibalizing a fellow
ground bus passenger is not criminally responsible due to mental illness and an addiction to Taco Bell.
Oh, yeah. I want to chop somebody's head off right now and I haven't been to Taco Bell in months.
Lee killed a 22 year old carnival worker was never in question at the trial. Lee is admitted he
killed McClean but pleaded not guilty. Witnesses said Lee attacked McClean unprovoked
as their bus traveled at night along a desolate stretch of the trans-Canadian highway.
And a greed statement of facts between the prosecution and defense detailed how
passengers stood outside the bus as Lee stabbed McClean dozens of times and beheaded and mutilated
his body. Finding himself locked inside the bus he finally escaped your window was arrested.
Leave that apologized and pleaded with police to kill him. Police said McClean's body parts were
found throughout the bus and plastic bags and the victims ear and nose and tongue were found in
Lee's pocket along with the Taco Bell Chalupa and three packs of hot sauce and three.
Three packs of hot sauce. Don't choke. The Chinese immigrant complained that he ate all McClean
he could but he was still hungry an hour later. All right. Funny. Taco Bell would not return
repeated requests for a comment. Cliff and Kendall sent that. Yeah, we had the
hundred of those. It's old news. You got to really do something nasty here to be a criminal
in Canada. That's just behead some guy and chew them up like that. Crazy Chinese man.
Oh, Neil! You're listening to Neil Rogers.
Neil God.
I'm a man.
Tight little island full of gay romance. They wear gay sandals and they wear tight pants.

Club 17 at 560 WQM. So I guess yesterday we never did decide who had the manly or penis
Don or Phil Everly. We never got any input on that. No, no, no one responded. No.
Kevin says, sorry, we're late with this. I've been listening from somewhere in the 1979
80 time frame. He's still on me hours of sleep lost when you and Bill Carter used to do cross-overs
at midnight and sometimes lasted until three or four in the morning. After callers,
see what the field George says Kevin. Okay. Well, here you go. Thanks Kevin. Sounds like a
guy to say we were having fun. That's why he used to stay on until two, three sometimes four in the
morning with Carter. We just laugh our asses off for free. You know, wow. It was a work of love.
The labor of love. The labor of love. Another shot at love.
Mark and Candlest is I heard you see this is the guy that gave us the WQA 7.
Here's the explanation which is going to leave you lame and limp. Okay.
I heard you say the other day WQM stood for a quid at midnight WQA 7. Get it?
We quit at seven. How about we quit a long time ago? Okay, thanks Mark. Good luck to you.
We quit at seven. That's that's a shot. That's a real shot at Kimba Volkamp,
or Ann. Well deserved by the way too. That Kimba and Blow Morning Show.
People have been executed for lesser crimes than that. That was up 16 point. It's just kind of
hovering before the big blow. Neil at neorodges.com. That's our email address. Kind of slowed down now.
I would have felt we got in a tremendous response after especially after those monthlys. My god.
Let me see those again. I want to honestly for real.
For real. Is real. I want to see the in my in somebody's a pretty and that's clear.
It's numbers. See how it makes numbers like a child. Like a like a baby.
Many teen plus in January QAM 4.3. Waxi 1.9. God they suck. They blow.
Except in the afternoon they stop blowing. I say not amazing. That love a turd man. He's just
out of control. And let's see. Person's 2554. In the morning we got a 1.0. In the afternoon we got
0.7. 0.7. And we got a 3.9. How do you like that? I like it. And when you were scrappling a man,
especially when you make it 10 to that's 10 to 3. That's 10 to 3 baby 3.9 7.8. That means we got
an 8 something in man 2554 8 8 8. We got 8. And sometimes getting 8 and all that bad. Depends
on who's doing the 8. And nevertheless got some very sad news, especially for our sales department.
A private connected based broadcasting school with campuses more than a dozen states abruptly shut
down this week and said yesterday they'll seek bankruptcy protection. Oh my God.
The Connecticut School of Broadcasting blame its financial woes on a tightening of the
private student loan market tuition for 16 week courses as much as 12 grand. The school has several
Florida locations including one at 3901 Coconut Palm Drive in Tampa. I'm extremely disappointed
that after 44 years of operation, CSB will not be able to fulfill its mission of providing
quality education to students interested in working in the broadcast industry. School President
David Banner said I'm also disappointed that the actions of our lender precipitated the
sudden disruption into lives and careers of our students and employees. The school's got 26
locations in 16 states. The school said it was surprised that its lender Pittsburgh based PNC
financial seized control of the school's accounts and then froze them as it was attempting to find
other ways to fund the business. I guess you won't be hearing any more of those spots for the
squeaky voice broadcasters. Oh well. In a statement, the school said it would promptly seek protection
under applicable insolvency laws. In other words, were off-sourced or maybe off-sulophous?
PNC spokesman Fred Solomon speaking of off-sulophous said the company does not discuss its
customers their accounts because of bank confidentiality rules. PNC recently acquired Cleveland's
troubled national city court and last week slashed its quarterly dividend by 85 percent.
Its stock was down more than 12 percent Thursday trading under its 52-week low of $20.33.
At the school's Farmington locations students say they found out by text message Wednesday night
while others showed up for class and found the doors locked. How do you like that? You go to class
and the doors are locked. Have we like showing up at work and the doors are locked?
Wow. Tracy Miller, a January graduate, said she was upset about losing the lifetime job
placement help and studio privileges that the school agreed to in a contract she signed.
She also was angry because radio demos she recorded for potential employers
were on computers inside the locked school. I just want some answers. I'm in the dark right now
said Miller 22 of Plainville. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said yesterday his
office was looking into the closure including whether school officials kept taking money from students
when they knew it would be shut down. Well that's a good scam, huh? I'm not saying they did it but
wouldn't that be a great scam? It would be. The office will seek tuition refunds for students if
finds any violations of law. Blumenthal said the State Department of Higher Education was also
seeking refunds and options for students to complete their studies. The school was founded in
Farmington in 1964 by a Hartford broadcaster Dick Robinson. Remember him? Yep. Robinson and his
family will reopen the broadcast school under a different name at that location. Oh they want to
reopen well maybe and maybe not. They want to reopen it under a different name. Family said in
the letter posted that the school they plan to apply for a state license to teach media and
communications. It'll be contacting students to help them complete their studies at no additional
cost. I don't know why because the business is over with anyway. There ain't no more broadcast
business. It's done. It's finished except for us in January. Boy we got a kiss. We finally got a
big kiss. That's what we needed. A kiss as in Kushner and Tuckers Jimmy Cifalus.
I'm just pumped about that. I'm pleased this punch. We finally got the moment. I'll say we
do work for this regime and you need all the breaks you can get. That old expression break a leg.
Oh never were true words spoken and working for this crowd. Oh you don't know what you're talking
about Neil. We're really promoting and yeah we're really out there go getting. That was up six
points just a little under six but who's who's counting right one two I think they ought to have
a special month on the gambling channel on CNBC and make all those people including the ones
who no longer work there like Ted David all them come on and apologize and they could do a
telephone and try to raise the money to pay back all these poor suckers out there who got stuck
under their hype hype not investment advice hype oh it's a buying opportunity

1245 at 560 WQ I am
Frank says about rush
He was arguing about bailing out the homeowners going into foreclosure
His argument was that the homeowners were not swindled and that they knew that in five years
They wouldn't be able to afford and they should accept their foreclosure and that's it
It's all their fault no fault of the banks and brokers
What he fails to mention is he always does when he spins things is that these homeowners were promised a no lose deal
They were promised in the event that the arm comes due they would have two options
They could refinance at a lower rate or worse could just sell their house
Of course thrown into the sell the house pitches that house prices are tripling and a five years your house
Will triple and price and you'll make a huge profit because everybody knows house prices never decline to the always increasing demand
They always and they always reduce the supply
Fact is no one mentioned the fact that the increase in housing prices was significantly higher than the increase of the wages of the home buyers
Demand the government can throughout the increasing average wage
But they don't mention that if one guy gets a billion dollar raise and 50 others get nothing
It's still looks like a growing economy in short Russia's full of Schmidt a man to that Frank Russia's full of Schmidt

Bye-bye Jimmy D. Bye-bye Jimmy D
I bet you there's still nothing on there about Joey Carr
And Steve Solomon or whatever his brother's name was
Reason his brother's name was a real Jewish name is because his brother didn't change his name like Joey Carr
Like Robinowitz or whatever his real name was nothing
Zip but he do does it. I think it's because it's the erasing hour
Do you mention the jockey changed the hubby at Castellano?
Julian Lepp Rue under the weather not riding today

Here's one about Sid the Iid but nothing about Joey Carr
Different you well, I'll print it out
Nine minutes till post-art for the first race at the Gulf Stream
What's that the handicap is named Ron Nicoletti? That's one of the guys that we just done there
With the real New York. He sounds speaking of Sid
On the track for race one with exacta trifecta superfecta next one. Why does he say one? I don't know why he says it
Oh, this is from Hawk Mark the fake Hawk Mark
I have been told exact words to my face ratings don't matter because I'm the most pound-toward person in this market
The fact is the promotions here at 790 are completely focused on the Dan La Bastard show and to a lesser degree Sid show
So if he's losing in the ratings, then it's all his fault
For example, we cross promote Sid show on the La Bastard show three times while the others get one mentioned if they're lucky
The reason is simply that he's stoo gots his close personal friend
Everybody thinks that Sid has a potentially bigger audience and management here is gonna die trying to prove themselves right
They've moved two producers from the other shows including my former assistant producer to give him a boost and boost his ego
The others including Sadhana are we sent this fact and hates it like poison as a result of this
How do you like that? There's the inside from the fake Hawk Mark
Do we care about this? No, no
In other words, they got some real internal tourists going on over there. Okay. They got there were one no Charlie
They got the love a turd and that's it. That's what they got like a pentonia over and over again. That's all they got
Is levatord
And stoo gots Steve Cohen
Steve Cohen thank you and his brother Marty Marty Cohen
Steve Cohen and Joey Carr
Car Cohen you know same difference. Thank you Steve slug
Steve stolen gave us that info, huh? Yep. Now, this you know if Joey Carr is still alive
Because the audience doesn't have any information or any interest in that whatsoever, which I find shocking
Here's one from Gabriel
How I discovered the near Rogers show
In
2008 my father introduced me to both your show and Rush Limbaugh
Rushes and insane fascist. I was instantly turned off by his ramblings and his skewed view on politics
Your show was the most entertaining I've ever heard

Moving up cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. We'll see
Rich says as you very well know a large portion of your caller's faxus e-mailers have absolutely no clue what
What a shot that is what a giveaway neither I nor any my friends have ever had a bad bite of food
To console oak much less a bad meal
The emailer who suggested you try the food court rather than the high-end steakhouse should tell you everything
You need to know about him and his projectile vomiting wife
Oh, what a great line that is I love it
Him and his projectile vomiting wife the sides are overpriced as they are at most high-end state places
But one side order a console can feed two or three people
So
Console oak and something rather on lasola so the two I can't read what it is the two best steak places in the area burn on
I hope that last guy enjoys his turkey club sandwich with lots of pickles next time he said his five star food court says rich
You're getting a little testy with each other now the food fight. It's a food fight. Yeah, I like that
Everybody I've talked to every all the emails of also counsel look at hardwreck is outstanding excellent
Have any near yet first I'd have to be down there to eat there I guess
Kind of a mixed bag, you know a mix a mixed blessing. So Joey Carr is dead. Well, that's good news
He was to me. He was not a pleasant person. I see
I was involved with him by way of the late Bob Savage
The late race caller from call to racetrack
With my late night TV show on channel 51 on on TV whatever hell was remember I talked about that the other day. Yep
We were involved in that and Joey Carr was like I don't know
Real hard ass but nevertheless
dining and dancing and
Clowning around
So what else did Hank have to say anything just that he knew we were on the air and everything
Well, what does that mean? It's like a sit there and have a long projected phone call why not you know
You might give you some inside dope inside poop. Well, I gave him my cell number in case he does have any more dope. Oh good
Yeah, give us the straight dough bank or the gate oak in your case
660 votes on the pool
Speaking of that which occupation though a mochomacho is also a breeding ground for those in the closet closet queens
Hey Jimmy you can
You know
Lifeguard's 135
Firefighters 89 Republicans 81 well Republicans uh from a standing start have gone zooming up the list
They must be thinking about all those toe tapers and about Miss Fowley and of course your gay governor
Limpress Christ
Do you think he's really fooling anybody?
Hmm with that marriage with that beard with that whole fake routine of his
Only the dumbest of the dumb
You'd have to be deaf dumb blind and basically dead
Not to know the Charlie Limpress Chris is a screamer screamer
Not just gay but
Like that
For publicans 81 football player 78. I can't believe those mochow football players like Brady Quinn
Those guys that take showers naked together all the time and slap each other on the ass with the towel and with their hand and with their
Marine 61 sailors 44 cops 44 soldiers 42
Paramedics 39 bounces 21 personal trainers 15 karate black belts 11
Out of 660
So what happened there the Chuck when the first race at Gulf Stream right now we can look up there and see
I don't even know if there's any scratches in the second race
No, there are not feel the seven
And the the horse I picked the six is the a third choice
Three to one one is two to one two is five to two and the six is three to one
So I'd open race you look at the form and you think I don't know
You want to pick this race? I don't want
I don't want it. Why I have no choice. That's the one. You know, it's the second race every Friday
Now the next Zito horse is the two who won resoundingly last time Todd got even
I'm surprised Hank didn't give you little information about that
That's his good buddy next Zito
One by two and a quarter, but he was the truck and he's moving up
In a 30,000 maiden claimer now he's moving up into a non winners of two
35,000 claimer. He's stepping on up
To the east side
Burning blaze on the other hand is taking a big big drop down
Second start after a long layoff. Well, whatever we don't want to intellectualize all this crap
How about Jimmy Cifilis getting 87% of the vote as the worst
The worst sportscaster play by play in all of South Florida and Gellie didn't even make the list
Let's find that very suspicious six are getting a little bit. He says coast second choice five to two
To good sign
Do you understand all this? No, are you ever gonna understand it? I mean, I don't know maybe by the time he dropped dead
Or I do
Why is it that difficult? Why is that compliment? I don't know. It's just it ain't sticking like that idiot
I think I got a couple days ago. Oh, how do you uh? How do you uh go to the track? How do you learn all about it?
How do you learn about horse racing and betting you go there? You buy the racing form and inside the racing form
There's a couple of pages devoted exclusively to how you read the form
And how you use that to bet and make your choice etc and so on tells you all about it like Johnny used to say
Hear all about it call for Philip Morris, whatever he's to say. I think we ought to go back to the days when we had cigarette spots
Why not we have a lot of other poisonous goods that they advertise why not cigarettes
Right why not faggots right freedom of speech, baby
Think it's a disgrace that the candidate for ties new ports Salem
Winston tastes good like a cigarette should
The moral bro man mr. macho probably a screaming queen
Six is back up to three to one so one two and six now what about the one one is Kent to Sermon oh look out
He wrote our 11 horse last week that one for fun good ride
Today
What's the name of that harule?
High rule oh Jeff high rule
Dropping down, but bad race last time bad race
I don't know
We'll see they'll open a gate the horses will run and they'll do their thing and
Life will go on and maybe I'll win cliffs some money and maybe not I've had four winners in six weeks and a second and then a fourth
That dr. Ogedy boogie Oga Oga boogie
That was that was unfortunate got bumped twice out of the gate. That was what it said. There's always an excuse, you know
bump twice at the gate
steady
Stiffed you know like that stiffed
I like when they say a horse was well meant I
Don't know what that means that that means they were trying to win. Oh
Okay, now what what's that opposite of the way as opposed to not well met as opposed to stifferoni stifferoni the San Francisco treat
I mean, what does that mean I don't know well meant
It
It means they were trying to win are we alive are we alive like that you know
Plenty of way the six keeps getting to hit back down to five to two. That's a good sign. He's taking money
When you see a horse that should be a low price and he's not taking any money
Run for the hills run like a son of a bitch
You starting to catch on now a little bit a little bit good one step at a time
I think the day will come when we'll actually have you go to the window and place your own bed
I've done that actually you have not at these things here, but when we've done things there before
In other words when we have done appearances there before
Yeah over the years you went to the window and placed bets
Yeah, somebody wrote down specifically what to say and like a bank robber. I just walked up there with a note
Give me a hundred across on the
Yeah, I had no idea what I was saying
I just laid over the six seven eight over the oh yeah, yeah, I want this I just handed the note in the money
My fat rich used to have tickets under his armpits and his wallet in between his knees
I mean this man after the every race was over he was reaching and then pockets the wallet the
Everywhere arm pits even once in a while pulled one out of his rectum ass
I had this super. I he was such a great guy. I know and then he died
Anyone in a why why fat
And it's Friday you best
Oh
You lost the race your complete
A groupacleery for your skin involves
money.
Jokes.
Here.
Believe that you show thanks to you.
Now I'm broke.
Money.
Jokes.
When you did, when you could hear all of us moan.
Or you're not triple crown.
Put on my money down.
Or I hit you.
Money.
Jokes.
Okay.
A little horse racing bit there to get us in the mood.
You in the mood?
Cute.
I am in the mood.
No.
I mean, to play it.
The six is up to four to one.
He was seven to two.
Back to three to one.
Now he's up to four to one.
Money's all going in on the one and the two.
The AC Doocy.
Four to one is a ten dollar horse.
It's not bad.
50 bucks to one.
I'm ten dollar horse.
250 bucks for cliff.
It stays four to one.
And if it wins.
What is that?
In the mood?
Another lot of burden to this house.
Oh my god.
Who is that?
Ernie Feele.
I remember that.
Okay.
John ZTR says.
You know that I just hear some moron blast me and calling me a fat shut in?
Yes.
Please inform this idiot that I'm an average citizen who gets bored at work has internet and radio access.
I put in ten to thirteen hours a day so I don't know what that moron was talking about.
Anyway, please tell George the movie should be there because I emailed him yesterday and let us usually take a day to get to the destination.
You get it?
No, I'll check it out then.
No.
I mean it might be sitting up front, you know.
It says I emailed him yesterday.
What does that mean?
That's what he says, but I haven't got it.
I think he means he mailed him.
That's probably what he means.
By the way, it's a coincidence that is it a coincidence that January was your highest rate of month or also the month I was sending in emails of full force?
Just kidding.
Yes, just a coincidence.
Anyway, I'll go ahead and reveal another fake identity since you ignored all the following emails from it.
Bart Owen and Raymond, the two idiots who heard from a coworker that Neil is not really gay,
real classic email says John, not.
It was mildly amusing the first time and then he kept following it up and I just kept deleting it because it was so stupid.
Not real classic, not up to your usual standard at all.
So obviously fake.
See, a real good fake email has got to be one that might possibly be real.
Right.
You follow on with Sam?
Yep.
Oh, here's Manny from Kendall with the Mr. Ego update.
We don't care.
Not interested.
He's just desperately reaching out.
I bet you Nick Lawrence sent that one.
Not interested.
Go away, Mr. Ego.
We're not interested in trying to put you on the map.
Just clawing out desperately, reaching.
Please, please talk about me.
No.
No chance.
No shot.
Here's one from Holy P-
Holy P-
Chris is not a Republican.
He's a rhino.
He hasn't done it.
One thing can even be characterized as being remotely conservative and most of his proposals are typical of a Democrat mindset.
Maybe that's because he's gay.
Who the hell knows?
Your governor.
All the six got hit back to three to one.
That's a really good sign.
That's a good sign.
What were those chicksticks or whatever we were talking about yesterday?
I don't recall the name.
I looked at him and I thought, well, maybe.
I don't know.
And maybe not forever.
You did what?
They're ancient.
The bitter off, forever.
So we got 10 minutes till the second race.
It's going to go off at 144.
The one is two to one.
The two is nine to five.
And the six is third choice.
Three to one.
And those three keep like road rotating.
Five to two on the one.
Nine to five on the two.
Three to one on the six.
Yada, yada, yada.
Anybody here?
No.
Cliff cares whoever Cliff is.
Are contestant on the pick up pony deal.
Now, when you go back out there again March 27, did you say correct?
Wow, what a memory.
And I think this time the station ought to give you like maybe five, six hundred bucks to plunge your guts on the first two races.
Do you think that makes sense?
It sure does.
Weel some triples and bet on some cripples and whatever, you know.
Seven to two on the six nine dollar house.
Pretty interesting.
The way in the five is taken somebody to.
Eon.
It'll be an Eon before he reaches the finish line with Cornelio Velasquez.
There's your horrejo Velasquez and John Velasquez and Cornelio.
Lots of Velasquez is in so many little time.
Four horses getting bent in the seven horse field.
Well, that means it's wide open.
Is that what that means?
Is that what that means?
Oh, boy, here's one from Ricardo Santorea, whatever the hell his name is.
He started yesterday.
John and Lake Worth is also wondering, again, two, he must be bored today.
The guy who emailed you was partially correct when he said it was entirely the fault of the people about these homes.
Oh, it goes on and on and on and on.
Okay, let's do the break a little early because we don't want to miss the race.
Oh, Neil!
You're listening to Neil Rogers.
Neil Rogers.
God.
I was riding on a train to Austin, Texas.
Oh, and a very lovely lady said next to mine.
When she got a ticket, she asked to buy what holds her sight.
I was more than happy too.
And now there's more I'd like to do.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
I want to whisper, so we've nothing in her rear.
I want to hold her behind closed doors and more.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
When she returned, she said she was an actress.
She showed me an album of pictures of her opening, which she then said she'd known.
She seemed as if she could be, but I could clearly see.
She was the kind of girl whose old man's heart's system right now.
Right now.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
I want to whisper, so we've nothing in her rear.
I want to hold her behind closed doors and more.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
Well, I'll never forget that train ride down to Austin.
We share the sweet, and we shared our tales.
But as my heart tries to leave her behind, regrets are all not fine.
Because I hope that you'll get that girl in the end.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
You're fair.
I want to whisper, so we've nothing in her rear.
I want to hold her behind closed doors and more.
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.
What an excellent timing.
Thank you.
144.
Post time.
They're going to the gate.
Are they good?
That's excellent.
I mean, they're like, poaching around their body.
They're approaching the Greek.
You ever so slowly.
Who made you can't see it?
And the bad, well, the good news is it's a price, nine to two, $11 horse if he wins.
Because the money, the two got plunged down out of six to five, almost even money.
That's the next needle horse.
One is five to two.
Five is four to one, and the six is the fourth choice of nine to two.
Might as well get a price once you already made the bet.
You know what I'm saying?
Right.
They're going to the gate.
There's the doose.
He'll be followed by a native.
Nader and Broadway Bobby.
Talk about a loser, that old Nader.
E on the next one.
Apsulacha season, the seven post.
And the last two to load are burning blaze and bio hazard.
Nine to two, $11 times 50 is $275 for Cliff if we win.
Confidence is minimal.
You know what I mean by that?
No.
Well, we'll see.
I'm going to use the bottom of them.
Can't win them.
Can't pick a winner every week.
I'm picking it.
The bio hazard up to the outside gate.
With ET beard no less.
Wow.
Been off a long time.
And the horse too.
And the only line.
They're in the gate.
Six looks like he wants to just fly out of there and he didn't.
He came out awkwardly.
I don't know why he's in there.
He's in there.
Todd got even an e-honor right there.
Burning blaze is over.
Running in fourth and then high rule later and brought way close to the base.
He's about to like something.
He run up the back stretch.
Now he's stirred.
Got even on the inside and e-hon.
They're right together on the leave and burning blaze is just off of them.
And high right there.
Let me tell you right now.
He's got a horse.
He's third.
Outside of them comes bio hazard.
Broadway.
What do you think?
Is trailing the field.
I don't know.
Can't see the four lengths.
Two and a five.
Four, six is still on the outside.
Twenty-three and two.
Todd got even an neck in front.
E-hon to the outside.
The five is pressing the two.
And here comes the six.
Moving up on the outside.
He's got some horse.
They're in third.
High rule is pushed along fourth along the rail.
Nader right alongside.
Outside of them bio hazard and Broadway, Bobby Z.
And two and a five.
Still side by each.
Todd got even an e-hon.
And the six is right there.
Thirty-six and two.
Come on, A-bar, I-bar.
He's in high order.
He's in this good field.
And they've left the others behind.
Good on the buzzer.
Coming to the top of the stretch.
It's Todd got even grinding out a narrow distance.
And we had to turn for home.
The damn two.
The next two.
The next two.
Still second.
And the six is hanging behind them.
And burning blazes fourth.
And the final for long.
Todd got even an Joe Bravo.
Have the lead.
Todd, I'll tell you.
Bet the chalk.
Yeah.
Nix Zito in the two.
Two on the rail.
Todd got even wins it.
Sorry, Cliff.
He was right there.
Most of the race and then puked his guts.
The two.
The chalk.
Who got one?
Three to two.
That's five bucks.
Right.
It's 125 bucks for Cliff if we have picked the two.
I don't want to pick the chalk.
And then Phil Arck is going to say, oh, you shouldn't go with the chalk.
I told you I always bet the chalk.
Screw you, Mr. Ricksburg.
And there are.
There's a little bonus coverage for you like that.
Yeah.
Okay, let's get back to.
Sorry, Cliff.
I gave up my best shot.
I told you the confidence was immediately over.
Tough race, four horse race.
We finished fourth.
Ricardo says about Charlie Christie's not gay.
He just runs naked on the beach with his close friends.
Oh, this is the fake gym defeat of Santana from Alabama.
And you know, I miss these bits and yadda.
I was like, whatever quit living in the past.
Okay, we're doing the best we can.
We had a kick ass January, baby.
Right.
As kicker.
Men 25 54 boy, we still got a shot at some money.
If we get a few more wire diaries, maybe if Betty will help us out.
Come on, Betty.
Of course, Betty's a, well, maybe she can be a man for a month.
Maybe she can be queen for a day.
Betty.
John from Lake Worth says the guy who emailed you was partially correct when he said it was entirely the fall of the people of Bought These Homes only to find they couldn't refinance them later on when their interest rates increased.
I agree with the majority of the people who bought these homes for first time home buyers who only wanted a piece of the American dream.
They wanted a piece.
It's 15 freaking degrees, baby, in Toronto.
59 holy cow.
It's a good thing that they got to go pick up the pizza to a clock.
The oldest delivery, I mean, oldest delivery boy in North America.
Probably not.
The predatory lenders who went on check in a Republican administration who to this day did not believe in any form regulation.
As much as they deregulated, the society sounds good.
It can and will not work.
People get greedy and they're left unchecked.
Well, rape the American people at every turn.
That's right.
Rape like Mo would say gang rape ain't funny or whatever you said.
Is that what Mo said?
All time.
As much as we hate the government telling us what to do, it is imperative to have them be the watchdogs over some aspects of our lives to ensure we're not getting screwed.
Have a nice weekend.
You too, John, the Lake Worth.
And thanks for your perspricated observations.
Whatever that means.
So we found out today some important stuff.
Joey Carr is dead.
The chalk always wins a Gulf Stream.
I'm sure Phil Archer is going to be chiming in and he's like, oh, I told you about the chalk.
Where?
Maybe not.
Here is an interesting just wondering once to know what are the rules of your show?
What is the reason you can't play Farts on?
Because Joyce don't want them.
What happens if he accidentally let one out?
Do you get fine for this too?
Ooh.
Yeah, it's fine.
Joey Reynolds comment on the, how could you be tied for eighth place with W-I-N-Z?
How is this possible?
When is the FCC going to grant the power increase?
You can't hear the station west of the turnpike.
Well, that's part of the problem.
That's how we're tied with W-I-N-Z.
When you can't hear the station, you don't listen to it.
Here is one that says, wow, that was either really exciting where I have absolutely no life.
You're still a man off on the a burning blaze, more like flaming queen.
I'm still going to donate 50 bucks to pet rescue of Miami. Well, good.
Well, the cliff in Kendall, he was a contestant.
I thought it was something.
Then I say that to you when you told me it was cliff, I thought I mentioned that's cliff in Kendall.
Well, sorry, cliff, because you were a good guy and sent us a lot of good email crap and stuff.
And I wish you could have won, but the truck, I just can't keep betting the truck.
My concept of betting at the track is beat the truck, not all the time, but most of the time.
How about eat the truck?
Yeah, eat the truck.
That's usually what you do is eat the truck, 70% of the time.
Rick James says, happy anniversary.
I wrote a poem for you.
Neil, Neil, Neil on the wall.
You're the guest radio host of the mall.
Congratulations from Rick James.
So thanks Rick.
Very creative.
Larry says, when I invited you to the council, I knew you wouldn't go.
Just trying to show you there are some nice listeners out there.
Well, thanks, Larry.
I still think Ruth Chris or Peter Lurgers is better.
What about Morton's?
Is Morton's chop liver or what?
If you eat an Morton's?
Yeah, what's?
I was very good.
You like it?
It was very good.
Oh.
Well, Rita makes the dinner great.
Is when the hard rock comps the $200 check for being a high roller.
Tell George, breathing, breaking bad starts new sunlight.
Okay.
What does that mean?
It's a series I think it's on FX.
Very good.
Oh, Carolman Picard, the attorney used to fax me whom moved to Pittsburgh.
Amber Carolyn?
No.
She was a regular fax here.
I'm calling Ray Charlie, Chris.
I can't get over how no one wonders about him, although it's none of their business.
Anyway, I miss hearing you except when I'm home not working.
Try to get an iPhone.
Why need to get an iPhone?
It's just Carolman.
I'm reading it off the monitor, you know.
In my eyes a little blurry after watching that race.
Six was right there.
Most of the way it was.
He had a good shot.
He was right there in contention.
Then when they came to the top of the stretch, he looked down the stretch like a lot of horses do.
Saw the finish line was way down there.
Anyway, like that.
He peeps his guts.
He went like that.
Six hundred eighty five votes on the pool.
What occupation, although Mucho Macho, is the breeding ground for those in the closet.
Lifeguards, 135, firefighters, 91.
Republicans, 90.
Is that a job?
Well, that's my bad.
Well, I did it well.
Football player, 79, Marine 61, sailors, 45.
Cops 45.
How about what group?
What group group?
Paramedics 42, soldiers 42.
Personal trainer 22.
Bouncers 21.
Karate Blackbelts 12.
Now maybe somebody can explain that to me that last one. Karate Blackbelts.
I've never noticed a correlation.
Oh.
But I only have ever known a couple.
Well, you know, sometimes those belts are on the pantaloonies and you know what's inside the pantaloonies.
Oh, me!
You're nothing to me, Rogers.
