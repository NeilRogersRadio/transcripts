The music expressed on the preview program.
Well, I'll be picking on Payroll now.
Those guests and collars.
And do not reflect those of the people who are paying for it.
It's staffed, advertising, and their spread.
What needs to take on it?
What do you need to say, Lord?
They've got a pretty good voice.
I'm a 6-0 WQM Miami.
For a lot of days.
I get worried just thinking about these people.
George is here today.
He wasn't going to be, but he is surprised.
It's a good guy who is here today.
What do you like that?
I'm not trying to be ambivalent about it, but so.
I'm fine.
I'm a little exiled in the head.
I'm a present in the Neil Rogers shot.
Until the hate and e-mails start coming.
Six-what-bill.
Six-cheating day and brower.
In the cabbage.
Cold cold friend.
All we work in the 7.30.
See today.
Don't tell me we got that.
It's your...
B-D-D.
And Verizon Wireless Phone.
I'm ready to go.
It's over.
His guests or his colleagues.
They didn't know you were going to be here for bells.
They'll follow up.
And sure.
Staff or sponsors.
Now the Neil Rogers show.
On 5.60 WQM.
Oh, you know in D-A-Y-S-U-D-K-S.
Crawford, Texas is a place to be.
And Bryce, clearing is the lab for me.
Under the secret service watch.
Well, I keep these he just give me that starfield sky.
No, Dallas is where I'd rather be.
Redecorated serving tea.
A posh new neighborhood would be my pick.
Georgia, I love you, but I'm not living in the disk.
The chores.
The chores.
Fisher.
It's not fair.
You are my wife.
I hate rants like.
Crawford, Texas, we are there.
10-015-60 WQM.
Happy Monday, February the 9th.
Well, thank goodness this is a short month, you know what?
Yeah.
I don't know why, but thank the Lord.
Thank God.
That's a short month.
Now let's see.
This is 2009, so it's certainly not a leap year.
Great.
Well, we get all confused on those.
You know what's an incident, even number?
Oh, this is last year was a leap year, right?
Right.
Well, 2009, 8 and O'Leap year, and either is next year or whatever.
Here's the pull from Friday, which of these would a real man never do?
Oh, and some of these go.
Cosmetic surgery, 209.
I wonder if Debbie knows about that.
You know Debbie?
No.
Oh, Debbie, Debbie.
Debbie, gosh.
I know, listen to Debbie.
Watch soap operas 145.
Well, I don't watch it anymore, so I'm on the way to becoming a real man, I guess.
What's the cosmetic surgery?
Baby steps.
We'll have you cup in a booby and no time.
Where are crocs?
135.
I don't wear crocs.
See?
But now we get to use body wash 56.
That is so stupid, man.
Those 56 people have voted for that ought to be horsewit.
Especially, no, they have that really macho body wash like access.
Oh, they've had those from the beginning since body wash came out.
Old spice for people who want to smell like old musty mothballs.
What?
Like old men?
Yeah, like old musty old men.
Use a body wash.
Give me a break.
Soap, soap, and out with knickers.
What's with you people?
Slow.
Cryoidem movie 52.
Order a Dachary 39.
Pay for sex 36.
Rollerblade 28.
Take Dan Thleffin's 24.
Drive a Prius 22.
But if you take Dan Thleffin's, then you could be on that dance show.
Dancing with the star with Payrod.
Drive a Prius 22.
Wear flip flops 21 and eat Keesh 14.
Well, wow.
See, I never understood that.
Well, what is it about Keesh that makes you not a real man?
I don't know.
They had that book.
Didn't they, Real Men Don't Eat Keesh?
It was a joke.
But that means something.
Somebody makes that up and right away people buy into it.
How about Don Eat Keesh?
Because it's the...
Yucky.
Yeah, that's a much better reason.
Because it tastes like crab.
Mushi.
Bumushi.
We don't like mushi foods on this show, okay?
I'll tell you what else I don't like.
And that is these goofballs across the street who think that they're going to sucker me into...
Getting into a big thing with them.
I don't care about them, okay?
790 as far as I'm concerned was WNWS.
That's a long time ago.
Many, many years and moons ago.
The crap that they got on there now, Dennis Collins being the loser that he is, it's a crap.
And I got an email here.
I'll just read the first paragraph.
Am I going to read all the rest?
Because I'm not getting the sucker in there.
Interferternal problems, whatever they are.
Hello, Neil.
I'm a somewhat disgruntled employee of 790.
So as a former release and revenge, I will update you on goings-on here across the street.
Mainly because you'll put these things on the air and actually embarrass the people I want to be embarrassed.
Now, actually, I won't.
Believe me, everyone here listens to you.
As long as they don't admit it in public, your rating shows are piped in without any hesitation.
And then it goes on and on about some problem ahead with some sponsor and yadda, which I don't care.
Little birdie at 790, it says.
Well, great.
Send me some spy reports on something that somebody might care about because this one we absolutely don't care.
I know it comes as a shock to our middle and upper level management people that we don't care on this show about 790.
We don't care.
They don't even exist.
We're not running the same format.
They can talk about all the balls and ball games they want and it's got nothing to do with us.
Right?
Absolutely.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
There you go.
So thank you so much for your very boring spy report.
Terminal ponderous.
We all listen as if that's a shock, as if I don't know that.
Obsessed.
You don't just listen.
You're obsessed.
Obsessed with...
Sorry, I can't share the obsession.
I don't really care about those people.
They can't complain about the numbers because except for love it, they haven't gotten any.
So what are they talking numbers for?
I don't know.
They keep trying to talk themselves into some kind of a standing in a marketplace in the business and they don't have it.
You can't have any kind of a standing if you don't have any audience.
Just ask us.
We'll tell you.
How come I don't hear...
I don't know.
I'm not hearing really like...
Like what?
Myself.
Well, there you go.
A little bit better.
It seems like the level...
You got to come to me.
No, well you're cranked up as much as I can crank you in here.
And...
And nothing.
Well, what does that mean?
Nothing.
That means you can turn your own monitor up.
That's all you can do.
I just did.
Good.
Don't start giving me like little mini lectures here on how to run the board.
I would never think.
How to run this equipment.
You've never even seen this studio much less than in it.
No.
So I'm the only one who knows how to run these machines, man.
What addiction is the most destructive?
We did not put Crystal meth on there, which I had a couple of emails saying, oh you left the meth.
Yeah, and should I?
Too late now.
Well, I mean, if you want to, go ahead.
What?
Go ahead!
Well, I don't know how much longer I'm going to leave this thing up here.
You know.
It all depends.
I just put the meth on there.
You put it on there?
Yeah.
Why you ever done it?
No.
What addiction is the most destructive?
You don't have to answer that.
No, it's the answer.
No, it's the answer.
Oh, yes, there's no.
Oh.

Huffing and puffing and roll the house down.
A compulsive spending 11.
Gambling 11.

You've got to find you a good machine, man.
Oxy-content 10.
Oxy's ever reminds me of a big fat tub of turd that is on the radio.

Cutting 2.
Cutting what?
Yourself.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, like, what movie was that in?
Hmm.
Well, first of all, what's his name?
Matt Damon did it and tell them Mr. Ripley.
Remember, he had that razor blade in his bathrobe when Marge came to the door.
And the blood hit a white bathroom, and the blood was kind of like their conspicuous on the bathroom.
Or whatever it was.
Cutting 2.
Dieting 2.
Who was the other one that did the cutting thing?
Was that the bitch in Rebecca D. Morena?
Or was the movie?
The hand that rocks the Canadian?
Wasn't she cutting?
She was real cut up.
I saw that one time.
Really?
Yeah.
That's a good flick.
I like it.
Just fine.

Still playing that show intro to call Neil.
Yeah, go ahead, call it.
This is me.
We're going to talk to you.
We've played the show intro.
And if you want to call, go ahead.
Right.
If I want to take the calls, I will.
And if not, I won't.
That's the way it works.
Oh, here we go.
Roger Schmendrich says the most destructive addiction to Neil Roger show.
Oh, God.
Wow.
How sad.
How sad and how about looking and how idiotic?
How about our great governor building the taxpayers?
$425,000 in private plane trips.
Way to go, Charlie.
Chris, it says.
Oh, this is my financial guy again.
I'm factoring you a bunch of pages.
You need to sign them and send it back by regular mail.
I'm about to be great.
Here they are right here as a matter of fact.
Should I read them?
And close our three pages need to be sent back to me by mail.
You need to write your driver's license on page one.
What are these?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I just trust this guy and you know what happens when you trust people with your money.
A fool and his money are soon farted.
And that what they say?
They do say that.
So, 540 votes on that poll.
It's okay.
It's all right.
What's that schedule look like for today?
I'm sure that everybody's on the edge of their seats waiting.
We got the big ol' at 2 o'clock mad dog 4 to 7.
Dolphins tonight, 7 to 8, and then the D H O A 2.
I'm pretty pristine schedule.
Nobody's out and about.
We got no ball games today where they had the pro bowl last night.
I watched about 40 seconds of that.
Now, maybe 20 seconds.
The pro bowl.
Oh, how ponderous.
I mean, you talk about anti-climactic.
Why do they even play those stupid games like the NHL All Star game, the Major League Baseball?
All those non-binding, and they're like exhibition contests.
I mean, they play exhibition games in sports to get teams ready for the regular season, right?
Yes.
But then when the season's over, just get rid of it already.
That's it.
Take it by the next year.
Bye-bye.
No, we have to have the pro bowl and all this other crap.
Aren't you tired of crap?
Oh, please.
There's one thing.
Let me tell you right now that life is too full of it.
Oh, God.
So tired of crap.
Speaking of crap, Anne Colter is now the subject of a formal probe by Connecticut's Election Enforcement Commission.
Moving or closer to being charged with fraud.
Right.
Which is a scary, hateful sound.
The commission is not conducting a thorough investigation whether the prolific conservative pundit.
By the way, there's no such word as pundits.
There's no second end in pundit.
If there's a word that's mispronounced more than let me ask you a question.
It's pundit.
Pundit.
Not pundits.
Yeah, you know what I see even these supposing.
Oh, sit there with a notebook and write down all the things that they say wrong like on dirty,
pundits and things.
They throw the language right out the window.
Yeah, idiots, A-holes.
Through investigation whether the prolific conservative pundit broke the law earlier this decade by voting in a Connecticut in Connecticut while living in New York City.
A spokeswoman for the commission told the New York Daily News.
The media centric publishing powerhouse voted in Connecticut in 2002 and 2004, even though she was living in New York City.
In fact, Coder bought a posh $1.49 million condo on the Upper East Side during that period according to the Daily News, miserable bitch.
The Coder claimed on voting forms.
She lived with her parents in Connecticut at the same time.
Ross Dury reported in January.
Connecticut officials are responded with a formal complaint filed by conservative coderwatch.com blogger Dan Bortchers.
For over 10 years Aunt Mancoder has gotten away with illegal immoral and unethical behavior, ranging from plagiarism to defamation,
perjury to voter fraud Bortchers is claimed.
She declined to comment.
Connecticut stated, attorney,
theater or brownlee told a private investigator last month,
a Connecticut voter must list a residence address in the state where you actually live.
It's not enough to claim a relative's house where you may visit.
Bitch.
And remember where she had the same thing in West Palm Beach.
She had the same thing lying about where she had let her official residence was and voting where she wasn't supposed to vote.
And y'all, typical, phony, right-wing, self-hating, soull.

Oh, yeah, just like Sid the kid the new meat on the block
He was gonna come in and whip everybody's ass. He was gonna kick my ass
Then they put him on in the morning, which was an even bigger mistake and he's got one shares. Oh my god
Right, let me say it again you people over there across the street keep talking and keep losing and then all of a sudden when they pull the plug in the side that they've had enough
Losing good luck to you because you'll eat it

The chicken was pretty good. Kenny Rogers roasters never tried it. That's all right
Hey, Neil and George happy Monday
Do you got a couple more days before I get out of South Florida for a week?
Well after George's favorite place Mexico believe me. It's much needed
I think meth is really the most destructive. I thank Neil God
I didn't grow up on the west coast where it originated from
Having done exactly oh, I see another designer drugs in my youth. I'm sure I might have said yes
Is some of that stuff too? I've seen before and after a picture of people on meth and believe me nothing compares to the brutality of the transformation

What if I get it too all these anonymous a holes after Brandon conversely. He actually likes the show
First he says cosmetic surgery if you continue to get surgeries
You're asking for trouble at some point because one of them will most likely go bad
Then he says I don't comment too often on the actual show
But I've noticed lately both you and George seem to be on your A game these days
I know it's hard to be on your A game when you have the station on your back tongue
You'll no longer be getting the money you would like or in George's case actually need however the shows have been pretty good lately
Says Brandon. How do you like that? Thank you, Brandon. Brandon's happy as opposed to Golden Boy across the street
Oh, we're gonna whip your ass. We're gonna. You're done your life is so bad
Yeah, you should have my life. I'll say this about Brandon
With yes, do disrespect to Josh Cordis when Brandon writes an email. It's usually contributing something. Yes
That's why I read them all right because he contributes something like you as opposed to whether they do it don't
Here's bad news for George oh no
Cannabis linked to testicular cancer. Oh my god. Well
The soaring rate of testicular cancer in the UK and other Western countries is linked today to the increased popularity of cannabis
Testicular cancer is more than doubled
Over the past 30 years and the rise parallels use of cannabis Britain's most popular illegal drug
researchers in the US have found that many regularly smoke cannabis have a 70% increased risk of
Testicular cancer cancer of the nuts. Oh no
The risk was highest twice of that who never used the drug and those who smoke at least once a week or add a long history of use
beginning in adolescence
George
Yeah, the study is based on findings from 369 men with testicular cancer were questioned about their history of cannabis use
The results were compared with 979 men who did not have cancer
cannabis was linked with test
Testicular cancer independently of smoking drinking and family history. Let me just say this if you want to make a lot of those sound effects
Okay, oh well, okay, two good thing. I don't need them anymore
Experts from cancer research UK said it was the first time a link had been suggested in the signs of the study was small
And so were the testicles more than three million people smoke cannabis only a tiny portion develop the cancer so don't get all bent out of shape
Wow
There were 2109 cases of testicular cancer in Britain's two of thousand five 78 deaths
In 1975 there were 850 cases unlike other cancers. It's most common in young men with a peak incidence between the ages of 20 and 40
So maybe you're out of the woods or maybe you're just out in the woods

P.s. I give serious until April to survive now someone actually wants to buy the thing and here's the story
The Wall Street urinal reports that serious XM chief melt carmas and is scrambling to raise about 175 million bucks to fend off and take over threat from
Charlie Irgun's Echo Star Corp. Oh, let's scramble and see if we can't raise 175 bucks not million just bucks
Then you could plunge your guts this Friday of costume. No, you're not gonna be there this week
Now by the way the horse that I picked on Friday one by a head that's two winners and three weeks in both of them one by a head. That's job
Yeah, if I do say so myself boy just desperately hanging on
Irgun ranked by Forbes is the 35th richest man in America worth one 8.1 billion
Has been buying up series's XM's debt to the two and a 400 million since late summer
Wow
Sirius has been in talks for several weeks with Echo Star which holds around 400 million dollars of the satellite radio companies dead people for major with a matter of be saying
Echo Star chairman and CEO Charles Irgun who's believed to be seeking control of Sirius has been accumulating Sirius debts since late summer the people said
Echo Star holds most of the 175 million in Sirius debt expiring in February and owes more than
Oens more than half of a 400 million dollar tranche coming due in December a tranche
Both stakes were purchased from hedge funds
Sirius's total debt load was is 320
3.25 billion dollars
Sirius did not respond to request for comment
See if they had a sense of humor at Sirius which they obviously don't that's long gone with all the tourists
They got under stock down like 13 cents
If they had a sense of humor they would have responded and just said long me thirsty dollars, right?
That would have been musing but right they didn't say nothing
The journal describes the process of takeover by acquiring debt is unorthodox strategy and one that could backfire
Carman's in successfully murdered Sirius with XM satellite radio in July 2008
Irgun was
Ranked the number one richest medium ogreland Forbes recent breakdown of billionaires by industry
He's got a lot of money. So why does he just take his money and go have a good time somewhere?
That's why I understand like the thing with pay rod

For the 19th consecutive year the mayor of Toronto pro-claim February 6th is Bob Marley day. Oh, it's already gone
I got to do a choice during the next break by the way, so from not back your luck good. I'll load something up
Why didn't I didn't choice this morning? I don't know why?

here, here, here, here, here, here, here, that can, you know, you treads have Cinema over. andơi
What I heard. I did.
Oh, am I gonna have to look it up in a book?
Oh, you got the commercial.
The real thing.
What I heard.
I got hanged by a tale.
I got a lot of songs to start with.
I like to hear the world of singers.
The new singers and the hillside singers.
I won out of two ain't bad.
They both done it.
I think the one you were playing was by the new speakers.
The commercials.
I'll take your word for it.
It's not labeled on my little thingy here.
The new speakers.
Let me look up the new speakers.
Why are you looking for whatever we were looking for?
That song that he's got the wrong name on it.
I love to change the world.
You know the song.
I'll find it.
If it's not in my collection, I'll download it.
But you know the song.
I do. How do you know that?
Because I know.
It's not a...
What do I really like that I'm looking at here in the book?
The new colony six.
Things I'd like to say.
I will always think about you.
That's a good song.
I just mentioned it.
Who am I looking for?
New what?
New speakers.
I don't see the new speakers.
Maybe if I look under speakers, maybe if you seek, you shall find.
During my life, I've done a lot of seeking and a lot of finding.
I have to be honest.
I have to be honest.
Neil Sedacca, the seeds, oh the seekers.
But it doesn't have the new seeker.
I don't understand what that's all about.
Now what's the other one?
Hillside singers?
There's Neil Sedacca.
He's married with a whole bunch of kids.
I know that surprises a lot of you.
Or if anybody ever acted really.
Yeah. Oh my.
You having a good time?
Everybody having a good time?
He was lighter than a limp.
Who?
Neil Sedacca. Oh yeah.
But married with a hundred kids like Peter Sittira from Chicago.
There's another one.
A lady. But with lots of kids.
Hillside singers. I'd like to use the words adopted from a Coca-Cola jingle.
What does that mean? I don't understand that.
Pop vocal group and it's got a list of a hundred names.
Do do do down do do down.
Throwing up is hard to do.
Do do down down.
Do do down.
I've got this from a Coca-Cola jingle.
Breaking up is hard to do.
See you don't have the Hillside singers and I'd like to taste.
Not that we need to hear both.
We didn't need to hear that other one either.
But it sure killed some sweet time and that's what we're here for.
To kill four hours a day baby and make your day go by fast and put a little smile on your push.
To go through.
Wow.
And turn it into a little.
Go and ask Vance.
To slow it.
This is it.
You want to buy the Rollside singer if you want.
Oh my god. I'm saying to slow it.
I don't know.
I wasn't paying close to Kathy once to the ordinary King aka Mr. Radio.
Was eight times a day by mixing with you about that.
Yes.
Whatever happened to miss a sidekick.
Tomacic.
Canna Maria Tomacic.
She became a chicken ex sidekick for a while.
She did vote for him.
She went to California but I wouldn't call her that.
Wouldn't call her what?
Anyone's sidekick.
No. She did some votes.
She was great.
She's not what I'm sorry.
Steve says the new seekers.
We just got through saying that Steve.
What's wrong with you man?
He's a little slow.
Tim and Tampa just stepped out of my car a few minutes wondering if you got in my email.
Yeah. I got you in my suggestion is don't start.
Just like I told you last week.
Neil, did you ever have anything to do with WBF and Rochester?
Yeah, I listened to it.
Not a bad station in the mid 60s especially one DJ named Jack Palvino.
No, I remember Jack Palvino.
He sucked.
I don't remember him.
I remember who was on that station.
WBF, home of the busy bees.
That was their logo.
Home of the busy bees.
Nick Nixon, he was one of them.
Joe, something or other.
And Jack Palvino.
It says another interesting Rochester station was WSAY.
Oh, yeah, interesting.
Erasatz.
They play racie rock and roll all day and then at five every day they have a prayer service with a bunch of nuns.
Channing, Hail Mary Fuller, Gracie on it.
That's right.
Pete and Tampa says.
Blessed is the fruit of that womb Jesus.
WSAY, why?
I almost worked there.
I went in audition for a job there and they were trying to harm me but then I think I started in the table.
WSAY, why?
Horrible.
But they heard a bunch of kids.
That's why I almost got to work there.
They went hard again and they had names for the kids.
Everybody was like either Nick Nixon or Joe Jones or Tom Thomas or Timmy, you know, like that.
What's that?
Ten years after.
You know this song, is it?
Oh, I love this song.
I love this song.
I don't like it.
I love it.
I think it's the world.
You're fair, right?
Yeah.
Okay, that's a great song.
I do like it a lot and I do know it and the two bad we can't play it all.
Holy Makin'ah!
This is Joe Boyle on the Voice of the Toronto May Beliefs and you're listening to the Hockey Authority Niel God.
United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people.
Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator and with his aggression.
Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait.
It's just the way it's going to ferry.
I'm too in space and blow away this heat.
I'm too in space and blow away this heat.
I'm too in space and blow away this heat.
I'm too in space and blow away this heat.
I'm too in space and blow away this heat.
I'm too in space and blow away this heat.
I'm too in space and blow away this heat.
Oh my God, that song was so overplayed on and I'm so sorry that we thought about it today.
Yeah.
And then of course we had to put up with the commercials too, you know?
Right.
The Coke commercials.
I liked it.
Hey, hey, hey, whatever.
That was good compared to some things.
Like what?
Compared to what?
Like most of the other commercials.
At least that was a pleasant tune.
Yeah, Sodom said it was a great compared to death by hanging.
Yeah.
How come they hung the son of a bit so fast?
And the reason the answer being that they didn't want the word to get out, you know?
But the fact that he was a CIA student and we stuck him in there in the first place.
That's right.
Now here's an email that's going to get you frosted.
Speaking of frosted flakes.
Well, when somebody sent me an email, oh, that was last week about Cocoa Puffs or some crap like that.
And I got news for a man frosted flakes beat a bomb.
That's where it's at.
Frosted flakes.
I could eat like a whole family sized box right out of the box.
Just shovel it down.
And guess what I had last night for a snack.
Frosted flakes.
No.
Remember we were talking about those popcorn, the cheese, the white cheese.
Oh, yeah.
In the black bag.
All kinds of things.
Maybe you're going to die.
What?
You're going to die up there.
Oh, I am.
I blood sugar is bad.
In fact, you know how long my blood sugar has been bad?
Too long?
You're in a half.
That's bad.
You're in a half.
Bad.
Now today it could be good.
Could be.
You think it will?
Maybe.
Maybe I won't have a candy bar before I go off to woodbind it too.
Maybe I will.
Maybe I will, yeah.
You know, you could have played that whole thing.
Go ahead.
Maybe I do.
Oh, what happened to it?
It's all distorted now.
What do you mean?
Maybe I do.
Oh, it is?
Yeah.
Oh, somebody's been in their pot, asking you around with your droppings.
I wouldn't be surprised if it's flee.
I got it.
flee.
He's our friend.
Trying to think of anybody else in the building who's our friend.
I can't think of anybody right now.
Duff.
What's?
Who?
Oh, Duff.
Duff, of course.
Duff's a great guy.
It's too bad that they've screwed him over so bad.
But that's the price you pay when you're a good guy.
And at, you know, a stick it to you when you're not in on the fraternity.
They stick it to you.
And from what says would be the first time.
Anyway, speaking of that, it's a great segue.
We're in this email that you're not going to like.
It's from the fake Larry King who I guess must be Fred Souter.
Why do you say that?
It says, didn't Fred Souter and then in quotes go out with Annemarie as well?
Where does she got around?
It says.
Well, that's not Fred Souter, first of all.
How do you know that?
Well, if Fred Souter did go out with her, which I don't believe that he did,
No, I don't think she'd go out with him.
He wouldn't be talking smack about her.
How do you know that?
Because Fred's a good guy.
And he emails us under his real name.
Right.
So who's the fake Larry King?
How would he know about Fred Souter and Annemarie?
Huh?
The fake whoever the F, the fake fill in the blank is somebody.
Is somebody who listens a lot or used to work with you?
No.
It's somebody who worked at IOD back in that period of time.
Right. I said, I said, who listens a lot or used to work with us?
No, definitely used to work there.
Maybe one of the engineers.
Maybe Steve Ziegler, with that big screwdriver and that bad hair piece.
Hey, Steve O, you're ferries.
I'm sorry.
Anyway, moving along.
So that's not for its owner.
No.
Did she get around?
Excuse me?
It's just a rhetorical question.
Here is one that says from the fake Larry King again,
Frosted flakes aren't good.
They're great.
Cocoa crispy's are great too.
Yeah, Tony the Tigers says they're great.
They are.
That would be a good poll to take about the most annoying, overplayed song of all time.
That has to be one of them.
I'd like to teach the word, oh, God.
And let me, let me give you another one that they played into the ground.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is left over's number five.
Over and over.
Right?
On Thanksgiving day, everybody ate the food.
Over and over.
Well, I guess maybe that's why it was called over and over.
Neil, I just got this.
Why do you set it again about?
I'd love to change the world.
Thank you.
I got it first time.
We did a whole segment on any sense of it again.
Jim and Tallahassee says,
I know you really don't like doing jokes while we don't.
Curator funny one today.
I thought I would share it comes from another of your faithful listeners, David Melbourne.
Shortly after Michael Phelps endorsement contract with Kellogg's have been terminated, he announced
he had signed another endorsement contract for a different serial.
The new contract is for Wee-Dees spelled.
Well, you know how?
W-E-E.
R-R-O-O-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U.
What our friend is trying to tell us is,
I have no love.
Too much time in my hands.
That's a good song.
Who did that?
Too much time in my hands.
Sticks.
Sticks.
Wow.
Sticks?
Yes.
For some strange reason, I've forgotten all about sticks.
There is your president.
No, there's my for our president.
For great.
We need to transport this new energy.
We gotta get out of the habit of saying there is your president.
Because when the previous one was there, I didn't want any part of him.
So it was always you were meeting anybody else's.
That energy can get to Chicago and can get to St. Louis and get to other places all across the country.
You found a whole meeting in Elkhart, Indiana.
Have you ever been there?
No.
You don't wanna.
What's that?
Sticks.
Too much time in my hands.
Yes.
I love that song.
It's not the best word.
It's what?
Not their best word.
No.
This is it.
Well, we said we were going oldies.
That was the moment.
We're going oldies on QAM.
We're spinning it into oldies.
We're spinning some racks.
Oh, sorry.
Okay, that's enough.
You know a group that I really think is very underrated?
That nobody ever talks about.
It's one of the greatest groups in the world.
I agree with you.
One of the most just fantastic original sensational.
Yep.
Rocky says.
Sorry.
Oh, George is just, yeah, I was gonna say, go ahead.
But I didn't.
Rocky says the song was written by Jack Benson.
He was a part-time actor and songwriter.
Oh, he's talking about, I'd like to teach that we're a Coca-Cola company stole the song from him.
We used it for advertising, for advertising, Coca-Cola the holidays.
It was then licensed by Coca-Cola to different groups who covered it.
Jack Benson was a friend of my parents.
That's how I know the story says, the real Rocky.
How do you like that?
Medium.
New York City Dave says, Fred Souter loves your show way too much to waste your time on phony emails.
Well, we know that.
That is correct.
He's a good guy, very ugly, but a good guy.
Incredibly ugly.
Looks like his head has been run through a meat grinder?
Would that be an exaggeration?
No, no.
He's a friend.
I mean, it's probably for me to talk about uglyness because, but at least I admit to it, he's a good guy.
He loves his leg.
He knows he's like him and he's uglier than ugly.
Wow.
Now that's going a little bit too far.
I think you hear that, Fred.
George said you're uglier than death.
He's a freaking Frankenstein, man.
He's like, what?
He's like, what do you want a bad day?
He knows.
You remember him that well, but...
Tampa, Tampa says, I understand you don't want to be a star with a slot machines.
It's a bad, bad habit to get into, which could be very expensive.
I have to try it, and I'm dying to play the Wheel of Fortune after listening to you.
They call it Wheel of Torture, those of us who play it often.
For a good reason, Tim, Wheel of Torture.
If any of your listeners could email you some good tips on which the denomination is best to play.
What does that mean which denomination is best to play?
Whatever you can afford.
Just don't play no five dollars.
Play a Catholic.
That denomination.
I was wondering if one denomination pays out better than the other.
The other dollars are good.
They're great.
If you win.
If you lose, lose your ass.
If you can afford quarters in Vegas, they've probably got like Nichols now.
They've got Nichols for everything.
Nichols and pennies and two senses.
And then the multiples.
Well, it's 100 lines times five credits, 500 times two.
So you're playing like 10 bucks a spin.
It's like a 2 cent machine.
Watch out for the multiples, Tim.
They're going to get you.
See, all this slot talk, and I was thinking maybe later I'll go.
I don't know, but now...
Now that Paco's got a busy day,
and I'm not going to be able to converse to later on in the evening,
I'm going to 2 o'clock put my shoes because my cabbie don't work on Monday.
Okay.
So I've got to have that tough assignment of driving that beautiful Corvette to whip out.
You know, the beautiful blue one, the 2004 Corvette.
Right.
That's like brand new.
Yeah.
Got 7,000 miles on it.
Maybe I'll sell it on the year.
Maybe we'll sell all of our...
All of our possessions on the year.
To get ready for the depression, you know.
Good plan, everybody.
Oh, and who's standing in front of the camera?
Coming out, coming around.
Thank you all for coming.
Oh, somebody's holding a sign.
Somebody was standing in front of the camera and blocking out the president.
Now whoever's doing that oughta be drugged and dragged away.
Oh, Neil!
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Huh?
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
Who's a curse Monday?
Yes.
If I parted in heaven,
would I stand the shame?
If I parted in heaven, would the Lord she smell?
Send me straight to hell.
Absolutely.
Or can anybody smell up in heaven?
Does gas act the same?
Does it linger in heaven?
Hey, Gravel!
Would you be ashamed to pull my finger in heaven?
I'll know these things when the fat lady sings
Because I'll be the one who brings tears to heaven
Because I know I'll be the one who brings
1234-26-1-560 WQAM, the sun is shining, it's just beauty
You know what's going to be 52 here on Wednesday?
Rain?
52.
Yeah.
And Friday it was 9 in all time record.
Broke the all time record for that date in February.
9.
Yes?
Yeah.
I got my car and I thought to myself, man, it's pretty warm for a February.
And I looked on the little thing where it tells you what the temperature is outside.
And this thing isn't working now all of a sudden.
Oh no!
It's not working.
How do you like that?
My keyboard is not what?
Uh oh.
Yeah, I did.
I didn't want to play Robert Creeper, you know?
And I can't blame it.
What's the story?
Is he still hanging out there a little bit or not?
I don't know.
Oh, please.
Please tell me no.
And if you don't take a look at the weekend, let's look at the weekend schedule.
See if Geldie's on this weekend.
Don't see it.
I don't see it.
I see the beast on their Saturday 4 to 7 right in the middle of the afternoon when people are awake.
Scary.
And the big O is on 9 to 1.
Boy, that poor baby's got to work six days a week to eat out of living.
What a shame.
But I don't see no Geldie at all.
At all.
Wow.
Too bad Leo, the Geldie lover turned out to be a John ZTR, you know?
Oh, well, I'm sure we'll find a real one.
I'm sure Geldie will find somebody out there, some stalker in Radio Land.
Larry from the North says, KDC, I won't read the word he uses.
I can't.
See you next time.
KDC tried her best to get prayer and God into the interview with a Hudson River pilot last night on 60 minutes.
She said, did you start praying when the plane lost power?
He said he was a little bit too busy just then to start praying and he would let the people in the back of the plane do it for him.
He made her look stupid, which isn't very difficult.
Then she did almost the same thing when talking to the passengers as she tried to get them to cry and the whole thing was dripping with emotion and dramatic music.
I thought 60 minutes was a lot more mature than all this bullshit, but it's not what a stupid bitch I was screaming at the TV.
So Larry, I told my wife I didn't want to watch this Schmidt anymore and she agreed we turned the TV to something else.
Anything else, please crack your please no more KDC you next time.
Please.
So tax cuts targeted to working families are the most effective means of stimulus that we can provide to the economy.
Now, you're making another point though that has to do with a separate part of what we're going to need to get this economy moving again.
He's much better.
He's a person to be American president. I'll say that right now. He's much too articulate and too intelligent after we had eight years of that.
Nigel says hello, Neil and George, slumdog millionaire is a great movie and deserves every bit of hype it's gotten.
Unlike many of the so called critically acclaimed movie, slumdog has got no boring parts.
I was hooked from the opening scene and I'm more of a hard-ass than George.
So my opinion and also my opinion free to Pinto is one of the hottest is how to six alive free to Pinto.
Okay, you know who that is?
No.
Wow, Google.
I wonder she's kind of Joey Pinto.
You know who Joey Pinto is, don't you?
No.
You don't know that's Joey's real.
Oh, Joey Reynolds. Yeah. Yeah. Joey Pinto.
I am that him right.
For some reason, I didn't like commit match, you know, to memory committed to memory.
I can't blame you.
But you remember Bill Martian. Yeah.
He was my favorite.
Joey sidekick.
The mole says although I'm boycott in Kellogg's right now, that's like George and craft.
Same thing for a bison.
Not unlike.
He should try smart start from Kellogg's frosted place for adults.
He has a post of craft.
I don't need cereal.
Yes.
So the craft Kellogg's does make something good every now and again.
No.
What's wrong with craft?
Everything.
How about craft macaroni and cheese, man?
Fowl.
It's all foul.
It's all foul.
Everything is foul.
Wow.
They'll beat them nearly all the way.
Anyway, it's frosted place for adult smart start.
Great cereal.
Since I smoked the wheat, I will not be purchasing anymore, but it rocks.
Smart start if you had it?
No.
What is it?
Oh.
I'm looking at pictures of free to Pinto and I'll be really busy for a little while here.
Wait, is she that hot?
She's very hot.
Wow.
Is she as hot as, um, what's his name?
Ryan Philippi?
Wait, way hotter than whatever his name might happen to be.
Oh, Ryan Philippi.
And he, his Georgia's great.
I like him.
And when he and Flea are together, has fat Chris and Joe Belbrookin up.
They made a great big fat couple.
Yeah.
They've, uh, they've had an ugly split.
I believe they've had a parting of the gateways.
Won't see them together.
No mole.
And you know, we don't get those emails anymore.
Don't get emails from emails from the fake clearance from the fake fat Chris.
Sticks best song is light up everybody.
Jeff Lynn is E.L.O.
He was the SNL band, produced the traveling Will Bereson was the guy you can't name.
Produced Tom Petty's best album was in the Blues Brothers.
So I agree.
Jeff Lynn is great.
What does that mean?
The guy you can't name.
I didn't know we were trying to name him.
I know, Jeff Lynn.
Do you know Jeff Cohen?
Yep.
How about Marie Cohen?
200 votes even on the new poll.
That's not too bad.
But only 33 say give the mic to Neil so we can double it at Woodbuy.
And that's not good.
Neil!
Wonderful W-Q-A-L.
What be?
Today on Doctor Fidck.
Oh, that's not the one I want to play.
Damn it.
I'm Chris Mathews, welcome to Hyde Bowl.
I'm a SMPC.
I get so much fiddle around my food.
Oh, I can water the grass.
Quite passively from all those years of working for Tipo Neil.
Crazy.
You're not passable reason why saliva glands are all out of whack.
May passively be because I drink scotch from a dog's bowl.
Traveling from too many years of working for Tipo Neil being told that it wasn't good enough smart enough is skinny enough.
Plus I get deal with it's like Bill O'Rideley take it shots of me every night.
I'm probably with a world's greatest minds.
You know my wear it in a sneak shield.
The reason I know that people finish their answers is because I can't hear what they're saying.
My ears are not even hooked up.
The constant swishing of saliva in my mouth sounds like the ocean.
The only time I truly feel comfortable is when we take hardball out on the road.
I never said B.C.
That way I can try to convince co-edges to come back to my hotel room.
That is before they realize in order to kiss me and get close to my mouth.
They have to be wearing a mask and a snorkel.
Many people don't realize John McKay suffered from the same malady.
But the A.C. Alibaglian's burned closed.
The Obama did just one of the many varied and stunning differences we like to point out here on MSNBC.
Here's one more important fact you should realize before you go to the verdict booth.
They have different hair color.
I'm Chris Matthews play a hardball on MSNBC.
You know this fact you just send me a scandalist.
Right. If true.
We would like a second opinion maybe then.
Yeah maybe somebody else heard it.
Although I doubt that too many of our people listen to all Paul Ancient Ron.
It says this is from some Chris facts.
Hello Neil.
I'm Thursday and Friday young Ron and Paul played Chris Matthews throughout most of the morning.
Oh no.
Poor Chris is in a vacuum.
In a tunnel.
Go ahead.
Is the content of your show allowed to be ripped off by these tellineless A.H.O.S.
every day?
Doesn't your management even care about this?
What would you like our management to do about it?
Not every day only every other day you got a 10th.
That's right.
Sorry if you already had this info.
No we did not Chris and thank you so much for the spy report about.
Go ahead.
That but nevertheless I'm sure if it's true we'll get I mean if they did a Thursday and Friday.
Shameless it's one thing to be a rip off artist Paulie but shameless excuse me shameless rip off artist must be that bacon.
The gross thing about me huh?
I haven't had that bacon in a long time because I never think I'll be.
What?
Is it what a bargain if you can enjoy it all day?
No I don't have it.
I don't have any taste just.
Graps you know.
No bacon taste.
That's too bad.
It's like this show it's okay.
It's a taste list.
Tasteless.
Oh I remember when your show was a lot more tasteless so to why that's back when we had an audience.
Let's have another one of those phone call conference calls.
Well now that we destroyed your show guys what do you think is a good idea?
Cliff and Kendall says oh he sends me this it's a story.
A third of the reason South Florida said a man was arrested after calling 911 to complain that a fast food restaurant had run out eliminate.
Oh this is an old story.
We already had this.
Yes.
Point and Beach police said Gene Font fortune 66 has been charged with abuse of 911.
That's an old story.
Thank you but no thanks.
Old ancient.
Ancient story.
Oh yeah I forgot about this one the vision of Jesus at the day's city auto dealer and here's a picture of it.
Ruth Johnson's at her desk in the show room and other employee passes through in a wheelchair and it's got a picture of Jesus.
Oh look at that on the door.
Have you seen it?
No.
It's going to be very effective on the radio.
Hold it on me to forward it to you.
Okay get out here with this thing.
Forward to George.
Okay and I think you'll agree with me that's that's Jesus.
Is that the one with the dog peeeeee art?
The what?
The dog penis.
No there's no dogs penis.
What are you talking about?
Well that was one that was making it.
We're talking about Jesus and you're starting in with the dogs penis.
Boy you talk about a short trip to hell.
That was one that was making the rounds for a while.
Here's a suggested pool horrible pool.
What former government did you or your family escape?
Socialists communist democratic religious etc.
How about fascist as in bushing the aneocons?
That's a bad pool.
Bad.
Have you got that yet?
Did it come true?
You got it?
No.
No?
Boy that's slow.
It's my look at when you sent me this morning.
That useless one about the brother fax machine?
Yeah.
George says my printer is screwed up.
Or is it why I don't have the appropriate software?
Yeah.
Just throwing out guesses.
Maybe I'll get a new printer.
Not.
Or just the right software.
I love that printer.
Don't you like it?
You got one there that I bought.
It's a four and one.
It's a copier.
It's a faxer.
It's a scanner.
And it's a whatever I left out.
The printer.
The image.
Brother MFS.
What?
The images aren't coming through.
The images are not coming through.
Might be a setting on Maya.
I don't know.
Oh, here we go again.
Are you kidding me?
Let me fiddle with it.
Oh.
You've got to be kidding me.
I wish I was.
Do you want me to try it again?
No, let me fiddle with it.
How can the image not come through?
It's a...
Let me do that.
Right click to download it.
The safety feature.
Hang on.
Here we go.
Safety feature, Maya.
You got it?
No.
Vision of Jesus and David City Auto dealer.
I wish I had the whole story though.
But it just has the picture.
See, the picture is kind of useless for the audience.
Yeah.
And even you can't see it.
Mm-hmm.
Now you're getting it.
I don't think I'm not that looking at it.
I think Jesus does have a penis.
It looks like a gorilla with a large penis.
I see.
You don't...
You can't see it?
No.
Man.
Well, what did you get?
Uh, the email about pictures are like not coming through.
Oh, I think you must have a block on there.
You might say,
Jesus penis block on your email.
I must.
Shouldn't everyone?
Well, I think...
I think the knob guy's out there.
The knobber?
Go get you something.
Go get you a polish.
Go get you a spit shine.
He always turns the knob like he's trying to open the door, you know?
Yeah.
I think that's part of the process, isn't it?
Part of the evil of it.
Twisting my knob.
So you're not going to get it.
Is that what you're saying?
Well, whoever...
Whoever sent it to me, they can send it to you.
They could...
I'm going to let you see.
I don't want you to miss the picture of the vision of Jesus on the door.
All these people hallucinating.
Oh, Jesus, it's the version Mary.
Yeah.
If Jesus makes a comeback,
do you think he's going to do it as a...
Oh, I got it.
You got it.
You got it.
You see him?
Does it look like you're gorilla with a penis?
No, it just looks like a...
A smear.
A smear?
A looking...
A smear on the door?
And I'm sure whoever sent it to us is thinking, yeah,
a smear this...
Looks like the space shuttle.
A smear my talking...
What?
Looks like the space shuttle.
Does it really?
A little bit.
I see the Lord on there.
Jack Lord.
Jack Lord.
Jack Lord.
We're doing that a lot today.
Oh, that's bad.
Well, it must have been a great weekend.
It was for me.
Yeah, it was fine for me, too.
It was okay.
Make sure you're running the latest drivers available from the Brother website.
Says somebody.
The latest drivers.
And it's got a link to it.
What does that mean?
Huh?
I don't know.
I don't know what that means.
I was hoping you'd tell me.
Well, let me click on the link.
I do this with...
Oh, it's the software download.
That was the kind one.
No, it's the same thing I saw myself on my own,
but it doesn't have it for that model because that model is discontinued.
So what do you think?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, exactly.
Oh.
Here's one from Anthony.
I was listening to Cousin Brucy on Series XM,
and later we requested yellow river.
And I had a laugh all I could.
All I could think it was yellow jockstrap.
That Boca Brian is a...
That Boca Brian's a genius.
Could you play that one, please?
Thanks, the fake Jeff Rimmer.
Well, the fake Jeff Rimmer is making a comeback.
But you know what?
What?
It's your big improvement over the real one.
I'll tell you that.
Haven't heard from him in a long time.
Not long enough, but a long time.
Yellow jockstrap.
Yellow jockstrap.
Yellow jockstrap.
We're one to hear.
Sports all day.
Yellow jockstrap.
Yellow jockstrap.
The bad and fake here was a denying the gay.
Anyone who wants to hear it just sports will stay today.
His dream and title not the rule.
Go to the showers, spray.
Yellow jockstrap.
You fairy.
How about those dolphins?
What a gay they played.
That's somebody's kid with the furry cains.
Do you talk about it all the time?
Make you a bag and I'm afraid.
You like yellow jockstrap.
Yeah.
Shooting and burning out,
Pourning shows.
No interest in learning about radio.
Just a sausage party for a few sport-al-nobos.
Who like yellow jockstrap?
Yellow jockstrap.
Yellow jockstrap.
Sport holes in seas.
Who all in out?
Yellow jockstrap.
Yellow jockstrap.
They're on your mind.
To be in your mouth.
Sports all day.
Make you care.
Sports all day.
Make you care.
Sports all day.
Okay, somebody wants to know what's the model number of my printer?
Brother, MFC 4800.
This continued.
Great machine, though, my.
Right.
There you go.
Maybe they're going to help me out, you think?
Let's hope.
It's on tv.com now and sptimes.com on Friday.
What is?
It's on tv.com now and sps.
I don't know what that means.
Neither what it means.
No, I don't need it.
And that's from buzz who's ordinarily a rational.
Oh, I see a vision of Jesus and the date to the auto dealer.
He sent that.
I see.
Oh, I'm looking at it again.
Get right over it.
I'm going to go and start praying.
It looks like the eight man with an erection.
Looks like the swamp thing.
The swamp thing.
Okay, so maybe this guy's going to send me the info on the.
When that be great, if he solves my problem about printing stuff out.
And then I can't say, oh, it's chopped off.
Which I think adds a little something to the reading of the emails.
Oh, by the way, it's one o'clock and no calls yet today.
I think we're going to take any in the last.
Oh, I don't know.
It's not just the one to two hour.
It's a phenomenon.
Obama went down to DC.
He just became the president.
He won the campaign to sped his middle name and off to the White House.
He came across George W.
And the Oval Office not doing squat.
That's when Barack jumped up on the desk and said, push you that Matilda.
Quiet.
I bet you didn't know it.
But I'm the president.
I don't mean to be gruff, but move your stuff.
The economy is wrecked.
So you were a pretty good leader, sir, but give Obama his due.
I'm going to fix this mess.
Get the terrorists.
Plus I speak better than you.
Bush said your name's Barry, and I just want to say, don't make the mistake.
Think the job is cake in a year.
You won't think that way.
Obama's bringing hope and change from Chicago to DC.
Since he has been elected, that's commander in chief.
And if he's good, he will get reelected president.
But if he stinks, we'll call him an experiment.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I'm printing something out.
Okay.
He important thing.
See?
And I'll have Pat run it by you and you'll see.
You're the technical genius.
All right.
Hey, Neil, if you take the ink cartridges out and reinstall them,
most printers ask you to print a text, a test page.
Then that page comes out as cut off, follow instructions to where we calibrate the fake Jeff rumor.
What does that mean?
Take out the ink cartridge.
The toner cartridge you're talking about?
At this point, I would like to divorce myself from any technical advice you might be getting from other people.
Which may or may not work, but you're going to win it.
That's not going to, I've every placed that that's got nothing to do with it.
Thanks a lot, fake Jeff.
I have that on it.
I have visions of you doing a whole bunch of things that people suggest.
Yeah, that you that may or may not work.
Here's one from Imperial 609 who says the MFC 4800s on the page I sent you the link to.
But here's the direct link that appears that the driver has been updated since 2004 though.
So it might just be the same as you already have.
And then this is chopped off on the right not so not sure why you're married to this particular model.
There are a lot of great printers that can be added for a little money.
Try downloading the full driver and software package here and reinstall.
That's good idea.
That's what we tried tomorrow morning.
Let's try it with his link tomorrow morning. Yes.
Yeah, let's try it in the morning and send me a copy of that so that we have the same thing and we do it all together.
Okay, okay, don't keep.
I'm sure the audience is fascinated by that.
Oh, you know they are.
They're writing it down.
We're trying to solve a real problem.
I'm going to problem bad.
Muimalo.
See 236 votes on the poll pretty weak.
And how many say I give the money to Neil so we can double their wood buying 38.
That's right.
Give me all of America's money.
Give me a couple of weeks there and there and I'll just plunge my guts out.
Wouldn't that be fun?
Oh, yeah.
Now what is this from Wesley Chapel, Wesley in the word of hell is he?
We're chronic.
I mean regular.
He's over there in a West Coast somewhere trapped in Lakeland or somewhere.
He says at first glance, this might seem to be too long for you to read aloud.
Oh, that's right.
As they say in some provinces, but it's a tremendous and surprisingly fast read with back stories I've never heard before.
Perhaps you can get your web guide a post the link.
I don't think so.
A Western Lakeland.
The day the music died didn't kill music.
It lived in group bigger by David Henkley, Daily News staff writer.
I mentioned this on Friday, but I never got to it.
Thank God.
It's long.
Oh, my God.
It goes on and on and on and on and on.
Forever.
And here's one from Tony Perez, the fake Tony Perez, the other side of the stadium giveaway by Michael Lewis.
Oh, here's the story about the Jesus thing.
Oh, it says the sales folks have a lot of downtime these days at Gerard Ford Lincoln Mercury.
That's typical for a small town car dealership during a severe economic slump.
What's unusual is how some workers are passing time.
This is in Dade City.
In the center of the used car sales managers office doors are wood stain, about three feet tall.
Some look at it and swear it's Jesus.
Jesus, God, are you back on the door again?
Jesus Christ.
Sometimes it gets so crazy that faith is all you got left to tip Davis who runs a paintless,
dent removal service that services Jared.
Davis immediately noticed the anomaly and identified it as the central figure of Christianity.
Anybody who's seen the pictures of the burial cloth on the image of Christ that's on that cloth,
that's the same image on that door said, Davis, who attends Cyprus Meta's Community Church in Clearwater.
And who obviously has had some mental effects from the church he's gone through.
By the way, don't watch that horrible thing about Ted Haggard.
It's a waste of time. It's a puff piece. It's an ass kiss.
Which evidently he kissed him real ugly ass in his time.
Davis snapped a photo of the door and put it on his Facebook page.
He also sent a copy to the St. Pete Times.
I recognized it as soon as I saw it, he said.
Carlos Castro has been at the dealership for 16 years said some customers have taken notice.
Oh, it's Jesus on the door again.
People come in and stop and look. He said a couple of them will do the sign of the cross.
They're doing the sign of the cross business.
Oh, yeah.
In fact, I told you about Paco taking like aspirin and stuff and like crossing himself.
The other day we went to some friend of his house and I had to go with him because he only has a G1.
So he needs like a fully licensed driver to drive with him.
So he had me, he drove and I sat in the passenger seat, took my life in my hands.
And when he started the car, I noticed he crossed himself before he backed out.
Yeah.
I just, I don't know, I just can't, I don't see anything that he said in drivers that in Mexico.
I don't know.
And Burrow's driver's head.
Yeah.
Before you back your door.
It's very impressed when you crossed yourself.
Before you back your ass up.
A couple of them will do the sign of the cross.
Castro recalled a discoloration of the front of the ugly duckling car rental building in Clearwater
that drew crowds of worshipers who thought that was the Virgin Mary.
It's not as defined as that when he said.
It looks a little bit like Sasquatch piped up, Ruchon, from the receptionist.
It's like you said.
Yeah.
What did you say big foot?
It was a swamp thing.
But yes.
Oh, the swamp thing.
James Bauman, Jr., who was getting an oil change, described as Christ and a Jedi outfit,
then as a Persian king.
Or maybe it's a Persian queen.
He then said there were probably significance in the stain just as there is in Barack Obama being president.
And his real conflict with Hamas.
Oh, yeah.
The stain on the door.
Obama is the president.
Right.
It's all coming together now.
But all together, man, makes sense to me.
I see the pieces of the puzzle.
I believe the rapture is just around the corner.
He said.
Oh, yeah.
Johnson studied the stain a bit more and said, look like a caveman.
Maybe it's the pissed off caveman.
Do you think?
Maybe.
We did say at one time it looked like Jesus, she said.
Darrell Collins, who occupies the office with the stain door, said,
they've said point of the stain out to me.
He really didn't think much of it.
I guess everybody has their own outlook on it.
It said Collins 42.
It depends on what religion you're from.
I guess the Jews wouldn't see Jesus on the door.
Even though, of course, he was one of their people.
Right.
Collins, who was raised a Baptist, said he's not a real, not real big on religion, but called the door pretty neat.
I'm not swapping doors with anybody.
I can tell you that.
He said.
That's right.
Hang on to that door, man.
Might be worth a fortune one of these days.
Some idiot on e-bay will spend like a 50,000 for it, 50 million.
The son of a carpenter, Collins said he'd never seen anything like it.
However, he knows what has a mind of its own son of a carpenter, just like Jesus.
Wood will stain differently in different places when the same stain's applied to what he said.
No one knows that better than Stephen I of her own, who teaches carpentery at Ford Margeman Technical Education Center in Newport, Richie.
First, the cut lumber is green and turns brown as it dries out.
I know something else that turns brown as it dries out.
Disease trees also look different.
Stain takes to wood differently in different spots because of varying moisture levels.
Even a floor that's been covered with a carpet will change colors as it ages.
A tree is in every evolving thing, he said.
Cliff Martin, the dealership general manager, said he only knows the same Thursday when somebody pointed out to him.
Martin said the door was put up about 10 years ago when the dealership was remodeled.
Didn't know the name of the contractor.
It looks like a man in a long row.
He said maybe if he calls out Yoschkiy, Yoschkiy, maybe he'll like jump off the door.
Jesus Christ, it's start dancing around.
Martin, whose Catholic it attends Mass every Sunday, didn't not attend spiritual significance to the office door,
but he said maybe to stay and would at least attract potential customers.
Oh, you don't think this sounds like a sales pitch, do you?
Like a publicity stunt.
And today's tough economic times?
I like to say we're blessed, but we're not bringing any sales records, so maybe we're just blessed to be in business, he said.
Jesus and Mary have spent a lot of time in Florida, it seems.
Here's a list of some places they were cited.
Oh, look at this.
Looky, looky, here comes cookie.
Clear water, weeks before Christmas in 96 on a building then being leased by the Ugly Duckling Car rental company.
In the nature of what looked like the Virgin Mary materialized.
Overnight, the ordinary glass building in US-19 near Drew Street became a mecca for both Christian and the Curious.
In 2004 and 18 year old man shattered the top of the window with a slingshot.
He was sentenced to 10 days in jail or to pay $1,200.
You killed the Virgin Mary, you bastard.
You son of bitch.
Spring Hill in 1998, a couple of swore they saw Jesus and the rust stains of ventilation pipe on top of their home.
A Tampa radio station, WFLZ paid them $500 to take the pipe on a month-long promotional tour and then ended up stolen from a branded movie theater only to mysteriously reappear seven months later.
It's a miracle.
It's a freaking miracle. Hollywood, Florida in 2004, a woman claimed a grilled sea sandwich she cooked for 10 years earlier bore the image of the Virgin Mary.
It sold on eBay for $28,000 to an online casino.
Remember that?
I remember it well.
Yep.
What that was her name in Hollywood?
Rosa.
Rosa Lopez.
There you go.
What memories we got between the acres and 2005 assure acres woman said she saw the face of Jesus in a lace potato chip.
Port St. Lucie in 2007, a woman said she discerned the outline of Jesus and Mary in a modeled pancake and took it as a reassuring sign from a recently departed father.
Her mother, the cook thought it looked more like a bit when and Santa Claus.
An Alabama woman who wanted a gag gift for a soldier husband about to be deployed to Iraq, but $338 for it on eBay only to have the deal fall through.
Finally, an Illinois man claimed it for $29.
Palm Beach, that same year, 2007, another woman told the Palm Beach Poshy found a seashell that looked like the Virgin Mary.
Her head tilted and hands in prayer.
A week later, she said she was evicted and forced to move into the cabana behind her ex-husband's home.
The move led to a reconciliation in a holistic doctor she found soon after, helped with some medical woes she was suffering from.
Oh, the Virgin Mary put her life back together again.
Hallelujah.
And Pinellas County.
Last year, Pinellas County granted distributors said he had a seven by seven-foot slab of granite depicting an image of Jesus on the cross.
It was in storage for two years, and he showed it to an employee who immediately fell to her knees and tears.
He tried to sell it on eBay more than 800 people viewed it online and several calls, but nobody offered the starting bid.
$4,999 and 99 cents.
Oh, Neil!
You're listening to Neil Rogers.
Yeah, you know in that DIY, as you seek a S.
I met a priest when I was eleven.
He said he would save my soul, but we made a detour on the way to heaven.
And into this bedroom we did take a stroll.
While he was standing in his underwear, told me to bend over and say a prayer.
Oh, my God.
Both of us wrote in women, thank you, ma'am.
I got molested by the preacher man behind the rectory.

shallow like that. You know, when a guy tells you that you're ugly, you're supposed to
say like, yeah, and, and you're stupid. It doesn't matter. Fred knows that like him.
When somebody had to go through reconstructive surgery and his disfiguredness, we saw
them a bad wreck. He doesn't look disfigured. He looks just ugly like a lot of guys are ugly
like me. Like you're ugly. Not bad, aren't we? Well, that's a good point. Sorry, Fred.
We love you. Sorry, Fred. Fred's a good guy. We love you. We like him a lot.
Yep. And you don't feel bad. I feel bad. I feel bad that you don't feel bad. I don't feel bad enough for both of us.
I don't because you're a bad. You're a hard, hard, hard, hard, easy. He calls me. He emails me. We hang out.
Whatever he wants to him. His fiance. We did. I'm here for him. Whatever. I'm here for him.
I'm here for you, Fred. Well, that sounds really to me. I'm here for him. What does that mean?
Like if he needs a ride from the airport or something stupid like that, you know, he's not going to call you for a ride from the airport.
He might. He can. Did he ever? No. A ride from the airport from where? From wherever from Yadam's Vell. Yadam's Vell.
I bet your Fred's out or never been to Yadam's Vell. And either of you for that matter. Hey, I used to live here. You're in it. You're in it.
264 votes on the pool. I'm going to sneeze in a second. Just a warning.
Wow. That was one that worked itself up. I mean, I told you that several seconds before it actually must spurt it out.
The sneeze that is 264 votes. The solution to the economic crisis is. I'll bail out an announcement delayed.
Also the fact that it really didn't help out the way. Yeah, blow it out your ass. Increased spending and infrastructure.
64 fixed the roads fixed up bridges. Get the bridge tender to work on it. I bet you that guy's long dead.
Don't you think I imagine he is. Do whatever Obama says 48. And by the way, we didn't get any for this fire reports about old Ron and
ancient Paul on Thursday and Friday doing the go ahead thing. Right. So either that fake Chris, either that facts you got was a bogus or nobody is listening to them.
They're probably all listening to the bubble of love. Rage. Oh, bubble the do rag. Double. The Dow is up 87 cent.
Not 87 points 87 cent. Wow. Do whatever Obama says 48. Eat the rich 47. Give the mind to Neil so he can double into wood by him 39.
Cut taxes 33 less government involvement 19 more government involvement 17. And also another choice. If they.
That's on there. If they. Don't start with all that.
You just don't need enough deli to be like sound Jewish, not for like a trillion. That the story by West Chapel on the music day.
The music died. You want to hear it or not? It's 100 pages. It says the music didn't really die February 3rd, 1959.
The day of force. They're playing cutting carrying buddy Holly Richie valence and the big bopper JP Richardson crashed into a cornfield.
A miles north of clear lake Iowa. Five years and six days later, the Beatles who learned their craft from buddy Holly records and whose name is a shout out to Holly's crickets played the
out Sullivan show. I never knew that. Did you know that? Nope. The Beatles, the name is a shout out to buddy Holly's crickets. How do you like that? No, the music lived. It just got bigger than anyone.
On a 59 could have imagined it says still that plane crash deeply affected rock and roll a world that 59 was still in early adolescence.
The term rock and roll itself and only come into widespread use about three years earlier that would have floated around the blues world since at least the 20s as a thinly camera
flashed in them for fun under the sheets rock and roll my ass when you're young. You don't think about death. Whatever that means before February 3rd, 59 rock and roll's
idea of a loss was Elvis Presley going to the army or little Richard announcing was going to sing only for the Lord. I'm singing for the Lord. John Lillian and
a rate would later mark that rock and roll died when Elvis went to the army. Elvis, I thought a rock and roll died when Elvis started singing. Yeah. On this one, John was wrong.
There's a widespread. I've got to blow my nose. Why spread popular myth that after well, it's bad. You know, you know, it's closed. No, it's bad to try to talk with a mouthful of
snot. I mean, a no school or a mouthful of snot. Malfa would really be bad. There was a widespread pop it. That after Elvis induction and the buddy, Holly,
playing crash, the enemies of rock and roll smashed into harmless little pieces by this myth, traditionalist in the music entertainment radio games got
together and conspired to replace the wild raw power of Elvis, buddy and little Richard with a harmless likes of Fabian and Frankie Avalon,
pretty boys with minimal talent. Frankie Avalon was a movie. He was in with Vincent Price about the world was ending and like that. That was a fairly entertaining.
Dust yanking the teeth and bite out of the dangerous aversive intruder without question. They were traditionalist to want to see that happen.
Even many fans believe rock and roll is another fad like goldfish swallowing whose inevitable expiration date was coming up fast. They too were wrong.
The music and the seeds that planted those 50, 1864 years between Elvis and the Beatles will stand with any six years in rock and roll history.
Motown started then with artists like Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and the Temptations. That was Roy Orbison's peak. He had the Beast Boys and the Four Seasons at their best.
Phil Specter was producing stacks and muscle shows were gearing up. The churrells were singing so were Del Shannon and Arthur Alexander and James Brown and Jean Pitney.
What a pity about Jean Pitney. He's dead. Oh well, isn't he? I think he's dead. Small companies produced hundreds of great singles from Maxine Browns all in my mind to Kathy Young's 1000 stars to the Caprice Classic.
There's a cockamoon out tonight and the Edselson mortal Rammel Amidding Dog. All right. I bet you Bowser like that one. You know Bowser? Yeah. Use could do it sitting down.
In the larger picture, the music was only slightly wounded. What the crash did do was take away 70 in a sense. The adolescent. This goes on and on. The loss of innocence was the real point of American pie.
The 71-toner Claim Ballad that locked in the day the music died phrase to our cultural vocabulary. American, it's almost enough to make me play that 55-minute bit. You know? I love eating nuts.
I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I love eating nuts. I

Wow. Wow. Wow.
Yeah, it says the loss of innocence was the real point of American pie.
The 71 Don McLean bell that locked in the day the music died phrased to our cultural vocabulary.
McLean's massive hit along with its mildly inside references and quasi profound imagery.
Well, we talk about pseudo intellectual crap.
I'll say crap.
Inside references and quasi profound imagery.
How do you like that for a bunch of swill?
Yeah, or as they say inside Buria for a bunch of Navanille.
Is that what they said?
Look it up. You'll find out what that means.
No, thank you.
Schmidt. What is ultimately most notable for reflecting the fact that a dozen years later fans still missed and more in those who were lost.
The crash also triggered a discussion somewhat muted with the passage of time over which those men could have given us what they had given us if they lived.
Richards in the veteran, the group of 23 was a dish jockey and country singer happened to have a novelty pop hit with chantilly lace.
Country was his legitimate talent.
He probably would have returned there valence is the wild card.
He's stunk at 17.
He'd already written the time of spalla Donna when he've written more or was he destined to be a star burst of a teen idol.
Either way, he was one of the first Hispanic rock and roll stars.
It was no Luis Miguel. I'll take it that.
He was no Ricky Martin. Thank God.
Hey, Ricky, you fairy.
Hispanic rhythms have never gone to credit.
They deserve for their part in shaping rock and roll.
And while valence wasn't singing hardcore Hispanic music, he was a pioneer whose importance could have easily grown.
Holly again, who knows his face? No, what?
You heard what I said.
What's got Shannon WPLJ program director morning co-host and lifelong buddy Holly fan says he thinks Holly's future might have been mostly in songwriting and producing.
His recording career, Shannon notes had hit a low at the time of his death, though it doesn't matter anymore.
It became an ironic posthumous hit.
It doesn't matter anymore. Do you remember that? I don't.
Well, I guess it doesn't because he's dead. You know, it doesn't matter anymore.
While Holly was only 22, they already begun moving away from the hard rockabilly sound of his earlier days, kind like the early brothers.
Talk about hard, experimenting with strings and valence like true love ways.
But right to the end, he was writing great crisp song, Shannon notes in in many ways.
He was a more complete musician than Elvis.
He started singing. He was a great guitar player and wrote great songs that Shannon. He was a producer too.
Oh, you're going to die when you hear this. You're going to die a wicked, horrible death.
The 1983 movie Eddie and the cruisers had it shadowy lead character.
A rock and roll singer quietly trying to arrange musical sessions that would bring black and white performers together in new and different ways.
Is that what Eddie and the cruisers was about? I don't remember that. I remember about two hours.
Wow. It's been suggested this notion came from a symbol what Holly was doing.
We'll never find out of course because 50 years ago Tuesday the plane went down.
Holly, valence and Richardson were part of the winner dance party tour that was doing a whirlwind run of one night or through small Midwestern towns.
Basically learn a few earn a few quick bucks.
On the afternoon of February 2, while they were all waiting for that night show at the surf ballroom in Clear Lake,
Holly decided he couldn't face one more 300 mile ride on a freezing bus stop to the next stop for going North Dakota.
So he charted a small plane. Oh, yeah, boy, buddy. Couldn't take the bus.
I guess the Lord will teach you a thing or two.
He charted a small plane figure that way. He'd arrive early enough to get some sleep to do his laundry.
The local charter service assigned a flight to 21 year old Roger Peterson, a pilot who had little experience flying with instruments in the kind of snowy overcast skies that descended over Iowa that night.
Holly was originally going to take the two other members of his band on the plane.
The terrorist Tommy Alsepp and play at base player, Wail and Jennings, Wail and Jennings.
That way they could split the cost 108 bucks or 36 bucks a piece.
But when other performers on the tour heard about the plane, they put in their own bids.
Richardson was coming down with a cold ass Jennings if he could take that seat and Jennings who didn't mind the bus as much of this told him, sure, go ahead.
Go ahead. That's exactly told him. He said, sure.
Yeah, you first, you fly fly boy.
Valence who thought flying on a small plane sounded cool had a harder time talking of somebody out of the last seat.
Who was it? Oh, also finally, Valence proposed flipping a coin.
I also agreed. Valence pulled out a half a dollar.
Also, flipped it and Valence called heads and heads.
It was 50 cent piece. That's what his life was worth.
50 cent. How do you like that?
Richie Valence was the original 50 cent.
If it would have been tails, he's on a bus.
How do you like that? Is this some pretty captivating crap or what?
Not you don't like it.
You want to pause you to Fred Souter, but no, the plan.
You're evil. You really are.
You said my friend, my friend for a very long.
He's not your best friend.
All right. Like all these are best friends.
And no, can I get to the end of the sentence?
Go ahead. My best friend. Wait a minute.
Can you what? Get to the end of the sentence.
Thank you for the for many years for the lion's share of my life is the ugliest human being that anyone ever saw.
It makes quasi moto look like a fashion.
All right. Has nothing to do with anything.
Your best friend.
Guys thinking that other guys are ugly.
Like I don't care if my friends think that I'm ugly or handsome.
I don't either. I'm not saying that.
So Fred's out there and I was and some horrible action and just figured like that.
So if you feel bad about it, no, do you feel about it a little bit?
I feel a little bit bad.
You feel bad about Mark Hamill.
Now I feel bad that he got so ugly.
It's used to be really something.
How are you?
I'm a camel.
Huh? See how you are.
Yeah.
Fag.
If you're going to ask me about what I think about guys, how they look that that's going to be from a
perspective, you know, Mark Hamill used to look really good.
Then he had that bad Corvette crash.
Oh, and they tried to put the pieces back together again.
All the King's horses, it's like the Greg Reed egg, you know, once he dropped it,
they couldn't put the pieces back together again and then Joe Bell came along and just stepped
all over with his big fat feet smashed it.
The plane took off about one in the morning from the Mason city or port.
The best guess about what happened next is that Peterson realized only after they took
off, eat after fly on instruments.
You know, tuba, banjo, guitar.
More specifically, add a fly by a spary altitude, attitude gyroscope, which displays attitude.
Is that attitude or is this supposed to be, well, that's what it says.
Altitude?
No.
Alticocker?
The opposite of the gyroscope in which you trained.
If he didn't know that, he would have thought the plane was climbing when it was descending.
Eight miles from the airport to play in question to a cornfield.
All we're going up, all we're going down, we're going down, baby.
It hit about 50 feet and skidded 500 to so feet into a fence where it broke apart.
Richard and Holly and Valenz were thrown out.
Peterson's body remained in the wreckage.
It didn't matter.
All we're almost certainly killed on impact.
When there was no word from anyone on a plane by dawn, a search began.
Jerry Dwyer, who owned the air service, took off in another plane, retracing Peterson's
route at 9.35 in the A.M.
He saw the wreckage.
A few days later another British young rock and roll artist Eddie Cochran, cut a sentimental
farewell song called The Three Stars, which went in part, Look up in the sky, Up Toward
the North.
You ever heard that?
No.
No.
There were three new stars, Bradley Shining Fourth, it was the kind of song that once was instantly
written for any famous person who died, proving how close popular music still was in 59
to the old pop era.
Fourteen months later, April 17, 1960, Eddie Cochran was killed in a car crash.
He was only 21.
The music didn't die then either.
Today the most popular young music fans only have historical knowledge of Buddy, Holly
or Richie Valens.
Maybe they've seen the movies.
Maybe they recognize that'll be the day which Holly wrote from a John Wayne line in
the searchers or La Bamba, which was Valens applying rock and roll to an old seesaw.
But The Three Stars mostly are names or maybe this was, and it goes on and on.
Thank God it's all over with.
Thank the Lord.
Thank you God.
Oh, oh, oh.
Come on.
Come on.

Remember the other day we were talking about Jewish names?
Yes.
How about a Lapidus?
That's right.
You know any goyem named Lapidus?
Nope.
I don't think so.
If anybody out there is named Lapidus and you're a goy, you better stand up and be counted

The nose picker says I read an interesting solution to jumpstart the economy.
There are 40 million people working over the age of 50.
Simply give each person a million dollars and have them retire.
Then 40 million jobs would open immediately.
The people over 50 would spend and the problem solved much less expensive.
Over the age of 50.
Okay, I'll take my million right now.
Thank you.
In fact, I'll take this app and know it would buy an intriple.
What do you think?
Sounds fine.
Go ahead.
That's what I meant.
So what do you think about old ancient?
I mean, talk about obvious.
No shame if that's true.
Although I have no confirmation about that about them playing that dropping.
Right.
So just one isolated facts.
Doesn't affect me.
What do you think?
People make things up all the time.
No.
No.
Our audience would make crap up to stir the pot.
Yeah.
As your words would say to stir the pot.
Stir it up.
Stir it up.
Why does he say that?
I don't know.
Maybe it's a sports thing.
Most said I was stirring it up.
298 in the poll.
We're going to make 300 this by the time we leave or else.
Aren't you proud?
This is our second poll today.
301.
Told you.
Told you Mr. Smarty pants.
And 45 people say they ought to give me all the money so I can double the wood by.
Give us out of this economic miss.
This depression.
Speaking of that, here's a long, long Michael Lewis.
I don't know where this is from commentary commissioners.
Here's the other side of the stadium giveaway.
Where's this from from the herald maybe?
I have no idea.
Oh, and this was sent to the mad dog.
Now what does that all about?
Why did I get it?
Happens all the time, doesn't it?
From Tony Perez, let's go fins at homel.com to maddog at wqm.com.
I don't get it.
So this is not even.
This isn't even meant for me.
It's for the mad dog.
Well, I don't want to steal his thunder.
Whatever that means.
Go ahead.
Wow.
Julio Pazos has got a long.
Oh, my God.
And a fundraising dinner for a school that serves children with learning disabilities.
The father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all
who attended.
After I stolen the school and dedicated staff, he offered a question.
When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does is done with perfection.
Yet my son, Shay, can't learn things that other children do.
He can't understand things that other children do.
Where is the natural order of things in my son?
The audience was still by the query.
And it goes on and on.
This goes on forever.
You want to hear it?
I sure don't.
No.
Why?
Because you're heartless and cruel.
That's right.
God.
Thought you knew that by now.
Well, I've tried to defend you all these years.
All these people say that.
Yeah.
So heartless and cruel.
Let them take it.
Go ahead.
And say that.
God.
I'm not going to read it.
Although it's not nearly as long as the thing about the marlins of the state and giveaway.
Yeah, everybody's out of work.
Everybody's broke.
Let's build a millionaire owners of the marlins of stadium.
Come on now.
Come on.
I don't want to say the fixes in.
But you know what?
The fixes in.
Isn't that what bloggos said?
The fixes in.
And you know why we're in such a good mood by the way?
We don't see him anymore.
Thank God.
Yeah.
Rain and plus eight.
46 tomorrow.
Rain and 50 on Wednesday.
Oh, hallelujah.
Oh, happy day.
And right now, sunshine and 38.
It's a heatwave, man.
I don't see any, any more emails.
Aren't you depressed?
No.
You're not?
No, because I'm heartless and cruel.
Yeah, you are heartless and cruel.
In fact, I should make you do the last minute and 44 seconds.
Hey.
I should.
Sliker.
Oh, thanks by the way for coming up with a great idea about my
Take all week off next week for vacation.
What I'm here for.
Well, I got seven weeks for crying out loud.
I got to start like spreading them out.
One in February, three in March, four in April.
Well, that's eight.
What do you think?
Yeah.
And the audience is starting to like flea.
I'm thinking maybe flea two to four.
What do you think?
Sounds like a plan.
I'm not, I'm not like trying to interfere with rock solid with that because he's coming up next by the way.
The big old Orlando, well, sequer, he's coming up to the four.
And I'm sure we'll have a lot of conversation about that pro bowl.
Oh, George watch that intently.
You hang on the edge of your seat.
Yeah, what?
The pro bowl.
So I like touch football, man.
Like like a pansy game.
Who the hell wants to see that?
Even pansies don't want to see a pansy football game.
Oh, but it's all the stars.
It sucks.
It's a bunch of crap.
But I bet you that some of the juxtapres they watched every second of it.
You know why?
Why?
Because it was on because it was there.
Give me the ball.
Give me the ball.
You know, when you got lots more, give me the ball all day and all night.
Look at that ESPN radio from 11 o'clock this tonight till five in the morning.
How come we're not promoting that Jesse Agler early edition show from five to six the more?
He's a good guy and actually belongs on the year.
God, promoting.
Well, that's probably the reason why and our old friend Chris works that show too.
Fat Chris.
For those of you who are joeasing for his fat squeaky voice.
I've been to Peter's mental rock worst and sour crap.
You're fair.
I love a Polish hit girl.
I rolled her barrel out.
I put on the leader hoes and died with her a funny hat.
The sound of the crack to the head and then I'll still flare a dead.
It's the sound you want from me.
It is my favorite dance.
I'm single, I live in poker.
Feel your fear's dying up.
Feel my deep poker.
The captain rolls out good with sausage from a trogan.
Stink your fear gun out.
Feel my life in poker.
I'm single, I live in poker.
I'm single, I smoke in poker.
The band goes on my pound with a fan out of dead poker.
Dance with your grandma during a lovely poker.
To heaven, there's no fear.
So drink some hot new poker.
Eat some, kill my stuff.
Listen to the poker.
Listen to the poker.
Everyone's out of poker.
Two jeans on.
That's so very nice.
You're fair.
All right.
Bye, bye, bye.
