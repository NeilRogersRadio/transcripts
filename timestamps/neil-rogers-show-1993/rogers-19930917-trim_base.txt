[00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.640]
Tonight after Randy Rhodes, it's Don and Mike.

[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.640]
It's a great year's vacation.

[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.220]
The money while you're with me.

[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.720]
It's national baked bean month.

[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.540]
And we're asking what do you like about baked beans?

[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.880]
It's great. They're nutritious. They make them fart.

[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.000]
A lot. They're delicious. They're nutritious.

[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.880]
And they make you fart. A lot.

[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.820]
Yes, they're baked beans with all my parties.

[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.840]
Because nothing breaks the ice like breaking wind.

[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.560]
I'm going to do a really big one here. Listen.

[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.680]
I locked you to hold some beans and then say the dog did it.

[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.740]
Here it comes.

[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.300]
Big bean's made bubbles in the back of the house.

[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.640]
Ready? Here's give me the microphone.

[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.480]
Bean's made a fart.

[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.880]
It's lots of baked beans.

[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.500]
During national baked bean month.

[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.680]
It's going to be big.

[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.800]
This mess. It's brought to you by the national baked bean council.

[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.080]
Wow. Balthalarm.

[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.460]
I, Luis Miguel.

[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.940]
It's 11.29. See this?

[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.260]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.820]
524WWD. The reaction is last night.

[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.420]
First ever, Panther's game is just so underwhelming that I'm astonished.

[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.480]
We had two calls. One from a guy who had no idea what the score was.

[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.760]
Then from some nose picker in Tampa who thinks that Darren Pupa is God.

[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.260]
And Felix Potman had the best year he ever had in the NHL last year.

[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.940]
Which he doesn't have any idea what he's talking about.

[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.480]
And that said, hockey in Florida.

[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.940]
Maybe it's a mistake after all.

[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.940]
Here's Cutler Raid.

[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.700]
No.

[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.140]
Let me make it short.

[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.700]
Let's go to sports for a second here.

[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.380]
Okay?

[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.800]
Here's the hits.

[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.940]
The hits.

[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.100]
The hits are.

[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.660]
Yeah.

[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.160]
Okay.

[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.960]
The hurricanes.

[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.440]
If you can have something else to do, then you can watch them.

[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.780]
Yeah.

[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.920]
The top is I'm a great football fan, but I wish them all the luck.

[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.600]
They'll need it.

[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.860]
Okay. Marley's.

[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.880]
Marley's.

[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.240]
I've gone to about 25% of the games.

[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.640]
Right.

[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.820]
Oh god. I'm not a season.

[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.760]
I'll take it harder.

[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.240]
They are.

[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.060]
I'm not a season.

[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.160]
I'll take it harder for the Marlins.

[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.700]
You're nuts.

[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.680]
The station is.

[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.480]
I get to squeeze out their tickets.

[00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.400]
Oh, okay.

[00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.820]
Oh yeah.

[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.500]
Look at you.

[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880]
Now, at least in hockey, I've been in the USA for 15 years.

[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.160]
Right.

[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.020]
And never been able to watch more than five minutes.

[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.440]
It's the last night.

[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.020]
Yeah.

[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.260]
Oh, you want to give my a thanks?

[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.140]
Goal pants is all that way.

[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.440]
Right.

[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.360]
I got excited.

[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.400]
Well, thank god.

[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.560]
I agree with it.

[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.500]
It was a pretty good game.

[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.160]
Big time.

[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.400]
And they were behind three nothing.

[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.320]
And it looked like, you know, they just roll over and kind of play dead.

[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.080]
They just get a little practice and they got right back in there and they kicked them as.

[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.580]
And they did it.

[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.120]
And I'll tell you what, after work, after one game, it's not day anymore.

[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.600]
It's the week.

[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.300]
Right.

[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.060]
Now you're talking.

[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.380]
Outstanding.

[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.000]
Okay.

[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.720]
I'll see you there.

[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.420]

[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.520]
Take care.

[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.760]
Yeah.

[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.420]
Outstanding, man.

[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.140]
There's a word that goes between out and standing, but I can't say it.

[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.740]
Out.

[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.060]
Instanding.

[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.680]
Anyway, we have an open line and date.

[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.260]
Seven five.

[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.640]
Once we got one new hockey fan there, which is good because we'll find him a good seat.

[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.460]
I can't find any, but we'll find him a good one.

[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.340]
Right there in the front row, right in front of the Weasemagel.

[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.020]
Okay.

[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.200]
Let's do Tampa.

[00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.640]
Hello.

[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.720]
You know, how you doing?

[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.100]
Okay.

[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.960]
You said a very good conversation with George.

[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.120]
Yeah.

[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.060]
It's a fantastic guy.

[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.400]
Anyway, consider talking about the hockey game.

[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.440]
Did he tell you to say that, by the way?

[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.740]
No.

[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.280]
Okay.

[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.440]
Let me correct you on something.

[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.160]
What did I say now?

[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.600]
Okay.

[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.300]
First off, the capacity of the Lakeland Civic Center.

[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.840]
Five thousand.

[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.580]
Right.

[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.480]
But last night they anticipated about four thousand people there.

[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.020]
Why is that?

[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.940]
We had 38, 76 because that's what they had last year.

[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.800]
They just really said there's not much enthusiasm on going to the games in Lakeland.

[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.240]
Why not?

[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.760]
It's just the way it is.

[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.700]
It's a bad place.

[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.860]
It's a bad access.

[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.660]
It's a small area.

[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.960]
I mean, it's just not a good place to see hockey.

[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.380]

[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.060]
No, no, no, no.

[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.080]
I'm just saying you were talking about the way you went.

[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.720]
I hope you're right.

[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.980]
I just thought that because I'm here and so much about this hyped up rival, we had a thought they'd been standing online all the way to Bartol.

[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:44.660]
No, no, no, no.

[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.060]
You just went to the Dunderdome.

[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.820]
Do we get over there?

[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.700]
That's a good crowd.

[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.580]
Well, you're supposed to break the all-time record.

[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.360]
It's a Dunderdome.

[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.080]
I tell me 25,000.

[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.340]
I think we're going again tonight.

[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.240]
Where they playing tonight.

[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.000]
Where they playing tonight.

[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.340]
They're playing tonight.

[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.240]
Playing the blues.

[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.240]
Oh, they're in Lakeland again tonight.

[00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.460]

[00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.600]

[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.380]
And Lakeland again tonight.

[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.820]
Yeah.

[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.120]
And Curtis Joseph won't be there.

[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.400]
Oh, aren't you lucky?

[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.880]
Exactly.

[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.400]
What the hell was he taking in some of those games against us last year and against the Blackhawks?

[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.900]
My God.

[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.440]
Okay.

[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.480]
This guy was on heavy duty juice.

[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.880]
They must have run out in the last couple of games against the Leafs.

[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.020]
But boy, he was doing it.

[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.820]
I don't know about right now.

[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.660]
Yeah, he is doing it.

[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.220]
He's definitely doing it.

[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:25.940]
The first game, in fact, that clip I played at Gilmore Scoring in the second overtime, he had 62 saves in that game.

[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.360]
Yeah, he's playing.

[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.660]
And again, that I went to tonight.

[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.440]
The two of tonight's the game.

[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.940]
I went to, we had like 20 some saves in the first period.

[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.380]
Right.

[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.520]
26 saves, I think.

[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.580]
Well, I'm not sucking up to you, but I love to leave.

[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.340]
That's my team.

[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.480]
I'm going to stand behind the line.

[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.520]
How do you like that guy that called before about Felix Poffen?

[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.240]
And about how it was this probably had the best year he ever had.

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.740]
I didn't hear.

[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.300]
Oh, really?

[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.860]
That's what it does.

[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.520]
I didn't hear it.

[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.700]
He's trying to tell me about how Darren Pupus so great and Poffen isn't so good.

[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.980]
It was probably the best year he ever had.

[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.460]
Of course, it was his first year in the league.

[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.920]
He was a rookie, but don't confuse this guy with the fact.

[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.300]
I hate to disagree with that man.

[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.720]
He's wrong.

[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.220]
Yeah.

[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.180]
That's really wrong.

[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.080]
Okay.

[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.240]
That was great thing about him.

[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.900]
That's the Zito and Bobby Clark kissed and made up last night.

[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.680]
Yeah, you know, Anthony was working to get like Joey Reynolds now.

[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.700]
He keeps sneaking up behind guys and kissing him.

[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.760]
Guess who I met last night.

[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.720]
This is no shot either.

[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.080]
Yeah.

[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.800]
I met D-Man, Heizinka.

[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.520]
Did you?

[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.980]
Yeah.

[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.940]
He was wandering around.

[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.140]
He was dressed really fine.

[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.200]
Did you let your kiss him on the ball's ball?

[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.380]
No.

[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.780]
No.

[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.920]
I didn't kiss his ring.

[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.400]
I didn't do anything.

[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.100]
I guarantee that.

[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.960]
I guarantee that S-Zito ain't going to be coming up between behind Wayne Heizing and kissing him

[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.400]
on the cheek.

[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.200]
I guarantee you that.

[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.320]
Well, of course, yeah.

[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.940]
What do they call him?

[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.860]
The Waste Magna.

[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.540]
Or whatever.

[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.200]
Bad jokes.

[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.080]
The Waste Magna.

[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.520]
Yeah.

[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.840]
Right.

[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.100]
You better watch out.

[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.400]
You'll waste you if you don't watch it.

[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.360]
Hey, we're not scared of him.

[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.260]
He's got all the right connection.

[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.580]
We're not worried about him up here.

[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.100]
No, not at all.

[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.400]
Brett Gretzky's playing tonight, too.

[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.940]
Is he?

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.300]
Yeah.

[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.240]
So tonight will be an exciting game.

[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.140]
I thought you said, wait a minute.

[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.760]
I thought you said you're playing the blues tonight.

[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.240]
Yeah.

[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.620]
And Gretzky's playing?

[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.080]
Brent Gretzky.

[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.980]
Oh, Brent Gretzky.

[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.500]
Oh, okay.

[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.840]
Yeah.

[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.840]
Anyway, uh, I wish we were playing Gretzky.

[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.100]
I wish we were playing Gretzky.

[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.200]
We're playing.

[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.920]
I'd come over there and heistick him right in the nose.

[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.240]
We're going to come back up here.

[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.220]
What?

[00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.740]
When are you going to come back up to Tampa?

[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.080]
October 9th.

[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.540]
October 9th.

[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.500]
Oh, for the Alistair.

[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.880]
Exactly.

[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.100]
Okay, I've got, I'm all excited here.

[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.380]
Sorry.

[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.440]
Come back.

[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.140]
And I, and when the Leafs do play up there, which is, uh,

[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.960]
I forget when it is the 13th or so.

[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.660]
Yeah, a little bit later.

[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.880]
Uh, I'll be up there for that.

[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.480]
Okay.

[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.120]
Good to you.

[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.360]
Trust me.

[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.940]
All right.

[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.580]
They call me Mr. Puck, man.

[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.260]
Don't forget it.

[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.640]
I know.

[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.760]
You are a Puck.

[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.160]
I know.

[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.860]
Well, look, I'm going to keep this rival regoing.

[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.880]
If I'm the only one.

[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.320]
Okay.

[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.860]
I'm not kidding.

[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.380]
Okay.

[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.960]
Have a good day.

[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.500]
See ya.

[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.440]
I hope Lightning kick ass tonight.

[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.800]
I have no problem with Lightning.

[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.660]
They got a nice team.

[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.200]
I like them.

[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.260]
Even though Terry Chris needs some help with this hair.

[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.420]
Oh, speaking of help with this hair, there's Orlando.

[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.280]
Look at that.

[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.640]
Who used to be very popular here until we found Louise McGell.

[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.080]
Used to be a number one in our hearts.

[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.260]
And in our mind, there he is.

[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.980]
They're good.

[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.900]
And I thought it was going to be real exciting.

[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.780]
But since we got our Louise McGell video going.

[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.000]
Well, we'll compare notes when he comes in here.

[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.320]
We have an open line on the green line.

[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.720]
1-800-944-9463.

[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.440]
It's 1135-WY-O-D-N-W-S-U-N.

[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.160]
If you're a sports fan, you like to mix in some water with your sports.

[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.960]
Or rate food and fun, whatever it might be.

[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.380]
Holigons, pub and oyster bars, is the place for you.

[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.360]
Holigons has got everything you'd like to see like the Lightning game, the Panther game, the Marlin game, the Dolphin game.

[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.720]
I mean, like even real teams.

[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.820]
And special request and no problems, too.

[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.120]
If they can pick it up, you're going to see it.

[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.160]
Join Holigons for Sunday and Monday Night Football parties with a complimentary of a fad halftime.

[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.920]
And free shooters with every lead change.

[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.660]
Every Tuesday night, it's food fest night.

[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.980]
With 25 cent oysters, clams, crab legs, shrimp and wings, as well as drinks and brew specials contest and giveaways.

[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:38.520]
Holigons menu off for something for everybody from fresh oysters and clams, prime rib, baby back ribs, chicken wings sandwiches and lots more.

[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.820]
And don't forget, your Marlin Dolphin and Hurricane ticket stub is always good for complimentary beverage after the game.

[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.360]
So don't leave your stub home.

[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.340]
Holigons, pub and oyster bars, and candle on South-Sixie Highway.

[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.120]
In Miami Lakes, just west of the Palmeco, in Miami Lakes Drive.

[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.180]
And it's a photopathy marina behind Lomans, Plaza, and Aventura.

[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.880]
That's Holigons, we're good friends, gather to get lucky.

[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.500]
Coming up tonight at a following sports talk six-thin, it's Randy Rose.

[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.260]
We'll talk radio six-thin, every new IOD.

[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.980]
So look who's here who didn't shine us today, Orlando.

[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.500]
Pull that thing, you know how to handle something that looks like that.

[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.480]
And he said, and we're watching the Luis Miguel video together here.

[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.180]
And you said what?

[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:20.780]
I didn't say anything.

[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.260]
You said, I Luis Miguel.

[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.520]
I was sure that's what you said.

[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.980]
How come you turning purple in the face already?

[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:30.100]
Huh?

[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.480]
No, I don't know.

[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.240]
I know.

[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.720]
I have no industry.

[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.560]
I bring that out with these one liners, and it's just, I bring out the best in you.

[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.040]
Yeah.

[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.040]
Or would like to anyway.

[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.480]
So wait, what do you think?

[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.700]
You think he circumcised your what?

[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.060]
I don't know, Neil.

[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.040]
Why don't you ask him?

[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.420]
We might.

[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.760]
We're making, we got some, you want to run that bias again, George?

[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.480]
What we got?

[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.820]
We got an agenda so full here today.

[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.240]
I may not leave the building all day.

[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.840]
We got the stuff coming in the mail.

[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.220]
We got everything coming.

[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.380]
You have no idea what the facts.

[00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.280]
We got what?

[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.640]
The bio is coming over on the fact that the bio is coming on the facts machine.

[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.040]
Okay.

[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.300]
20 years old.

[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.140]
He's not circumcised from.

[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.600]
We'll do it for a price.

[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.260]
What is it?

[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.320]
We are Latina.

[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.240]
That's the Latin division of water.

[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.720]
So how many points you give him on a scale of 10, Orlando?

[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.600]
I don't know.

[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.480]
Just give me a guess, okay?

[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.980]
Damn, you, I don't know.

[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.240]
I don't know.

[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.920]
I don't know.

[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:21.920]

[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:21.920]

[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:21.920]

[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:21.920]

[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:21.920]

[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.420]
In other words, what I'm trying to say is if you were like really desperate.

[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.020]
Yeah.

[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.220]
Just can't get it out of this guy.

[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.200]
You know, you just can't weasel anything out of you.

[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:31.620]
That's all right.

[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.240]
Just sit there and watch and keep your hands on the table at all time.

[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.140]
You said that he used to have long hair.

[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:36.400]
Yeah.

[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.960]
I remember watching a show a lot of people working out a lot.

[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.460]
Is that true?

[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.820]
It looked like I'll built up now like one of those.

[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.560]
Really?

[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.140]
Yeah.

[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.460]
I'm working out of my house.

[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.540]
Yeah, you were with who?

[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.920]
Well, anybody else?

[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.980]
I have a way to my house.

[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.300]
Yeah.

[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.600]
I have a membership at the gym expired.

[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.340]
So I'm doing a game.

[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.120]
How come, how come every time you come in here, you sound like a real Julio?

[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.280]
Well, the day that he came up before, remember the time you came up to my seat at the dolphin game?

[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:03.620]
Right.

[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.040]
The one time you didn't shine and showed up.

[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.200]
Right.

[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.140]
And he sounded just like like a regular guy.

[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.160]
And you come in here and you have that it always is like.

[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:10.860]
They're good.

[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.880]
Like an act.

[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:12.780]
An act.

[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.220]
Yeah.

[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.940]
You sound like you're putting us on or something.

[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.440]
Putting you on.

[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.820]
Yeah, you probably put me on the phone in Jersey or something.

[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.780]
Oh, no, I did live in Jersey.

[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.640]
I told you.

[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.360]
Before I came down.

[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.180]
Now, look at this.

[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.400]
Do we take care of you or what?

[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:25.980]
All right.

[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.660]
Here's Flores with 45 pounds.

[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.100]
But only one slice of pizza.

[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.100]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:30.420]
Okay.

[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.180]
Just a little warning because if you eat the second slice.

[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:34.640]
That's it.

[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.320]
Thank you, sir.

[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.060]
You're a great American.

[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.400]
Okay.

[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.960]
Now, what is the, see how he's holding his fingers apart like that?

[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.600]
What is that an indication of?

[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.780]
He was like holding his, he was not between fingers.

[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.580]
He was like this, like about the two inches apart.

[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.580]
Is he like a message there or something?

[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.340]
It might be.

[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.640]
It might be.

[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.080]
I don't know.

[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.860]
You got to call me.

[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.280]
I haven't seen anybody so reluctant and so we call us to drink.

[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.960]
Can't just be a great day and you're like, can't be this be the day that you just, uh, I don't know.

[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:04.820]
No, but wait a minute.

[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.480]
What do you mean?

[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.440]
I act like a Julio Julio Julio.

[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.460]
You know what a Julio is?

[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:10.640]
Julio.

[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.020]
Yeah, it's like a professional Cuban, you know, it's like, uh, Julio.

[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.840]
That's what we call him on this show.

[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.420]
They love that.

[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.260]
Julio and don't you remember Julio and Juliad?

[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.140]
Aromio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio.

[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:25.860]
Now you're talking.

[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.460]
Okay, let's take some calls.

[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.920]
You can start eating by the way any time you want and the food too.

[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.180]
Here's the Davey on the star line.

[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.480]
Hello.

[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.220]
Yeah, hi Neil.

[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:33.820]
How you doing?

[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.340]
How about those panthers?

[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.480]
Yeah, pretty exciting.

[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.120]
Now wait a minute.

[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.660]
Are you going to go to hockey games Orlando?

[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.160]
Hi.

[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.940]
Yeah, I've never been to hockey.

[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:41.660]
I have seen it.

[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:41.880]
Okay, great.

[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.000]
I have season tickets.

[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:43.880]
I'm so excited.

[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.380]
If you got good seats here, because if you do, I hate you like poison.

[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.220]
Well, then I won't let you hate me.

[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:48.820]
Okay.

[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.920]
I'm in the upper deck, but I'm on center.

[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:51.620]
Okay.

[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.500]
I'm on center.

[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.380]
Yeah.

[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.000]
Okay, but those are the seats I chose.

[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.040]
Those are good places to throw the octopus from.

[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.860]
Oh my God, Tina Waltz just came in.

[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.160]
Oh, no.

[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.040]
Did you buy this?

[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.020]
Well, thank you so much.

[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.500]
God almighty, I knew we had one salesperson back there.

[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.520]
We had our head on straight.

[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.840]
Look at that.

[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.500]
Look at the look on.

[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.300]
If you can see the look on Orlando's face when I showed him this, the CD.

[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.260]
Oh, embarrassing.

[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.920]
I'd be embarrassed to have looked like that.

[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.280]
Well, I wish I'd looked like that.

[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.780]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.520]
Were they unbeasurable or what?

[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.420]
The beasur is dynamite, man.

[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:26.980]
He is unreal.

[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.560]
And he's real.

[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.080]
He's God.

[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:28.720]
He was.

[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.880]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.800]
I mean, I really, I was getting into that game when, you know, we were two men short over and over.

[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.560]
All these penalties.

[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.020]
I know I was getting into that game.

[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.980]
Like it was a playoff game there at one point because I mean, it was so intense.

[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.560]
And here was the first exhibition game we ever played.

[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.180]
It was intense.

[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.880]
It was.

[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.280]
It was unreal.

[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.060]
Yep.

[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.080]
And.

[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.880]
I hear you're also going to Vegas, huh?

[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.060]
Well, I wasn't planning on going to Vegas, but I just found out that Lewis, my buddy, Louis Miguel,

[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.700]
who is my best close personal friend is doing at Seasers this weekend.

[00:12:59.320 --> 00:12:59.720]
Uh-huh.

[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.660]
I'm not going to Vegas.

[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.560]
You're not going?

[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.420]
I got a great restaurant for you to try.

[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.500]
Did a Italian restaurant?

[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:11.460]
No, actually, it's more like a steak, a seafood continental type thing.

[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.220]
Nice watch, Roland.

[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.000]
It's called Hugo's.

[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:15.300]
Yeah.

[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.980]
And it's in a union path.

[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.880]
I'll go a few go.

[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.160]

[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.360]
But they have a great Italian restaurant there, too, don't they?

[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.780]
The vineyard or something like, I don't know what it's called, but I've heard that the Italian restaurant in Seasers is to die from.

[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:28.780]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.420]
I didn't eat there.

[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.580]
I ate it to Delhi there in the form shop.

[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.140]
Yeah.

[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.680]
If you go, eat it to Delhi.

[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.260]
Okay.

[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.140]
It's unbelievable.

[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.360]
You'll have corn beef coming out of your ears.

[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.200]
Mm-hmm.

[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.860]
Okay, well, listen.

[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:42.320]
Okay.

[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.380]
If you're psyched, I'm psyched.

[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:44.840]
I'll tell you that.

[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.560]
I was into it.

[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.180]
No wait, there's one other thing though.

[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.500]
Yeah.

[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.100]
Have you ever heard of that new game show called the Seasers Challenge?

[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080]
Well, I'm odd Rashad.

[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:53.500]
No.

[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.340]
Okay, it's taped at the Seasers.

[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:55.980]
Vagely, yeah.

[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.380]
It's taped at that Seasers.

[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.680]
Well, when I went in July, I was a contestant on that game show.

[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:03.920]
Really?

[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:04.660]
Yes.

[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.680]
How'd you make out?

[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.860]
How'd they make out?

[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.540]
I don't want to talk about that.

[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.360]
Oh, bad question, huh?

[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.760]
Yeah, but it was fun being on the show and it was pretty wild to meet on my Rashad.

[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.020]
Yeah, he's okay.

[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:16.880]
He is okay.

[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.020]
He never stole a freight train.

[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:18.680]
He's not.

[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.820]
Oh, God.

[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.740]
Sir, I'm going to have to leave you now.

[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.800]
Like Luca Broughtzi said, he said,

[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.260]
I know it's your busy man today, your daughter's wedding.

[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.360]
Okay.

[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.400]
Good luck you're back.

[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:28.900]
Take it easy.

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.800]
Oh, my God, we're going to have to terminate the show right now.

[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.480]
Look at that.

[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.080]
Look at that.

[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.100]
Don't look at it too close, Orlando.

[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.080]
You might start getting nervous.

[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.700]
He is turning such a dark shade of purple man in his face, too.

[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.420]
Anyway, it's 1146 at WYOD and WSUN.

[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.260]
Boy, that Tina, man.

[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.180]
She knows how to do it.

[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.220]
Here's an incredible thing, man.

[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.280]
Marlin fans get a Marlin season's the first limited edition baseball for just $3.99

[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.720]
when you buy any subway footlong sandwich chips and a medium Coca-Cola classic

[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.440]
at any participating subway store.

[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.580]
Now, the baseball has the Florida Marlins inaugural logo and blazing right on one side

[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.960]
and a list of commemorative firsts on the other like the first game, the first win,

[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.300]
the first pitch, the first home run, etc., etc.

[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.360]
Subway, the place where fresh is the taste and subway, of course, known for their great

[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.880]
fresh baked bread and fresh veggies and sandwiches and salads made right before the eyes,

[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.640]
the way you like them.

[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.540]
Subway, the only place you can get the Marlins season the first limited edition baseball

[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.560]
to enjoy a BMT turkey steak and cheese subway club tuna seafood and crab meatball,

[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.440]
roast beef, veggie or cheese, just to name a few.

[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.980]
You pick out the one you like and also get a piece of Marlin's history at the same time.

[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.940]
A commemorative season the first baseball for just $3.99 when you buy any footlong sandwich,

[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.780]
chips and a medium Coca-Cola classic at any participating subway store.

[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.660]
Limit two-procustomer please, while supplies last only.

[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:46.960]
They all played.

[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.740]
Well, that's great.

[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.940]
And you're in here, diddling around with the food.

[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:51.640]
They all played.

[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.240]
What an asshole, man.

[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.140]
We're busy in here.

[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.320]
You're not mine.

[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.880]
Well, how was I supposed to hear it, you idiot?

[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.020]
How do you know they all played?

[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.120]
You assumed they all played.

[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.260]
They're all the lights are flashing.

[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.620]
That's only a little bit of Luis Miguel.

[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.400]
Maybe they never fired.

[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.420]
We're too busy showing on net Luis Miguel and she said that looks good to me,

[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.260]
but he needs a haircut.

[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.820]
This hair looks okay to me.

[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:15.860]
So we're in here.

[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.160]
We got so how about Orlando?

[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.000]
What he doing a pinch?

[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.940]
We can't get Luis Miguel in here today, huh?

[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.080]
What are you looking over there for?

[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.000]
He's over here.

[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.260]
Okay, she's so goddamn bashful, man.

[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.400]
Her husband's going to hear about this.

[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.820]
She'll be finished for life.

[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.880]
Everybody is so intimidated, so bashful, man.

[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:31.960]
I'm not bashful.

[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.380]
Just watch.

[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.460]
Okay, here's a lady in North Miami Beach.

[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:35.720]
Hello.

[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.460]
Hi, Neil.

[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:36.800]
Hi.

[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:37.900]
This is Marlon.

[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.760]
I got the tickets from you on Tuesday.

[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.900]
He gave me for my birthday to the Marlon's game.

[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:42.840]
And...

[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.620]
And I had a really good time except they totally blew.

[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.600]
Except for the fact that they're in a coma now.

[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.560]
You picked a bad time to go.

[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.940]
You picked a really good time to pick the worst time.

[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.260]
I swear, the weather was great.

[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.220]
You know, I mean, it was nice that it drizzled like two seconds.

[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.820]
But, uh, man, they really just totally blew.

[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:02.980]
They bit the big one, yeah.

[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.200]
Yeah, I was kind of upset about that.

[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.080]
Did you go?

[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:06.700]
No.

[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:07.660]
You didn't go.

[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.600]
Well, flying over the stadium with a...

[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.600]
Flying over the stadium was like a twin engine.

[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.240]
Yeah.

[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.380]
And his engine stalled out right over the stadium.

[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.500]
Now, that's not the guy that was carrying the gigantic banner of Markey Markin, his Calvin Klein's wallet.

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.280]
No, no.

[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.860]
He wasn't carrying a banner, but his engine stalled out right over the stadium.

[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:27.620]
Oh, that's great.

[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.240]
And all you can do is everybody just breathing in.

[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.820]
It was great.

[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.200]
Hmm.

[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.700]
What a rush.

[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:32.800]
Beautiful.

[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:38.320]
I think for the next dolphin game to turn our luck around instead of having that Markey Mark poster up there,

[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.640]
we'll have Orlando and his Calvin Klein's like trailing over the dolphin game.

[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.660]
There you go.

[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.440]
For the Red Skin.

[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.140]
How would I say?

[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.020]
Red Skin's in four skins.

[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.760]
Oh, here's ESEA.

[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:49.680]
Now, we have to...

[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.520]
Now, before we do...

[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.580]
We got to rewind the tape.

[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.460]
Okay, for ESEA.

[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.380]
Can you see on the VCR down there below?

[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.000]
Where it says rewind?

[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.240]
That one.

[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.000]
You have to give instructions and not rewind.

[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.500]
I have to give instructions.

[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.060]
The wireless is a crappy VCR.

[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.820]
You're folded down.

[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:03.420]
There you go.

[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.220]
Just keep holding it.

[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:04.860]
Here we go.

[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.440]
A little longer.

[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.080]
A little longer.

[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.960]
You bet anytime.

[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:08.920]
Okay, let it go.

[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.500]
Let it go.

[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:10.940]
Hit play.

[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:12.620]
Play.

[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.200]
Believe me, you see, you'll appreciate this.

[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.760]
You'll thank me for this and your will.

[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.300]
Okay.

[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.200]
She's a big Luis Miguel fan.

[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:19.800]
She's obsessed.

[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.400]
Anyway, go ahead.

[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:21.900]
I'm sorry.

[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.840]
That's all right.

[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.700]
I just wanted to call somebody a douchebag.

[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.120]
Okay.

[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.500]
Paula, you are a big beautiful, teeny tiny.

[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.400]
It's a bitty little douchebag.

[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.140]
Okay, I'm glad you had a good time.

[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:32.840]
It's part of the fact.

[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.160]
I can't be responsible for our team sucking a big one.

[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:35.440]

[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.000]
But it was still fun.

[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.700]
Thanks a lot, Nick.

[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.160]
Well, that's good.

[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:38.900]
Bye-bye.

[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.320]
See ya.

[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.600]
We're on the air in here.

[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.080]
Okay, you want the audio here.

[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:43.960]
Get out of the way, Bob.

[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.160]
She wants the audio too.

[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.520]
She may have an accident in here before we're finished.

[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.280]
This woman is such a gigantic Luis Miguel fan.

[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.100]
If she knew that he was at Caesar's in Vegas this weekend,

[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.460]
I might even take you if you speak real nice to me.

[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.460]
Would Joey Reynolds, yeah?

[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.880]
Yeah, but you don't have to sell me, okay, Andy?

[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.120]
And look at this Tina being the great goddess that she is,

[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.780]
went out and look what she bought.

[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:12.600]
Yeah.

[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.260]
She is Tina's a goddess.

[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.480]
Say, if you can't see them, join them.

[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.780]
That's what they say, right, Orlando?

[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.080]
Can't see them, join them.

[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.720]
We're starting to do the whole show in Spanish all now.

[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.300]
See you, Neil.

[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.500]
See this.

[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.700]
That's the famous Orlando.

[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.320]
Would you like to sit on his lap for a little while?

[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.760]
Until you're a married woman.

[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.980]
Did that make a difference before?

[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.320]
Look at Anna Maria laughing at that one.

[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.120]
I shouldn't have mentioned Anna Maria, sir.

[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.280]
I'll get for a giri in here again.

[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.120]
Here is every time I mentioned your name, he comes in and

[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:51.940]
they're all going to start again.

[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:52.680]
They're going to start again.

[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.720]
Keep him out of here.

[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.760]
Would you please go get him something to do like some...

[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.640]
Have him clean the latrine downstairs.

[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.140]
That one that was overflowing yesterday.

[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.000]
I don't want to do this in the middle of lunch,

[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.100]
but I'm telling you, if there wasn't something from outer space

[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.860]
in this building yesterday, oh, God.

[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.600]
He must have thought this was a bank,

[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.700]
because he left the biggest deposit I have ever seen in my life.

[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.780]
Yeah, yeah, there was a New Year's gift.

[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.520]
Here's Tampa.

[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:13.980]
Hello.

[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.260]
Hey, Neil, happy Friday.

[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.160]
And the same to you.

[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:16.800]
Thank God.

[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.420]
So about time, huh?

[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.740]
I got so many choices now.

[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.860]
I can go to Vegas this weekend or I can stay around

[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.300]
and watch videos or whatever.

[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.260]
But do you think your obsession is going to be back in time

[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:25.940]
from Monday show?

[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:26.780]
Probably.

[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.100]
What was that guy's bottom earlier about the booster

[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.680]
couldn't even carry Poppins to dock stuff across the creek?

[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:33.600]
Wasn't that a joke?

[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.320]
Oh, man.

[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:34.620]
Well, look at him.

[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.080]
He wouldn't know Felix Poppant from Dennis Poppant.

[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.380]
Yeah.

[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.820]
Who, by the way, last night, wait, no, you didn't hear the,

[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.700]
because you're over there.

[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.100]
So you didn't hear the telecast on Sunshine?

[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:43.540]
No.

[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.220]
Dennis Poppant will be okay eventually once he comes out of his coma.

[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:47.760]
He's a little.

[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.860]
I don't think they realize that Poppant had the lowest goal

[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:51.060]
to get that record.

[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:51.620]
No, no, Dennis.

[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.160]
Dennis, Dennis, not Felix.

[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.020]
Dennis, Dennis Poppant, the one who's like doing the color on the TV.

[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.600]
Yeah, I'm not talking about Felix.

[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.300]
You don't have to sell me on Felix.

[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.640]
Felix Poppant is God.

[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.180]
Anyways, what happened to that number 26

[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.120]
when you guys as bench is, what did you get to stick up

[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:06.840]
his nose or something?

[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:07.740]
Who's that?

[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.400]
Some guy, you, when the line changes are going on,

[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.420]
he got like a stick up his nose, had to carry him off the ice.

[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.200]
Oh, yeah, he got to cut on the ice.

[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:14.780]
Yeah.

[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:15.680]
He'll be alright.

[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.020]
Yeah, you got a good looking team there.

[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:17.840]
Yeah.

[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.840]
Thanks for the beavers.

[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.560]
Let me all right, I'm telling you.

[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.080]
Oh, no, he's like God.

[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:23.860]
Man, it was for that.

[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.760]
We'd be up three or four goals more than what we were.

[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.580]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.500]
In fact, if they were left him in the whole game,

[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.320]
I hate to break the news to you, but we would have won the game.

[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.040]
Yeah.

[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.060]
What was I going to say?

[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.360]
Oh, jeez, for God.

[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.660]
And it was all on the fourth floor, all on the fourth floor,

[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.100]
over an hour.

[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:37.960]
That's why you forgot.

[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.840]
That's the way we planted.

[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.140]
And it works like a charm, doesn't it?

[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.680]
Yeah, y'all look pretty sleazy in the first period,

[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.960]
but I guess you got that fire then.

[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.220]
You know, you know, you know, you're underneath your butt.

[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.740]
Yeah, the period went well.

[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.380]
Wait a minute.

[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.100]
How about the lightning in the first period?

[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.620]
You guys had a two-man advantage over and over again,

[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.480]
and couldn't score at Kathy Willow's house.

[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.320]
Let's get serious.

[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.020]
I know, 50 minutes of that game was a penalty.

[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.080]
You guys couldn't score at Orlando's brisk.

[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.860]
Yeah, the big demilodlet showed us a few times.

[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.820]
I know, the sort of Bradley they whiffed right there on the open net.

[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:05.760]
Yeah.

[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.760]
But, um, yeah.

[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.040]
And that one, Bradley had the whole open net, man.

[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:09.880]
He just choked big.

[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.080]
I know, he just, he was choked.

[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.540]
He was excited.

[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.140]
I was like, happy birthday, and he just, you know,

[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.620]
forgot totally about the net right there.

[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.000]
Yeah.

[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.600]
Anyway, Kathy, somebody, dish bag.

[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.080]
Go ahead.

[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.560]
Okay, joke in 40.

[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.020]
You're a meatball eaten.

[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.940]
But sniffing, paint your balls, but douchebag.

[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:23.360]
Okay.

[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.920]
Have a great life, fam.

[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:25.520]
You too, thank you.

[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.880]
Open line and, bro, boy, so much excitement going on in here.

[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.580]
You would almost think we didn't even have a radio show.

[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.600]
I wonder how much dead air there was at the end of that break.

[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.420]
Huh?

[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.180]
We'll never know.

[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.260]
Maybe the lady in North Miami Beach can tell us hello.

[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.440]
Uh, I have to be blind, but that shouldn't stop.

[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.160]
We have an open line and, day, 751.

[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:44.940]
Do you believe that?

[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.900]
Now, someone, now we got people playing tapes of blind, Mike, on here.

[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.640]
That's the best part.

[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.980]
Maybe they wanted to pull them out.

[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.160]
Maybe they had some jingles they wanted to play the pull them out of his show on WSBH.

[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:54.700]
Huh?

[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:55.400]
Under blind.

[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.480]
What is that beast stand for in SBH?

[00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:57.920]
Blind?

[00:22:59.280 --> 00:22:59.640]
Huh?

[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.160]
South Beach blind station?

[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.520]
Or they should call this one that because this station basically consisted of the blind leading the blind.

[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.600]
Here is Clearwater.

[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:07.880]
Hello.

[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.020]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:09.720]
Pretty good, sir.

[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.080]
You really have to excuse the people in the West Coast.

[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.440]
They really don't know a pluck from a pluck, you know.

[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.560]
They really don't know hockey.

[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.200]
From a pluck?

[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.460]
Yeah, a pluck, you know.

[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:17.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.500]
And, uh, you know, I tell you what, if you want to meet Luis Miguel, more than one of the biggest.

[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.300]
I tell you what.

[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.020]
Orlando and I are going to Vegas this weekend.

[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.120]
We're going to fly out there to meet him.

[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.960]
I'm sure he's letting it all hang out at the Little Rocks Museum, you know?

[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.580]
That's the one?

[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.740]
At the Liberty Museum.

[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.220]
Yeah, all right.

[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.000]
You know it, you know it.

[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.280]
Hey, I got a shameful request.

[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.860]
I really enjoy this song.

[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.260]
Can you play stuck on a bench in Del Rey for me?

[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.680]
How about sitting on a bench?

[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.400]
Well, whatever.

[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:45.140]
In your case, stuck on a bench may be true, but, uh, in Randy's case, it would be stuck on a bench.

[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.000]
Yeah, well, you know how that is.

[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.320]
Can you do that for me?

[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:48.600]
Yes.

[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:49.480]
All right, thank you.

[00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:47.410]
Hey, look, oh, I wonder you know I can't I'm sitting here. I'm wondering why Orlando wouldn't take a second place of pizza

[00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.230]
He heard the news

[00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.430]
That's probably what it was definitely don't ever take two like

[00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.290]
Yeah, yeah, they shoot this 13 year old kid

[00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.170]
Well, first of all the first of all the old guys smacked him in the chest

[00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.130]
He said here I get out of my face you and give me another slice of pizza

[00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.770]
And a kid went home and he got a gun and he said but I'm being that's it and the guy

[00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:11.830]
Your new staff is very selective on what they report. Yeah, they don't tell you that well

[00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:16.230]
That's the true story so not so now that you analyze it that way now it makes a little more sense doesn't it?

[00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.710]
Of course it does right. I mean anybody hits me in the chest especially in this town

[00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.390]
Right you go home and you get a gun and you blow their crap away

[00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.050]

[00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.410]
Rosie you're not a douchebag George is a douchebag

[00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:43.390]
George is dead me

[00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.970]
So I guess we can assume Luis is making a little bit more per hour than you are Orlando

[00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.390]
We don't want you to get a big a swelled head

[00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:17.590]
He's not making more than you are mm-hmm a lot more like millions millions and millions and you're probably like just as talented as he is

[00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.930]
I can't son oh can't think

[00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:22.550]
Look almost as good as he does

[00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.830]
Anyway, so now we got this an interview with Luis Miguel by Manuel Pila

[00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.930]
By Manuel labor where did this come from by the way?

[00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:37.490]
That's from the girl that's from Eltha from from Warner. Oh, this is what the horse is but

[00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:46.270]
Well excuse me look at that. Here's a whole biography career of Luis Miguel 1982 and the two-year span from ages 12 to 14

[00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.750]
He records and succeeds with four albums

[00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:53.810]
One and one equals two in normados in normados

[00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.150]
Huh, what is that?

[00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.910]
Oh, in Amorado. So I thought it said enormous

[00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:06.250]
Well, I chose you where my mind is here's the mobile as they're gone on the mobile and to that it looked like that for just a second

[00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.090]
He said it's enormous

[00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:15.210]

[00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:52.210]

[00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:31.050]
She came in here all the way in here and I'm very grateful especially for the one picture in here where like you start naked

[00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.730]
Oh, well pretty close

[00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:38.090]
That's not sure that was worth it then. Yeah, but no Orlando City had too much clothes on. He'll never make it modeling Calvin Klein

[00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.530]
Now the new the old CD which is Romance

[00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:45.290]
That's the really nice one because it has all those low-spexies

[00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:50.690]
Lusty songs lusty songs. Yeah, that's the one you have to get really yeah

[00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:54.690]
Well, let's want to make do the one where he's got his hands deep in his pockets in the big grin on his face

[00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:59.990]
Now you have to you have to know he looks a lot different now when he first started. Yeah, he used to have this

[00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:05.950]
You know shoulder length hair. Oh, and all he would do that's what Orlando said he said he used to have hair down to his public

[00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.310]
It was gross and all he would do is jump around and stage and just yank his hair and all the growth

[00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.530]
He used to jump around and yank it yank it and his hair too

[00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:19.590]
Uh-huh he would just pull the tug of his hair on the front and then he'd do like an Elvis move

[00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.010]
Yeah, oh he was gross but now in other words he was trying to be like Michael Jackson

[00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.990]
He'd grab it at his uh thing and jump it around a lot and molesting little boys

[00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:31.410]
This huge mansion and alcapocal. Yeah, and he has all these wild parties

[00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:33.170]
And stuff with whom

[00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:38.490]
Well, maybe we can slip in if there's that many people there. They'll never notice us. I'm saying you can slip in

[00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.170]
Huh, well, it's all gold. We're leaving right now. The bus is leaving in a half an hour

[00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:46.930]
Anybody want to go in party with Louise, huh? Go to Vegas. I'll guarantee you there'll be somebody there for everybody

[00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:50.610]
Well, you got to get that CD. It's really really good

[00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.550]
What's it called? Romance

[00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:54.370]
Rrrr

[00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:57.630]
My tongue keeps getting stuck on my molar

[00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.550]
Anyway, wait a minute. What is it? Romance

[00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:12.550]
It sounds like Sally Fitz is in the building you hear that? You know, or rap or attices in 10th gear man

[00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:14.070]
It's about to take off into orbit

[00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:14.990]
You know Neil

[00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:20.290]
Ornanda has a real sexy voice. He does. You ever see Orlando? No, I'm nervous. Oh my god

[00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:24.750]
He would make you forget Luis Miguel and Ota. Well, I don't like really loose Miguel. What do you like about we think?

[00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.870]
You don't like his looks? No, he's just then

[00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:35.410]
What? What do you like chubby guys? No, not Joey, but he just looks like a real young kid. Oh, that's why you like him

[00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.670]
He's 23 years. Don't say that. He's legal aid

[00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:43.890]
As long as they're not jailbait. That's right up my alley. Okay, leave. Okay. Leave you number with George

[00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.190]
Now Orlando is more your

[00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:50.590]
Orlando's 28 Orlando's 28. He's a male model. Oh, there you go

[00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.690]
He was in the men from Cuba calendar in which all the other guys were ugly and he was out of this world

[00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.030]
Out of this world. I'm gonna tell you something or Orlando

[00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.990]
You lucked out because you stood out and you must have had something to do with that

[00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:04.170]
You must have some pull if I could get it. What's that? Huh? What's that? He stood out

[00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.510]
It's stood out. No really because if you go down on South Beach

[00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:13.170]
You will see so many beautiful Cuban guys. I mean really hot-looking guys. Am I right? Yeah, you do

[00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:14.950]
I'm asking him. Oh, but no

[00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:17.950]
Don't you stop it. Yeah

[00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:24.330]
Yeah, huh? Because he's turning a deeper shade of pale man because he is the mama's listing right now

[00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:28.550]
I get very embarrassed easily your mom listen to this your mama. Yeah, your mama

[00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:31.030]
My mama. Yeah, why mama? Why mama

[00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.870]
But anyway, so they could have probably found a lot of really hot-looking guys

[00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:40.730]
Down here on South Beach, but they had all these ugly guys in an Orlando who's like a 45 on a scale of three

[00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:44.290]
Yeah, so he stood out. That's why he became a big star now

[00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:48.650]
So he's in a calendar and he's in he's in everything if you open up any magazine

[00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:52.150]
He's modeling all over the place. He's like in Calvin Klein's things. He's all no

[00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.010]

[00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:27.930]
Some of them were real good. Well some of them not so good. Yeah, but the score should have been

[00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.170]
bigger than what it was. It should have been a lot bigger. That's what I've always said. It should have been a lot bigger
