[00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.800]
13 on the IOD Network.

[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.340]
1017, one thing I'll say about this ice cream.

[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.120]
It is so hard.

[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.420]
Because it's frozen and it's going to be great.

[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.280]
Thanks to Damon and his Pisons here, three of them.

[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.800]
Three guys, not one but three.

[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.740]
Bring us in just tons and tons,

[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.180]
and pikes and pikes and big containers of eaties.

[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.820]
Those are like what?

[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.620]
Those are half gallons?

[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.140]
I guess.

[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.500]
And we're going to have a good time with it.

[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.360]
And guess what Rick?

[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.440]
He had the balls to ask me yesterday to save him a pint.

[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.860]
We ought to do it out of spite.

[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.100]
Save him a pint of cookie dough and do something special in it.

[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.400]
If we got the weasel in the back room to do something special,

[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.280]
I don't even know the difference.

[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.440]
Now, is the reason that all those lines are lit up

[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.540]
because I have this talking head sand in your van felene thing?

[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.980]
It is?

[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.460]
Well, that's not right.

[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.140]
Well, we do have a couple of calls under before that.

[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.380]
The last hit around is Stan had some technical problems over there.

[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.680]
At what?

[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.680]
It sounds bad?

[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.400]
He's bad.

[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.020]
How about now?

[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.820]
Is that better?

[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.980]
Well, look, I can't be responsible for what's going on here.

[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.360]
If everybody would just cooperate and do this thing and be reasonable,

[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.500]
we wouldn't have to keep adjusting the thing and keep pumping up the remote control

[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.360]
with Kevin Dillon.

[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.220]
See, I remember that today.

[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.920]
How do you like that?

[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.780]
Mmm.

[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.400]
Wavy gravy line.

[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.780]
How's Wavy gravy line?

[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.200]
Do we have that in here?

[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.820]
So how's, um, now that's not in here unless it's under Davy?

[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.080]
One moment, please.

[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.800]
Davy Jones?

[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.520]
That's not in there.

[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.840]
So how's Davy gravy line?

[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.400]
How's that possible?

[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.880]
Is that under gravy line?

[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.920]
Boy, this thing's starting to really...

[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.120]
It's starting to get me aggravated.

[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.740]
They warned me.

[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.640]
They said, boy, don't get a, um, don't get a false sense of security with computers

[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.260]
because in the beginning it's like it's great.

[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.440]
No more searching, please.

[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.220]
Thank you, Dave.

[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.580]
Okay, let's do a lady in Fort Lauderdale who probably must want the CDs

[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.020]
because otherwise she wouldn't be calling me.

[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.040]
Hello?

[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.000]
Hi.

[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.440]
Hi.

[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.780]
I don't want the CDs.

[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.640]
Well, great.

[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.360]
And you actually called to speak to me?

[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.000]
Yeah, I did.

[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.360]
I can't get over this.

[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.280]
You could knock me over with a feather duster.

[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.240]
I just want to ask you, did you see on the news on Channel 7 a couple days ago

[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.100]
about the sanitary of people that were sacrificing animal rights in front of the reporters?

[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.440]
Right.

[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.200]
Don't you find that appalling?

[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.980]
I find it nauseating and revolting and a one guy that kicked out of the church.

[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.860]
Yeah.

[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.640]
They said too many animals.

[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.100]
I think it was like 19 or 20.

[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.200]
They said anything more than 15 we get upset about.

[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.820]
But you know what really made me stuck?

[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.400]
What's that?

[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.160]
The on?

[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.340]
That they had to show it on the news?

[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.740]
Not only they showed on the news, but all of these reporters stand by and watch it happen.

[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.040]
No, these people have no decent say.

[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.520]
What did you want them to do?

[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.960]
Start a riot?

[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.320]
Well, they could have done something to try and stop them.

[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.840]
Like what?

[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.940]
They could have grabbed the chicken?

[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.180]
Start a fight?

[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.480]
No.

[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.640]
They had that goat in their arm.

[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.580]
And the guy was trying to kill it.

[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.940]
The blade was too dull.

[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.780]
Oh, no.

[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.160]
They had to do it again.

[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.740]
They had to have a crowd of reporters and camera men there.

[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.360]
And they just stand there and watch it.

[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.540]
I mean, it is so hard.

[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.560]
God.

[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.660]
I didn't see.

[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.120]
I refused to watch any of it.

[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.920]
As soon as they put the story on, I like said not for me.

[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.380]
Yeah, I just, I mean, I find this sanitary of people disgusting to begin with.

[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.880]
Do you?

[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.600]
Absolutely.

[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.560]
Somebody needs to put a third throat.

[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.160]
Really?

[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.940]
Absolutely.

[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.540]
But to think that there's also regular people out there that will stand by and watch it happen.

[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.700]
Look, don't you understand?

[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.500]
The news people will stand by and watch anything as long as they can keep the tape rolling and get the story.

[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.480]
They don't give a crap.

[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.820]
Well, it's a sad, sad day.

[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.880]
It is a sad day.

[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.300]
You're right.

[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.200]
I spoke to one of them.

[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.440]
Can you explain to me why my bank was closed this morning when it's not a holiday?

[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.260]
No, I can't.

[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.040]
What bank?

[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.980]
Nation's bank.

[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.940]
Really?

[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.320]
It's closed.

[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.020]
Yeah.

[00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.300]
I don't have any idea.

[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.420]
8.35 in the morning.

[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.580]
The drive-through is post-opened.

[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.080]
Maybe somebody will call and answer.

[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.200]
Yes, well.

[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.440]
Because I'm afraid that maybe my bank went out of business or something.

[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.120]
I don't think so.

[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.440]
Took off with all your money.

[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.740]
Yeah.

[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.500]
Well, not that much.

[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.400]
Okay, well listen, I'm sure a lot of other people are just as a p-o-d-s-u-r.

[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.720]
Yeah.

[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.580]
Well, thanks for talking to me.

[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.640]
I don't want to get your goat.

[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.560]
Have a great day.

[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.740]
Bye.

[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.920]
We have an open line.

[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.640]
It's in Broward.

[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.720]
If I didn't bring it like 100 of these CDs, but I don't have 100.

[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.500]
These are expensive.

[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.660]
This is a double set.

[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.560]
And who the hell would ever want this thing?

[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.780]
Life during wartime.

[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.920]
Girlfriend is better.

[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.780]
And she was.

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.640]
Stay up late.

[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.320]
Road to nowhere.

[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.360]
Sacks and violins.

[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600]
I wonder if a, huh?

[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.780]
It's all great stuff.

[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.140]
I don't like the talking heads.

[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.620]
I'm sorry.

[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.280]
Okay, I'm not into the talking heads.

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.020]
You like it?

[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.000]
You're not getting it.

[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.180]
Because I'm not going to piss off these people on the phone.

[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.260]
I will put, huh?

[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.980]
You're going to give it to me.

[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.220]
What?

[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.260]
I'll borrow it from the person you give it to.

[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.340]
No, you won't borrow it from anybody.

[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.160]
How do you like that?

[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.200]
You got, did you watch FATSO yet?

[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.720]
That FAT rich brought you that tape?

[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.080]
You did?

[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.280]
You did not.

[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.920]
Well, so that's your next assignment.

[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.040]
Take Carol one thing at a time.

[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.260]
Oh, by the way, now before the saw start, it's melting.

[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.560]
And I noticed, you know, if there nobody came anywhere near here.

[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.540]
Just don't on me.

[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.160]
I'm sitting here and there's these three big Styrofoam containers with all the ice cream.

[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.380]
Nobody came anywhere near the room.

[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.120]
Now, is Animory working today?

[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.580]
Now?

[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.960]
Is she listening?

[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.480]
Because they brought some special spores, a spores with spores for, uh, to take a little taste buds.

[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.900]
Old Animory.

[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.600]
I have a lot of money, but I don't have a gun.

[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.980]
Oh, sorry, honey.

[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.400]
But now you have to go, uh, a spores spores.

[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.900]
They brought her E.D. spores just for Animory to tickle the, uh, ends of her, uh, thing.

[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.760]
So I hope she comes in.

[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.520]
I want people to come and eat the size cream.

[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.680]
Now I got my wavy gravy, which is starting to melt.

[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.640]
You really can't eat it until it starts getting like real room temperature and gets real, real soft.

[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.800]
Because when they first bring in it, it's frozen and it is.

[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.460]
It is so hard.

[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.200]
But now it's starting to soften up a little bit.

[00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.060]
Mm-hmm.

[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.080]
Wavy gravy.

[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.680]
I'll do the same thing that Rick did the other day.

[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.860]
And really ingredients, toffee, cashews, Brazil nut, ice cream, with a chocolate hazelnut, fudge, swirl, and roasted almonds.

[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.960]
God is this, uh, incredible, unbelievable, indescribable.

[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.380]
So anyway, they distribute the E.D.'s and Ben and Jerry's and they brought like a bunch of each.

[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.500]
I don't see anybody coming in here for the ice cream.

[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.680]
I'm going to tell you this right now.

[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.520]
If you don't, then the Georgian are going to take it all home and put it in the freezer.

[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.700]
And you can all stick it where the moon don't shine.

[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.860]
At least take it and stick it in your name on it and put it in the freezer.

[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.080]
And I hope there would be a couple hours it might still be here all the way to some likely.

[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.660]
1023, by the way, somebody stole Johnny Darks.

[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.820]
Isn't that something on his ice cream too?

[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.720]
1023 on the IOD Network.

[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.440]
Yeah, I've been listening to your show since so much day one.

[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.720]
Yeah.

[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.740]
Because I heard you on your talking about your show.

[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.800]

[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.960]
How long have you been on the radio station?

[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.700]
Well, if you've been listening since almost day one, you do them now.

[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.320]
The Randy Road Show.

[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.780]
Tonight at 7 on Newstalk Radio 610, WIOD.

[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.220]
Update on traffic and the current weather forecast.

[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.780]
Like that's going to make a difference that you put a thing on there taken.

[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.960]
There's nobody else that's coming here anyway.

[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.900]
They must have hot 105 on the monitors today because there's nobody at, huh?

[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.040]
There's nobody in the building listening.

[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.240]
That one person is coming here to grab up some ice cream.

[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:33.180]
There are loads and loads of pints of ben and juries and eat these big, half gallons including eat these crunchy cone with chocolate cone pieces, peanuts and caramel caramel.

[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.800]
Oh, do I hate when people say caramel?

[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.080]
That gives me like goosebumps.

[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.920]
I can't stand when people say caramel, not caramel.

[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.260]
But however you pronounce it, it's incredible.

[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:48.420]
God, it's like it's like taking those drumsticks that I'm allergic to and chop it them all up and putting them in ice cream.

[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.700]
Would it be gross if I took a spoonful out of this thing?

[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.620]
Like that?

[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.600]
God, well it's about time somebody came up here and got some.

[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.800]
I'm fan, this is Jared.

[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.540]
Oh, how you been?

[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.500]
So anyway here, wait till you try this.

[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.200]
Crunchy cone, eat these please.

[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.800]
It's going to fall on the board and schmutz all over and somebody's going to get a very, very upset.

[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.360]
Thank you.

[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.200]
And the wavy gravy line.

[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.000]
And it's all, this is the best, the wavy gravy.

[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.740]
That is tremendous.

[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:29.540]
And you notice that there's a smourst thing there for anamaria because you said yesterday she wanted some more smores and spores

[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.840]
to a tickler taste buds or something like that but she hasn't made any movement.

[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.340]
I guess everybody's either paranoid or they're all in the hot 105.

[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.720]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal.

[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.180]
I don't know where to start.

[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.760]
Okay, at the beginning would be a good place.

[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:43.720]
Perfect.

[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.680]
Yes?

[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.800]
Darrell Whiffmore.

[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.360]
There's got a lot of pictures.

[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.840]
Did I give him the right name or what?

[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.480]
Unbelievable.

[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.720]
Whiffmore, I told you.

[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.380]
He whiffed more than anybody I ever seen.

[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.780]
I mean, I don't know if it's because he's the last two games, okay.

[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.720]
He faced Abraham Hague and Tanae.

[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.020]
Tanae has his number.

[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.960]
He had no chance against Tanae.

[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.440]
He got that weak base hit the ninth inning.

[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.240]
Which, okay, maybe that'll help him.

[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.020]
Did you hear it, Jared?

[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.480]
After the outcome was over, like arrested got there.

[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.380]
When the game was already decided, then arrested comes up, gets ahead.

[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.120]
Like I said, I don't know where to start.

[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.740]
Between the two of them, okay.

[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.520]
Yeah, Whiffmore.

[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.680]
And how about Henry Cotto and that nice fielding plan setter field again?

[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.160]
Henry Cotto, I mean, I don't play Henry Cotto.

[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.700]
He may not be good, but he's consistent.

[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.620]
Every time the ball gets near him, he boots it.

[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.720]
He's marginal at best.

[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.620]
And not only is he marginal, he's old.

[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.260]
Did you see him when he took his house?

[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.080]
The guy's bald.

[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.540]
32 going on 40.

[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.180]
Jesus.

[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.880]
I don't know if they'll understand what the rush was to dump Maggadon.

[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.380]
Well, that's the...

[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.900]
That's the conversation that we're all having is what was the big rush.

[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.600]
Okay, he was discredible, so you sit him down and you work things out.

[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.180]
You give him a little try for his base.

[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.020]
You sit the big zero down for a while and you work it out.

[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.940]
You try a share field and right field who wanted to play right field.

[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.380]
But instead of that, they rushed into this whole thing.

[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.580]
They screwed the whole team up.

[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.740]
They turned it upside down.

[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.160]
And in spite of the fact that we got share field, I still say we had a better match.

[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.800]
And the other team a week ago, then we got today.

[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.300]
You want to know the fight thing about it.

[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.260]
Everybody says, oh, Tom Browski built the expo.

[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.240]
What did he build the expo too?

[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.880]
They never made the goddamn playoffs.

[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.520]
Well, they got some good young players, but as far as winning anything, you're right.

[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.940]
He didn't build the expo.

[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.080]
Now he built the expo for the last five or six years.

[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.460]
And they haven't had a damn thing.

[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.020]
Who cares?

[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.800]
You know, something, the whole thing is frustrating.

[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.360]
You sound a little agitated, I mean, sir.

[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:32.720]
I'm a little agitated.

[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.200]
The fact that we lost two in a row to a team that hasn't won two in a row since April.

[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.000]
In two months.

[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.520]
That played like 70 series in a row and never won two consecutive game until they played us.

[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.500]
Let me ask you that.

[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.220]
It wasn't bad enough.

[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.120]
We lost that frustrating game the other night when we made two great comebacks.

[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.060]
That wasn't bad enough.

[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.940]
But then to get blown out last night and look and we looked like the real a marginal team last night.

[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.920]
We looked like the expansion team and they looked like a real team.

[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.520]
And how we make them look good beats me.

[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.720]
That is not easy to make the best look.

[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.980]
Because their lineup still is for all these guys that nobody ever heard of before.

[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.320]
They got Coleman and Bonilla and Eddie Maria.

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.160]
How the net nobody ever heard of any of these people.

[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.360]
And the one way because they are not going to have it.

[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.360]
Maybe because his daddy played for the cup.

[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:18.060]
A part of it, I mean, between Bogar and what's the other guy's name?

[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.200]
Jeremy, I don't know what his name is.

[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.240]
Who's the other guy?

[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.980]
The guy with these two earrings in the long hair that looks like a...

[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.840]
I don't know what the hell he is.

[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.540]
Yeah, he used to work at GTR that guy.

[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:37.280]
Let me ask you, where did they come up with a stat that the met of not one two games in a row since April?

[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.540]
Yeah, but then they look back and they find out that the team hasn't won two in a row since...

[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.460]
You know what I'm saying? They come in 70 games that hasn't happened in 1920.

[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.060]
Where did they come up with these things?

[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.060]
What do you mean where they come up with them?

[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.200]
They had a lot of time on their head.

[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.100]
Yeah, apparently.

[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.100]
That's what baseball is all about, it's statistics.

[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.920]
I don't... first of all.

[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.800]
Don't you understand the official score like Sonny sits up in here and in between courses of food that they keep bringing to me?

[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.040]
The official score comes up with this, Chris.

[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.380]
I just don't understand what the rush was to dump Maggity.

[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.580]
I mean, don't... just try to... not only...

[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.020]
He blows.

[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:13.680]
He blows.

[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.820]
He ought to put him out of bus... put him out of bus to Japan.

[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.240]
Well, he'll be out of pocket.

[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.000]
Got to feel better getting it off my chest.

[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:21.520]
Okay.

[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.300]
Well, wait, wait.

[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.280]
It's going to get worse, yes?

[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.140]
And we better not get swept tonight.

[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.180]
If we lose tonight, boy, there's going to be a long-yum Kipper weekend.

[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.260]
Let's tell you that.

[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.820]
I am definitely going to that game tonight.

[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.380]
I'd like to see Good and Pace.

[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.020]
I'd like to put Kelly Shepard and Arresta's distraught on the same bus to Japan.

[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.560]
What's the problem with Shepard?

[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.800]
I don't even want to go into it.

[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.360]
He's a master of disaster.

[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.440]
If he can't win it, he wants to make sure that nobody else can either.

[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:52.300]
Knocking people down out there just... his... his... his on track behavior is so aberrant and unacceptable

[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.780]
that I'm surprised that somebody hasn't beaten the living crap out of him yet.

[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.580]
The stuff he pulls out there on a racetrack is nauseating and the just grotesque and he makes me puke

[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.460]
and I wish he'd go back to Toronto and stay there.

[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.480]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.280]
Just absolutely outrageous.

[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.700]
If I can't win it, I'm out here to make sure that somebody else don't.

[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.500]
And he makes sure.

[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.600]
We have an open line. It's in Broward 5249463.

[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.280]
Here's Pombi Chiloh.

[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.360]
More and Uncle Liam.

[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.420]
Yes, sir. Welcome to a great Thursday,

[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.380]
a long 85 day holiday weekend.

[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.460]
I was just going to comment on how interesting your Thursday was starting off.

[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.420]
Yeah, with ice cream.

[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.160]
Exactly.

[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.920]
I know that you're going to get about 1500 calls about the Milo and the Games.

[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.460]
So I'm going to kind of stay away from that.

[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.560]
I know the game blew out.

[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.780]
You're going to steer away from it?

[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.000]
Yeah.

[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.420]
And I know that I'll leave that up to somebody else.

[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.020]
Okay.

[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.820]
But while you were at the game, why lie soon, you were at the game?

[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.540]
What, last night?

[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:45.760]
Yeah.

[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.380]
No, I was at the track watching the game.

[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.300]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.280]
Well, you probably didn't get a chance to see what was on the news last night.

[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:52.740]
No.

[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.980]
It's about this TV violence crap.

[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:55.540]
Yeah.

[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.880]
Did you see anything about that?

[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.960]
No, I heard the story that they're going to put voluntary disclaimers on there, which is pretty amusing.

[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.700]
Well, not only that, but the four major networks, the head guys.

[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.680]
The head guys.

[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:07.900]

[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.360]
The head guys.

[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.860]
They got on the air.

[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.960]
It is so hard.

[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.480]
Tell me about it.

[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.800]
They got on the air last night.

[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.800]
And they were saying that, oh, well, you know, we really kind of pushed the limits to TV.

[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.460]
And children are just watching and watching.

[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.640]
We just can't have that.

[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.980]
But who is that?

[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:26.820]
And who are they?

[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.680]
And who is the Congress to make all this crap up?

[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.260]
That, you know, who says that a parent can't come over?

[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:32.840]
Turn off the...

[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.220]
Hey, exactly.

[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.680]
They sit up there in Washington and they start making all these threats.

[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.160]
They bring the executives in.

[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:38.660]
Exactly.

[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.560]
And they start making all these threats like somebody empowered them to censor what material is on.

[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.320]
Well, I mean...

[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.380]
Just like this bit about language on radio.

[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.480]
It's the same thing.

[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.140]
Who the hell...

[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.960]
Who the hell ever told them that they had the authority to decide that they were going to be the censors for public taste?

[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:54.880]
It's a bunch of shots.

[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:55.580]
Exactly.

[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.400]
It really is.

[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.140]
I mean, who are they?

[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.160]
They just sit up there and play.

[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.820]
Well, they're a bunch of shot heads as who they are.

[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.320]
The goddess with our channel changers.

[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:02.500]
Right.

[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.960]
I mean, it's...

[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.340]
And of course, they're doing it because they're pandering so desperately to what the goody-touches

[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:14.800]
use, this family values crowd out there who, you know, want to repress everybody so they can do all their stuff behind closed doors.

[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.100]
Well, they still have a little bush left.

[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.120]
Yeah.

[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.460]
Yeah, they're still to speak, yeah.

[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.320]
Still bushed out.

[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.400]
But, uh, in closing, I'd like to wish my Mr. Tracy a happy birthday.

[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.220]
In fact, I noticed with all the screw-ups, you have to wonder if there isn't just a little bit of bush left in the White House.

[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:29.740]
Yeah.

[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:30.480]
Okay.

[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:30.820]
Yeah.

[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.240]
Have a great day.

[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.760]
In closing, yes?

[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.500]
Chammels request.

[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:34.900]
Yeah.

[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.120]
Uh, I can't get over the Larry King phone call without the boss, but...

[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:40.360]
Okay.

[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.800]
I just want to hear the whole phone call.

[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.100]
Okay.

[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.160]
Thank you, I agree.

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:43.960]
Bye.

[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.220]
Okay, we have an open line.

[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.300]
It's on the green line, 1-800-944.

[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.580]
Have some ice cream, Greg.

[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:49.920]
Come on.

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]
Have two or three gallons.

[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.880]
Well, I got it off of it to anybody that shows up.

[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.320]
I bet Jake would like some ice cream.

[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:57.760]
Huh?

[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.920]
He's going to have to come in here and get it for himself.

[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.240]
And the ice cream, too.

[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.760]
And anybody else, I've never had this experience.

[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:10.600]
I think the whole Rick and Suds thing the other day just has soured everybody in the building on the ice cream deal.

[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.880]
Because as much as they want it, they're so terrified of the whole thing that happened.

[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.980]
See, we want to share.

[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.000]
We want to spread it around.

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.520]
Now Bob Green and Cheryl were up here hopping up tons and tons of good stuff.

[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.060]
And then we were all in the title.

[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.800]
Take all you want.

[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:23.280]
Everybody.

[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.500]
Come and get it.

[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.300]
But don't take anamory as four as please.

[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.080]
Because she wants to share those with Randy.

[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.460]
The wavy gravy is the absolute best.

[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.200]
Did you have that yet?

[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.220]
The best ice cream, huh?

[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.840]
I put a little paper on it.

[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.320]
The best ice cream in the history of the human race is Ben and Jerry's wavy gravy.

[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.840]
It is just, uh, oh, to die for and from.

[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.320]
It's 1037 on the IOD network.

[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.320]
I just noticed something that in one of your interviews with John Candy,

[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.080]
I believe it looked like an older interview.

[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.640]
You had less hair than you have today.

[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:57.940]
How do you explain that?

[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.660]
I, uh, don't wear a wig, sir.

[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:00.740]
Paint your bald spot.

[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:01.900]
More bald spot.

[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.340]
You paint your bald spot?

[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.860]
I know what you're talking about, sir.

[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.600]
My hair grows.

[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.300]
You paint your bald spot.

[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.580]
I don't have a bald spot.

[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.740]
How come you had less hair on the tape?

[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.440]
Maybe my hair grew.

[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.380]
Maybe I had a bad haircut that day.

[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:15.940]
You paint?

[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:16.640]
By the way, something.

[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.780]
What do you care?

[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.720]
Paint your bald spot.

[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.360]
I don't.

[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.680]
Do you paint your bald spot?

[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:22.980]
Paint your bald spot?

[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:23.760]
I'm sick.

[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.680]
All right, this is Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rockers.

[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.340]
Okay, 1041 at WIOD.

[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.720]
We finally got some of our ladies to come in and start hopping up the ice cream.

[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.540]
It's about time.

[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.120]
And, uh, they ain't by take the wavy gravy.

[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.960]
You've never tasted anything like that.

[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.680]
Try one of those.

[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.320]
Those are just, I'm serious.

[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.800]
I've never in my life had anything this outstanding in my mouth.

[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.700]
I mean, this is just the die from and for and about.

[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.340]
So, where's Jake?

[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.640]
Anyway, it's 1041 at WIOD and thanks again to, uh, what was his name, Damien?

[00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.140]
Okay, and get your hair straight.

[00:17:59.280 --> 00:17:59.820]
Now, will you please?

[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.640]
Her hair, every, she's like a chameleon.

[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.180]
Every day, her hair is like a different shade of orange.

[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.000]
Old carrot top.

[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.220]
I don't know what she's doing.

[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.180]
Anyway, let's do Miami.

[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:10.560]
Hello.

[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.660]
They were hanging.

[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.300]
God.

[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.200]
Yeah.

[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.400]
A Metz fan.

[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.380]
Yeah, you guys are really the best.

[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.600]
As a matter of fact, that's one thing I should have done at the very beginning of the day.

[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.540]
But we have a little bit of a problem.

[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.420]
My fault operator error make no mistake about that.

[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.000]
Where's the thing, uh, huh?

[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.260]
Come on.

[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.500]
Boy, really off to a bad start with my computer or a technique today.

[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.580]
The Metz.

[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:37.740]

[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:38.640]
Oh!

[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.940]
But made up for it there.

[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.160]
Okay, let's go to, uh, yeah, you guys are really doing it.

[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.420]
The Metz, they've won two in a row.

[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.100]
A hallelujah.

[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.440]
Here's a punk in the Gables.

[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.120]
Hello.

[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.560]
Punk is gone.

[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.020]
Punk's long gone.

[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.040]
Here's, uh, Fort Myers.

[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:55.400]
Hello.

[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:55.920]
Neil.

[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:56.980]
Neil.

[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:57.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.120]
How good of it?

[00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.720]
Where are they on the air today, Fort Myers?

[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.660]
Yes, we are back up and on the air.

[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.740]
Well, congratulations, Tony Allen.

[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.640]
I knew you could do it.

[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.500]
You knew you could pay that electric bill?

[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.060]
They said they were up all night working on it.

[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:09.480]
Now bet.

[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.060]
Yeah.

[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.320]
What was that chocolate you had the other day that gave you the trot?

[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.480]
It is so hard.

[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.800]
That was sorbitol.

[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:18.440]
Sorbitol.

[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.320]
Maybe a new flavor for Ben and Jerry.

[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.200]
Mm-hmm.

[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.120]
I'll pass on that.

[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.480]
Or I'll pass with that.

[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.300]
Uh, Neil, I don't want to suck around too much.

[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.860]
I would love to have the CDs.

[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:27.540]
Would you?

[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:27.980]
Yeah.

[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:28.520]
Okay.

[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.100]
That's going to make all the other lines go out now.

[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.540]
Sorry, I need to do it, do you?

[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.400]
Why is that?

[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.320]
Um, I offered it.

[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:35.940]
That's true.

[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.520]
I just like the ice cream.

[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.560]
We've got gallons and gallons and pints of ice cream in here.

[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.680]
This is the hardest.

[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.140]
I've ever had the big for people to come in here and get some free goods.

[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.860]
I don't understand.

[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.400]
There's one in here that I just saw.

[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.260]
An 80s of big, oh, I guess they took it.

[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.520]
Cherry something with the cherry.

[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.800]
It was just beyond belief.

[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.440]
80s, didn't see one of the chocolate peanut butter cookie dough.

[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.320]
That's a Ben and Jerry's, of course.

[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.660]
Chocolate chip cookie dough, which rick wants me to say for him and I won't.

[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.000]
Well, maybe I will.

[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.060]
Maybe I'll have to because nobody else is going to take it.

[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.820]
Just build him called arteries clogged.

[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:12.540]
Exactly.

[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.520]
Well, a pint of ice cream ain't going to kill me.

[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.040]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:15.520]
That's true.

[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.100]
I mean, if I am mind my peas and cues the rest of the day, this isn't going to kill me.

[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:19.460]
Definitely.

[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.960]
Well, listen, hang on and enjoy it.

[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.620]
And George will get your shoes sized and stuff.

[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.120]
Thank you.

[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:23.620]
Okay.

[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:24.860]
Okay, that's gone.

[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.460]
So that'll take care of clearing out the lines.

[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.380]
We don't want to have too many calls on a holiday weekend.

[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.960]
I can't believe we have any calls.

[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.920]
I was driving to work this morning and I thought, boy, get that computer just loaded up

[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.700]
because it's going to be grim and slim and none because there just was no traffic at all.

[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.260]
It's this long 75 day holiday weekend, which more power to you.

[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.460]
Just don't blow yourself away with all those fireworks.

[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.780]
I get to, I love seeing fireworks.

[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.320]
I think almost everybody loves beautiful fireworks.

[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.300]
They're like exciting.

[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:52.800]
It's great.

[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.080]
Well, if there's anybody who deserves some ice cream and cheering, right?

[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.180]
She said, I don't know.

[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:00.960]
Well, I said yes.

[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.840]
So take like, and by the way, the real, now do you like eaties or Ben and Jerry's better?

[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:06.460]
Both.

[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:06.720]

[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.140]
Well, take three of each.

[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.480]
There's some like beautiful, oh, there's Wavy Gravy.

[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.600]
That's, oh, you'll die when you try that.

[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.120]
The best.

[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.520]
And there's a bunch of Ben and Jerry's on the end there too.

[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.500]
Anyway, here's a mobile in Fort Myers.

[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:18.940]
Hello?

[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:19.680]
Neil.

[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:20.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.300]
What time did you leave the track last night?

[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.900]
What time did I leave after the last race, 11 o'clock?

[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.300]
Did you happen to hear any of the 10th inning shot?

[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:28.780]
No.

[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.540]
On the way out?

[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:29.920]
No.

[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:30.800]
It was great.

[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.480]
The Gack, isn't it?

[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.540]
The Gack, you doesn't have the 10th inning shot?

[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.000]
Yeah, right.

[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.560]
The Gack, he...

[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.060]
That's because they know everybody's going to go to bed at that hour, so they figured it's a good way to start.

[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.820]
I was on my way home and the first...

[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.500]
Here's the Gack, he sucks, okay?

[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:42.980]
Sorry.

[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.800]
The first three calls he got were...

[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.820]
Maggaten supporters.

[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.460]
The supporters.

[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:50.960]
Great.

[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.360]
He was...

[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.760]
You know how when they have a press conference for the president and he goes,

[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.140]
well, we'll talk about everything but that, no, and then he gets 10 questions about that.

[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.640]
Right, right.

[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.280]
Exactly.

[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:08.180]
He was like, please, anybody but Maggaten, people were calling in, he was so frustrated.

[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:08.760]
Why is that?

[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.500]
He wasn't self.

[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.020]
Because he gets one phone call and he can tell he's frustrated.

[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.400]
He can tell he's...

[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.160]
So in other words, he's become a complete shield because they carry the games over there,

[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.400]
so he doesn't want to tell the truth.

[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:18.820]
Exactly.

[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.520]
Well, here's what he said.

[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:27.440]
He said, well, why did they get rid of Maggaten and get nobody in return for him?

[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.440]
And he goes, well, that's what the...

[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.360]
Their goal was to put the best team on the field and that's what they felt and that's the best team

[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.980]
that they could put on the field and their plans didn't include Dave Maggaten.

[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.980]
And he hangs up and you can tell and it's very neck-

[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.040]
Joe, you are an asshole, Joe.

[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.100]
And by the way, CCA, I don't even know so to five to three last night.

[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.820]
I wonder if the...

[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.380]
What Maggaten did.

[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.560]
Maggaten was one for four.

[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.240]
He's hitting 385 in the three games.

[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.380]
He also had a walk, so he was on base twice.

[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.380]
He scored a run and they won five to three.

[00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.760]
Against pitching has never faced before.

[00:22:59.160 --> 00:22:59.360]
Right.

[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.880]
In a league he's never played it before.

[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.280]
Exactly.

[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.160]
What are you gonna do?

[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.240]
Hey, one more thing now.

[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.080]
How come I've never seen Rush Limbaugh and Lloyd Lindsay Young in the same room?

[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:10.360]
Same type.

[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:11.840]
Well, think about it.

[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.840]
Have a great day.

[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:13.900]
Hello!

[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:15.580]
Larnas!

[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.960]
We have an open line in a day, 751 and one on the green line.

[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.100]
So, Maggaten gets another hit and a walk.

[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:22.980]
He's on base twice.

[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.820]
His team is winning.

[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.340]
In fact, let me take a look at the standings.

[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.320]
I don't know what happened elsewhere.

[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.320]
Look at that.

[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.120]
Oh, gee, Seattle's only two and a half games behind the first place

[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.700]
fading fast white socks, who must have caught something from the tigers

[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.320]
as in like fade out of it disease, falling like a rock.

[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.040]
So, Maggaten's over there with a winning team.

[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.180]
He's with his godfather.

[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.500]
And then, of course, that this good and who's gonna pitch against us tonight,

[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:48.760]
do I?

[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.880]
You are a real goofball.

[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.980]
You hear the thing that he's all upset because he's Sheffield's uncle allegedly

[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.120]
by way of third cousin or something.

[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.860]
So, he's all bent out of shape because the Mets didn't make any effort to give Gary Sheffield

[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:07.060]
as if they have like more money to pay him some astronomical amount next season

[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.100]
to add that they're already bulging gigantic biggest in baseball $40 million

[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.720]
payroll that's netting them still like 10 and a half games behind us.

[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:21.900]
I mean, these guys are just the biggest bunch of loudmouth primadanas, just the pathetic.

[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.120]
But I will say this, the big zero did make a beautiful play at first base

[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.800]
their last night.

[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.660]
That was my favorite.

[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.260]
And almost as good as the one made by our center fielder Henry Cot.

[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:31.700]
Oh!

[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.780]
After Chuckie injured himself again.

[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.780]
And by the way, another incredible play by Chuckie Car instead of your last night,

[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.080]
Bad Ribs and All, an incredible play before he re-agribated his injury.

[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.500]
This kid is just a dynamite.

[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.060]
It's a 1048 on the IOD network.

[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.320]
First make it a free call by Diling Star IOD.

[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:59.000]
Now, the Neal Roger Show on U-Star Radio 610 WIOD takes forever to get that taste

[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.700]
and smell out of your system.

[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.060]
It's a study in Huckstuffing Taylor.

[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:03.760]
Who's that?

[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.080]
The chilling story of a deaf woman alone and afraid.

[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.720]
And the killer she'll never hear coming.

[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.460]
What more does it feel long?

[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.340]
A ketamine award when a mali makeloon starts in here no evil.

[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.600]
A thriller so frightening it'll keep you.

[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:17.740]

[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.980]
So frightening it'll keep you.

[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:20.700]
Is anybody out there?

[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.220]
On the edge of your-

[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.200]
I can't believe it anymore.

[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.000]
Wally, I'm talking.

[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.340]
What?

[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.360]
We're doing a commercial.

[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.440]
A commercial.

[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.640]
A commercial.

[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.720]
We're doing a commercial.

[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.760]
I can't hear you.

[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.360]
I can't hear you.

[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:37.800]
I can't hear you.

[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:37.840]
I can't hear you.

[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:37.860]
I can't hear you.

[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:37.860]

[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:37.860]

[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:37.860]

[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.760]
Don't miss Miley makeloon in here no evil.

[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.900]
What you can't hear could kill you.

[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.060]
And what you can't hear could screw up a really good commercial.

[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.900]
Okay, so Annamaria got hers.

[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.660]
And she's all excited about that.

[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.420]
She got her smores, her E.D. smores, like a half a gallon of it.

[00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:00.420]
And also we got to thank Vinny Ignacio and Mike, the boys at Bravo,

[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.960]
and also Risturante, who are like in Lighthouse Point, 2486 North Federal Highway,

[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:10.700]
in Lighthouse Point, Bravo, Risturante, Pizzeria, and Salumaria.

[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720]
What the hell is that?

[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.040]
Salumaria.

[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.860]
But anyway, they sent over some great past of a jewel and George is eating it now with his cold.

[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.500]
Yeah, I'm glad you're enjoying it, okay?

[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.640]
I said, no, I don't want that right now.

[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.080]
And George said, okay, I'll eat it because I'm very sick and he keeps sticking his tongue on everything.

[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.900]
And say, oh, by the way, I'm sick and I have the flu.

[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.200]
So don't anybody else have any of this.

[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.600]
And then Jake came in here and got some, but I don't want to go into that.

[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.980]
So anyway, here we are at 1107.

[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.400]
Thanks again to our friends from Ben and Jerry slash E.D.'s.

[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.280]
Damon, Damon.

[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.820]
I can't see, I can't say that because there's nobody named Damon.

[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.340]
Is there?

[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.500]
There is? That's like a real name.

[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.660]
I keep feeling like I miss, but like it should be Damien.

[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:52.420]
Damon?

[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:53.820]
Damon.

[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.120]
They call him Damon for short.

[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:55.780]
Did a great job.

[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.600]
We appreciate it.

[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.040]
Not that I was jealous or anything.

[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:02.520]
I just don't like being slided by our friends, by people that we love and that wavy gravy

[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.260]
who's worth the going through the whole exercise.

[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.120]
And by the way, Rick, there's none left.

[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:06.460]
Sorry.

[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.460]
Here's Kendall on the star line.

[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:08.760]
Hello.

[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.920]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.340]
Pretty good.

[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:10.820]
Good.

[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.180]
Well, I'm kind of excited.

[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.400]
I'm listening to you since the last days of beta.

[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.680]
And I've never had a reason to call till today.

[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:17.940]
And today is the reason, okay?

[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.300]
Yeah.

[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.140]
So I got a first of all Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.240]
Have you ever had their frozen yogurt yet?

[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:23.820]
No.

[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:24.600]
The best.

[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:24.700]
Yeah.

[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.380]
Is it?

[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:25.620]
Yeah.

[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.400]
There were some of that in here too, but I opted for the wavy gravy and I'm not sorry.

[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.100]
I made the choice.

[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:30.980]
You like coffee and almonds?

[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:31.840]
No.

[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:32.360]
Yeah.

[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:32.880]
Oh.

[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.340]
Oh, I'm getting like chills just thinking about it.

[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:35.680]
I am.

[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.120]
It's actually really great.

[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.780]
Anyway, this morning, either that or I'm starting to go into a diabetic coma, which is a good

[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.460]
possibility, but boy, what a way to go.

[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.560]
Chances are, but like you say, what a way to go.

[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.920]
This morning, I'm listening to about 10 to 9 driving to work.

[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.580]
And I'm like, I guess it's sunny.

[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.420]
And I'm sunny hers from your Marlin.

[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.220]
Oh, I heard that.

[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:57.980]
Yeah, I heard that.

[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.700]
I died.

[00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.460]
That was beautiful.

[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.260]
It was the best.

[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.440]
And I'll tell you one thing, we cheer be doing a hell of a lot better job than having Joe

[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.660]
Zagaki on the post game show trying to be a shield.

[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.540]
We wouldn't be doing that.

[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.040]
Yeah, but some things will never change.

[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:08.660]
Correct.

[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.140]
It doesn't matter what station he goes to.

[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.460]
Some things will never change.

[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.380]
So that's it.

[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.840]
I just wanted to touch on the Ben and Jerry's and the sunny hers thing.

[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.060]
And the only other thing is my father-in-law who is a closet match fan right now because of

[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:19.460]
the Marlin.

[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.880]
He's opening his mouth.

[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.680]
He says he's going to bring the broom to the game tonight.

[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:23.700]
Good.

[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.320]
I hope he finds a good place to put it.

[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.020]
Sorry, I just want to say one thing to him.

[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.360]
You are a douchebag.

[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:28.820]
Okay.

[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:29.360]
Goodbye.

[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.080]
So yeah, maybe he can either fly away with it or stick it in the orifice.

[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.040]
We have an open line in Broward 5241 on the Star Line star IOD.

[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.340]
What is this exercise show that I'm watching right now?

[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.080]
Which is sure better than anything else.

[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.040]
We have really been sorely lacking in flash shows lately.

[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:48.140]
And then I heard Rick the other day talking about how the Spanish stations are the ones

[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.480]
that have the good flash on there.

[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:50.980]
Did you hear that?

[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.020]
Better late than never, Rick.

[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.780]
Although they got some horrendous.

[00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.060]
Look at who is in that Tomas pseudo intellectual espanyol on the left.

[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.320]
Are you watching on 44 not this guy, but the guy on the left.

[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.000]
What is his name?

[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.900]
Is that Tomas Regalato or one of those Ojón provocateurs from no speaking English radio?

[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.160]
Come on, we don't want to see this geeky guy here with a glasses.

[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.440]
I want George to tell me who this other guy is because I recognize that push and he makes

[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.060]
me very, very, very upset.

[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:22.080]
Because he's one of those traditional Ojón, see the guy there?

[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.400]
Who's got his picking his nose?

[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.480]
That's Tomas Regalato?

[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.140]
That's not a, that adult guy.

[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:26.440]
That guy.

[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.300]
Who?

[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.340]
A Delgado.

[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:30.440]
Delgado.

[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.120]
Gado Del Sol.

[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.560]
He's whoever you're thinking about.

[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.840]
Bill Gado who wrote the TV radio column in the hero of the other day.

[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.700]
That ain't who that is.

[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.940]
What am I asking you for, for crying out loud?

[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:42.640]
Bigot?

[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.420]
Anyway, let's go to Miami.

[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:45.860]
Hello.

[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:46.560]
Hello, Neil.

[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.300]
How you doing?

[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:52.940]
I think the reason that they got rid of negative is because Dave's and Ralphie owed

[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.500]
a negative came here to play every day and when they got shutt off, he couldn't play every

[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:57.680]
day.

[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.140]
Why not?

[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.740]
Why couldn't they, why couldn't they put Cheffield in right field since we don't have a right

[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.660]
field or he wanted to play?

[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:03.700]
He just wants to play outfield.

[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:03.700]

[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.140]
He just wants to play outfield.

[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.460]
Well, in Latin, well, then they messed up.

[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.220]
And how about first base?

[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.600]
Maggot was originally a first baseman.

[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.580]
Oh, yeah, he wrote it.

[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.000]
It was him.

[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:14.920]
The big zero.

[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.500]
Would you rather have him at first or at the big zero?

[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.260]
I'd rather have negative.

[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:18.860]
There you go.

[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.240]
Who's sitting 385 in the American League?

[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.480]
Oh, my other thing.

[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.440]
Um, do you get your show on Pennsylvania?

[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.420]
No.

[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.220]
You don't?

[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.800]
Okay, because I'm going up there for a few weeks.

[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.620]
Well, take some tapes.

[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:29.420]
It'll keep you company.

[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.560]
I think I will.

[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.320]
Have a great time.

[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:31.900]
All right, you too.

[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.120]
See you.

[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.480]
We have an open line in day at 751 on the Green Line.

[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:40.500]
By the way, I told you that Ben and Jerry's gives me an instant, um, I can't say it.

[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.380]
Oh, that's it.

[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.300]
Or I could have said, Scorch, Scorch, that too.

[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.460]
So any minute now, if you hear like a whole bunch of stuff like running together,

[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.640]
I guess that wasn't a good choice of words.

[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.480]
If you're a whole bit of a bunch of, you know what I'm talking about.

[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.720]
12 minutes after 11 on the IOD network.

[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.100]
Pizza man doesn't get in.

[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.660]
Morning news.

[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.540]
Weed day mornings right here.

[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.800]
You saw a radio station.

[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.460]
You got a new IOD.

[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.160]
Oh, Anna Maria says she's like a magnet, man.

[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.860]
She's just one of those sexual beings.

[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:14.840]
I dig her like crazy.

[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.560]
I love her mind.

[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.540]
I love everything about her.

[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.680]
I love her big bounce of her breath.

[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.800]
I don't know what it is.

[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.480]
Anna Maria.

[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.640]
We want to see you.

[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.180]
Summers that just don't quit.

[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.600]
And it's warm where you see.

[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:38.700]
All of us for Nikai is fond of size.

[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.740]
That your by we've been my honey.

[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.320]
Who you to see.

[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:45.160]

[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.800]
It's who you are.

[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.340]
Anna Maria.

[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.900]
So she's like a magnet man.

[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.540]
She's just one of those sexual beings.

[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.540]
I dig her like crazy.

[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.300]
I love her mind.

[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.240]
I love everything about her.

[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.400]
I love her big bounce of her breath.

[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.460]
I don't know what it is.

[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.200]
Yeah.

[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.360]
See, I figured I'd better play it twice there.

[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.340]
Better play it about a hundred times today because if I leave it around, it might

[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.260]
just disappear.

[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.000]
It might walk on here.

[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.940]
Anyway, it's 1117.

[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.200]
Randy, by the way, is doing a show from our house this Saturday.

[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.660]
I have no information about that.

[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:15.080]
Also, we have a big thing coming up this Sunday and I have no information about that.

[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.200]
Do you know anything about it?

[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.500]
Chuck's been promoting it because he's involved in it.

[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.880]
But the rest of us thank you so much.

[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.560]
The rest of us know nothing about it.

[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:27.240]
We have like a big good July 4th, the bash and Randy and Chuck, I think, are involved

[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:27.880]
in that thing Sunday.

[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.560]
I don't know where is it at Bayfront Park.

[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:31.960]
It is, we think.

[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:32.620]
We don't know.

[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.000]
We have nothing on this.

[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.800]
And far be it for me to start attacking Halcyon who did eat a lot of ice cream.

[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.560]
But it would be nice for us or a boy Kurt who also weighed a lot of ice cream.

[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.860]
But it would be nice to have a little info on this stuff.

[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:49.080]
So, I mean, it's great that Chuck is promoting it, but Chuck's got a small select audience.

[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.320]
By the way, Chuck did a very nice thing here today.

[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.220]
In fact, I like that morning show a lot more now than I ever did before.

[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.200]
I think Chuck is gone.

[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.420]
Don't you?

[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.180]
Chuck brought Jake in here.

[00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.900]
They have the same here, do I notice?

[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:00.660]
Did you notice that?

[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.340]
Chuck is a little bit on the grayer that was.

[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.600]
But they have like the same barber, I guess.

[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.940]
They could both use a little trim.

[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.880]
Anyway, here's the mobile in Miami.

[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:11.280]
Hello?

[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.140]
Listen, I haven't been listening to like half our 4th, 5 minutes.

[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.140]
Did you go to game last night?

[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.800]
I know I watched it on TV though.

[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.480]
It was very depressed.

[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.800]
Okay, well, I'm becoming using your words psychotic.

[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.140]
Oh, join the club.

[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.200]
We've had a lot of people who are very psychotic and very upset.

[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.340]
And PO'd.

[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.780]
I'm a seasoned ticket holder.

[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.660]
I've gone to approximately 80% of the game.

[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.360]
Yes, great.

[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.480]
Every game that I've gone to, the fans have been super nice.

[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.440]
You know, the opposing team, everything else.

[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.180]
Last night up in my section, there were two fights alone.

[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.760]
Oh, and probably some met fans up there again.

[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.220]
Welcome to Miami, the Met Fan.

[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.460]
Well, how about on the field last night,

[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.380]
there were about like three almost all their occasions,

[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.460]
the Chuck E. Car thing.

[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.820]
And then Armstrong got into a big thing with, with a Lonsman.

[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.300]
And then the Met's all came out on the field of one time

[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.340]
when they threw a Chuck E. Car.

[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.680]
And then there was another thing later on.

[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.600]
And it was like right on the edge.

[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.760]
And it also happened with Benito a couple of times

[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.240]
in the two games so far.

[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.160]
If this was the way people in New York are,

[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.020]
tell them to stay to hell up in New York.

[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:06.440]
Exactly.

[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.620]
And also one last thing was the fact that the,

[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.380]
when you were talking about that,

[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.220]
these people, there was one met's fan up there,

[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.920]
yelling and screaming.

[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.180]
But one of the guys in the section just very politely

[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:17.540]
pulled out the newspaper and says,

[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.800]
is this the same team that's 28 games behind in first place?

[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:21.300]
Right.

[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.000]
And the guy shut up for 10, 15 minutes.

[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.880]
But I just want to tell the met fans,

[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.180]
if you want to fight, go to help back up the New York.

[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.220]
The only other crowd that was almost as rowdy

[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.600]
was the Philadelphia people.

[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.360]
But I think that's the sixth burrow anyway.

[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.880]
So, yeah, just tell them to go back up the New York.

[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.020]
Tell them to burrow their way back where they came from.

[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:38.320]
Please.

[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:38.840]
Okay.

[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.180]
Bye.

[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:39.680]
Excellent.

[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.660]
See, there's all kinds of reasons

[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.280]
to be a psychotic and aggravated.

[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.180]
But we're still putting 40,000 and more

[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.380]
in a ballpark for every game.

[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:48.160]
And we'll have a big crowd there again tonight

[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.000]
as we hope that Charlie mose him down.

[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.760]
Well, moe him down is not the way to like knuckles him down.

[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.060]
Old knuckles.

[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.280]
Let's take a call a portable phone in Tampa.

[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.100]
This ought to be good.

[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:58.440]
Hello.

[00:34:58.900 --> 00:34:59.260]
Yeah.

[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.140]
How you doing, man?

[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:00.740]
Okay, sir?

[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.340]
This is your pie's on in Tampa.

[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.260]
Do you get ready to go to Daytona?

[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:04.800]
All right.

[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.420]
And I just have to call you.

[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.560]
Charlie, you're all fixing tonight.

[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:08.840]
Yeah.

[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.080]
Man, you're always bashing all Charlie,

[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:11.700]
but he's the greatest.

[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.740]
He's the best.

[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:13.480]
He's the best.

[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.700]
They don't come any older than Charlie.

[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.260]
They don't come any older than Charlie.

[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.640]
And I want to call somebody a doochback.

[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.900]
Mike from Route 5.

[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.140]
He's a Mr. Lurin.

[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.940]
He got it more on.

[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.640]
Flaken to pay.

[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.020]

[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.960]
And I'm just going to pass on you.

[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:30.900]
But I can't do it.

[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.040]
Can't do it.

[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.620]
I know you just can't bring yourself to do it.

[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.160]
Have a great life.

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:34.980]
Well, get out of here.

[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:35.520]
Get a life.

[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.420]
We have an open line on the green line.

[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.680]
By the way, for my for my ears, what am I laughing about?

[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.440]
Because it's funny.

[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.160]
That's why they're off the air again.

[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.460]
They got back on here at midnight last night.

[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.600]
And we were on for a little while.

[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.720]
And then all of a sudden the power got struck by lightning.

[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.420]
Just a little while ago and they're off the air again.

[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.940]
So I'm I've concluded that there must be a God somewhere.

[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.860]
Because if anybody deserves to be off the air a lot,

[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.800]
it's W W C N and Tony Allen and Tony Baldi J and it hold a group

[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.680]
of a mystery and so they can't even get their facts machine working right.

[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.740]
Not that George is upset about that,

[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.000]
but he's getting sick and tired of that.

[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.160]
I'll tell you that right now, Tony.

[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.300]
He thinks that you guys are a bunch of idiots and group balls and you make him

[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.240]
sick and want to puke.

[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.540]
You just if you just leave us alone and just steal our material in the program,

[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.520]
we'd all be a lot happier.

[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.700]
Here's Dave the cop.

[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.820]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:23.920]
Gravy Davey line.

[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:24.500]
How are you?

[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.060]
Pretty good.

[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.900]
Listen, the big out really sucks.

[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.560]
I mean, we gotta get rid of that.

[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.760]
The big out, that's a good one.

[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.000]
Big out.

[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.900]
And are you still giving up on the cardinals or am I maybe I'm right?

[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.720]
No, as a matter of fact, the Phillies look right for the pickings.

[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.920]
Is there you were telling me that crap a couple of weeks ago?

[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.580]
And I said, I think you're getting a little carried away,

[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.700]
but the Phillies are sliding on it.

[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.500]
With all the barbecues going on in the next week and right.

[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.420]
Croc could be like watermelon man in about 10 days.

[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.320]
By this dire stuff.

[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:49.580]
Yeah.

[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.380]
Anyway, with all the cards coming on,

[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.720]
I think you need one from the police.

[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.100]
Now, some of the jargon we use would be a three-letter one,

[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.520]
QRU, which means okay, it's not like God,

[00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.440]
but here we go anyway.

[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.220]
A Neil, QRU.

[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.580]
No, good for the card, man.

[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:03.960]
Beautiful.

[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.600]
You're gonna down the pigs.

[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.600]
You got up the pigs too.

[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:07.100]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:07.960]
I know what you're saying.

[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.620]
You'd be good.

[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:09.560]
Alright man.

[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.080]
See ya.

[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.620]
Boy, we are just, we are cop intensive on this show.

[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.880]
And I don't want to pour water on his parade,

[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.540]
but I do want to a word to the wise or unwire

[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.740]
should be sufficient this weekend.

[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.720]
They're not only gonna be looking for you going two miles

[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.720]
an hour over the speed limit,

[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.180]
but they're gonna be doing that seatbelt stick again.

[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:25.780]
That's right.

[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.640]
They're gonna be playing that game again,

[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.740]
pulling you over to the right.

[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.140]
Exactly.

[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.600]
George says you number one, guys.

[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:31.640]
And I wear one.

[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.720]
And I don't and I won't under any circumstances.

[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:35.260]
Okay.

[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.980]
It's just when you're big and fat and you're wearing it

[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.260]
and you're driving a beautiful Corvette.

[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.560]
You want a little freedom there.

[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.240]
You want to be able to reach over and put your arm on

[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.160]
Jake Scholder and say,

[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.520]
good job today, a pal.

[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.940]
It's just a little joke.

[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.340]
He, and I, isn't that something that Chuck had to bring him in

[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.440]
here though that he had in other words,

[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.020]
he had to come in here with a security blanket.

[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.520]
Now he'll work his way up to the day when he comes in here alone.

[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:57.820]
And then he'll be sorry.

[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.140]
It's 1123 on E.I.O.D. Network.

[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.120]
Come on you I.O.P.

[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.280]
Hi.

[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.000]
This is Jim.

[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.000]
Love your show, Neil.

[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.180]
Love you.

[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.520]
Love you.

[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.360]
That was so weak.

[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.860]
I'm almost embarrassed.

[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.180]
Oh, and it's fine.

[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.560]
Oh, my God.

[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.680]
It goes crazy when it's bad.

[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.840]
When it's bigger, it's better.

[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.460]
Yeah, it's my hand.

[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.520]
It touched my chest.

[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.360]
Oh, and it flew.

[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.320]
It ruined my best.

[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.220]
It came out of my jeans and into my life.

[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.140]
Oh, how it makes me feel fine.

[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:12.740]
It's 16.

[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.120]
Oh, beautiful.

[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.300]
And it's mine.

[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.420]
Oh.

[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.300]
Let me tell you something.

[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.460]
We ought to play that one more time.

[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.600]
You know what that Jim thing?

[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.320]
Every time he redid that,

[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.520]
out of the kindness of his parts,

[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.960]
that was so bad, Jim.

[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:31.580]
Hi.

[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.220]
This is Jim.

[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.180]
Love your show, Neil.

[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.380]
Love you.

[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.720]
Love you.

[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.080]
Oh, God.

[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.900]
Man, you can just see the feathers falling up.

[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:46.460]
Can't you?

[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.420]
In fact, we had a few of them up here this morning.

[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.640]
It's 1128 at WIOD.

[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.960]
Here's Dania.

[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:52.220]
Hello.

[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:52.940]
Neil.

[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:53.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.160]
This is David.

[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.020]
Hi, David.

[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:55.640]
How you doing?

[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:56.220]
Pretty good.

[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.740]
How's the mornings doing today?

[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:58.620]
The one?

[00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:59.220]
The morning.

[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.880]
What does that mean?

[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.240]
The mornings.

[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.460]
Because I heard the one yesterday.

[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.320]
And yesterday I heard.

[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.620]
You heard the one yesterday?

[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:09.860]
Sunday.

[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.600]
You heard the one Sunday.

[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:11.940]
Right.

[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:12.880]
You heard the one?

[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:13.460]
Yeah.

[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:13.820]
And I heard.

[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.060]
You heard the one by the Vogue's,

[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:15.680]
we don't have that.

[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.200]
Maybe joy will play for you this weekend.

[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.320]
We have an open line in Broward,

[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:19.840]
524.

[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.720]
If anybody thinks I'm talking to somebody of that,

[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.260]
missing that many bricks, they're dreaming, okay?

[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.240]
Call up it too.

[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.340]
Rick will talk to you for a while.

[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.000]
By the way, Rick, I'm sorry.

[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.100]
We don't have any ice cream left.

[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:30.820]
Do we?

[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.000]
Not a drop.

[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.120]
There's nothing in here.

[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.180]
We have three Styrofoam containers.

[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.700]
And it was great.

[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.940]
And just about everybody, they started a little slow.

[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.300]
But finally, Lisa came in here.

[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.680]
And Lisa Campbell came in.

[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.000]
And Stephanie.

[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:47.320]
And Annette.

[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.200]
And Mercy.

[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.060]
Mercy Mercy.

[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.420]
And Sharon.

[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.860]
And of course, Cheryl and Bob were in here immediately

[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.340]
if not sooner, which was fine.

[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.780]
Because they were very, very pissed about the treatment they got the previous day on another show.

[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.800]
And Chuck came in here with the Jake.

[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.560]
And who else?

[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.420]
And the boy Kurt was in for a little and healthy.

[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.900]
And of course, came in and didn't, uh,

[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.760]
she was a little bit recalcitrant because she got chewed out when she came in the end of the day,

[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:17.900]
chewed out by the, uh, obnoxious one who doesn't like to share with anybody and then comes on

[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.160]
and has the audacity to lie and tell us that he didn't get any.

[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.480]
Now, I have it on very good authority that he got some.

[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.620]
And maybe some ice cream.

[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.300]
Here's the gable.

[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:28.660]
Hello.

[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:29.420]
Neil.

[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.540]
Maybe it was from the weasel.

[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:30.800]
Yes.

[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.060]
That last call was probably one of the fans that gives, uh,

[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.000]
sounded like a meds fan to me.

[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.180]
Yeah, he probably gives,

[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:42.840]
he kind of gives Charlie up the standing ovation when he walks in the winning run like he did last week.

[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:43.960]
And then, uh,

[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.640]
Latch comes out and sends them to the bench and everybody gets up and gives them a standing ovation.

[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.260]
Yeah.

[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.260]
And he's, what we like, Charlie, what's wrong with that?

[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:50.680]
Huh?

[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.320]
We figure anybody that older can still stand up deserves a standing ovation.

[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.040]
I don't know.

[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.080]
And always going the, uh, always going the picture.

[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.280]
Very timey those first base.

[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.140]
Anyway, I didn't want to talk about that.

[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:01.480]
Why not?

[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.040]
Huh?

[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.040]
Speak your piece.

[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.620]
Don't be, uh, don't hold it back.

[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.340]
Let it out today.

[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.860]
Today is the day for venting after a couple of very,

[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.120]
very frustrating baseball nights for us.

[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.060]
Let's let it all out.

[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.680]
Let's even let one or two of the meds fans call them tell us how great they are.

[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.280]
And we'll all just laugh until we fall down and puke.

[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.860]
I want to say something about this magazine conspiracy.

[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:24.060]
By the way, we are going to start the official Dave Maggett and watch on this program.

[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.660]
We've already done it each of the first three games he's played.

[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.480]
And tomorrow I see they're playing an afternoon game today, Seattle,

[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.640]
at Minnesota, one 15.

[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.840]
So tomorrow you can be sure one of the first pieces of business will be to see how Dave did today.

[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:35.380]
Excellent.

[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.160]
Excellent.

[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.580]
Who's sending 385 by the way in the American League?

[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:38.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.400]
Even, uh, they had an interview with Chef Field.

[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.840]
He's not even from this town.

[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:43.940]
And even Tampa.

[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:44.860]
From Tampa?

[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:44.880]
Huh?

[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:45.600]
It's from Tampa.

[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.100]
Yeah, but I mean, I don't think he's had to which time to follow the Marlins.

[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.140]
But the first thing that came out of his mouth was,

[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.720]
why didn't they put me in right field and keep and put Maggett in a third?

[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.380]
If they really wanted a good lineup.

[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:56.780]
Right.

[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.320]
Because this guy, that boy again,

[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.080]
that guy blows and that rich Rodriguez guy,

[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.460]
he comes in his first pitch.

[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.980]
How did you like that first pitch, man?

[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:10.140]
They didn't have to send the space shuttle into orbit because any Murray hit his first pitch into orbit two nights ago.

[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.880]
That ball is still going.

[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.580]
If it wouldn't have hit that gray stuff there in the upper deck,

[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.040]
it would have still been in orbit.

[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:20.020]
I mean, with a lineup like that, we might have had a chance maybe third, possibly even second.

[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.980]
I mean, if they're talking about the thing.

[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:23.960]
I think we'd have won the damn division if you wanted to be.

[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.300]
They probably won the World Series if they wouldn't have screwed our team up.

[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.840]
They probably wanted to save some money.

[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:33.880]
Or something like that.

[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880]
What do you mean save some money?

[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.540]
How much do you think it's going to cost in the sign Gary Sheffield next year?

[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.020]
He's going to want at least $85 billion.

[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:39.620]
Yeah.

[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.000]
And then Wayne won't be able to paint that ball spot.

[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.520]
Yeah, it's pretty frustrating.

[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.760]
It's something we can do about it now.

[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.400]
Well, it's like, cry over spilled milk.

[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.280]
They should have consulted with us first.

[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:51.760]
Shouldn't they?

[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:53.060]
Yeah, they should.

[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:57.060]
Yeah, shouldn't they have talked it over with the fans and said, look, we're thinking to do it a really stupid thing.

[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.940]
Are you going to let us do it?

[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.160]
We should have said no way Jose.

[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.500]
Yeah, but like most things that go on in this town, they just do it.

[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.600]
Forget the consequence.

[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.800]
And then we have to suffer.

[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:05.920]
You're absolutely correct.

[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.480]
Well, Neil.

[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.220]
And closing.

[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.460]
Get the honey, hoonier.

[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.420]
Can I call somebody to do something?

[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:11.980]
Yeah.

[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:12.940]
I own one.

[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.600]
Add in barbedo liquors.

[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.460]
You're a big Russian German beer drink and douche bag.

[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:19.580]
Okay.

[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.000]
Get the honey, hoonier.

[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.120]
That could have been the greatest line we've ever had on the show.

[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.340]
Now, we don't have that on the thing though, do we?

[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.820]
Oh, you haven't watched that movie yet.

[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.560]
Well, between now and the end of the holiday weekend, you better damn well watch that movie.

[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.760]
And Mr. Fat wants that tape back too, by the way.

[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:35.700]
I don't know what else is on it.

[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.700]
Probably some porno stuff.

[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.000]
But seriously, it's a great movie, Fatso.

[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.140]
And when you hear that line, after you've seen the movie, get the honey, junior.

[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.520]
Then you're like P and your pants and fall off the chair and start rolling on the floor.

[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.520]
Until I know Maria comes in.

[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:55.440]
He looked pretty good today.

[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.520]
I got to be honest with you.

[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.200]
I mean, if it was a choice between her and Randy, I'm sorry.

[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.220]
Why do I see?

[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.960]
Now I'm flagulating that whole thing and Mitchell Lewis is the one that does that.

[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.520]
It's 11.33.

[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.180]
Let's take a call from, that's the wrong one, I think.

[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:09.960]
Rock a hold on.

[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.600]
Don't go away.

[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.120]
Tampa.

[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.180]
Like I said, Tampa.

[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:14.880]
Hello.

[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:15.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:16.160]
Yeah.

[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:16.640]
Yeah.

[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:17.420]
How you doing?

[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:17.860]
Great.

[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:23.180]
What is this controversy with the shungoes crap?

[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:29.840]
Are we going to start using animals and kind of them, like a fighting for the stupid guy?

[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.080]
Abusing animals and what?

[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.280]
And coming to my normal?

[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.820]
You know, killing animals for the guy that's in your mane.

[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:39.740]
In your mane?

[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.260]
Yeah, man, where are we?

[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:41.980]
In your lo-main?

[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.140]
In your mane.

[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:50.020]
Meaning it's not, it shouldn't be cut, this shouldn't be, shouldn't be doing nothing animal.

[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.200]
Shouldn't, he said, shouldn't.

[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.480]
He didn't say what you thought he said.

[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.760]
He said, shouldn't.

[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:54.960]
Shouldn't, yeah.

[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:55.100]

[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:55.440]
Yeah, man.

[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:56.240]
I don't know.

[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:56.740]
I don't know.

[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.220]
I don't think I'm going in any of that.

[00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.420]
Hold on, number two.

[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.820]
You're going in that old black magic.

[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:01.700]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:02.040]
Right.

[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.380]
Look what it did for Sammy Davis.

[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:05.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.940]
I didn't know he did that stuff.

[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.620]
And Louis Prima and Keeley Smith, and I think they're all dead, yeah.

[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.820]
You know, you know, something pisses me off too.

[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:14.820]
Well, go right ahead.

[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.700]
Well, I want to just get in ring the other day.

[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.260]
You want to what?

[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.780]
No, no, we're not meeting anybody under 10.

[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.320]
Into 12 o'clock and I got there at 10.30.

[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.440]
Anybody under 10?

[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.220]
Yeah, big time.

[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.360]
All right, the Corvus, can I call some of those bags?

[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:29.880]
Sure.

[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.580]
Those people from the United States of America.

[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:34.920]
United States of America.

[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.600]
In Tampa, you have a bunch of those bags.

[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.000]
Okay.

[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:38.860]
Beautiful.

[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.800]
That was my favorite call of the year so far.

[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.440]
We have an open line.

[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.300]
It's on the green line.

[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.440]
And of course, it won't be from four Myers or Cape Crayl,

[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.860]
because they can't hear us, because WWCN has offered the duration of the day again.

[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:49.640]
What a shame.

[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.480]
God, how are we going to make it through the day today?

[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.440]
We'll never get enough calls without them.

[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.600]
1-800-944-9463.

[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.940]
We do have an open line there for like Orlando and Tallahassee.

[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.980]
We've been getting calls from Orlando lately.

[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:01.640]
You notice that?

[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:02.700]
Like a few here and there.

[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.140]
Huh?

[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.760]
What are you looking at me like that?

[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:06.680]
No, good.

[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.300]
Not from that Orlando, all the way.

[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:08.860]
I wish we did.

[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:13.640]
God, wouldn't it be nice if during this nice long holiday we'd get a call from our good old buddy, Orlando?

[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.820]
And he called and like make up with us and pack things over, so to speak.

[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.500]
Because I still have a soft spot in my heart for Orlando.

[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:23.920]
We all do.

[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.960]
Even those out there who are in perpetual self-denial.

[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:32.720]
Even those guys out there who are like, you know, wrapped up in their embarrassment.

[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:33.920]
Let's go.

[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:34.600]
Now let's not.

[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:36.460]
It's 1136 on the IOD Network.

[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:43.480]
Today's show is brought to you by the makers of Tiger Kitty, the cat with the taste of real human flesh.

[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.820]
Tiger Kitty, don't ask how we make it.

[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.680]
And now back to our show.

[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:53.720]
Nothing makes you feel more like a woman than the romantic sensation of silky lingerie.

[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.320]
That touch of satin as you slip on a pair of thong back bikinis.

[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.120]
A soft stretch of garter built with stockings or a black lacy canisol.

[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.220]
Oh my goodness.

[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.460]
I've never felt so womanly.

[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.800]
Victor's secret, the catalog for cross-dresses.

[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:14.140]
I haven't been this excited since Alex Trebek said put your hands on your buzzers.

[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.860]
Victor's secret, nothing makes you feel more like a woman.

[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:23.180]
1140 at WIOD we have an intercepted memo here which we always enjoyed.

[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:26.300]
This is from Nick Lawrence at WFTL aka the light bulb.

[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:32.120]
Two hosts and programmers from programming management, Ray, chronic collars.

[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:35.940]
The following collars have abused the privilege of calling this station.

[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.400]
One, angry Sam aka Sam the poet.

[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:45.660]
Two, slim, three, Dr. Slinky, four, meat market millie, five, Gilbert.

[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.580]
Oh geez, where is he in here?

[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.420]
Oh yeah, five, Gilbert.

[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:59.060]
Six, Harvey from Kendall, seven, sightless Mike, my, my, my.

[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.040]
Chronic collars stop other people from getting into the station says Nick.

[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.860]
These collars are banned by programming management.

[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.420]
Also the collar Henry should be kept to one call per week.

[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.640]
Sign Nick Lawrence.

[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:11.980]
Take a bad Nick.

[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.620]
Okay, it's 1141 at WIOD.

[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.360]
Let's do a beautiful poppano.

[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:16.700]
Hello.

[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:17.320]
Hello.

[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:17.960]
Yes sir.

[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:18.840]
How you doing today?

[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.380]
I'm just a tremendous.

[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.940]
Did anybody check and see if Resta's got a hit last night?

[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.300]
Yes he did, didn't you see the game?

[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:27.880]
I had to go to bed early.

[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.300]
I turned it off by the fifth inning.

[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:35.140]
You didn't see the beautiful error he made in about the, let's see, it was the top of the eighth inning I do believe.

[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.220]
When he made the bases were loaded with the two outs.

[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.860]
Easy ground ball by Saber Hagen, the pitcher to first.

[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:43.920]
And Resta's like starts taken off with it for the bag, but the ball is behind him.

[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.520]
And then he goes to reach for it and falls down.

[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:50.640]
And then the pitcher comes over to cover the bag and Resta still has plenty of time because Saber Hagen's not even running it out.

[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.300]
And he throws the ball and there's Richie Lewis-Wendy and he throws it away and two runs score.

[00:49:55.100 --> 00:50:00.820]
And then at the bottom of the inning after it was now safely seven to one and the game was way out of reach, Resta's comes up and bought a bang.

[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:01.560]
There's a base hit.

[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:07.620]
But of course, pre-prior to that all during the game when we were still in the game, he was like, oh for...

[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:07.840]
Oh!

[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.160]
That's why they call him the big one.

[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.640]
He's probably leading all nationally first base then in big O.

[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.720]
And big O's and in the big chokes.

[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.420]
He's choking it over there.

[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.440]
Oh boy.

[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.000]
Be pressing. Very depressing way.

[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.480]
They made a bad decision, sir.

[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.780]
I just can't emphasize it enough.

[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:32.600]
We traded away a quality major league player and we left ourselves with a rookie kid in right field who's not ready for prime time.

[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.820]
Who's striking out at a rate that is just...

[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.320]
Stagger is the mind. It boggles your imagination.

[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:39.680]
Daryl with more.

[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.000]
With and more.

[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.800]
He's with and more than I've ever seen.

[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.320]
Who's our backup for a spade?

[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:46.080]
I beg your pardon?

[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.420]
The backup for a spade.

[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.540]
The backup for a spade is Jeff Kohnine.

[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:54.180]
Who by the way had three hits last night and is like a legitimate and doesn't get anywhere the credit he should.

[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.540]
I don't know why because he's kind of like a bland guy and he's not real flashy.

[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:02.480]
But he had two tremendous home runs and two games and he had three more hits last night.

[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.500]
He's our backup for a spade.

[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.320]
I think he's going to be in the fourth position in the batting line up soon.

[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.220]
I hope so.

[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.480]
Maybe that'll help.

[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.260]
That should do it.

[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.980]
Maybe that'll wake up so they go.

[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:12.520]
Yeah.

[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.960]
But I think we better look elsewhere.

[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.120]
Exactly. And it won't be Henry Cotto either.

[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.960]
Who also made another nice error last night.

[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.700]
I'm glad that you fell asleep before it happened.

[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:21.880]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:22.760]
Hey, yeah.

[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.440]
I call a couple of my buddies, douche bags.

[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:25.760]
And good luck to us all. Yes.

[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.860]
The guy that traded.

[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:29.900]
Bagging in a way.

[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.380]
Dave Dombrausky, yes.

[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:32.320]
In the big O.

[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:32.920]
Okay.

[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.680]
Big douche bags.

[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.180]
See ya.

[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.100]
The big zero.

[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:36.460]
Oh!

[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:36.900]
Yeah.

[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.220]
Look, it's not personal arrest.

[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:39.920]
This we like you.

[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.360]
You're a very nice guy and you're articulate and you're like,

[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.780]
look like a human being and everybody loves you.

[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.100]
But we just want you to go away.

[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.080]
Don't go away, man.

[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:47.760]
Just go away.

[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.620]
See, like with who knew it was personal.

[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.980]
He had a crappy attitude and he wouldn't, you run after the ball.

[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.240]
And he just, there was a piece of crap.

[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.720]
Or rest is, he's a good guy.

[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:56.340]
I like him.

[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.340]
He just can't play.

[00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:58.440]
That's all.

[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.880]
I mean, Henry Cotto, we don't know him well enough to have an opinion

[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:02.440]
while we're the other.

[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.080]
We know he blows, but personally, he might be a nice guy.

[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:05.480]
I don't know.

[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.900]
He's getting a little long in the tooth and he's, he sucks.

[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.900]
So, you know, we were doing, it reminds me of WIOD.

[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.680]
It's like the micro-neary deal.

[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.100]
Okay, it's the same concept.

[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.060]
I mean, Chuck's a great guy.

[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:18.800]
I love Chuck.

[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.280]
Chuck is like a brilliant guy.

[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.160]
He's got a great voice.

[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.380]
He's got a great sense of humor, a great personality.

[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.660]
But you won't ever hear that on that show because it's a news show.

[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:29.760]
And so, Reniri was there and we were, we were doing a fine.

[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:33.400]
Everything was just fine as somebody you used to say,

[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.560]
but never will again on this show.

[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:35.780]
And it was great.

[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.140]
And then all of a sudden they started the front office again.

[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.860]
I think they must have called Dave Dumbrowski

[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.440]
and they started doing some stupid things.

[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:45.020]
And we messed it.

[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.120]
And now we're having a little problem every now and then.

[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:47.840]
Here and there.

[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.920]
Like in certain day parts.

[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.860]
Here's South Miami. Hello.

[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:53.340]
Hello, Neil.

[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.280]
Uh-huh.

[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.120]
Well, this isn't the Dr. Slinky, is it?

[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.000]
Or Sam the poet.

[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.860]
Or, or, hello, lovely lady.

[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.020]
Or, or my, my, my.

[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.260]
No, that wasn't Harvey from Kendall, lovely lady.

[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.020]
That was Jack from the beach.

[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:09.860]
Oh, Jack from the beach.

[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.720]
I can remember Jack from the beach with a gruff voice.

[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:12.620]
Hello, lovely lady.

[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.360]
I can admit one thing.

[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:17.120]
There's one person I do get tired of hearing and that's my, my, my on Rick and Sud.

[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:17.840]
My, my, my.

[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:19.040]
But you know who that is?

[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.400]
Do you know who that is?

[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.380]
Oh, my, Mike, and he works at it.

[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.820]
No, it's, it's not the real blind.

[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.400]
Mike, it's, uh, it's, uh, Ken Block again.

[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.100]
Oh, is it?

[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.380]
The chip off the old block with the, uh, punk with the, uh, dog racing tapes.

[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:29.900]
Oh.

[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.560]
He calls with about 20 different voices.

[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.160]
And I, I got to admit that the, uh, the blind Mike thing he does is very funny,

[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:38.120]
but like maybe he wants a month would be good, you know, not every day.

[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.640]
Yesterday he went on and on and he was like reaching and stretching.

[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.560]
And there was nothing that he said that was remotely humorous.

[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.140]
Listen, you said something yesterday and I'm trying to accept maybe look out now.

[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.020]
Uh, the outsiders.

[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:51.920]
Yeah.

[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:52.680]
You mentioned the movie.

[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.200]
That was a very distressing and depressing movie.

[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:56.680]
I like to, I like it.

[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.180]
You like it?

[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:57.500]
You like it?

[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.520]
I like it.

[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:15.820]
That was a good one thing that I liked to talk about was, uh, in the

[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:31.460]
songs, The Ruhler and his gig.

[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:31.460]

[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:31.500]
So he asked me if I was the slipp мужist, and I was trying to dat into the

[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:31.500]

[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.660]
i said c-rock or how c-tomicide

[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.640]
c-rock or how do tomas like a green

[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.500]
whatever is the matter

[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:42.980]
well there is a lot of very uh... erotic uh... overtones to that movie and

[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.840]
nobody knows what it is that scene that one in the picture

[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.140]
right that one scene where rucker how are sitting there in the got them in jail

[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.520]
and then uh... c-tomicide comes in and uh... he goes in there

[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:56.000]
and i don't want to go in with the thing about the spitting and he like uh... yeah

[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.020]
exactly something a little bit though there's a erotic undertones and

[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.380]
overtones in that movie well i'll tell you what

[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:06.520]
and any movie with c-tomicide has erotic overtones as a movie that i'm going to be

[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:10.760]
watching many many times you mentioned it i went and read it i never heard of c-tomicide

[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:15.700]
and i remember the movie uh... uh... soul man which was great he was funny in that

[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:18.640]
movie was a cute movie and i didn't realize he was the same kid that was in the

[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:21.200]
outside yes um...

[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:25.360]
and matt dillen was in the outsideers and uh... right and uh...

[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:27.180]
the middle of the west of all is

[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:32.640]
and the rath macho with the the zits right and all those kids you uh...

[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:36.340]
you know this is me off two things that everybody seems to be pissed off today which

[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:39.840]
have a lot of trade and no godfather's pizza's itself water

[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.260]
yeah you're right godfather's was tremendous and you're mentioning ice cream

[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:48.180]
i never buy ice cream about a half a gallon last week of eating strawberry

[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.380]
mm-hmm and that took out a spoon

[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.280]
gone that's why i don't buy it

[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:58.260]
yeah that that's what you can't you can't stop once you start with something that good you can't stop

[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:01.940]
now there's what i'm going to tell you plan just what i want a buddy of mine is twenty five

[00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:03.060]
four years old

[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:07.040]
buddy of mine we have an hour hanging out the other day i'll bet and i talked to him in the

[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:12.260]
he never seen the godfather yeah never thought and i got into the down and watch it

[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:14.780]
and i've i must have seen that movie about a thousand times

[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:20.280]
it's a good one of those movies i can't imagine anybody could ever see it too much it's

[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.960]
well there's there's some movies when you've seen it enough times you just could never watch it

[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:28.140]
again and if you started to watch it again you'd say now it's just but with the godfather if it

[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:32.040]
you can't put the come across it on the cable or the satellite or something you just sit there
