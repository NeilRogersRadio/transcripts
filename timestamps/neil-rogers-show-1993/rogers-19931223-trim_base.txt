[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180]
There's a painful fact about meal Roger that you should know that's a major cause of stiffness and swelling.

[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.520]
Oh!

[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.680]
Use Talk Radio's 610 WIOD presents The Neal Roger Show.

[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.040]
To talk with Neal Dial 751 WIOD from date in Broward 524 WIOD.

[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.800]
Outside the 305 area code toll free 1-800-944-WIOD.

[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.720]
And Bell South Mobility customers make it a free call by dialect star IOD.

[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.100]
Now, the Neal Roger Show on Use Talk Radio's 610 WIOD.

[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.260]
You can't call this Christmas.

[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.420]
It's not politically correct.

[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.320]
The ACLU has said the object.

[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.520]
Santa's no longer jolly.

[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.060]
He's differently sized.

[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.320]
And he's not a white man.

[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.940]
He's melanin deprived.

[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.040]
The ACLs are not little.

[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.120]
They're vertically constrained.

[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.520]
No men are no persons.

[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.400]
Oh God, what a pain.

[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.560]
So call Christmas trees.

[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.020]
Your botanical friends.

[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.800]
Much more of this do do.

[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.400]
I'll need a deep ends.

[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.120]
Girls are now free women.

[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.580]
When they're under 10.

[00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.220]
But in the beginning weren't we all semen.

[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.960]
We must be so careful as not to defile.

[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.420]
So please say the homeless are undomified.

[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.940]
Because of cancer.

[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.580]
Proficiency.

[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.640]
So fail is achieving a deficiency.

[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.240]
If you want to be a DC insider.

[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.360]
Then start calling hookers.

[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.640]
Sex can't provide us.

[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.540]
So we can't call this Christmas.

[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.620]
It's not politically correct.

[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.980]
The liberal soup over.

[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.040]
What the hell do you expect?

[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.580]
Probably to WID.

[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.420]
So the president has been screwing around a little bit.

[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.620]
Is that a big surprise to anybody?

[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.920]
Which president do we have that wasn't screwing around a little bit on the side?

[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.620]
FDR had a mistress.

[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.060]
And Truman of course was too ugly to have one.

[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.400]
And I was in the house.

[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.940]
And I had a mistress.

[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.420]
And I had that Chinese broad.

[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.120]
And Kennedy had like everything that would like walk with a skirt on.

[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.040]
And for the course.

[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.740]
What do you think Betty started drinking about?

[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.560]
And Jimmy.

[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.620]
What is that?

[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.400]
What is it?

[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.380]
It's got a couple of candles in them.

[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.400]
It says Sally was here.

[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.560]
What do you want it means by that?

[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.540]
Look at that one is shorter than the other.

[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.280]
She must already got a head start for Christmas.

[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.780]
A head start, he said.

[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.680]
It's from a Tisca de Tasca.

[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.820]
Let me check out your basket.

[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.240]
And let me open a little card.

[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.680]
It's like a beautiful thing.

[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.560]
It's got two candles.

[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.900]
It's from, oh look at that.

[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.540]
The clients and staff of center one.

[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.680]
Thank you for all you've done to make this a happy holiday for all of us.

[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.640]
Isn't that pleasant?

[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.000]
The wonderful people that center one who appreciate the just under 50 grand that we've already raised for them?

[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.720]
As opposed to certain other people like it all psychotic and surely because they don't like Brian Cox's finger on the back of our t-shirt.

[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.120]
And it just can't get enough out of us but won't be getting any after this year.

[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.100]
So anyway, it's a pleasure you doing great work over there at center one.

[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.300]
And thank you for the beautiful arrangement.

[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.780]
I'll see what I can do with those candles.

[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.360]
Where's that Luis video again?

[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.800]
I'm sorry.

[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.740]
Okay, look at the green lines.

[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.000]
What's going on over there now?

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.420]
Huh? They off to a head start themselves.

[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.000]
All the green lines are open, which is a very unusual experience here.

[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]
At 1-800-944-9463.

[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.820]
Are we still on the air over there? They just shut it off.

[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.680]
Because Bob Green was in here a little while ago saying to George,

[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.320]
oh, a Tampa call about anything yet?

[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.340]
Did they call yet? Did they tell you they're pulling the plug yet?

[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.840]
Tampa call yet? And I just opened up my Christmas card from Todd DeLisa of Two Weevils and Little Tommy Velvita.

[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.120]
So I assume we might still be on here there but I wouldn't bet my, wouldn't bet the lunch money.

[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.580]
Here's Margate.

[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.780]
Good morning.

[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.780]
When is to you, sir?

[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.640]
I just got in from Chicago.

[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.160]
Okay, how was it besides cold as crap?

[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.840]
Cold and it was snowing.

[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.420]
Yeah, I got an nasty and windy.

[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.840]
Oh, it's terrible.

[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.840]
And obnoxious?

[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.420]
Yes.

[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.760]
Yeah. All the above.

[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.880]
But I'm an elite from way back.

[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.720]
I've only been up there for about a year and a half.

[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.760]
And I heard you talking about Camilla's and I need to pick up a couple tapes.

[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.040]
Right, you can go to peaches. Any peaches like near by you, they got them all.

[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.060]
Best of Neal, best of Randy video, the best of Rick and Suds, Cassett and CD,

[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.820]
all the t-shirts, the great IOD calendar, which please buy at least 10 of those.

[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.840]
Okay.

[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.860]
I'm Tonya.

[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.300]
That's good.

[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.080]
And I got to get down to see the pizza loft.

[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.420]
That's one thing that I miss.

[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.420]
Even though they got some great restaurants in Chicago, they really do.

[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.240]
And pizza loft is still good.

[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.600]
It is. It's El Primero.

[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.220]
That's it.

[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.640]
You just keep saying that.

[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.980]
I do, I believe that.

[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.660]
Hey.

[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.140]
Oh, I'm sorry, a little distracted.

[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.100]
Oh, sorry about that.

[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.540]
That's okay.

[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.640]
Anyway, are you getting up to Chicago to watch the Cubs?

[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.800]
No, I gave up the Cubs for Sickness, although quite frankly, the way the Marlins are shaping up for next season,

[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.420]
we might have to make another trip up there to see real baseball game.

[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.860]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.320]
Yeah.

[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.900]
I am walking this to, to, to, to Riggly.

[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.720]
And I can catch the L anytime I want to run down to Kamiski.

[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.840]
It's a real sports intent.

[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.800]
One of the great sports towns in the universe.

[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.440]
Absolutely. Well, thank you, Neal.

[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.360]
Have a great holiday.

[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.620]
Happy Mowelidays, do you just...

[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.940]
See ya.

[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.180]
Ciao.

[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.620]
Bye.

[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.460]
Happy Mowelidays. That's what they say in China.

[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.420]
We have an open line and a blue line and one on the green line.

[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.560]
I'm going to take about a five minute break so I can watch this,

[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.940]
because at least this one doesn't bounce up and down, I said.

[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.360]
This is the one that bounces up and down.

[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.600]
This is the only one I really want.

[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.260]
I mean, especially with a short hair, that part there where he looks like really, really...

[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.220]
Well, he always looks really good.

[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.940]
That one right there.

[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.760]
It just bounces up and down by itself and the picture too.

[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.080]
I mean, it's one thing if you make it bounce up and down,

[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.940]
but it just kind of hops up and down by itself.

[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.160]
Holy Toledo.

[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.940]
Anyway, it's 12 and I'm going back to Vegas, okay?

[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.860]
Tell you how it is placed.

[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.200]
This is just...

[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.680]
This is like pretending to be alive here.

[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.720]
That's the deal in Florida.

[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.560]
This whole state is like a pretense at being alive.

[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.680]
And I go through that thing yesterday about how it was just packed with people out there.

[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.920]
Everybody having a great time.

[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.780]
The MGM grand opens up Saturday.

[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.140]
That Treasure Island everybody's out there with their kids having a great time.

[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.240]
And the Luxor with the big sphinx and the Pyramid.

[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.980]
And it's just a cacophony of great stuff happening.

[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.440]
And all these great shows.

[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.860]
I haven't seen that many shows out there.

[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.820]
The Luis Miguel, of course, was spectacular.

[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.760]
It didn't even come close to describing it.

[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.180]
I bet you there's never even been a bad show.

[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.580]
Well, maybe, you know, sometime over all of these years.

[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.680]
But there aren't too many.

[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.700]
I mean, unless they really are up to muster,

[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.480]
you won't see bad shows in Vegas.

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.920]
I mean, they go the whole nine yards that all the top entertainers,

[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.600]
they all just can't describe it.

[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]
And what do we got here?

[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.420]
Maybe we still have like a peppy field to sing it on the beach.

[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.480]
Huh?

[00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.980]
How about tummy boots?

[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.960]
Can they dig him up again and prop him back up on here?

[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.760]
One more show, Tubby.

[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.720]
Come on. You can do it.

[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.140]
Put it away, Louis.

[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.340]
1213 at WIOD and WSUN.

[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:13.920]
On second.

[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.620]
Don't miss the Weekend Magazine featuring the latest news,

[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.660]
information, trends, and what's happening this Saturday

[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.500]
and Sunday morning right here.

[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.200]
WIOD.

[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.320]
Hey, Neil.

[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.680]
F*** you.

[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.520]
We wish you a back in Texas.

[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.300]
We wish you a back in Texas.

[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:33.640]
Oh!

[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.460]
We wish you a back in Texas

[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.600]
with your big mouth and ears.

[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:47.400]
You must be real sore, being me by alcohol.

[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.040]
We wish you a back in Texas

[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.340]
with your big mouth and ears.

[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.300]
Incredible.

[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.860]
Here we go, it's so hummus.

[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.160]
Now you're eating Jimmy Chungus

[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.140]
because after, you're by Congress.

[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.520]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.400]
Oi.

[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.660]
Oh, where were the killer Cubans?

[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.720]
Oh, where were the killer Cubans?

[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.860]
Oh, where were the killer Cubans?

[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.000]
Of Fidel Castro's rear.

[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.500]
Thank you.

[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.700]
F***ing sound jive.

[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.760]
Was you on Larry King's life?

[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.500]
We wish you a back in Texas

[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.240]
and to you across cheer.

[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.340]
Call me Shostee.

[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.080]
1217 at WIOD.

[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.720]
How come I can't find any bit long enough

[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.980]
to cover this video on watching?

[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.040]
What a bitch this is.

[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.820]
I was supposed to be a Merry Christmas.

[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.560]
Damn it.

[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.120]
Anyway, we're just rolling along singing a song.

[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.620]
Today's Rick and Sucks last day before they go on vacation.

[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.760]
And tomorrow, jazz McKay is going to be filling in

[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.620]
for a Rick and Sudge with that great affected radio voice of age.

[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.000]
He'll be riding in on his Harley, which he don't own one.

[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.480]
Now he's all right.

[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.700]
He just needs to calm down a little bit and stop up being Mr. Renounce here.

[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.000]
Okay, if he would stop doing that.

[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.640]
And if he would just worry a little bit less about bikers and tiddy bars and drugs.

[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.760]
And come up with something else like...

[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.180]
I guess basically that's him.

[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.920]
I guess that covers him to a tee.

[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.500]
He'll be all right.

[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.300]
He'll be in for them all next week as a matter of fact from two to six.

[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.180]
Can you handle it?

[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:24.860]
I think so.

[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:25.900]
Don't have any choice.

[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.900]
Anyway, here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:28.180]
Hello.

[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.140]
Hey, Dale.

[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:29.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.520]
How you doing today?

[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.460]
From Mendis, man.

[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.920]
My wife and I had our first hockey game last night and it was great.

[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:35.500]
Oh!

[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.300]
Beautiful.

[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.680]
Hey, let me ask you something.

[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.640]
This is the reason I call.

[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.600]
It's true that you're going to be at Bauders College graduation in January.

[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.040]
Yeah.

[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.820]
That's what they're telling me.

[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:45.960]

[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.600]
Yeah, right.

[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.220]
Hey, that's what they told us.

[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.600]
Yeah, no question about it.

[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.260]
And other than that, thanks for playing Luis Miguel.

[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:52.980]
Isn't he the best?

[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.380]
Yeah, I'm watching him right now.

[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.660]
He's on hit TV right now doing Ho Chi Kuchi for about 20 minutes here.

[00:10:58.940 --> 00:10:59.340]
Fantastic.

[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.500]
I got something for you.

[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.140]
I bet.

[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.140]
Neil Rogers.

[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.600]
You're great, Bobby.

[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.320]
Ha ha.

[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:04.720]
Bye.

[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.420]
Well, I can't believe it.

[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.160]
Was that Rocky Etchie Maria or what, huh?

[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.420]
Pop this.

[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.360]
We have two open lines in both in Broward at what's the number?

[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.420]
Well, I'm busy popping it at 5249463.

[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:18.940]
Damn it.

[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.820]
All good things must come to an end and it just did in the video too.

[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.120]
Anyway, let's go to Haya Lea.

[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.440]
Hello.

[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.640]
Neil, how's it going?

[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.460]
Great, sir.

[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.640]
You're at the other best.

[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.740]
I want to say that before I go on.

[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.360]
Before you keep sucking around any longer.

[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:32.660]
Great.

[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.740]
I'm a suck up.

[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.320]
So what?

[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.440]
Listen, you turn me on to Luis Miguel.

[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.120]
Beautiful.

[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.400]
And I have to tell you, he's not only a very handsome man.

[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.940]
But he does have a voice.

[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.760]
Now I understand why you're so much into this guy.

[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.180]
The best.

[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:45.840]
Great talent.

[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.680]
Great performer.

[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.480]
Great everything.

[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.680]
I mean, what's not to like?

[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.340]
Very true.

[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.160]
I never thought that day would come that I would be a Luis Miguel fan like yourself.

[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.420]
There you go.

[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.440]
But here I am screaming out to the world, getting out of the closet.

[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.840]
I'm a Luis Miguel fan and I love it.

[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.080]
That is a miracle, you know what?

[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.240]
It is a total miracle.

[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.480]
Right.

[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.120]
I think he owes me now.

[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.220]
Did you get your paycheck?

[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.160]
Not yet.

[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:06.900]
Why not?

[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.360]
I'm glad you reminded me, by the way.

[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.580]
You know, I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.240]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.380]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:17.380]

[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:17.380]

[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:17.380]

[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:17.440]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:17.440]

[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:17.440]

[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:17.440]

[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:17.440]

[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:17.440]

[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:17.440]

[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:17.640]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.480]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.400]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.900]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.760]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.700]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.440]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.660]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.760]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.580]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.580]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.560]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.540]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.540]

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.540]

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.540]

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.540]

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.540]

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.540]

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.540]

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.540]

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.540]

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:50.680]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:50.680]

[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.200]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.940]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.560]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.000]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.080]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.700]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.200]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.140]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.420]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.020]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.940]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.540]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.080]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.080]

[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.080]

[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.080]

[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.080]

[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.080]

[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.080]

[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:11.260]

[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:11.260]

[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.060]
Did I go to bat for him that I sit in there

[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.820]
and when we had that other derelict,

[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.240]
that other geek from Candle working here,

[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.300]
I went to bat for him and now he wants me

[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.240]
to do something for you.

[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.340]
You're out with that crappy outfit you got on.

[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:21.840]
You're out with that crappy outfit you got on.

[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.520]
You're out with that crappy outfit you got on.

[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:22.800]
You're out with that crappy outfit you got on.

[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:28.880]
You're out with that crappy outfit you got on.

[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.540]
You're out with that crappy outfit you got on.

[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.760]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:40.760]

[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.060]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.920]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.820]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.740]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.460]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.440]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:46.560]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:46.560]

[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:46.560]

[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:46.600]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.760]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:47.880]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.780]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.080]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.780]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:50.780]

[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.920]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.580]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.700]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.920]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.440]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.280]
I'm glad you're not.

[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.600]
Because this station is going to make you a new person for the new year.

[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.220]
A new.

[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.060]
You approved.

[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.900]
You just be the tenth color when you hear this sound.

[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.400]
And we'll come to your house and lock you in an empty closet.

[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.060]
That's right.

[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.300]
There'll be no more beer.

[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.260]
No more cigarette.

[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.780]
And no more unprotected sex with miners.

[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.100]
You won't have to make new years' resolution.

[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.500]
Because you'll be locked in a closet.

[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.400]
Living a life without temptation.

[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.900]
You'll also be thin, dehydrated, and soil.

[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.660]
Winners will be denied beer, cigarettes, and unprotected sex with miners

[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.180]
for a period of not less than one year from the date of contest.

[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.300]
Unless, of course, winner opts to have sex with themselves in which case

[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.960]
we'll still make you wear a condom and asbestos smitten.

[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.640]
New years' resolution.

[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.980]
Why make them when you don't have to break them?

[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.640]
People listening for your chance to win.

[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.680]
1225 Adam White downstairs took care of business.

[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.460]
Got me my check.

[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.700]
What a guy, huh?

[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.880]
Oh, boy.

[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.120]
I'm Tonya.

[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.960]
That's whatever was in that trail mix, man.

[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.420]
I've got hemorrhoids now.

[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.420]
I can just sense it.

[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.620]
I can feel it in my mouth.

[00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.300]
Honey, like that.

[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.080]
When's the last time you could feel hemorrhoids in your mouth?

[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.600]
That's how bad they're burning from the tip of my nose to your reinus.

[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.580]
Look at the brow lines, man.

[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.720]
Speaking of your reinus, all three of them are opening.

[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.260]
And we kind of like have swapped today.

[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.300]
We had one time all the day lines were open.

[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.260]
Then a one time the green lines all went open.

[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:14.920]
And now it's the brow.

[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.900]
It's kind of like, you know, like in single-patient, right?

[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.540]
Isn't that what we wanted to be in single-patient on this show?

[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.500]
By the way, speaking of syndicated shows, you know that the fat obnoxious self-grandizing

[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.440]
now she's skinny, but pretty soon she'll be fat again.

[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.320]
Oprah show is the only syndicated show that's like in the top 15.

[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.380]
And really makes really, really gigantic bucks.

[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.680]
That's the only one.

[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.920]
That's why she's worth a billion dollars that obnoxious bitch.

[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.900]
Anyway, of course now that she's been down here in Miami,

[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.500]
we don't have any problem with shooting tourists or any crime problem.

[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:44.940]
Are we right?

[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.820]
Because she said she was coming down here to straighten that out.

[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.960]
And thank you, she did.

[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.680]
Thank you, Oprah.

[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.140]
Here's Miami.

[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:50.520]
Hello.

[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.520]
Hey, Neil.

[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:52.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.700]
Yeah, I want to tell you that you converted me to Louise Miguel.

[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:56.360]
Really?

[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.740]
Yeah, the first album that I had was Roman.

[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.020]
Yeah, I think it is.

[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.340]
Yeah, and now I've bought it.

[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.760]
No, say to...

[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.580]
I just watched it.

[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.860]
They just showed no say to with those big bass violins.

[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.240]
Yeah, that was the first one I bought.

[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:08.720]
Right.

[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.800]
Because you bought 20 years.

[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.020]
Yeah, and...

[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:12.480]
And the anjos.

[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.920]
Yeah, and now I'm on the verge of buying...

[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.500]
Adiace.

[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.340]
Exactly.

[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.380]
Must get it.

[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.120]
I'm Tonya.

[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.560]
Makes all the other ones pale and win significance.

[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.240]
All right.

[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.920]
And I want to tell you, you know, I'm out of school right now.

[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.320]
Right.

[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.540]
But the times you show is at, you know, when I'm in school,

[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.800]
I get into a lot of trouble because of you.

[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.440]
Why is that?

[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.200]
Because I wear that one year, one year headphones.

[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.060]
Yeah.

[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.000]
And the teachers get me.

[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.040]
Now, I'm probably 20, 30 detention.

[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.620]
Because I listen into a radio.

[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.280]
Do you realize?

[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.780]
You know, so what's more important?

[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.200]
Screw off with those teachers, Tom, to get out of your life.

[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.640]
You got important stuff to listen to on this show.

[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.240]
Right.

[00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.120]
Right.

[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.340]
Tell them to screw off and stay out of your business.

[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.600]
So, here you're going to turn them in.

[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.460]
Yeah, one more thing.

[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.820]
That asshole card.

[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:06.500]
Which one?

[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.140]
Which...

[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:07.760]
Who is it?

[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.480]
Yours is Randy.

[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.680]
Because I hear him both shows.

[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.040]
Which one are you talking about?

[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.320]
That asshole.

[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.100]
Oh, you mean the guy who says it?

[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.440]
Yeah.

[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.860]
The one that goes...

[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.420]
Asshole!

[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:16.960]
Exactly.

[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.040]
Randy's.

[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.520]
But at this station, we're used to sharing assholes.

[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.640]
Oh, one for enclosing?

[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:24.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.940]
I want to call my boss George, a big, bad, doin' no work.

[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:30.820]
Tush bag.

[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.420]
And assholes.

[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.040]
And that too.

[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.880]
Good luck, pal.

[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:34.520]
Bye-bye.

[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.400]
Happy, uh, whatever.

[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:36.520]
Anyway.

[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.740]
I'm not playing this now.

[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.280]
I don't think.

[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.420]
Well, I got inspired as others' videos.

[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.800]
And that's the Neo-Rodges tribute hour on Channel 44

[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.440]
and hit video when he got nothing else.

[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.440]
Hasta que no olvides voy a intentarlo.

[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.600]
Ooh, oh, the way he rolls that, you know.

[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:57.940]
Just...

[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:58.200]
Ooh.

[00:17:59.280 --> 00:17:59.740]
Uh-oh.

[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.340]
Brrrrrrrrrrr.

[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.300]
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.520]
Okay, enough.

[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:05.320]
Man.

[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.800]
Right on the edge of a very, very moist experience.

[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.560]
We have two open lines in both in Broward 5249463.

[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.920]
You would be amazed at how many people...

[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.440]
I'm talking about English-speaking people who never could have given a crap about any...

[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.420]
never would have thought including me they would have ever bought a record that

[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.060]
was not in english have gone out and just grabbed up louise mcgill i mean just

[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.000]
hands full of louise mcgill and the thought of it is just very very satisfying

[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.140]
i'm telling you

[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.620]
so i want little a rakeoff you know i'm talking about and tomorrow i'm getting

[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.640]
that other album in here it's interesting though that some of the uh...

[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.120]
videos that i had seen before like on tellahit that i didn't really like the

[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.200]
video and i allowed that to interfere with my enjoyment of the song

[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.120]
now which do you like first you like the song first or do you like the video

[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.720]
first when you see the video i think

[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.560]
the video enhances your appreciation and if you don't never heard the song before

[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.660]
if you don't like the video

[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.660]
it's distracting from the song

[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.820]
that make any sense

[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.580]
because a couple of songs he sang at the concert

[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.560]
i had seen on the video like no say to i hate that video where they're out

[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.180]
there on the grass in the water he's got that big symphony orchestra and he's

[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.460]
dressed up in that big got tuxedo i mean who wants to see that

[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.940]
who want to see a lot of naked people like most of the videos

[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.460]
but uh... the song is just tremendous

[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.880]
and so it's got to the point where i really like some of the songs that i

[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.980]
care for that much before

[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.360]
and when you hear a performer do something live anyway if it's like it

[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.160]
enhances the appreciation you know i'm talking about

[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.300]
is there anybody who is ever even gotten out of the house if you ever left like

[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.360]
the room that you're in right now like recently in the last year the year is

[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.280]
almost over with i would at least open up the front door get a fresh breath of

[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.980]
air something just inhale real real deep

[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.860]
here here i'm not joking man if you know how many perocardial people we got in

[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.300]
this state people who like a big trip for them is like a trip up the store to

[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.360]
the nearest up the street to nearest you float them store that's like a big

[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.220]
outing for them

[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.760]
and we also have a lot of people need to be out in ninety four

[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.800]
here's my me beach on a starline hello

[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.040]
and i'm guilty of anything

[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.700]
it is a leaving with god said about little children

[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:08.500]
and

[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.940]
little children come on to me

[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.760]
Michael calling in on the celebrity line and a boy Michael i guess he wasn't

[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.500]
finished yesterday he will be soon we have an open line in the day 751

[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.280]
on the starline at star i.o.d

[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:31.820]
but if i am guilty of anything it is of giving all that i have to have all that i have to

[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:38.980]
give my penis my buttocks my lower torso thighs and any other error that they

[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.060]
wanted to help children all over the world

[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.020]
well he's always been known to give generously and you know what they say

[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.420]
the family that plays together

[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.340]
fillets together that's what they say in the meat department

[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.800]
a crogr

[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.820]
like i said the other day if i could just be the bowl on that violin

[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.480]
i would probably give the best bow job in the history of music

[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.960]
i said bow job to you

[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.140]
take a bow

[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.780]
what is it?

[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.320]
i'm gonna like to

[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.160]
start a shrine to luiz begin i'm just gonna build up a build up a gigantic statue of him

[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.820]
like stark naked out in front of the building

[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.300]
the only question is will he be circumcised or not that's the question does anybody

[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.380]
know the answer yes

[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.160]
oh and look at that speaking of circumscribed people

[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.680]

[00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.600]
you've almost converted me as well

[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.920]
is he coming to one of our games?

[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.020]
i actually heard he's a great player

[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.380]
no but uh...

[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.000]
i bet he is

[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.200]
i meant ice hockey

[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.300]
you know it's crazy

[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.540]
well he was there for the draw on the world cup which by the way that was the big event in Vegas on sunday

[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.320]
and nobody in this country watched it they had like a zero point five rating on ESPN

[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.620]
and around the west rest of the world there were like billions of people watching it

[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.460]
because nobody cares about soccer thank god

[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.820]
but no seriously that was the big event in Vegas on sunday the world cup draw

[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:32.840]
well the other day i was flipping just by accident to jimmy on the field five sixty

[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.100]
yeah people are calling up saying you know

[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.360]
hey they will copy it's the greatest thing

[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.500]
and uh... you know then later i've made an accident flip the hang for about two seconds

[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.220]
and he happened to mention it and say you know making fun of it and all that

[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.880]
nobody cares about soccer in this country and nobody ever will it's it's terminal

[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.060]
it's ponderous

[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.060]
very ponderous

[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.560]
because the guys don't slam each other into the board every day

[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.540]
it's just boring the field is too big and they just keep going back up and down and back up and down

[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.960]
and the little pansy referees keep running around and throw their little blimp wrist up into the air

[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.880]
and then they throw the ball out of bounds and they kick it in again it's a terminal sport

[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.800]
nothing ever happened

[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.060]
no

[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.540]
but anyway i'm passing these issues out uh... sunday night outside the arena right

[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:13.900]
right

[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.020]
it was a great game of course

[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.280]
as the game is winding down i'm already out there early i didn't go to the game myself

[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.540]
people are starting to leave which i'm listening on the radio

[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.100]
well that i'm glad you brought that up i had reports from the people last night

[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.020]
i the lot of people as usual came up saw me before the game in between periods

[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.440]
i find out that with about a minute to go

[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.060]
in the third period on sunday

[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:40.460]
and here is our great comfort behind panther team that is never out of any game

[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.280]
they came from behind three goals in the Dallas game on away ice and tied them up

[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.060]
and have come back so many times to win games or time up

[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:52.820]
and with a minute to go they were pouring out of that place like uh... they had a panty raid

[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.380]
and and uh... the place was like half empty by the time with six seconds left in regulation

[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.700]
they scored the time goal

[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.880]
well i'm out there passing out issues and i'm listening on the radio and people are pouring out of there

[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.540]
and i'm giving them out and just you know saying

[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.200]
to people is a free hockey magazine here to have one

[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.220]
and all of a sudden you know i hear

[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.440]
christmore go crazy i don't know if you heard that call it actually is probably the best quality

[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.740]
we actually had some enthusiasm

[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.260]
he was like born speedy burns you know he was little excited

[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.040]
but uh... so i'm telling people i was passing a met

[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.520]
i'm telling people i've been passing out the issues and like by the way you left early and the panther just tied it up

[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.120]
like what?

[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.040]
of course a lot of anaconda

[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.020]
and they were all racing around to try to get back in and we would want to back in good

[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:39.100]
anybody that leaves a hockey game it's one thing to leave a football game early when you're down by 13 points

[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:45.440]
would like two minutes or four minutes to go into game but to leave a hockey game early when you're down by a goal with a minute or two minutes left in the game

[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:52.480]
only an asshole would do a thing like that only an idiot somebody who totally doesn't understand the game and should be shot on the spot

[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.020]
and the crazy thing is you know here i am passing out these issues with some people

[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.340]
and we're saying free hockey magazine and people are actually saying no thanks

[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.740]
so i'm like what you know you're welcome?

[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.420]
no thanks

[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.340]
so we're walking out of a hockey game and i even joked in one person

[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.820]
i was like can you read and he's like no by the way

[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.740]
i was like i think there's other people out there passing out these pamphlets with you know

[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.540]
restaurants or coupons or whatever they're going

[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.840]
well i think that's inhibiting now that's true i understand where people are coming from

[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.140]
they're so tired of being panhandled out there in the street

[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.500]
they just want to get to their car get out of their safe and sound and get out of their as fast as possible

[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.600]
right but once people see what i'm giving out and they see the hockey thing

[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.340]
you know they just take it and you know and they go on their way and hope they read it

[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:33.240]
yeah i mean read it yeah

[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.280]
but anyway i'm too released me gal

[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.780]
yes okay so you know you i'm not a total convert but

[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.820]
yeah but i went out to the store and by the way i'm in one of them

[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:45.660]
go ahead

[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.020]
okay i've been one of the chain

[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.360]
i want to let you step on them

[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:54.920]
okay and they're actually white white angles looking at the loose me gal section

[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.340]
which i thought was kind of

[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:02.580]
first of all i want to say this i don't want anybody to think that they're going to get any idea of what

[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.300]
Louise Miguel looks like by the cover of his albums and especially

[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.140]
audio so which is one of the ugliest pictures i've ever seen

[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.240]
uh... i don't know what he looks like he's got a pug nose it's taken from a strange angle

[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.460]
just trust me as a great connoisseur of human flesh that when i saw him in Vegas

[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.580]
even with that stubbly beard he's sporting now he looks so good that even animals

[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.040]
are like approaching him in the street

[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.440]
trust me we're like him for different reasons but i understand that i'm just talking

[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.320]
about and don't start getting paranoid mic i'm just explaining one aspect

[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.140]
because there are a lot of faggots out there that are running out to peaches and other record stores

[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.920]
and they're taking a look and they want to see if this guy's as hot as i say any look at some of these

[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.500]
paid i don't know trust me when i tell you okay

[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.880]
there's no doubt that just a human being you look at the fact that he is a sexual magnet

[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.100]
he's a really good looking man he's an erotic thing

[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:55.040]
but anyway so i picked up i saw the disc it's uh... america and and the wife's three wife songs

[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.080]
right that's your position get america's right right okay good so i bought that one

[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.960]
which is nice i'm anica yeah right so which was the first song you did the concert by the way

[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.940]
i brought tears to my eyes so in this music store in the latin section they have like

[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.920]
a thing you can put on headphones and listen to different albums right so they have ariest

[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:17.180]
so i'm listening through when i didn't hear any of the songs that you play a lot so i figured

[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.960]
okay i want to take a chance and just buy any other cd just to see what's on there

[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.880]
you didn't hear the songs that i play like swave and us to came you'll be this and i can't

[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.820]
be near where star solo when you first started playing and i hear you play a couple

[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.700]
songs i really like that i haven't heard them in a while i don't know what's a long time ago

[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.840]
yeah i don't even know which ones they are okay so anyways i buy this cd there's a picture

[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.560]
of them like holding a microphone like i can't really see a space it's sort of a silhouette

[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.880]
romance and i can't that's romance what's that that's romance no it's a different one because it's

[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:53.100]
it's uh... it's like a ratten the uh... companies flintes is the actual

[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.600]
like name of the record company so i can't read i don't know spanish so i just

[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.600]
bought the thing i was actually called George before trying to figure out what this is

[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.300]
and it turns out and i'm listening to this record and there's no lewisbee

[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.940]
golf singing it's just the songs of just the music and i don't feel in the

[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.500]
here yeah and it turns out these are song beds of all his songs right it's like her

[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.060]
mouth for plays neal diamond yeah and i mean that case it'd be an improvement and i said to

[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.440]
myself this thing's worthless because i want to hear him sing yeah it's like ray conif does

[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.860]
lewis mcgel so besides adios which is the other way i mean i mean i can just hear the ray

[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.180]
conif singers doing swive

[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:33.100]
you have all the songs you probably know uh-huh but they're all along with Louise

[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:38.180]
elevator music it's right exactly i can stuck in an elevator with Louise right well

[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.620]

[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.100]
going to the sunset dome i'm i'm not kidding you know well first of all the thunder dome the ice

[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.920]
sucks the equality of the ice over there it's very very choppy and very bad and everybody's been

[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.580]
complaining about the ice it slows the game way down secondly you got the banking of the seats like

[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.200]
i've said many times it's very poor you're why looking straight into the b i've here new

[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.460]
of the bichson sitting in front of you no seriously the the seats at the thundered

[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.520]
dome aren't bank properly to watch the sporting event and thirdly they got all those sit down

[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.620]
folding chairs which give you hemorrhoids it's just not designed you know it's good for car

[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:30.240]
shows and boat shows right exactly right but definitely not for hockey and maybe other types of shows

[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.260]
and it's funny because i was reading in the sports section in Vegas of all places that they've

[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:39.500]
just agreed to build a 20 million dollar new arena downtown in tamper something like that

[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:44.700]
i haven't heard anything about that here yeah it's coming along well it's about time you know

[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.240]
stop with all this make-believe stuff and build a real arena maybe they'd win a gamer too yeah maybe

[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.520]
brownered 524 oh Jeff did call you from over there before so Tampa did call

[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:21.820]
very paranoid and very secretive around here right now like what's going on what's going on

[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:26.640]
oh you'll know soon enough you'll know soon enough oh what's going on very paranoid because like

[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.000]
i said they had their big meetings up in Atlanta and they sat around it's well you know we may have

[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.540]
made a mistake over here and we made a made a little mistake all we usually don't make mistakes but uh

[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:43.620]
yeah they have screwed us up so bad in this last year i mean here it is the it's christmas time it's

[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.360]
like coming on new year when people make resolutions and when people do really bad things get shot

[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.840]
which i think we should have a really long line in this place and let's hope that they can do a

[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.140]
little bit better because it can't get any worse unbelievable maybe that's the secret maybe

[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.500]
they're going to put David Paul on sometime like in drive time here's Miami hello

[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:11.520]
hello yeah nil what is that oh that's my uh two-month-old daughter beauty thanks hey i got a

[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.240]
question about last night's game fantastic game first of all we're there no unfortunately now

[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.500]
on tv with the baby here watching it on tv she's got her own little panther outfit already right

[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:25.220]
yeah so listen with a few minutes left in the game about four minutes left in the game right okay

[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:31.640]
Richter comes out of the goal crease he gets nailed by i don't know lower your somebody i think i

[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:36.260]
think it was uh no it was bending i'm sorry i'm burning okay bending yeah okay and so Richter's

[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:42.060]
out he's uh fair game anyway so out of goal well let me say this uh that's not really true then

[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:47.160]
the old days they used to be true but now if you really haul off and hit the goalie even if he's

[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.360]
out of the crease they're going to call it almost every time they call a penalty well it didn't

[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.740]
look like he really nailed him too hard yeah he came down on top of him right but they still call it

[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:58.820]
everything okay well everyone's still everyone going into the melee behind the net right all right

[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:03.040]
so anyway Richter gets tossed uh at least they showed it on tv that he got two minutes for roughing

[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:09.920]
right well how come he never left the game that would be nice if the goalie gets a penalty they have

[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.380]
to take him out and they can't replace him that would have been very nice no no no no i would i

[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.920]
understand no the goalie doesn't get replaced in other words if the goalie in fact my my gardener

[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.400]
served that penalty for the Rangers he went off into some of some they select a player it can be

[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.500]
anybody they want and he sits in the box for the two minutes or however long the penalty is

[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.340]
and the goalie stays in there oh well i was under the impression that the goalie still had to go

[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:35.780]
that goalie had to go out like and they were bringing uh the other goalie healy no yeah oh okay all

[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.320]
right well that was my question i was i was wondering why Richter was able to stay in the goal

[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:45.280]
yeah that's that's the answer okay well thanks very much and uh i'm out of material okay okay let me

[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:50.180]
say that Lance you play tennis like a flame and douche bag have a great holiday thank you bye bye

[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:56.480]
open line and date 751 and what had powered 524 and i could have done the john moinehan answer

[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.220]
that i would still be going on and explaining that uh under severe conditions if the goalie has

[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:05.500]
hemorrhoids and if the other goalie breaks his leg that they would bring email frances off the bench

[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:09.320]
in New York and that they would put the uh pads on him and they would suit him up and then if he

[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.140]
got hurt foster he would they would dig his body up right next to her old ballad and they would

[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.660]
suit him up and stick his ass in time like between the gold post and use him as the temporary net

[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:22.420]
and maybe her sees our maniago would come back and just kind of back him up but rather than go through

[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.900]
one of those long convoluted explanations i think it's basically pretty simple like icing it

[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.500]
offside and the other rudiments of our game and doesn't require a long convoluted explanation john

[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.980]
just to kill a lot of time and sound real suitable intellectual like you pretend you know what you're

[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:40.180]
talking about which trust me baby you don't but be sure and ask uh Roger about it today

[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.100]

[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.260]
getting like a little bit too much I mean every time it turned the radio on

[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:25.340]
to something about Michael Jackson yeah something like that sure is getting a lot

[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.420]
of publicity makes you kind of wonder actually you know what surprises me is

[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:34.600]
he is charred with like molesting kids but everybody thinks it's like such a joke

[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:40.140]

[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:45.000]
tell you now I'm not Catholic okay no it is not funny that's why I don't

[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.780]
understand the whole thing but don't you understand every time a story like

[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:52.160]
that it isn't even the essence of the story it's the personality that outweighs it

[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.540]
and people can't be bothered with what the immediate the matter is don't you

[00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:00.100]
understand it yeah it's just it's just another big cause so lab it's another big

[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.700]

gave it to every guy in town

[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:41.380]

[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.640]

[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:17.780]

[00:45:55.100 --> 00:46:01.700]
springs hello hello what is wrong with this thing man hello there we go hey

[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:06.400]
Neil how are you okay I want to say I'm a first time caller yes and I live in

[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.200]
Missouri but I did live in Florida for three years long time with her to you okay

[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.880]
I mean you're talking about the panthers earlier I want to tell you the people out

[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:18.520]
here who are listening to you that do not know hockey they need to support that

[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.060]
team it's a hell of a sport man if they're leaving early they're all amongst you

[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.440]
do you back they're there are supporting them don't worry about that we have three

[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.240]
record crowds three straight games we broke our attendance for I read that

[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.960]
this for now fantastic they tied the Rangers last second that's fantastic

[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:41.200]
we tied the Rangers we beat the Rangers last night yeah okay the papers today

[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.980]
tied them up to two no let me say it again we beat the Rangers three two well

[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:51.520]
fantastic yeah oh that's even better that is even better yeah yeah put a

[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:56.140]
little on a kid all right see you two open lines and

[00:46:56.140 --> 00:47:01.260]
Broward 524 1 on a green line 1 80944 9463 so during the break the

[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:06.020]
a bat line rings and George puts it on hold he says to me it's Elvita I pick

[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:10.340]
it up and there's a dial tone then he calls back and I pick it up and he

[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:15.240]
why he did that because he wanted to make sure he wasn't on the air again so

[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.180]
you put this on the heels of that mysterious visit by Bob Green earlier

[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.960]
over you heard anything from Tampa today yet to Tampa call about anything yet

[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.680]
no and he goes flying out of here like a bad out of hell so something is in the

[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:31.080]
wind in WS you win and I said what's up Tom well about those hockey tickets are

[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:36.300]
you gonna use them Tom didn't call about the hockey tickets okay so there's

[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:41.420]
something in the air at WS you win George that we don't know about remember

[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:45.360]
the last time I got a call at that he was gonna call back at two yeah yeah

[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.220]
that's right that was the following week we went on Y&F for a week for that

[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.400]
great experiment and then they stabbed us in the back and took us off when we're

[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.560]
on the verge of really building something now I have a feeling it's like in

[00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:00.500]
reverse I really do I think that probably they're gonna put let's see what are

[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.180]
going to the put jazz mccayon in midday they'll put Chris Baker on in the

afternoon and then they'll run our reruns of their tapes from six o'clock till

[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:13.460]

[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:20.360]
Broward 5249463 it's 11 after one at WIOD and maybe WS you win everybody knows

[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:24.300]
the holidays mean getting together and getting together usually means eaten lots

[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:28.960]

Gardens hello hi Neil yes sir how you doing great how you doing pretty good

[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:47.560]
Cam Neely is God is he well you don't plan the right team though sir he could

[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:52.840]
be if he played two games in a row yeah also kind of like Mario Lemieux yeah yeah

[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.100]
uh-huh two bonds as a heck of a hockey player huh kind of like John

[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.260]
Offer doll if he played two games in a row that would be like front page news yeah

[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.840]
yeah yeah two Barnes is a good player in fact I think we got a couple of good

[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.680]
acquisitions I think Greg Hall good as a outstanding defenseman yeah two

[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:10.740]
Barnes looks pretty damn good to me he's a gutsy tough hard-nosed kid he skates

[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.900]
up and down the ice to he plays both ends of the rank I like that he plays both

[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:17.540]
ends against the middle you're right yeah yeah you're up and down you'd made a

[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:22.100]
comment about the dolphins you know no imagination on the offense right I'd say

[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.960]
this guy Gary Stevens has got a good pulse on the team does he they can't

[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.640]
execute how you gonna put some trick poison if these four million dollar

[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.440]
athletes can't hold on to the ball well at some point you have a point there

[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.080]
they can't execute maybe execution is the answer sir I think we need to yeah

[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:41.040]
because I'm in favor of it for several of them yeah yeah Fred Q'sic there you go

[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:45.560]

here if you give me about 10 seconds can you handle it that long well my wife

[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.300]

[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.440]
green lines and we're waiting for that big news now maybe one of our spies on

[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.360]
the west coast knows what the big news is already from velvita that probably

[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.400]
supposed to be a top secret but I'm sure just about everybody in town already

[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:20.580]
knows it at 1-800-944-9463 here's Delray Beach hello hey that's what I'm

[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:26.900]
watching I can't guess Dave Lowry shoot these scores where you see in that yes the

[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:30.800]
answer is the end to oh we don't have that on our thing here in this crappy gold

[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:35.240]
coast cable yeah but you do have had it we do have and no we don't have that we

[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:39.660]
have MTV Latino which is on right now as I speak you believe the scorpions are

[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:45.560]
singing wind of change oh well kill that in English you believe this team I'm

[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.480]
gonna tell you I will agree with Moynihan on one thing okay that he keeps

[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.300]
repeating and it's an absolutely correct observation that is we're getting

[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:56.160]
spoiled because we've come to expect this team to be competitive with

[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.740]
everybody and we and when you got an expansion team you have no reason to

[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.920]
expect that I mean you should expect to get the living crappy out of you now

[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:06.500]
and in just like the penguins beat the crap out of the lightning the other

[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:09.800]
night eight to three and the lightning or a second year team but this team

[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.820]
man has got the balls of a hippopotamus they're just never give up their

[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.940]
competitive with everybody and we ought to kiss the ground for a nice little mix

[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:20.900]
they got yeah exactly these like lowery man like lowery had great playoff

[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:23.700]
experience he gave the Leafs a tough time in that series last year when he was

[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.480]
with the blues and now of course we got him he's experienced Grewdland's

[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.460]
experience from the Canadians we got a lot of guys with good experience these

[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:32.980]
aren't just a bunch of green rookie no no talents who just came out of the

[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:37.100]
minor leagues now those playoff games will top in the up in our her you bet well

[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.200]
I tell you what I'm looking forward to it and it's kind of kind of reminds me of

[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:43.780]
the marlins in the mess a little bit as long as we can beat the lightning

[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:48.360]
yeah yeah that see there are there are basically two things that I'm really

[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.240]
hoping for number one like you said is finish ahead of the lightning it's a

[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:55.540]
good rivalry were seven points ahead as we speak and number two of course is

[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.840]
maybe just sneak into those playoffs which at the moment I mean we're like

[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.640]
right on the average we're right on the edge of being right in their competitive

[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:05.460]
I'll tell you what I'll give the team a big jump ahead and the whole thing to be

[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:11.920]
able to get a playoff would that be something as it says on the scoreboard

[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.660]
after we score a goal up there unbelievable that's what it would be all right have a

[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:09.200]
get serious right thing but I don't I don't understand this uh this Michael

[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.380]
Jackson interview yesterday after was over I was listening to a EDR that damn

[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:18.240]
fact that I can't stand up yeah I don't like them too much change that to 48

[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.900]
there 105 048 if you would add him you can look at it eye to eye you're so nice

[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:28.020]
and tall 48 048 instead of 033 at a boy you can do it go ahead sir anyhow on

[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:31.520]
this EDR they get a these people calling in for their reaction kind of like they

[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.280]
did on TV yesterday right on channel six and and a lot of the a lot of these

[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:40.760]
people are calling it and they're going it's the white man who's trying to bring

[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.400]
them down and yeah I don't consider myself to be prejudice or racist or any of this

[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.880]
other stuff I mean the guy is the wacko I don't care whether he's black or white

[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:54.920]
or I mean it you know that it just it never fails to astonish me how some people

[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:58.260]
and of course it's usually the so-called leaders like the NAACP who started

[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.240]
shooting off their mouth a couple of days ago how they can take something like

[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.140]
this and twisted into a racial issue it would be like remember when John Wayne

[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:10.300]
Gacy was found bearing the bodies of all those kids in Chicago all those boys

[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.700]
and it would be like if some gay rights group came up and said oh this is

[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:17.640]
discrimination against homosexuals or some white supremacy groups said well

[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.480]
there's a discriminating against him because he's a white man and the fact that

[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.820]
he killed all these kids well let's got nothing to do with it you know what what

[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:27.440]
is that all about and let's forget that we're talking about a pedophile exactly

[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.060]
we're talking about somebody who admittedly sleeps in a big bed with a lot of

[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:34.480]
little boys who takes them around and buys them thousands and thousands and

[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:37.860]
showers them with all kinds of gifts and who allegedly has like written out

[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.760]
all these checks to the parents of these kids which makes one wonder what the

[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.480]
hell that's all about I mean there you know there's no question that there's

[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.400]
still are some doubts but there sure seems to be a hell of a lot of a

[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.380]
preponderance of evidence that indicates there's something wrong going on here

[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.140]
along with the testimony of maids and servants and bodyguards and all kinds of

[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:56.540]
people who saw them like running around cavorting naked with little boys there

[01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:00.560]
was something there to be answered about and you know he makes a big deal that

[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:05.320]
he was searched I mean that's that that's nothing compared to you know believe me

[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.840]
I got better they didn't find much on that you know I'm talking about yeah there

[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:12.640]
wasn't much to check out on that thing I guess small package right you know the

[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.000]
other thing is your your station on that song that you guys have to sense

[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.220]
there instead of staying be it in a reaction and all that other right tell me if

[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:24.300]
I'm wrong at the end doesn't it say something like it can't be better there's

[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:28.620]
nothing like a five-year-old or can't be as tight as a five-year-old I didn't say

[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:32.340]
can't be as tight didn't say that because you said they're black their white

[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:37.380]
they're really tight I think he's talking about his jeans yeah I guess yeah well I'm

[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:41.520]
kind of a skintai he wears those skintai jeans you know I see but it just

[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.520]
seemed you can't say well I don't you know I did just as so ridiculous to me I mean

[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.480]
beat it is the name of one of his best-selling songs and the fact that we have

[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.260]
to delete that and we live in such a juvenile society my friend that it's just

[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:55.820]
that you have no idea what we go through here just to try to entertain people on

[01:05:55.820 --> 01:06:00.720]
an adult level everything has to be brought down to the level of a sandbox it is a joke it is a joke

[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:04.860]
well I'm I hate to we live in a country where freedom of speech is only a

[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:08.620]
figment of your imagination believe me I'm in kind of a bad mood so I'm gonna
