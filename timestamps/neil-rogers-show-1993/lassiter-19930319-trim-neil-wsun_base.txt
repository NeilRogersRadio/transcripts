[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]
For a special guest right here in the studio with me none other than guest not a guest

[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.080]
We don't have guests. Well, you said you're the best place for you're sure you're softening on the other guest

[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.340]
Place for boogers wait to hear this you're gonna you will fall off the chair checkers

[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.960]
Oh

[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.580]
Checkers is a lot plays for what don't come in don't come into my town and ridicule the taste of my audience of my friends and neighbors

[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.500]
What did they do to the neighbors of Bokin?

[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.840]
Ray and lutes or what

[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.420]
More than how were the taste buds of the people that besides having no taste with Lionel whose voices like

[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.620]
They's great to hear this on the plane lutes. I'm telling you the best place for burgers is checkers

[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.140]
You have to be up to town and knock my friends and they have a hard to prove that you're on welfare before they let you

[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.560]
Weed at checkers. That's how they didn't do the survey in lutes because somebody lost the crayon

[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.780]
Is like burn steakhouse compared to checkers and this goes on raving about people have

[00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.000]
Focusing the eyes and the shakes. How do you compare that with steak and shake?

[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.580]
Why don't you just accept it?

[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.980]
Those of us heathens who live in Miami would kiss the ground to have steak and shake and this

[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.560]
Cocka made me think here the the readers of the tribune say that checkers is the best place

[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.460]
This has got to be a benefit of those of you listening at home. What has happened this morning is the tapet tribune

[00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.000]
You know, I mean you have no idea or it might be a night reader publication come to think oh well

[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.820]

I don't know who all they own but they own a lot of this paper blows man

[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.360]
I want to go on record right now saying the Tampa Tribune could be one of the most

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.060]

[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.080]

Hot phones that you have you were just crying

[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.400]
I put him on for your benefit.

[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.600]
I do a little special something for your trip up here.

[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:40.940]

[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.100]
Holy cow.

So now you'll have something to talk about to your, my, my,

[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.200]
my, my, my audience.

[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.180]
Break time.

[00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.860]
Drew Hayes.

[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.560]
There's a name.

[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.760]
If ever, if ever the GM Con of Family missed anybody that they should have taken care of.

[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.420]
There was the guy.

[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.420]
How much do you think it would take?

[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.020]
What a punk.

[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:08.080]
I've got $5.

[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.080]
WLS.

[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.520]
The world's largest sore.

[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.920]
Anyway, I don't know how to go.

[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.360]
Sorry to bring back bad memories.

[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.460]
Ball, you certainly did.

[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.140]
Let's go to Tampa.

[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:18.780]
Hi there, Tampa.

[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.360]
You're on the air.

[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.560]
Hey, how you doing, Bob?

[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.200]
Hey, pretty good man.

[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:21.600]
You soft.

[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.420]
Not too bad.

[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:22.840]
All right.

[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.200]
Long time listening, first time college.

[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:25.980]
All the three.

[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.880]
Hey, well, now we're talking.

[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.480]
I'm a Bay.

[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:35.380]
And Bob, I just wanted to, I've been contemplating cars for a long time, but I decided to call.

[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.020]
Six years ago, you changed my life, and I just wanted to thank you.

[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.920]
What did I do six years ago?

[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.620]
Well, mainly you just got me to start thinking for myself instead of listening to the

[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.040]
reddering.

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.180]
Well, I certainly hope we've changed that in a minute while.

[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.840]
I just wanted to call and tell you, I really appreciate it.

[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.160]
I'm looking forward to meeting you all tomorrow.

[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.500]
Oh, you thought about the features?

[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.860]
Yeah, I'm going to come out there.

[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:57.180]
All right.

[00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.080]
11 to 2 if you get there early, man, you know, you scoff up on somebody and besides the

[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.460]
food will probably last a hell of a lot longer now because I doubt very much that the

[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.280]
pox and festive Velvita will be there tomorrow.

[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.000]
Yeah, I just, I just think don't, don't take you realize sometimes how much you can, you

[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.760]
can affect people's lives by just talking common sense.

[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.320]
And I just hope to keep it up in the future.

[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.740]
Thank you very much.

[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.460]
Appreciate it.

[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.220]
Have a great day, Phil.

[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:18.800]
You too, Phil.

[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.160]
See you tomorrow.

[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.820]
One, one, open it.

[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.900]
How did, don't, don't like sluff on it.

[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.500]
How come my level is so low now?

[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.820]
You got my mic turned off.

[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:26.820]
No, I don't have to.

[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.160]
You're not fooling me.

[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.060]
He's trying to like upstage me now.

[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.760]
Like, I'm not trying to upstage you.

[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.280]
You've got a different mic than I do.

[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.400]
Your mic, my mic is highly directional.

[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.260]
Yours is not.

[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.340]
And when I raise my voice, I can hear feedback in your mic.

[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.020]
Feed this.

[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.060]
Yeah, you've got to sluck over that.

[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.660]
That was like a very, it was like a home.

[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.080]
It was not so far call.

[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:49.980]
It was poignant.

[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:50.840]
It was meaningful.

[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.580]
It goes to show you that sometimes people who are inhibited, people who are living in

[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.800]
like this narrow little cloistered world brought up.

[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:56.800]

[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:56.800]

[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:56.800]

[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:02.340]
And this kind of neanderthal mentality, when they actually hear there's an option like somebody could think for themselves, it's like a mirror.

[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.840]
I'm screaming over here in that goddamn needle isn't even moving on it.

[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.400]
What are you looking at the wrong one?

[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.200]
This is the one.

[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:08.940]
Oh, ran.

[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:09.940]
I'm not going anywhere.

[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:10.820]
It's not. Look at that.

[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.520]
Look, see what I'm talking about.

[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.040]
This is what it is.

[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:13.380]
It's a panic.

[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.620]
Crank that thing up.

[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.660]
Let somebody hear this goddamn station.

[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.120]
Well, you know, wonder you don't have any numbers on this station.

[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:24.920]
When you walk into a radio station and you see that the needle is barely moving.

[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:30.120]
How come we got a point five right is lay that needle on the pin, man.

[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.500]
Lay that baby over there, distort the damn thing so that they'll be listening in Jacksonville.

[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.220]
Why do we want people listening in Jacksonville?

[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:37.780]
You're right.

[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.520]
Exactly.

[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.760]
I'll turn it back down again.

[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.660]
I'll turn it all the way off this time.

[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.060]
Let's go to St. Petersburg.

[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.040]
Hi there, St. Petersburg.

[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.100]
You're on the air at the WSUN with a.

[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.460]
Hey, that's what I'm going on.

[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.320]
My gills and lasses are on it now.

[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.880]
I think Fred, Fred, their Bob's famous religious call, a formerly Jacob from F.A.

[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:56.400]
from over there.

[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.320]
Flah, think he's after your bot, man.

[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.500]
What do you mean, formerly Jacob?

[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.100]
What does that mean?

[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.340]
He was one of Bob's old colors on F.A.

[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.100]
His name was Jake.

[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.060]
Oh, no, he's Fred.

[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.880]
Well, if you'd like to know the truth, I thought so too, but Bob's a sure man.

[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.240]
I hope they're in N.P. Richie.

[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.180]
I hope they have big enough shirts to fit over their clasp to me bags tomorrow.

[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.180]
They're a clapped in shirts.

[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.320]
Bill and Fred and Jacob are doing like a little three-way right now as we see.

[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.660]
Do they are a clapped in?

[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:23.760]
Stop!

[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:24.520]
Stop!

[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.540]
Oh, man.

[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.920]
Can I switch to a commercial show?

[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.980]
Oh, funny clothes.

[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:29.920]
They're chillin'.

[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.840]
Hey, Neil.

[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:31.340]
Yeah.

[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.280]
Closing your great-

[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.140]
But laugh at her.

[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.120]
God, man.

[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.860]
Cavitry, will you ever hear of some kind of radio?

[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:37.500]
Sure.

[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.500]
To talk show.

[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.360]
You know, people fall in while he's on the air and make a beat.

[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.320]
What about?

[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.420]
Well, I ain't, Joe.

[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.700]
Whatever happens to bug you, that's what you talk about.

[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.620]
Sometimes he agrees with the caller.

[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.220]
Other times he sets some straight.

[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.000]
Surprise, you never listen, Joe.

[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.980]
Feel three other talk shows around, but for my money he's the best.

[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.000]
Why does he get results?

[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:56.740]
Well, no.

[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.440]
He doesn't do anything except talk.

[00:33:58.860 --> 00:33:59.360]
Well, then.

[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.400]
I guess it just gives you a chance to unload.

[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.280]
You know how it is.

[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.080]
You got a beef.

[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.880]
You tell it to somebody and you feel better.

[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.620]
Bob, God!

[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.700]
This time we go to Newport, Richie.

[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.920]
Who's your problem?

[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.020]
Talk about a self-stroking exercise.

[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:21.280]
We're going to Newport.

[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.660]
Do we have to, how many guessers do we get?

[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.260]
I think you'll be delightfully surprised.

[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.600]
Newport Richie, are you on the air?

[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.680]
What's happening, Big Bob?

[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.200]
You see?

[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.440]
You have different voice in Newport Richie?

[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:33.860]
That's right.

[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.140]
You're making progress, man.

[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:35.720]
Under 100.

[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.420]
And he's under 100.

[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:37.980]
He's bright.

[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:38.960]
He's a live.

[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.720]
He's articulate.

[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.420]
Articulant, intelligent.

[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:42.920]
The last time I have something coming.

[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:43.740]
What's that?

[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.000]
Former WFM.

[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.000]

[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.000]

[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.000]

[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.000]

[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.020]
Both former WFM.

[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:47.660]
Did you work there?

[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.000]
Pretty much as of last week.

[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.120]
As of last week.

[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.460]
I just started now.

[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.520]
I worked there, bought up a couple of times.

[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.800]
I don't want to talk too much.

[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.320]
So that's one finished business there.

[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.620]
We know he's one of your most loyal listeners.

[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.140]
Yeah.

[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.860]
Well, when will you're on finish business this week?

[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.000]
You would want to offend him.

[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:04.220]
No.

[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.880]
I don't know, but I know he's listening.

[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.500]
He spends more time listening to the orc show than he does concentrate on his shows.

[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.040]
Well, he likes good radio.

[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.080]
That's why he listens over here.

[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.920]
He would know good radio if one slid up his ass.

[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.460]
He was.

[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.760]
He listens to the station.

[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.220]
Now, he just does monitoring so we can write letters to arbitrage.

[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.860]
When they said, die, we again.

[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:24.780]
They said it.

[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.380]
That is true.

[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.800]
It's out of his freaking mind.

[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:28.980]
We hold a hold on there.

[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.060]
One where your business is.

[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.660]
If any up there, I mean, you know, when will you be a business?

[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.100]
He's a proglody.

[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:32.980]
You're a good.

[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:33.120]
You're a good.

[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.200]
I'm probably David Paul's illegitimate brother.

[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.540]
Has the last check cleared?

[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.320]
Oh, yes.

[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.180]
Okay.

[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.460]
So you don't have any unfinished business.

[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.480]
This mess, spill your guts.

[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.520]
What's going on over there?

[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.220]
Well, I have nothing.

[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.140]
Nothing.

[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.560]
There will be nothing said about you on the radio.

[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.200]
Well, I know that's what we know that.

[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.180]
How about off the radio and the halls?

[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.440]
Oh, off the radio.

[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.320]
There's everyone listening to you.

[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:56.360]
Everyone.

[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:57.180]

[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.980]
Oh, man, it's great.

[00:35:59.320 --> 00:35:59.780]
I have time.

[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:04.720]
We've had people try and call the show and then, you know, get curse words on.

[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.080]
Oh, you're kidding.

[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:06.340]
Huh?

[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.540]
Well, Lionel called one day.

[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.180]
Did you really?

[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:09.940]
Yes, he did.

[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.460]
I'm serious, too.

[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.500]
But then Lionel is just a chronic caller.

[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.620]
All he ever was was a caller.

[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.560]
It's always still his.

[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.620]
Oh, I tell you he's starting.

[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.560]
Yeah, well, you know, Lionel and I, God, man, I feel so bad.

[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.540]
Lionel and I have a lot in common, you know?

[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.380]
I always wanted to be a lawyer.

[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.060]
He always wanted to be a talk show host.

[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.360]
And neither of us ever got our dream.

[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.720]
Well, I just wanted to say, did you guys, when we're working for you someday, man?

[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.280]
Big Bob.

[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.960]
Hey, well, you know, come on over.

[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:37.320]
Yeah.

[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.000]
Well, thanks a lot.

[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:39.920]
I'll catch you guys tomorrow.

[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.480]
I'll catch you guys tomorrow, peaches.

[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:40.940]
Okay.

[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.400]
Congratulations for getting out.

[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.740]
Hey, be sure to tell us who you are.

[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.160]
Huh?

[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.500]
Be sure to tell me who you are.

[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.580]
I don't care what the situation is.

[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.360]
There'll be a lot of other radio people there, too.

[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.700]
So be sure to tell us, okay?

[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:51.340]
All right.

[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:51.720]
Okay.

[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.340]
Thank you.

[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.720]
Oh, seriously, when we did the thing at the Clearwater Mall, like days afterward, I was told through the

[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.700]
rape find that every person who works in radio and some who are on the outside looking in,

[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.760]
we're at that thing.

[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:04.640]
Check it out.

[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.020]
They did.

[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.320]
It was an incredible gathering.

[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.260]
We have an employed Tampa Bay radio people as well as some employed as well.

[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.000]
But I do get spy reports of your pardoning expression.

[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.720]
I don't use the word spy reports on my show.

[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.000]
You've got to get some nervous talking and saying, is my radio got?

[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.980]
I do get spy reports that, what are you making faces for?

[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.260]
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:23.800]
Let's go.

[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:29.180]
You're pacing as they talk about my show that they talk about my show up and down the halls at WFL.

[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.460]
They probably have a meeting every day.

[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.680]
They just sit down and analyze it.

[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:32.860]
Oh, no, no, no, no.

[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.220]
I mean, they like the show.

[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.680]
Yeah, we're talking about the employees, not of course, man.

[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.340]
Well Todd was telling me at the game last night, which he was paying no attention to.

[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:43.460]
He was telling me that at the newspapers here, and at the, you know, at the TV stations,

[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.940]
and then he was departments, everybody who works in TV news here, listen to this station.

[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.340]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.040]
But how come they won't talk about it?

[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.580]
How come the goddamn Tampa Tribune is given a song of a dance about Ron and Ron who aren't even on the air anymore?

[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.080]
And Mason Dixon with his cornpone finger up his butt.

[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.180]
Here you come up, you come up, you're an idiot, it's an idiot.

[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:01.860]
Exactly.

[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.960]
So the entire, you know, not our audience, the audience, the audience that reads the Tampa Tribune,

[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.540]
that eats at checkers and up chucks at the Olive Garden.

[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.960]
Well, last, that are on News Talk Radio 620, WSUN.

[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.700]
Let's go to New York, which is where we're right.

[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.600]
Well, no, it's very believable. New York, higher on the air, WSUN.

[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.280]
There were no tacos, no meal.

[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.920]
Who told you he had widespread appeal?

[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.020]
I didn't mean that I young cut and started to hurt.

[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.520]
That couldn't leave and come.

[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.380]
Oh, feel.

[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:32.240]

[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.000]
I love it.

[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:37.000]
Was that Bell V to call it in from the house?

[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.940]
I don't think so, his voice isn't that deep.

[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.780]
How about saying, Petersburg, either, St. John, or the air, WSUN?

[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.420]
Hey, the bad dog, how you doing?

[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.700]
Oh, they're pretty good, thank you, self.

[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:46.620]
Pretty good.

[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.880]
Hello, Nioh.

[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:48.140]
No.

[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.120]
No guiding light for today.

[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.280]
No, over to money, basketball.

[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.640]
This is, this is, uh, what are your favorite colors, chronic?

[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.100]
Chronic, uh, Rose, Jr.

[00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:58.840]
Yeah, hi.

[00:38:59.040 --> 00:38:59.240]
Yeah.

[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.860]
The glad you had me, oh God.

[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.880]
Glad you had a safe trip up.

[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:04.900]
I thought you were flying.

[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.780]
Wow, look at this.

[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.700]
We got food.

[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.080]
See, all I got into was coming here.

[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.060]
I tracked it like a magnet, Rose, Jr.

[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.240]
Oh, there's plenty of stuff up and down for a street.

[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:15.780]
Yeah.

[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.360]
So, I've amazed you got up there safely.

[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.580]
You must have done 120 miles now.

[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.980]
No, no, no, it did not.

[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.700]
It's a matter of fact that we've made it in four hours

[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.020]
and it would have been less than that except when you're coming up 75

[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.400]
and you get around four miles.

[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:27.780]
Yeah.

[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.400]
God, are those people old and slow and those picking men?

[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.340]
Oh, man.

[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:33.860]
That.

[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.420]
They're, it's like a convoy.

[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.600]
They're like in all three lanes and they're like all going about 45, 48 miles an hour

[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.980]
and everybody's just tearing it here.

[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.920]
I'm trying to get around them.

[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.320]
It's impossible and impossible.

[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:47.400]
I wanted to tell you that my sister is down from Boston, my step sister,

[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.700]
and she, she listened to the whole show from beginning to end.

[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.600]
I mean, from the last year right through to Randy loves you all.

[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.000]
Right.

[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.620]
And she's a total hockey maven and she ought to be because she's the daughter of the late Walter Brown.

[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.060]
So, I just want to say hello.

[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.200]
She's too nervous to call.

[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:04.840]
Say hello to you.

[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.020]
Well, let's say hello to her.

[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:06.540]
Okay.

[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:07.120]
Hello her.

[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.880]
Her name is Marge.

[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:09.580]
Time Marge.

[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.320]
Okay, take anything.

[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.240]
Have a great day.

[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:11.360]

[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:11.440]

[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:11.760]
Have a great day.

[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:12.460]
Okay.

[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.020]
Bye.

[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.380]
Bye.

[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:14.460]
Oh, great.

[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.280]
Now we can enter inventory of the food here.

[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.400]
Do we have anything to drink?

[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.320]
Like sodas, like diet sodas.

[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.220]
How come last night so?

[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.500]
How come last night at the game when Todd said to you,

[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.520]
anybody want a soda and you said, I'll have a coke and then he said, like, diet or regularly said,

[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.180]
regular is my diabetic friend.

[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.120]
Are you eating sugar?

[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:33.320]
I'm eating sugar.

[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:34.880]
Just what I asked.

[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.880]
I occasionally asked.

[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.220]
I can't.

[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.880]
Well, a diabetic was eating sugar.

[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.500]
Now, if I admitted to you that I had M&M's at the hotel in the mini bar last night,

[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.140]
you'd be upset.

[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.700]
I mean, how come all of a sudden you're so concerned about my health?

[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.200]
I'm not.

[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.420]
I didn't think so.

[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.300]
What is that?

[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.520]
What is in it?

[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.340]
I don't know here.

[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.460]
Let me pass it over.

[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.500]
Can we take a puke at that?

[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.440]
Now, is this the stuff from the deli?

[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.320]
Oh, that's your omelette blob?

[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.020]
Look at the size of that thing.

[00:40:59.200 --> 00:40:59.440]
That is.

[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.320]
That's your omelette.

[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.200]
I can't eat all of that.

[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.020]
Why you don't have to eat all of this?

[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.100]
This is from Schwarze's deli and restaurant.

[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.720]
Judy and Michael Schwarze at 1706 out of the El Mabry in Tampa.

[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.680]
Kosher and Codd.

[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.260]
And Catering and Jewish and Fragoyam and Ferrella.

[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.700]
I think you almost all of their own baking.

[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.620]
This stuff is phenomenal.

[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:16.600]
It's great.

[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.220]
Do they advertise at WSUN?

[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:18.640]
Not yet.

[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.280]
Well, why not?

[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:20.840]
Let's go.

[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.280]
I have got to wake up this place, man.

[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.280]
I might have to take a month off and stay over here and wake these people up and get this

[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.360]
into a real radio station.

[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.240]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.480]
I hear them down there at the end of the hall with their goddamn neodymium records.

[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.920]
Who the hell wants to hear that crap?

[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.160]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:35.380]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.380]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.480]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.300]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:39.300]

[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:39.640]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:39.640]

[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.640]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.760]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.440]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.960]
I'm on top of the school.

[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.360]
Oh, geez.

[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.220]
St. Petersburg, how you're on the air?

[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.440]
Good morning.

[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.360]
Good morning, St.

[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:59.700]
No, I wanted to start off by thanking you, Robert, for introducing me to Mr. Robert Engersall.

[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.920]
Oh, yeah, Engersall, okay, sure.

[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.680]
You're in the men's, the Messiah.

[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:04.500]
Who's that?

[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.240]
Some kind of communist?

[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.660]
Robert Engersall?

[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.320]
You don't know who he is?

[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.940]
Yes, yes, yes.

[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.320]
You would have known when you were good.

[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:11.040]
Really?

[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.180]
Never went that, Robert.

[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.660]
Reminal, do we have a fork or weed just with our fingers?

[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.020]
Here's your stuff.

[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.060]
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.100]
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.700]
What is a meal, Roberts?

[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.900]
What is a meal, Roberts?

[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:23.460]
Yeah.

[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.200]
I don't know.

[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.160]
Right after 10 o'clock, you go off?

[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:27.760]
Yeah.

[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.240]
I hear a static on my radio.

[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:29.620]
Yeah.

[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.700]
And then two of you have picked up.

[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:33.880]
Just kidding up on the eye.

[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:34.840]
Listen to you, come on.

[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.660]
He does not have a smile on his face.

[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:37.240]
I know.

[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.320]
I'm busy in checking out the food.

[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.160]
Okay, these guys okay with me.

[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.240]
I'm just saying anything you want.

[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.180]
I'm checking the food out.

[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.880]
Okay, well, look at that beautiful bread.

[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.000]

[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.000]

[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.000]

[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.000]

[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.240]
If you ever said that's one of those mixed rye and pumpernicolette is incredible.

[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.100]
Okay, I'm going in my call.

[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.500]
Yes, I think.

[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.020]
All right.

[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.320]
My king.

[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.600]
Oh, God.

[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.320]
Thank you.

[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.020]
Thank you, sir.

[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:58.820]
Okay, come down.

[00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.600]
Oh, God.

[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:00.720]
Get a great call.

[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:01.300]
Oh, God.

[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.760]
I'll do that later when I get home.

[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:03.880]
Let's go to Sethner.

[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.700]
I said if you're on your WSU end.

[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:07.520]
Neel?

[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:08.640]
Uh-huh.

[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:09.700]
Oh, Neel.

[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.480]
Just a hug.

[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.460]
Robbing, talking to you.

[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.040]
Oh, bed.

[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.000]
I don't even vibrating, too.

[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:15.820]
Yeah.

[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.840]
I might even be shirrating.

[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.440]
Don't wear your batteries out.

[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.720]
Oh, Neel.

[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:21.580]
God.

[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.660]
Damn, could you people talk longer?

[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.600]
You know, we're trying to eat.

[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:26.920]
Exactly.

[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.300]
We're trying to get the damn food organized and we got a bunch of short ones on the phone.

[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:30.800]
Okay.

[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.580]
Oh, I can't put a long winded one on if they don't come any shorter than that one.

[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:35.100]
Look.

[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.500]
So that we can eat just what a beautiful object.

[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.880]
It's got like all kinds of good vegetables and stuff in it.

[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:41.220]
I know.

[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.420]
And my omelette's getting cold.

[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.260]
So, you know, do we even have a few things?

[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.200]
I'm going to put one on the whole bottle.

[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.480]
We even have a little bit of wine.

[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.380]
Talk on the phone.

[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.740]
Well, we've got to, uh, let's go to, uh, uh, the celebrity line here.

[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:52.560]
Hello, Rose.

[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:53.820]
Hello, my darling.

[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.180]
Just keep talking, honey.

[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.940]
Is this the Rose?

[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:57.700]
Yeah.

[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.240]
And you talked to this bitch?

[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.260]
Hey, asshole.

[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:00.880]
Yeah.

[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.120]
You're a real asshole.

[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.240]
I'm no chronic Neel.

[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.680]
So then what do you call me an asshole for?

[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.700]
Because kind of a greeting is that.

[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.100]
You think calling me a chronic, that's not a good thing.

[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.500]
You're disgusting, filthy bitch.

[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.640]
What kind of a greeting is that?

[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.540]
I come over here in the first word out of your ugly,

[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.320]
a post-drilled mouth is asshole.

[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.760]
Look, you've been calling me a chronic.

[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.560]
God, are you a slut?

[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.200]
Are you been calling me a chronic?

[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:19.660]
And that's not true.

[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:20.680]
I don't even know who you are.

[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.440]
I hear your show, Neel, because I like your show.

[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.580]
So why can't you listen?

[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.760]
Why do you have to call?

[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:29.000]
You tell everybody I'm a chronic, and that's not true.

[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.600]
I just stand out because I'm good.

[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.020]
Yeah, you stand out, huh?

[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.380]
Yeah, I'm a good caller, Neel.

[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.500]
I'm a good caller, Neel.

[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.480]
Stand out on this side.

[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.180]
And that bitch that called a while ago that chronic.

[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.600]
Everybody to you is a bitch and asshole.

[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.760]
Why don't you clean up your act?

[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.240]
Gargolot your thing with corn.

[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:43.960]
From you.

[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.240]
Yes, right.

[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.040]
Clean up your callostomy bag, honey.

[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:47.520]
I'm not in a lot of room.

[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.440]
You have a lot of room to talk to bitch.

[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:50.400]
Whoa.

[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.300]
Anyway, listen.

[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:52.920]
Hey, what's up?

[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:53.140]
Hey, what's up?

[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:53.200]

[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:53.660]
Yes, Rose?

[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.000]
You're a lot better than Neel, all right?

[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:57.420]
Yeah, you know what?

[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:58.920]
I find very amusing, Rose.

[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.020]
My chronic suck-around bitch.

[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.900]
What I find most amusing is that you're about the third one.

[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.640]
Well, you know about you're the best or kneel the best.

[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.180]
Why can't you people listen to the radio?

[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.520]
And it's always trying to pit this one against the other one, okay?

[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.160]
If you like Bob, listen to Bob.

[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.400]
If you like me, listen and don't ever call it.

[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.980]
And that's yours for the whole audience.

[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.680]
Well, you're really the way it goes.

[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.040]
This is your number one and we're concerned that number two and Neel's number three.

[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.400]
And Randy is a bitch.

[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.720]
Just to listen and cut the crap, okay?

[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.140]
And for this, you get up in the middle of the night.

[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.040]
It's true, honey.

[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.780]
9.48 the time.

[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.020]
Let's see your last-order on NewsTalk Radio.

[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.280]
6.20 WSUN.

[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:38.260]
Great food.

[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.000]
Okay, let's wrap it up a couple more quick calls so I can get out of here and go home and go.

[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.400]
I'm going to, by the way.

[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.060]
Okay, great.

[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:44.560]

[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:44.620]
I'm sorry.

[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:45.640]
I can't hear us.

[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:46.680]
I'm afraid to love to see you.

[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.920]
What do we have here?

[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:49.900]
Oh my God.

[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:50.860]
Guess who just walked in.

[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.060]
Guess who just walked in.

[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:52.980]
I'll be so happy.

[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.700]
Um, now you can't see him from there.

[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.340]
Jacksonville, hi there, Jackson.

[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.000]
You're on the air.

[00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:58.940]
Madduck.

[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.340]
Hey, how you doing, man?

[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.060]
Look who's there.

[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.140]
What the hell is that?

[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:02.820]
Get a tanker.

[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.060]
Jacksonville, listen and four.

[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:04.640]
Neel.

[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.240]
What?

[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.840]
You don't want Jacksonville, listen and to the street.

[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.320]
He loves Jacksonville, sir.

[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:10.020]
You have?

[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:10.680]
That was me.

[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.320]
That said he don't want Jacksonville.

[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.960]
Oh, you got it all wrong.

[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.220]
God, that's what I heard.

[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:18.820]
The only difference between Jacksonville tamping Miami is the number of assholes per square

[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:19.060]
it.

[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:19.580]
Exactly.

[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:20.600]
Spread out up.

[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.500]
The number of square inches.

[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.040]
God, I went down and I came up here from Clearwater.

[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.720]
And I had a dog named Bubba.

[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.440]
But you moved from Clearwater to Jacksonville?

[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.360]
Yeah, I got a promotion.

[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:32.600]
Actually, I live in a small town.

[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.920]
How could you possibly get a promotion?

[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.360]
I mean, I know the Clearwater is a prize winner, man.

[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.740]
But how could you possibly get a promotion?

[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.460]
It would take you from Clearwater to Jacksonville.

[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:43.020]
Well, actually, it's a smaller town than Jacksonville, about side of Jacksonville, and it's

[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.220]
down to about 1,000 people.

[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:44.940]
No, wait a minute.

[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.300]
Are you the guy that called before?

[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.020]
No.

[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:47.720]
Huh?

[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:48.480]
No, no, no.

[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.680]
You are talking to this gentleman that came in here that brought us all this crap.

[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.280]
Are you the guy that called the city we're coming in?

[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.240]
From Jacky?

[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:54.360]

[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.100]
He gave him the, uh, good to see you, by the way.

[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.920]
Oh, good to see you, but I think of this guy.

[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:58.520]
No, not you.

[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.120]
This guy that came in here brought us a, uh, pornographic catalog and a bunch of stuff in

[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.860]
the bunch of M&M.

[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.380]
So we just gave him a pornographic album.

[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:05.780]
Right.

[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:07.320]
Anyway, Bob, I believe you.

[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.380]
I believe when you were on Plata, I can't believe you're back.

[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.920]
No, I can't believe them back either.

[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.180]
So maybe you're doing a great job with the schmoo.

[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.300]
He is doing a great job.

[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.720]
You want to know something?

[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.020]
He's a monster in a business, sir.

[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.420]
I don't like sports talk.

[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.080]
But you do a good job.

[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.440]
I do a damn good job.

[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.080]
You make it happen.

[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.040]
How about those leaves, huh?

[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.460]
How about them, leave?

[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.040]
They did it.

[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.040]
They kicked some ass.

[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.020]
Well, I'm a, I'm a penguin spin.

[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.800]
Um, that one I side to, by the way, okay?

[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:31.940]
No, it didn't come in the five.

[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.040]
In fact, well, keep up the good work.

[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:34.660]
I'm a cop.

[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:35.680]
Okay, here you're side, back.

[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.980]
Have a great day.

[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.520]
Yeah, I just took the M&M away from me.

[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:38.760]
See ya.

[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:39.560]
Diabetic, I mean.

[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.620]
Would you take care of the calls and stuff with a damn food here?

[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.180]
It's a video show, not a goddamn restaurant, Lanceter.

[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.960]
Land, oh, lakes, either land.

[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:47.680]
You're on the air, WSUN.

[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.080]
Or land.

[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.200]
Let's go.

[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:51.960]
Go on.

[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.260]
Huh, hell with him.

[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:54.540]
Didn't want to talk to him anyway.

[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.440]
Most people in land, lakes are bizarre.

[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:57.440]
Let's go to Tampa.

[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.120]
Hi there, Tampa.

[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.340]
You're on the air, WSUN.

[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.320]
Hey, Bob, I talked to Neil the other day.

[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.060]
He played a card for me.

[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.200]
I offered him dinner when he was up here at Donatello.

[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:06.600]
Yeah?

[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.600]
If he played Chesterfield, Queen for me.

[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:09.240]
And I did.

[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.180]
Yes, sir, and I was just inviting you.

[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.680]
We're going to night and tomorrow night.

[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:14.420]
No, jeez, that's too bad we can't go there tonight.

[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.460]
Well, we'll be there tonight.

[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.820]
So you just left by and took up the check for all of us, okay?

[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:18.700]
I don't work.

[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.040]
There'll be about 20, 30 of us.

[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.580]
All right, and we're going for my vice president's birthday.

[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:24.380]
I've got to say happy birthday to him.

[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.060]
Happy birthday, Pete.

[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.320]
Happy birthday, Pete.

[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.800]
And I did not bring that card, but that's...

[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:32.300]
We don't have to.

[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:32.960]
Because it's...

[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.580]
Because you're not a nice guy, that's why.

[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.680]
Anyway, next time you get a little bit of free time, Neil, and you're up by...

[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.020]
And Bob, I'll take you to...

[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:40.300]
Okay.

[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:41.000]
Okay.

[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:41.880]
No problem, thanks.

[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:43.020]

[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:44.880]
Who else going to Donatello's tonight?

[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:45.300]
You.

[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.240]
You're a lovely wife.

[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:47.660]
Right.

[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.360]
Um, allegedly Curt and Susie, but I'm sure they'll come up with some other excuse tonight.

[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.640]
I thought he was going to the basketball fair.

[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:54.580]
That was last night.

[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.060]
What's he at night, Curt?

[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.080]
I always got a hand in the middle.

[00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:58.680]
Nobody in there.

[00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.660]
Is that a solid?

[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.500]
And Bob's running on its own.

[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.080]
Bob Neil.

[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:02.960]
Oh, other Peter?

[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:03.720]
How are you, Peter?

[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.040]
Bob Neil.

[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.020]
And Bob Neil, that's it.

[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.320]
Dad, as far as I know.

[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.640]
Okay, so I just don't take.

[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.380]
And of course, Guido.

[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:13.480]
Hello, B.

[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.380]
Try the revolver on the RWSC line.

[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.820]
Good morning, Mr. Lasseter.

[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.940]
Good morning, there, Apollo.

[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:20.300]
Uh, I'm going to Pete's tomorrow.

[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.420]
And of course, I know what you look like after seeing you get beat up by that lady rascal.

[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:29.680]
So I know I'll see you, but I have no idea what Mr. Rogers looks like.

[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.480]
Uh, Mr. Rogers.

[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:32.340]
Hi, he'll choose and dresser.

[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.240]
You'll be wearing it well.

[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.200]
Mr. Rogers doesn't know anything about the lady rascal.

[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.040]
I'll be wearing a lace slip, as a matter of fact, it'll be lovely.

[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.220]
What color dress and the shi-hi-yo shoes are you wearing?

[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.500]
In fact, maybe we'll give you the slip.

[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:43.980]
How's that?

[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.440]
I'll be there.

[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.180]
Okay, great.

[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:46.940]
Give me the slip.

[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.060]
Okay, bring your white hood, too, with you, okay?

[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.780]
Let's go to a pom-armor.

[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.260]
Hi, there, pom.

[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.700]
You're on the RWSC end.

[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:54.460]
Hey, good morning.

[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.720]
Good morning, pom.

[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.580]
Are you still living in this 6th, 10th slot, huh?

[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.660]
You haven't been admitted to this side yet.

[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:01.740]
Man, I love this.

[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.600]
I really, truly like the hours.

[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:04.680]
Come on in, bird.

[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:05.780]
Oh, man.

[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.240]
Well, you know, it used to be the ratings for very important to you.

[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.560]
Oh, it still are.

[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:17.680]
But you would own this whole market if you were on after some of us with brains woke up in the morning.

[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.640]
Well, I'm just saving off of the stolen owned market.

[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.360]
You see, this is the most prestigious time.

[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.820]
If I can make this big fly, I'm going to earn so much.

[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:36.720]
I'm going to earn so much.

[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:36.920]

[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:12.620]

[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:12.620]

[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:12.620]

[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.180]
I'm going to earn so much.

[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.040]
I'm going to earn so much.

[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:14.480]

I'm going to earn so much.

[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:41.700]

[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:52.820]
I'm going to earn so much.

[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.620]
I'm going to earn so much.

[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:57.480]
I'm going to earn so much.

[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:57.680]
I'm going to earn so much.

[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.460]
I thought I was bad when the food came in.

[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:00.540]

[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.480]
But you're like it's just total disinterest.

[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:02.760]

[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:02.760]

[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:02.800]
But you're like it's just total disinterest.

[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.120]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.560]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:04.840]

[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:05.960]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.120]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.280]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.560]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.460]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:17.720]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.980]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:26.100]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.660]
Like we got to hit the board over here.

[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.800]
He's in Thursdays from Michael who's a dandy's in now.

[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.720]
He's in now with a great deli at 1706 Southdale, Nebri.

[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.700]
Well, Kurt has told up a message in here for you.

[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:36.460]
He said eat this.

[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:45.900]
People to see things.

[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.960]
We haven't had one report this morning.

[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:52.700]
Not one miserable little report this morning on Kurt Skig at Blueberry Hill.

[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.360]
I mean, I get all the promotion yesterday.

[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.120]
All the begging, the pleading, and things.

[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.360]
Marvin and Wendy went out there and know that.

[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:03.020]
So that's two more than they would have had.

[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:04.400]
That's probably like a half a dozen.

[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:05.580]
TJ, how about you?

[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.140]
Did you go there after the FLA thing?

[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:07.920]
How do you come on?

[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:08.740]
Let's go, people.

[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.480]
Oh, I get into my hotel room last night.

[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.400]
I turn on the TV.

[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.760]
It happens to be on 44 on TOG.

[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.000]
And what's on the news?

[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:16.740]
What?

[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:19.040]
The FLA thing.

[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.040]
That's news.

[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.860]
That's a news story.

[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.680]
And there's Lionel talking about,

[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.360]
how we like to press the flush without the stairs and get their input.

[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:28.180]
Well, he does.

[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.500]
You know, he passes out his business card, that way.

[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.480]
It comes to find out the only people that showed up there

[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.840]
were the ones who were there to see Bruce Williams.

[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:34.600]
Really?

[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.420]
Yeah, and it wasn't even on Tuesday.

[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.240]
Probably not.

[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.740]
But all this 576 WS U.N.

[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.420]
Alacitor on AM620 WS U.N.

[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:44.440]
It's in the treasure of the, uh, I was a deep card.

[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.160]
Was that Rose?

[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.240]
By the way, was that specifically for that bitch?

[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.260]
What, you just played?

[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:50.900]
I, uh...

[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:51.940]
Why don't you just get rid of her?

[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:53.960]
That would be a side of real time.

[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.180]
You're a party member call.

[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.260]
Oh, get out of here.

[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.080]
I've been here for what?

[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.140]
This is the fourth day.

[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.440]
We're just starting the party.

[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:00.400]
You know, I think she's got a thing for you.

[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.220]
You know, calls and the thing on tape.

[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.200]
She's like, uh... a co-host.

[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.480]
Oh, that just came work-a-host here in the morning.

[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.260]
I just came here to the studio.

[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:07.840]
I just came here to the studio.

[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.520]
That came into the studio less than five minutes before one on the air.

[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.660]
I'd never played that before.

[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.540]
It used to be on part of a promo with that promo,

[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.680]
I was in one for a couple of months.

[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:15.780]
Here.

[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:18.280]
I think she just has a thing for you, man.

[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.380]
Let's go to Tampa.

[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:19.880]
I'd Tampa.

[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.200]
You're on the air, WSUM.

[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.920]
Hello, Mr. Alster, Mr. Roger.

[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.220]
Hey, Mr. Serba.

[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:25.040]
Welcome to Tampa.

[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.380]
Thank you so much.

[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:29.760]
Oh, I thought that was the end of the call.

[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:30.360]
Oh, no.

[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:31.660]
I wouldn't hang up on you.

[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.120]
Oh, OK.

[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.460]
Yeah, I just want to say, I just...

[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.960]
I just tuned in you guys a couple of weeks ago

[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.240]
and it's much more...

[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.560]
Much refreshing from FLA.

[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:39.940]
That's right, sir.

[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:40.700]
Right there, fresh here.

[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.240]
So what do you have, FLA?

[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:42.560]
Yeah, like...

[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.040]
I'll take some.

[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:46.300]
Like, I'm really going to pay ten bucks to see those guys.

[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.460]
Yeah, or even nine dollars and seventy cents.

[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:49.480]
Or to go see them.

[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:49.880]
Yeah.

[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.100]
Not awesome.

[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.400]
I would have paid ten bucks to see them.

[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.720]
I would have gone except I was afraid they'd throw me out.

[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.440]
Oh, well, I think just...

[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:56.700]
I don't know.

[00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.880]
They'd do too much stick, you know, like old box, doing stuff like that.

[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.220]
That's right.

[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.280]
We don't do stick here, man.

[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.780]
Oh, Ms. Alster, I want to thank you for the tape.

[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:04.640]
You're in a little letter.

[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.200]
Oh, you're quite welcome.

[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:06.420]

[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.820]
I took it to the mailbox personally myself

[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.180]
and filled out the envelope and everything.

[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:12.080]
Yeah, I appreciate it.

[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:12.700]
Well, you're welcome.

[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:17.640]
And Neil, to tell you the truth, I do catch your show more

[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.500]
than Bob's just because I get up later.

[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.960]
But it's nice that both you guys are on the air,

[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.420]
because you sound like you have a good rapport together.

[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:24.860]
The best.

[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:25.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.420]
You know, people say, well, you're just a little bitch.

[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.160]
You're tripping you.

[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.100]
That's nonsense, you guys.

[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.600]
You've got good times, a lot that I want.

[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.460]
You guys are doing, you know, I mean,

[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.820]
you guys compliment each other, you know.

[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.140]
But what one doesn't pick up on the other does.

[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.320]
Exactly. That's right.

[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.760]
Whatever he doesn't pick up, I do.

[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.260]
Let's go to St. Petersburg, St. John the Air,

[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.240]
WSOK, and I'll have whoever the hell you are.

[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:44.760]
Yeah.

[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:45.340]
Hi, Bob.

[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:46.720]
Hey, how you doing, St.?

[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.340]
OK, Neil, how are you this morning?

[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:48.940]
OK, sir.

[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.600]
Listen, I don't normally call the complain.

[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:52.320]
Yeah.

[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:59.060]
But yesterday, I was invited by Tom Zolvita,

[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.820]
to the doghouse for lunch and to meet Randy Rhodes.

[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:03.320]
Right.

[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.800]
You know, I hear you guys rip on him a lot,

[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.700]
and I've always felt that maybe there was a little bit on just.

[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.360]
Until yesterday.

[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:17.160]
Sir, it's only because we're afraid of our jobs that, you know,

[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.720]
we're as kind to him as we are.

[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.540]
Well, it's an absolute tyrant.

[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.040]
Well, I sympathize with you because of yesterday's experience.

[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.180]
But one second, here he is.

[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.900]
Hey, Tom, there's a guy on the phone that says he saw you at the doghouse yesterday.

[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:31.940]
Do you know what he said about you?

[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:32.860]
I was a geek.

[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:33.520]
That's right.

[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.600]
Well, here's what happened.

[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:36.780]
I'm about to make it brief.

[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.940]
Ian, if I can be there, comes to my table while I'm having lunch.

[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:41.420]
Yeah.

[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.900]
Bring the pot over.

[00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:45.820]
Introduce this talk.

[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.020]
Oh, Todd was there, too?

[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.160]
That Todd was there.

[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:50.560]
God, you must have come back into town for that, yo.

[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:55.320]
Then he proceeds to spill my entire lunch on my lap.

[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:56.980]
Are you serious?

[00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:57.720]
I'm serious.

[00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:58.620]
Is a geek.

[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:03.460]
Todd goes to get a rag or something to wipe it up.

[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:03.960]
Yeah.

[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.060]
And Tom, well, to that Todd is gone.

[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.420]
So you have to forgive him.

[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:09.940]
He's a little manager.

[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.700]
He has to please forgive my general manager for doing that.

[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.420]
He's very clumsy.

[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.940]
And I saw what happened.

[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:17.180]
It wasn't Todd.

[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:17.840]
It was Todd.

[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:18.760]
It was dope, the food.

[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:19.820]
Unbelievable.

[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:20.920]
He blamed Todd.

[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.200]
Was the zipper up or down?

[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:22.760]
Huh?

[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.480]
Was the zipper up or down at the time?

[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.660]
Because I understand he had a zipper problem, yes, though.

[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.240]
Well, you know, at least the seats would say, well, let me buy you a lap dance.

[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:30.660]
Yeah.

[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:33.160]
To buy you a lap dance?

[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:33.640]
Yeah.

[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.320]
I got food all over my lap.

[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:35.960]
Uh-huh.

[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.400]
You know, and I said, uh-

[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:38.440]
Well, it wasn't a lap dance.

[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.760]
It was a lap meal, how's that?

[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:44.140]
Well, you see, if you had all that food all over your lap as it was, then there's a thing.

[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.340]
Sometimes the lap meals and all that bad, you know.

[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:46.460]
Unbelievable.

[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.360]
Unbelievable, indeed.

[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:52.020]
Joining us in the studio today, of course, is the bird meal.

[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.320]
Rogers is here and we're just about finished with this turkey.

[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:57.780]
Let's go to, um...

[00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:58.620]
We're not sure where.

[00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.160]
Hi there.

[00:57:59.320 --> 00:57:59.940]
We're not sure.

[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.200]
Am I on a beer?

[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:02.240]
No, you're not.

[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:05.760]
This time, it is a West Kong Beach.

[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.020]
No, it wasn't Rose.

[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:08.960]
God, you got Rose on the brain, man.

[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.200]
Yeah, everybody, the sounds to you like Rose.

[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.040]
Jesus.

[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:16.560]
Oh, line one river to hell, that may be West Palm Beach.

[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.200]
Yeah, right.

[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.680]
Hi, Bob.

[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:19.500]
Hi.

[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:20.920]
This is Martha.

[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:22.080]
This is Bob.

[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.820]
Oh, if it is this time to clear water on a cell phone, I clear you're on the RWS you're in.

[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.000]
Hey, Bob, Neil.

[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:29.520]
Gawr.

[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:30.840]
How you doing, guys?

[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:31.960]
Oh, great, man.

[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:32.380]
What do you think?

[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.060]
Michael Jordan broke the silence.

[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:35.660]
Oh, he did.

[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.620]
Just think of, come out and say it ain't nothing but a thing.

[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:40.400]
Oh, isn't that something?

[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:41.200]
Just a hobby.

[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:42.240]
God, I hate dead man.

[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:44.800]
I'm serious.

[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:50.980]
I started to dislike him in Chicago, but he has such an angelic smile.

[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:55.020]
I mean, he just looks like such a nice guy and I know he isn't.

[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.760]
And I don't mind being a son of a bitch.

[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:57.560]
I'm a son of a bitch.

[00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:58.860]
Most of my friends are son of a bitch.

[00:58:58.900 --> 00:58:59.460]
He's all high, Neil.

[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:03.080]
And it's just that when you pretend that you're not what you are,

[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.860]
it just did drives me crazy.

[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.280]
And I like Scottie Pippin anyway.

[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.560]
Hey, man, world's greatest basketball player.

[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:09.700]
Scottie Pippin.

[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:10.960]
Michael Jordan.

[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:11.880]
Ask Scottie Pippin.

[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:13.760]
No, Scottie Pippin's world's best looking guy.

[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:18.100]
Oh, speaking of that, you've got to watch Eastpan.

[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.600]
They're 6'30 to 7 o'clock aerobic show in the morning.

[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.420]
Eastpan.

[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.180]
Eastpan.

[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:23.940]
I'm so sad.

[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.140]
It's something for everybody.

[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:26.080]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.560]
They got three broads for those of us who are into the broads.

[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:28.700]
Eastpan.

[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.580]
How you doing?

[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.660]
You're going to love the male aerobic stance with the best.

[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:31.980]
I'm telling you.

[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:32.440]
You're going to have a big fan deck.

[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.380]
There's one black 2-0.

[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.860]
There's one black 2-0 on the show that's making me think about it.

[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:39.340]
You're going to get a G-span.

[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.480]
Why is he here?

[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.040]
He's trying to help your friends out, Collar.

[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:42.840]
And you see what you get?

[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.000]
A little lower on the fuzzer head.

[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:44.540]
You need help, anybody.

[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:45.720]
He's getting old.

[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:46.760]
It's seen going away.

[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.000]
You like Michael Jordan.

[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.160]
Oh, yes, P-N.

[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:49.980]
One time.

[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.960]
I just got the money.

[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:52.100]

[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.120]
Sure, you can call somebody a douchebag.

[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.500]
I started that back in 1967.

[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.980]
Somebody stole it from you, though.

[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.540]
Who do you want to call a douchebag, sir?

[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:00.920]
Hello.

[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.140]
He's gone.

[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:02.600]
He's here.

[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.680]
That's the new thing.

[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:05.000]
Right?

[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:05.460]

[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:06.600]
Oh, it's an old thing.

[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.120]
It's an old thing.

[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.100]
I think he just picked up over here.

[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:08.780]
Oh, OK.

[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.260]
Let's go back to West Palm Beach.

[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.300]
West Palm Beach.

[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.100]
Other West York.

[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.600]
Hi, Bob.

[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.000]
Oh, it's you again, Martha.

[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.060]
Yes, hi.

[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.440]
You hung up on me.

[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.020]
How come?

[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.120]
It wasn't my idea.

[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:24.800]
Listen to that.

[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.200]
We should need it.

[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.520]
I'm in West Palm Beach.

[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.340]
Mill Rogers made me do it, Martha.

[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.760]
Well, how long have they been in the vise market?

[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:37.040]
He said he would never, ever get me another job

[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.140]
if I put you on the air.

[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.580]
You know if I bet, Neil?

[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.540]
You sum up that vise just a little bit.

[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.700]
He's a fucking scrub, Martha.

[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:44.600]
I'm your jockie.

[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.000]
You're two tight this morning, Rogers.

[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:46.960]
I thought you were a little vise.

[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:47.780]
Oh, boy.

[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:48.580]
Just more shit.

[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:49.940]
She must be on East Palm.

[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.280]
Yes, Martha.

[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.840]
What's your obsession with donuts?

[01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.360]
576 WSN went.

[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.340]
Is the telephone number, where would that be?

[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.400]
In Penelope and Hillbrook.

[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.540]
Maybe it's the boy Martha can relate to that.

[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.280]
Whoa.

[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.120]
You see you come in here?

[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.660]
You insult my great collars.

[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.020]
Here I am.

[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.780]
You're roasting the numbers on the station.

[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.060]
Or we have roast on tape.

[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.280]
We have roast on the phone.

[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.920]
We have roasts on the nose.

[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:19.040]
I'm trying to transfer all of these great listeners and collars

[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:19.580]
to your show.

[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.340]
That's the only reason you really took a big gun.

[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:21.920]
I'm throwing the ball.

[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.860]
Quite frankly, I'm throwing the towel or put it on.

[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:27.520]
But I can't relate to that.

[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:28.200]
Whatever that means.

[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.220]
Miami or Richie or...

[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:30.860]
Is it Richie?

[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:32.200]
Is it Miami?

[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:33.880]
George, but out.

[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.040]
We're having a good time with this.

[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.400]
And you're sticking your...

[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.960]
Well, just do what you're paid for, okay?

[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.240]
In other words, just sit there and stare straight ahead.

[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.740]
You don't even get paid enough to sit there and stare straight ahead.

[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:44.040]

[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:44.300]

[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.100]
Newport Richie?

[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:46.820]
What is that?

[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.020]
Is it Miami or...

[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:48.760]
He doesn't know.

[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.040]
Well, who typed it on there?

[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.720]
Is there a mouse in your pocket or what?

[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:52.540]
Careful.

[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:53.240]
Huh?

[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.200]
Careful.

[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.160]
He's reaching in there to check it out.

[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:56.360]
Yeah.

[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.800]
Okay, let's try Miami.

[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.120]
Hello.

[01:01:58.700 --> 01:01:59.060]
Hello?

[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.920]
Are you in Miami or Ork Richie ork?

[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:01.600]
I'm out of Miami.

[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:02.160]
Okay.

[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:02.780]
Great.

[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.600]
We got a right, Kurt.

[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.040]
Edaboy.

[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.640]
They got a full work in the air in there.

[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:08.380]
Behind where?

[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360]
Whoever's working the phone.

[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:11.580]
That's Marvin.

[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.060]
He said you're right.

[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:13.540]
It's Marvin.

[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.460]
God, this is a mean audience.

[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.520]
Oh, it's not.

[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.380]
Mean audience.

[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:16.780]
Yeah.

[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.320]
I want the whole rest of the state to know that this morning I came on with Blob.

[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.020]
I dragged my ass out of bed at 6.30 in the morning.

[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.580]
I come in here at 7.15 and couldn't get in here until 7.30.

[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:25.760]
7.30 to 1.00.

[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.700]
The first three calls are like, you bastard.

[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:28.760]
You bitch.

[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:29.800]
I was great.

[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.340]
It was beautiful.

[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.120]
It was Blob's own personal audience.

[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:34.440]
And there were all calls were coming from Blob's house too.

[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:34.860]
It was great.

[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.420]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.940]
Don't be intimidated by this crap.

[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.120]
Favorite, favorite, favorite.

[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:40.400]
What do we got here?

[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:42.940]
Neil would show up.

[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.520]
We're ready for the later build back up again.

[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:44.880]
Yeah.

[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.860]
Neil would join WSU and Morning.

[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.120]
Now, what is this?

[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.420]
I mean, what is this on?

[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:51.420]
I mean, what is this from?

[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.440]
Is this from like a poster that we put up on the board?

[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.080]
Oh, it's a little blow up from a press release from Tom Velvita.

[01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.600]
By the way, Field Better Tom.

[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.880]
We sure hope you're feeling better and back within two, three months.

[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.900]
That's what everybody said.

[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.080]
Now, do they?

[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.400]
They said, man, it sure is going around here with Tom.

[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:06.860]
Well, here we are, Tom.

[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:07.580]
It's probably a year.

[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:08.120]
Okay.

[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:15.560]
Neil will join WSU and Morning host, Blob Lasseter, for a personal appearance at Peaches and Tampa Saturday, March 20th.

[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.980]
This will be Lasseter's first appearance since he began doing WSU and 6 to 10 a.m.

[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.400]
Morning show on February 1st.

[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.480]
It says.

[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:23.060]
Yeah.

[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:23.600]
Yeah.

[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.100]
Everyone is invited to come.

[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.080]
Well, I don't want all of this.

[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:28.480]
Okay.

[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:29.620]
We know all of that.

[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.660]
It says then we want to know what in the hell the refreshments are.

[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.580]
That's what we need to know.

[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.180]
Did you write this in here Keith on the bottom?

[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:35.740]
Yes, see.

[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.180]
You're not fooling us.

[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:37.520]
Okay.

[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.080]
I mean, we know your good intentions are good, but you're not fooling anybody.

[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.500]
Like, oh, we got our crap together.

[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:42.380]
Not sweaters.

[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:43.960]
What are these refreshments?

[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.260]
We got our free scratch.

[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:45.680]

[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.380]
You can't get it.

[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.440]
Dead at cans or good food or what?

[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.300]
Oh, it's it.

[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.300]
Yeah, great food.

[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.140]
Don't cover up for him.

[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.620]
What are they doing in there in the other room?

[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.060]
Are they playing grab ass to get in there?

[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.680]
Kurt's playing grab ass with everybody in the other room.

[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.080]
Let's do the show in there.

[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.160]
It says.

[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.620]
Come early for free refreshments provided by cash and carry.

[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.120]
How early and how much?

[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:07.060]
We don't know.

[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.300]
No, we don't.

[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:10.800]
Well, we didn't know.

[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:11.620]
But he won't tell anybody.

[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.100]
I don't care.

[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:12.700]
It says you win.

[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:13.240]
It's not mine.

[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.540]
I didn't call Vel Vita at home.

[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.140]
Maybe Bob Neal will be their addition it out.

[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.900]
And certainly if anybody can do it.

[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:19.440]
Huh.

[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.300]
Huh. You don't know Bob Neal, do you?

[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:21.500]
No.

[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.120]
Oh, man.

[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.980]
So come and see Bob Neal and Bob Neal tomorrow.

[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:26.940]
And just Neal and Bob.

[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:27.700]
He is here.

[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:28.800]
He's here.

[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:29.920]
He's going to join us.

[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.140]
He's going to come in and say to Guido.

[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.160]
Hi, how you doing?

[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.540]
With a finger like right up around here?

[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:34.980]
He.

[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.100]
But of course in Bob Neal's case, he don't have to worry about it.

[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.400]
Because his fingers always like right up around there by the left nostril.

[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.180]
Land it's an atrium.

[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:40.700]
He's from Atlanta.

[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.140]
Funny that's not where you had your finger with your finger.

[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:43.920]
He's the Neal Bortz guy up there in Atlanta.

[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.100]
He's the David Paul guy.

[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.280]
He doesn't want to see me.

[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.240]
Undalabeled.

[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:47.680]
What?

[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:49.800]
Well Mike Disney poisoned his mind.

[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.780]
I'm sure toward me.

[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.560]
He didn't want to see me.

[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.440]
He, uh, I don't think he and Disney are like exactly like this to be honest with me.

[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.000]
Oh, well maybe.

[01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:01.300]
The Disney was shipped and packed back to WCKG in Chicago, which is a desperately dying radio station.

[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.160]
It's a place for him.

[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:02.360]
Yeah.

[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.480]
He'll fit right in there.

[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:03.720]
Yeah.

[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:07.140]
I wonder how Mike celebrated St. Patrick's Day and I wonder how read his noses by now.

[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.840]
It's, uh, 1135 on the IOD network.

[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.620]
You can wake up with Bob Lasseter every week day morning from 6 to 10.

[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:16.320]
On News Talk Radio 620, WSUN.

[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.640]
Hey, uh, what was that lady talking about?

[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.040]
I don't know.

[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.460]
I got to pee.

[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.620]
She, she, she doesn't want to be mixed up with the squirrels and the stuff.

[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.020]
Yeah, I understand.

[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:26.780]
You left out of that.

[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.320]
I'll talk to you in three and a half years.

[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.160]
Oh, another one.

[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:31.780]
Another one.

[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.140]
Yeah.

[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:32.720]
Yeah.

[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.320]
I'll have you on the radio again.

[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.300]
Yeah, so happy.

[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.420]
You know, you waited four miserable weeks to call me.

[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.140]
I know.

[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:40.460]
I found out about it too.

[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.440]
And I was driving down the road.

[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:41.800]
I really should.

[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.220]
That fat man's coming back and I tell you, I got a Woody.

[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.080]
You got a Woody, huh?

[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.000]
Well, good.

[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:48.700]
I'm excited.

[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:49.660]
By the way, what is it?

[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:50.920]
I've seen one of those a long times today.

[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.620]
Is it a Mercury or a, uh, Dissoto Woody?

[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:54.900]
I never mind.

[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:55.460]
Oh, okay.

[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.860]
What is the seaworth anyway?

[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:02.700]
Weekday mornings from 6 to 10, it's Bob Lasseter on News Talk Radio 620, WSUN.

[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.840]
It's the Neil Lager show.

[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:18.680]
You can talk to Neil Live by calling toll free 1-800-944-9463.

[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.580]
Oh, Neil, my queen.

[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:24.780]
Okay, 140.

[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.040]
All right.

[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.420]
Cut the crab at, uh, Dissoto, 140?

[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:28.780]
Yeah.

[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:29.080]
Yeah.

[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.400]
God, this time flies when you're having a good time, doesn't it?

[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.580]
Yeah, really good.

[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:34.320]
We're in Ricken Suds.

[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:40.680]
It's 1140-20 till noon, we're at our palatial WSUN studios on the shores of the, uh, thing

[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.080]
here, man.

[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.060]
Now, you saw, you know before I hit in a rub because it is my show out much.

[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.220]
Uh, you know, I have a, uh, do they call like a Bayview?

[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.960]
Or is that the Bay, Tampa Bay?

[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:51.520]
Yeah, that's Tampa Bay.

[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.520]
Right in behind a hotel.

[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:56.920]
And this morning I get up and I open up the windows and here's the beaches out there.

[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.800]
All I will say, I'm pretty sorry filthy looking beaches.

[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.620]
Oh, don't go on them.

[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:00.200]
What do you mean?

[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:00.880]
Even in the summertime?

[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.820]
Even in the summertime unless you have, you know, rubber boots and gloves on.

[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:04.300]
Why not?

[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:09.560]
A lot of people like to walk up and down the shores of Tampa Bay with all those large green trash bags and collected fish.

[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.380]
No, seriously, what is the problem back there?

[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.420]
Because I thought this is exciting.

[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.020]
I'm on the water here and then I looked at it and looked like mong.

[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.420]
Well, that's, because that's what it is.

[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.820]
Oh, it is mong?

[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.140]
Mong.

[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:24.000]
So if there's anybody in the audience who doesn't know what mong is, just take a drive up to the, uh, thing.

[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.000]
Don't drink it though.

[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:25.900]
Just drive up.

[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:26.500]
Don't go near it.

[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.980]
Okay, let's do, uh, I knew you were about to say something.

[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.220]
I interrupted very rudely for which I don't apologize.

[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.860]
No, you mentioned Rick and Suds.

[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.040]
Yeah.

[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:38.920]
And I was gonna say you saw Suds Wednesday, St. Patrick's Day, when he was allegedly in the bag.

[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:39.980]
Perfectly coherent.

[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:40.560]
He was.

[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.500]
I at least I thought, don't call it in his case.

[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.020]
How do you tell?

[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:43.480]
Exactly.

[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:44.780]
But he looked okay.

[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.080]
Yeah, because he has a blood sugar.

[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.220]
900.

[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:48.620]
What's the, let's test it now.

[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:53.280]
See, you're trying to compare the smoking thing with these M&Ms and during the break, because you...

[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:53.920]
You're a sad only, Aaron.

[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.340]
So I'm gonna go out there and smoke.

[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.220]
I'll show them.

[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:57.980]
When did I say that?

[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:58.660]
Last week.

[01:07:58.740 --> 01:07:59.520]
I don't smoke earlier.

[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:02.020]
I will never smoke another cigar as long as I live.

[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.320]
You know why?

[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:04.320]
No, listen to me.

[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.020]
I smoke it.

[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.340]
Maybe it was because George gave me those nasty ones they...

[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:08.420]
You're a cigarette.

[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.980]
And sliced the end off of the other day and I like got in my tongue and all over my...

[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.940]
Those things irritate the cramp out of your mind.

[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:14.800]
I think they're worse than that.

[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.580]
You know, see how all the little people around here are counting on you.

[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.520]
Every time I step out in the hall, I mean what?

[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:20.220]
I'm me smoking a cigar.

[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.400]
The body comes up to me.

[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.340]
Okay, Peter comes up to me.

[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.840]
No, I'll smoke it if that's what the purpose is.

[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:24.080]
Yeah.

[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:24.760]
Well, what did you do?

[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.440]
Just get a new pack?

[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:26.160]
Yeah.

[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.340]
You want me to change smoke them now?

[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.240]
No, I'm not gonna...

[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.720]
You're not gonna say anything to me.

[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.220]
That's true.

[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:30.880]
Yeah, okay.

[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.380]
They can go to hell.

[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.800]
I'll pull this show off the station factory and you can say douchebag.

[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.100]
You're all the little people are counting on you.

[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:35.980]
What were the ash tree?

[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.960]
Well, how come we don't have an ash tree in here?

[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.820]
Well, because there's no smoking in the building.

[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:41.980]
What kind of...

[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.060]
What kind of...

[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.860]
You're not a damn good reason.

[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:44.340]
You're not a damn good reason.

[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:44.780]
You're my bottled.

[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.160]
Okay.

[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:46.460]
Mmm.

[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:47.340]
Time!

[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:48.520]
No time!

[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.240]
You smoking time!

[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:51.160]
Shut your mouth.

[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:51.880]
Call the cops!

[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:53.660]
Here's a...

[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.640]
Now, what is it?

[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:55.060]
What it is?

[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.520]
I'm gonna give it a 10 to 2 slot after.

[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.320]
Uh, Miami is next to sunrise.

[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:02.120]
I'm very confused because Kurt is like doing his best to screw up the show.

[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.160]
Could I have the light back down?

[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:03.800]
Yeah, could you just a joke?

[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:04.100]
What?

[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:04.620]
The lighter.

[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.660]
Is it not the lighter back?

[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:06.440]
You're just laughing out there?

[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:07.420]
Nobody cares.

[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.000]
What lighter?

[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.080]
Do I have your lighter?

[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:10.000]
Oh, there it is.

[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.420]
Isn't he about ready to go home?

[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.120]
Don't you need an ash?

[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.200]
Yes, I do.

[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:15.960]
Where are we going now?

[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.120]
Are we going to sunrise by any?

[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:17.860]
We're not having.

[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:18.100]
Hello!

[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:20.460]
Good morning.

[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:21.980]
Good morning to you.

[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:22.640]
Top of the morning.

[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.940]
Hi, birdie.

[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:24.840]
Hi!

[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.460]
How are you?

[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:27.140]
Unbelievable.

[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:29.100]
This isn't the island queen, is it?

[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.680]
This is the original one.

[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:31.300]
Wow!

[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.760]
The island queen!

[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:33.380]
There you go!

[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:33.860]
Yeah!

[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.240]
Oh, man.

[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:35.880]
It is.

[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:36.620]
It's island.

[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:37.540]
Hi, birdie.

[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.000]
Are you okay?

[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:38.540]
Yeah.

[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:40.240]
It's so nice to talk to you.

[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.900]
How astonishing to hear from the island queen.

[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:43.820]
Hi, Bob.

[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:44.680]
Hi there.

[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.740]
Why is she sitting on Kurt's lantern?

[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.480]
She's doing that just to piss me off for one.

[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.540]
When you cut it out, when you...

[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:49.900]
Look at this.

[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:50.700]
They're grabbing each other.

[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.820]
You're not fooling anybody.

[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:52.880]
Okay, these are raids.

[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:53.960]
We've seen them a million times.

[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.240]
Okay, it's not fooling anybody.

[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.600]
Go ahead, queen.

[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:57.320]
I'll have an island.

[01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:59.540]
Well, this was nice to see you again.

[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.000]
Yeah.

[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.020]
How does he look?

[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.140]
How he looks fine.

[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:03.580]
Yeah.

[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.580]
Except for those silly headphones on, he looks like Mr. Spock

[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:07.740]
on a bed day without the ears.

[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.460]
With an ear job.

[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:09.940]
A better day.

[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:10.340]
Yeah.

[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.780]
It's like the good old days.

[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.500]
It sure is like a little reunion here, right?

[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.560]
Spock and I and Z.

[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:15.060]
Yeah?

[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.440]
The only thing missing is that a douchebag.

[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:18.160]
Where was his name?

[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:18.760]
Kyle.

[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.280]
Kyle.

[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.080]
Kyle Isley.

[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.140]
Probably the best board op I ever worked with.

[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:22.720]
Oh, sorry, George.

[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:26.680]
No, I feel like I'm working with Kyle because he'll keep turning my mic off.

[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:28.660]
You didn't hear that, did you?

[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:29.780]
You're just blew me a little kiss.

[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.080]
Wasn't that sweet?

[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:31.740]
Unbelievable.

[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.300]
Yeah.

[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.300]
Well, I kind of go, Jeff is waiting.

[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.940]
Okay, well, make sure you go ahead and do a good job.

[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.120]
He'll be done with that.

[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.060]
Okay, see you later.

[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:39.760]
Bye-bye.

[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.520]
Whatever happened to Kyle, I'd totally forgotten him.

[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.540]
He was a raid boarder.

[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.580]
He'll be there forever.

[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.180]
They will bury him right in the end.

[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.160]
He'll be there forever.

[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:48.140]
He'll be there forever.

[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:48.540]
He'll be there forever.

[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:49.760]
He'll be there forever.

[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:53.040]
That's what he took his brother and threw him out into the gutter end of a crap about that.

[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.940]
I wonder what ever happened to Keith.

[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.080]
Now, there's a guy who probably wouldn't be too good on a job interview, you know what I'm saying?

[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:58.500]
Yeah.

[01:10:58.820 --> 01:10:59.140]
Yeah.

[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.160]
He doesn't give a real good impression.

[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.560]
On the phone, he might be a little better.

[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.840]
Probably couldn't hear him.

[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200]
If it's a night, yeah.

[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:07.980]
If it's a night.

[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:08.220]
Yeah.

[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.540]
Like, three in the morning with those crayons, he was very good.

[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.220]
He was a piece of work.

[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:12.760]
I'll say that.

[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:13.860]
He was different.

[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:14.400]
Yeah.

[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.080]
He was sure different.

[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.120]
We come in and do the mornings you want to say to like 4.35 o'clock in the morning.

[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.400]
And he was like in the middle of just getting a wrap it up again right to go home.

[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:21.580]
Yeah.

[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.720]
From a late night's session with his Crayolas and his charts.

[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.720]
He didn't come to work till five in the afternoon.

[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:27.500]
Or later.

[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.420]
Yeah, or later.

[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.200]
And that's why he walked out.

[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:35.680]
Because they started demanding that he come in for meetings like in real times when normal people come in and he said the screw that.

[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.040]
They said, Keith, we're having the meeting to decide our meetings.

[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:39.860]
Is anybody upset that I'm smoking in here?

[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.560]
Evan, are you serious?

[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.420]
Haven't heard anything.

[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.820]
I'm not inhaling this by the way.

[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:43.900]
I don't know.

[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:45.340]
It is okay.

[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.240]
As long as I make a lot of smoke and make a big to do about this.

[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:51.060]
Now, are they going to like rip my ass for weeks after I leave now?

[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:51.480]
And they are.

[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:52.260]
People say yes.

[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:53.600]
They'll say what a disgusting.

[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.360]
Oh, it's a whiskey.

[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.360]
I'm the one who's going to.

[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:55.980]
He's got a auger slot.

[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:56.700]
Oh, yeah.

[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.720]
It's like you're a voodoo doll and stick all kind of the cream smoking in here.

[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.620]
So I don't see that.

[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.600]
It's having a great impact.

[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.960]
I don't see any schmutz on the ceiling.

[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:03.800]
It's a lot more comfortable.

[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.280]
Although it is a little too warm still.

[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:06.840]
No, schmutz on the ceiling.

[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.600]
How comfortable in here last time.

[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.480]
In other words, they don't.

[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:10.620]
Did you see that?

[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:14.580]
I have never seen such a limperist in my life.

[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.260]
What a...

[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.340]
Oh, I saw that.

[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.700]
Where the God, I saw that.

[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:19.740]
I saw that, man.

[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.600]
No wonder he wouldn't come to the hockey game.

[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.260]
Yeah, that's it.

[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.020]
Stand up and toss it down, baby.

[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:26.620]
Who the hell are you, kiddin' Kurt?

[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.640]
What's going on here?

[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.640]
He was playing a little, he was tossin' it.

[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.000]
Oh.

[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.440]
Here's the hotline.

[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:33.060]
Hello.

[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:33.560]

[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:34.220]
Nail.

[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:34.700]
Yes?

[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:36.340]
How were the seats last night?

[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.280]
Is this Melvita?

[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:39.760]
Yeah.

[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:44.140]
He's smoking, Melvita, he's smoking, he's smoking.

[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.040]
Nail can do anything he wants.

[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.320]
Yeah, see, there you go, Mom.

[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.560]
How do you like that, Lassiter?

[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:49.320]
Are you fatso?

[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.280]
So anyway, we had a great seat and we had a great time.

[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.320]
And we found some SUV and listeners all around us.

[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.620]
And it was great.

[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:56.840]
Good.

[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:58.840]
Hi, Tom.

[01:12:59.480 --> 01:12:59.940]
Are they true...

[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:00.240]
Hey, Bird.

[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.380]
How you feeling, Tom?

[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:02.080]
Huh?

[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.760]
Oh, I'm feeling pretty good.

[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.560]
Let me say it again.

[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.880]
How you feeling, Tom?

[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.040]
The fever is down and I'm feeling pretty good.

[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.560]
But I'm all packed up.

[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:10.180]
You are?

[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:10.640]
Yeah.

[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.420]
Well, I noticed that the one that used to be on Kurt's face is missing now.

[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:14.240]
So is there a coincidence?

[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.960]
Maybe you picked it up from him.

[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.740]
His Kurt were in the bow that I gave him.

[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:18.620]
He's wearing one.

[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.020]
Yeah, he's wearing a pink bow on his head.

[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:20.240]

[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.000]
He was supposed to be wearing the bow today.

[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.160]
Yeah, that's all he's got on.

[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:27.080]
He's just got a pink bow on his head and like wrapped up like a little holiday package.

[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.000]
Leave him alone, I really want to see what the bow is.

[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.160]
I think you're all doing it with this guy.

[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:31.960]
And you're going to give him a complex and get him neurotic.

[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.780]
Oh, no, Susie stole the bow.

[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:34.920]
She's got it on her head.

[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:35.500]
Isn't it?

[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.680]
So anything you give to Kurt, he's going to give the Susie.

[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.180]
You know what I mean?

[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:38.920]
Well, then she's going to give it to him.

[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.600]
Like chickenpox.

[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:40.380]
Yeah, right.

[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:45.120]
He said he's going to give it to her, but I think he's been saying that a long time.

[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.520]
She's even, she's laughing at that.

[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.500]
She said that'll be the day.

[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.940]
Well, what time did you turn the radio on this morning, Tom?

[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:50.820]
Say what?

[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.540]
What time did you turn the radio on?

[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:53.580]
It's been on all day.

[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:54.180]
Oh.

[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:55.420]
And how's it been?

[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:56.420]
What?

[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:57.120]
Give me your honor.

[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.040]
You know, I got to be honest with you.

[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.440]
We've been doing very well up until this call, but you're like,

[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.540]
so I understand you're out of the weather, but don't like blow the whole thing out of the water.

[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.620]
I was planning on running a place and come up here for a couple of months at a time.

[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:09.420]
That'd be great.

[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.300]
It would be great.

[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:10.940]
Come on up.

[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.200]
Because I enjoyed a lot better, although Dave would get upset with my smoking in this room.

[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:15.520]
Are they treating you okay?

[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:16.860]
They're treating us great.

[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:20.360]
And the Schwarzes deli on Dale Maybury came up with some great stuff.

[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:21.340]
We don't eat any more food.

[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.360]
We had a feeding frenzy.

[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.500]
We had omelets and potatoes and bagels and the bea-

[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.700]
The alleys and cookies.

[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:33.600]
And then we had one of our listeners come up and actually got the Dennis Lyrie CD off our hands and brought some N&Bs.

[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.500]
And all kinds of stuff were bagels and brought two extra packs of cigarettes so I can change smoke and make...

[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.660]
We're having a hell of a time, man. We're having a little grab ass.

[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.940]
And Bob is actually staying in the station.

[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:43.920]
What is he doing on the wall?

[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:44.980]
Let me leave, Bob.

[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:45.660]
What's going on now?

[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:46.860]
Is he on the floor?

[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.240]
Neal's distracted.

[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:49.480]
Oh my God.

[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.680]
Yeah, whatever's going on in there, I'm missing out time.

[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.000]
You're saying, God, this is radio.

[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:53.360]
Yeah.

[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.960]
If you could only see it.

[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:55.920]
I usually do.

[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:56.660]
That's what he was saying.

[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.640]
If I could only see it.

[01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:58.800]
But anyway, what?

[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.800]
Bob's actually staying there past 10 o'clock.

[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:06.540]
He's going to stick around as long as I want because he appreciates it so much that I came in early this morning.

[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:11.340]
And I would have been on a lot earlier except that I was walking around in the halls trying to get my ass in his station.

[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:12.880]
Tom.

[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.620]
Peter let you in, didn't he?

[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:15.720]
Yeah.

[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.340]
Okay, no one knew what time you were coming.

[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:20.120]
I'm not touching any of your lines, okay?

[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:23.860]
Hey, Tom, can Neal stay at your place next time?

[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.080]
He was supposed to stay this time, except...

[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.080]
Well, I'll just move in like to the front senior car there on the floor and that bottom right hand in the passenger side there.

[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.540]
Well, the sawdust is.

[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.260]
It makes for a nice little bed delaying.

[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:35.800]
Neal, have you ever had the chicken pock?

[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.560]
When I was a kid like most people.

[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.440]
So you did have them.

[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.580]
How long is this going to last?

[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:40.140]
Did they tell you?

[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.640]
I mean, it's call?

[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:42.240]
No.

[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:42.860]
Yeah.

[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:44.420]
Exactly.

[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:46.200]
That's what I had in mind.

[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.900]
When I heard your voice.

[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.320]
Probably a week, 10 days.

[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:50.760]
Yeah.

[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:51.560]
14 days.

[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:52.460]
Which is how much longer?

[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:55.180]
Well, I don't know when I actually started coming down with it.

[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.420]
Probably Sunday, Saturday, Sunday.

[01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:57.840]
Yeah.

[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.140]
So probably I might be back to a darkened Bob door next week.

[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.600]
Because Keith Conner was coming.

[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.340]
You looked like crap on wheels, man.

[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:06.540]
He said that you looked like a pathetic.

[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.980]
He said it was embarrassed for you.

[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:08.640]
But, no.

[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.720]
And I said, what's that about that?

[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.280]
But you would have enjoyed the hockey game last night, Tom.

[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:12.960]
Yeah.

[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.820]
A lot of fights, a lot of action.

[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.300]
Leaves won it, but the lighting were right in there.

[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:18.700]
And potpan made a lot of great say.

[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:19.760]
It was a good game.

[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:20.740]
A lot of enthusiasm.

[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.580]
And the security guard waved back.

[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.460]
No, actually the security guard.

[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.360]
You knew who Mr. Guard.

[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.820]
And the security guard number 29 winked at us.

[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.660]
When we came in and I said, listen, Bob and Neil are only names, okay, kid?

[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:31.200]
Ha!

[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:32.480]
Well, listen, Tom.

[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.400]
I don't want to blow you off here, buddy.

[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:35.360]
You're blowing me off.

[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:36.600]
Have a great day, Tom.

[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.160]
And it feels better.

[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.960]
I didn't get to call anybody a douchebag.

[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.260]
And we're so sorry that we may be able to send you to your Tom.

[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.360]
And I'll smoke another one just for you, okay, Tom?

[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:44.540]
Hey, thanks for having me.

[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.880]
And Peter and Kurt said they miss you desperately, okay?

[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:47.960]
Hey, enjoy your study.

[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.540]
And if you believe that, okay, Tom?

[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:49.820]
Okay.

[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:50.320]
See ya.

[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:53.920]
That's Tom Velvita for his big bank club from State to the From Coast.

[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.800]
You know, Keith painted such a picture, such as sad tragic, pathetic picture of him.

[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.060]
And Tom and his pox that everybody here at the station actually felt sorry for him for about 10 minutes.

[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:04.040]
Up until I'd call now, I feel sorry for us.

[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:05.660]
It's 1151.

[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.420]
Now is the possible, huh?

[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.480]
On the IOD network.

[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:36.740]
And then Saturday we got our remote, our appearance in peaches from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.

[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:39.280]
Me and the blob together again and Tom Velvita will be there.

[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.540]
We'll have some ugly pictures and a bunch of stuff.

[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.220]
Neil Bob Fowler.

[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:43.840]
Peaches.

[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:44.600]
Be there.

[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:45.800]
Don't miss it.

[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.320]
It's gonna be one month.

[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.660]
Come see Neil and Bob.

[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:59.500]
Come meet Neil Rogers and Bob Latheter Saturday March 20th.

[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:00.880]
11 a.m. till 2 p.m.

[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.900]
Peaches at University Collections.

[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.580]
Another personal appearance from News Talk Radio 620 WSUN.

[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.760]
News Talk Radio 620 WSUN.

[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.260]
It's the Neil Rogers show.

[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:20.020]
You can talk to Neil Live by calling Toe Free 1-800-944-9463.

[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:21.760]
Unbelabeled.

[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.120]
So anyway, oh wait a minute.

[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.720]
Just look like a blob to you.

[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.680]
See you're the one that told me don't make the levels at high?

[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.280]
Just look like a blob to you.

[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:29.580]
Yeah.

[01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:31.260]
It's 1155.

[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.420]
We got backed up badly here toward the end of the hour.

[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:34.460]
We did?

[01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:35.500]
We got backed up.

[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:35.960]
We didn't get it.

[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:36.800]
It takes a next class.

[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.740]
Here's four Myers.

[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:39.100]
Hello.

[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:40.960]
Hello.

[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.060]
Four Myers.

[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:43.740]
Hello.

[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.760]
Does this thing working?

[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:45.940]
They've been on here for hours.

[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:46.340]
They're gone.

[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:47.460]
How about Port Charlotte?

[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.000]
Hello.

[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:49.820]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:50.200]
Good morning.

[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:51.160]
Good to you.

[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:51.540]
Yeah.

[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:53.060]
First of all, welcome to the West.

[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:53.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.320]
I'd be up there to see you.

[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.780]
But nice old prevent you pulled out in front of my motorcycle and I have a cast.

[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.840]
So I won't be able to come up and see you.

[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:01.640]
It's all nice.

[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.200]
Well, I tell you, those old parts that drive down by you, man.

[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.000]
I would love them.

[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:08.780]
I always pop at a gut driving up 75 years today trying to get around these people.

[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:09.720]
They're in all the lanes.

[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:10.920]
They're all over the goddamn road.

[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.420]
They're all going each one going slower than them.

[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.700]
And talk about Canadian plates, man.

[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.420]
There are more Ontario plates than there are in Ontario.

[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.600]
Well, you just clear the call back and you'll be all right.

[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:21.280]
What the hell was that all about, eh?

[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.340]
Well, you can see as their knuckles were going down the road.

[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:23.720]
Yeah.

[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:25.480]
Anyway, listen.

[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.700]
While Bob is in the room, blephal plastic.

[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:28.600]
Who?

[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:28.820]
What?

[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.700]
You were talking about that, the eyelid procedure?

[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.120]
Oh, yeah.

[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.080]
I've had that twice.

[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:33.820]
You have?

[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:34.220]
Yeah.

[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.140]
And how did it come out?

[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:35.880]
Pretty good.

[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.420]
When I was born, I had a condition called toses where your eyelid just doesn't work.

[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.240]
You know, it stays shut.

[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:40.760]
Yeah.

[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.020]
And blephal plastic.

[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.140]
And it's called one.

[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:44.180]
It's called toses.

[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.000]
Hallotosis?

[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:45.620]
Toses.

[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.480]
Just plain toses.

[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:47.760]
Just plain toses.

[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:48.560]

[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:48.840]
Toses.

[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.300]
Is that when your toses stay shut?

[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:50.700]
Yeah.

[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:51.760]
That's when your eyes stay shut.

[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:52.100]
Yeah.

[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:52.940]
Anyway.

[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:54.760]
Anyway, they're towing your eyes called toses.

[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:55.960]
Yeah.

[01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:59.220]
Anyway, it's a procedure that fixes your eyelid.

[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.660]
It reattaches it to the muscle.

[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:01.740]
Dude, and I had a problem.

[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:02.900]
It attaches it to your muscle.

[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:04.840]
It reattaches it to the eyelid muscle.

[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:08.560]
Well, boy, it must create some back strain having your muscle attached to your eyelid, huh?

[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:09.120]
Well, sometimes.

[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:12.120]
Even once his name was a hair.

[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.300]
Ron Jeremy couldn't do that.

[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.960]
Yeah, it makes it real difficult to dress.

[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.920]
Yeah, I would think so, yeah.

[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:17.780]
Anyway, I had a problem with my face.

[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:18.760]
That's what the art of it should be.

[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.340]
He can't get his dress on over his ears.

[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:21.940]
I've had early certain times that your eyelids are open.

[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.240]
So you've got Hallotosis and your eyelids are all straightened out now?

[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.580]
Yeah, and it's the only thing it does is I sleep with that eye open now.

[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.140]
So I have like, I'm like, I'm winking when I sleep.

[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.680]
Well, sir, if you'd stop having dirty thoughts, you could stay on it.

[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:34.480]
Well, what can I do with all the time?

[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.500]
You can be like the winked poster child.

[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:39.100]
Yeah, well, you know, all the references to Kurt can't help.

[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.440]
Yeah, well, listen, yeah, I'm just in my shoes.

[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.840]
He's okay. He's just like, excuse me.

[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.860]
I'd make a famous request if I could.

[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:47.100]
Okay, so we got to tone all of that down because we don't want to intimidate him

[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.260]
so much, he'll create a neurosis.

[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:49.240]
All right.

[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.360]
And then, of course, he'll have toosis.

[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.100]
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:51.740]
Yeah.

[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:53.920]
Don't ask you.

[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:53.940]

[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.700]
Would you rather have neurosis or toosis?

[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.300]
Probably neurosis, so I could cope with poor Charlotte.

[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:58.800]
Okay.

[01:20:59.440 --> 01:20:59.620]
Anyway.

[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.380]
What an old crappy place, huh?

[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.400]
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, Tony Allen, you know, I got to hear WWE.

[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.140]
Are you listening probably on S U N, right?

[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:06.400]
Yeah.

[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:07.780]
Because it comes in much better.

[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.740]
WWE C N is only like within a three mile radius of four Myers

[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.420]
and Eustace or whatever that is over there.

[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.780]
I have, guys, sterile.

[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:17.600]
I have got to tell you that radio station, I don't think it's like really on the air.

[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.560]
I mean, I could hear it.

[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.300]
But like, oh, spots are available on the near Rogers show.

[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:22.920]
Call up Tony Allen. They give a phone number.

[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.960]
It's, I have never heard a radio station quite like that.

[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.780]
It's like he's sitting in a room somewhere, running the board

[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:33.560]
and waiting for the phone to ring the cell-sum spots.

[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:34.920]
And I'm getting it.

[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:35.680]
It's like thousands of...

[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:36.680]
What's what we do here?

[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.420]
It's like a monopoly game. It's like a hobby.

[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:39.980]
You're right, just like here, exactly.

[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:40.800]
It doesn't remind me.

[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:44.080]
Just before your show on Mondays, they stole a spot for an hour.

[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.520]
They had these two ladies who own an erotic toy shop.

[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:48.180]
Ooh.

[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:51.240]
And people call in and discuss what they want to do and...

[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:51.840]
They all go.

[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:52.620]
Yeah.

[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.660]
Yeah. It's pretty interesting.

[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.380]
A lot of toy stores.

[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.740]
Yeah. It's all different sort of thing that you can't talk about.

[01:21:58.940 --> 01:21:59.800]
Really? Like what?

[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.000]
Oh, you'd be surprised.

[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:02.380]
Well, they sure went to the right.

[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:04.280]
You take this one off your poses.

[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.940]
People coming in and...

[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:07.080]
Like his friend...

[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.160]
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.

[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:11.620]
He said, what are you doing with that?

[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.880]
You stick it on your toes, sis.

[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.540]
But anyway, Sally would be upset.

[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.720]
But look, you've been a really alarming caller, I think,

[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.740]
because the movie's working.

[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:21.000]
I was exactly anything.

[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:21.920]
Yeah.

[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:24.400]
Since Bruce Wilson, I share today's our birthday.

[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:24.760]
If you pick up...

[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.780]
Look at how your toes, sis.

[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.120]
Yeah.

[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:28.720]
Bruce and I share today's our birthday.

[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:31.260]
So if you could play the Vagdy Fair Demi More card,

[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:32.120]
that big...

[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:32.400]
Okay.

[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.020]
You'll see it.

[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.740]
A blob is hiding at the rock comedy CD around, okay?

[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:36.200]
All right.

[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.020]
And a great day.

[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:37.840]

[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:50.240]

Hey Joe! Speak!

[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.700]
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!

[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:48.020]
I don't believe it.

[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:49.040]
Look at that girl.

[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:53.080]
He's a big name beauty who's appeared in movies

[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.620]
and you've seen her in the picture show.

[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:58.520]
Yeah, I saw ghost Bruce Willis is her hubby

[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:02.020]
and she's got a little baby that she brings to this studio.

[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:02.740]
Right.

[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.920]
She makes all kind of tone of my heart.

[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:09.200]
All kind of clothes, but the clothes she doesn't wear.

[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:09.980]
Oh!

[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.400]
Are the clothes that are painted on the girl who's naked on the cover

[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:16.160]
of the vanity fair.

[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.780]
Vanity fair.

[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.360]
They're more naked on the cover.

[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:21.200]
Fair.

[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.580]
With a suit that's made of watercolor.

[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:30.020]
She fades at you on the cover of the vanity fair.

[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:31.560]
And under it.

[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.640]
She's a bloody man.

[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.260]
God take her.

[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:39.000]
I could have agreed to make passion for her skin type fashion

[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.060]
because she's gone out on holding.

[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:44.940]
She got a body by her williest.

[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.900]
And they even did the trim.

[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:52.380]
She got a pinstripe, put some metal panels in with them.

[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:54.860]
And she's looking so dead on air.

[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:59.080]
Once you ain't seen nothing like the extra buttons

[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.680]
on the cover of the vanity fair.

[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.520]
Vanity fair.

[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.860]
And they get on the cover.

[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:06.780]
Fair.

[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:07.780]
With a suit that's made of watercolor.

[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.200]
Like a bank you can't remember.

[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.100]
Fair.

[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.480]
And she makes me get by this fair.

[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:15.340]
And the color of the vanity fair.

[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.440]
On the cover of the vanity fair.

[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.020]
And she makes me get on the cover.

[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:21.820]
Fair.

[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:24.600]
On an extra copy of my brown.

[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:25.260]

[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.820]
With a suit that's made of watercolor.

[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:28.240]
Fair.

[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.380]
On the cover of the vanity fair.

[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:31.060]

[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.500]
And she makes me get a cover that looks so beautiful.

[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.220]
Smiling.

[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:35.900]
She ain't even pregnant this time.

[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:40.180]
So anyway, it's a 1208 blob is getting ready to go out of here.

[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:43.540]
And as soon as he puts out that awful bag of it that he's smoking.

[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.060]
What are you laughing about?

[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:52.980]
The only reason I was laughing about it is because I smoke one in here.

[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:53.960]
And I like felvita.

[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:54.740]
Are you going to weigh in here?

[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:55.620]
I'm not smoking man.

[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.880]
I want to try to cook him in trouble.

[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:57.220]
Yes.

[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.280]
I'm not smoking a bag.

[01:25:58.460 --> 01:25:58.720]
You know?

[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.160]
He's smoking it in here.

[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.680]
Tom, he's doing it.

[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.340]
He lit it up.

[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.840]
It's burning over here.

[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:04.520]
You're a trouble maker.

[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:05.820]
You're a trouble maker.

[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.540]
You're a trouble maker.

[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:07.920]
And you're a blowhard man.

[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:08.580]
I agree.

[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:10.260]
So anyway.

[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.080]
I've heard anyway.

[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.860]
Anyway, you're going to be getting out of here in a couple of minutes.

[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:14.660]
Go home, take a nap.

[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.520]
We're going to have a great dinner at Donatello tonight.

[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.820]
The only thing that bothers me is having read the...

[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:21.020]
And we still have had no comment about that.

[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:22.640]
About what?

[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.080]
About that thing in the Tampa Tribune.

[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.140]
Of course not.

[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:26.460]
Why?

[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:27.420]
Well, you mean the course.

[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:28.120]
You know what I'm saying.

[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.520]
You ought to come back Wednesday, man.

[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:30.980]
Are these people retarded or what?

[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:34.460]
Here's a big spread, if I can say that, in the local newspaper.

[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.980]
And I got only notice where they surveyed these people except maybe at the unemployment line.

[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.680]
And one of the best of this and the best of that.

[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.540]
And the best hamburger they got checkers.

[01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:45.280]
In a town that's got steak and shake.

[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.860]
And then crystal for that matter.

[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:52.200]
And what's the best pizza, pizza hut, which is really colorful.

[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.820]
And the best.

[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:55.680]
Why does this...

[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.220]
At the risk of bringing your show down, why does this surprise you?

[01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.080]
I called you.

[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:02.680]
The best Italian restaurant, the Olive Garden, which is industrial strength.

[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:03.660]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.440]
And best I call you about a month before I had this gig, right?

[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:08.000]
Did I not?

[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.440]
And I said, you know, tell me about working mornings.

[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.980]
And you said, well, you know, I don't really know.

[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:12.700]
It's all what we did.

[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:15.120]
We played records and then you know, we schmooz and we took some calls.

[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:16.200]
This is not mornings anymore.

[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:17.160]
This is the middle of the day.

[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:18.760]
And they're still not talking about it.

[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:21.080]
Well, yeah, but it's still a morning mentality.

[01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.260]
No, it's not.

[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:25.100]
People started with us six hours ago are still here.

[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.640]
And how about the ones who started with us like a half an hour ago?

[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:28.540]
What about them?

[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.900]
They don't know what the hell we're doing.

[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:30.780]
Yes, they do.

[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:31.340]
Oh my God.

[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:32.000]
They weren't here.

[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:32.380]
They weren't here.

[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:34.300]
Over and over and over again.

[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:36.820]
Maybe nobody reads the goddamn time for tribute.

[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.460]
Maybe everybody reads the same Pete Times in the USA today,

[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:39.880]
because they like the pizza.

[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:40.860]
Maybe nobody cares.

[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:43.640]
Maybe nobody's like, following along with the pictures in USA today.

[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.060]
Maybe nobody finds them unusual.

[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.180]
Maybe their favorite restaurant is the Olive Garden.

[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.520]
And you're insulting the hell out of them.

[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:50.340]
People love the Olive Garden.

[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:50.840]
Oh, yeah.

[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:51.520]
Some people do.

[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.300]
They love it.

[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.400]
I can't believe it.

[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:55.000]
This is second year in a row.

[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:55.420]
It's one.

[01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:56.780]
You have to be joking me, aren't you?

[01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:58.000]
People, I talked to them.

[01:27:58.140 --> 01:27:59.840]
With that brown curdled up lettuce.

[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.480]
I don't like it at all.

[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:02.640]
You know, I've been there.

[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:03.320]
How would you say it earlier?

[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:05.320]
You're sucking up the Neal, man.

[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:06.120]
You're sucking up the Neal.

[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:06.780]
Oh, my God.

[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:07.960]
Everybody.

[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.260]
I think you're going to get your job back.

[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.020]
You know, tell him the truth.

[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:10.980]
You'll like the Olive Garden.

[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:11.500]
No, he doesn't.

[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:12.220]
Especially with the salad.

[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:12.720]
No, he doesn't.

[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.120]
He said too many good free meals to have that better.

[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:15.760]
That is correct.

[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:16.680]
I just don't get it.

[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:17.760]
I just don't understand it.

[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:18.480]
And checkers?

[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:20.240]
Checkers I've never been to.

[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.360]
You can work with me if they were free.

[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.120]
I think it's taken, Shake, if I want a hamburger.

[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.180]
You had a checkered career.

[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:25.160]
But I mean, checkers?

[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.260]
Checkers is like rallies.

[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:28.520]
You know what rallies is?

[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:29.120]
Vicaries.

[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:29.300]
Yeah.

[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.580]
Same kind of thing.

[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.380]
It's where people who only have like loose change.

[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:34.900]
And nothing over a dime.

[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:36.260]
Okay.

[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:37.280]
No, seriously.

[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.240]
They drive through there.

[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.360]
They reach dig down deep.

[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:40.600]
They scour through the car.

[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:41.780]
And they feel the change.

[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.020]
And they like toss it if they drive through.

[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:44.480]
And that's it.

[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:45.660]
That's what that is.

[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:46.400]
Okay.

[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:53.240]
So I guess checkers and the Olive Garden aren't going to be advertising anytime soon on WSTVN or WIOD or WWCN.

[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:57.240]
Of course, in four miles you don't make any difference because nobody is ever going to be advertising on WWCN.

[01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.060]
I don't get it.

[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.660]
How does he pay the electric bill over there?

[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:03.280]
Well, I think the following four miles has an Olive Garden yet.

[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:04.240]
They don't.

[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:04.960]
They don't have an upscale mark.

[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.980]
What do they have in four miles besides a lot of all of the King Dry Up people?

[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:09.120]
They have the erotic...

[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:09.640]
What is it, women?

[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:10.060]
What is it?

[01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:11.740]
What was that?

[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:12.740]
Oh.

[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:13.580]

[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.980]
George said they got...

[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:16.680]
That's what he said.

[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:18.200]
They have the erotic toy store.

[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.500]
In four miles?

[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.680]
Didn't know what the guy said?

[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:21.920]
Oh, no.

[01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:23.360]
No, it was that old lady got confused.

[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.920]
It was a candle shot they opened up.

[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:25.640]
Ha!

[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:27.920]
Erotic toy store.

[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:28.920]
Are you out of your inventory?

[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.780]
Didn't know what the guy said to call right before the time.

[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:34.160]
No, that was the guy who had his toses.

[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:34.920]
Yeah.

[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:35.520]
Yeah.

[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.460]
And he was talking about this erotic toy store.

[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:40.920]
And they didn't know what was I hallucinating?

[01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:42.920]
Did Sally open up a business in four miles?

[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:43.120]

[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:43.740]
What's going on?

[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:44.780]
What a sense of humor, huh?

[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.140]
I wonder how that energizer bunny is doing with her.

[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:47.160]
Ha!

[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.300]
You know, she does use those kind of batteries.

[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:50.980]
Did you know that?

[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:51.900]
You know why?

[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:53.080]
Is that keep going?

[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:54.780]
Is her right in us notes now?

[01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:55.320]
No, that's right.

[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:56.100]
You were personal note.

[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.240]
He's right in your personal note.

[01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:57.900]
Oh, God.

[01:29:58.060 --> 01:29:58.500]
I'm shocked.

[01:29:58.960 --> 01:29:59.520]
I'm shocked.

[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:02.280]
And he's like drawing a picture too.

[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:06.200]
You know, that disgusting Kurt got all mighty and talked about an exaggeration.

[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:06.380]
Ha!

[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.100]
So how are we doing on the phones, guys?

[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.020]
I don't plan on taking any calls the rest of the day.

[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:12.920]
No, we'll take one or two.

[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.360]
Now you're sticking around, right?

[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:16.680]
If you insist.

[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:17.140]
I insist.

[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:17.860]
And you're leaving.

[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:18.700]
God, we insist.

[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.720]
Okay, now we're going right now.

[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.780]
No, I just want you to get some rest.

[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.700]
I don't want you to be grumpy and grouchy at dinner.

[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:26.180]
You're gone.

[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:26.520]
Sure.

[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:27.500]
Here is a note.

[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:28.540]
I got to take a hit.

[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:28.800]
Deal.

[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:30.320]
Especially when you shut off my mic.

[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:30.760]
I don't want to be grumpy.

[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:31.600]
I don't want to be grumpy.

[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:36.020]
Now listen, I don't want, blah, blah, I don't want Kurt to feel bad or feel anything.

[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:40.420]
But just before during the news, I was reading out, did you type it on the screen?

[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.260]
Also?

[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:41.780]
Yeah.

[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.720]
Then what, you just came in here to be close to me again so you could write this?

[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:45.320]
I don't understand.

[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.800]
You know, if I come back here often enough, he might even shake my hand.

[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:49.420]
I doubt it.

[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.080]
Huh?

[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:50.980]
You want to try it?

[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:51.760]
He won't do that.

[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:52.740]
You don't think he'll do it?

[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:53.820]
I think what you do with your hand, really.

[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:54.280]
Come on, Kurt.

[01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:55.920]
Just one time.

[01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:56.460]
Doubtful.

[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.220]
You don't think he'll do it?

[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:57.420]
No.

[01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:58.760]
Come on, let's see if he'll do it.

[01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.520]
I wouldn't do it.

[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.300]
Would you shake my hand?

[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.060]
Shake your hand?

[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:01.440]
Yeah.

[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.180]
You're going to have to spot it real quick.

[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:03.940]
Do you see this?

[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:05.880]
This is an interesting exercise.

[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:07.400]
I think this is a...

[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:07.840]
Hey, look at her.

[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.300]
Hey, you're going to touch it.

[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.120]
You're going to touch it.

[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.580]
Just a joke.

[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:12.220]
Get out of here, Kurt.

[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:17.120]
It says, if you thought that pizza from Flores had a lot of onions before you went see nothing

[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.160]
yet from Marvin and George burping and farting.

[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:22.760]
And it says on the bottom of the thing, which I read, which you're a Kurt type, if you thought,

[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:24.240]
you couldn't get it on there?

[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:24.640]
No.

[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:25.180]
How about the message?

[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:25.800]
I wouldn't.

[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:26.500]
Finish up on there.

[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.200]
It wouldn't finish up on there?

[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:28.540]
Yeah.

[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:30.820]
Everything he says is another line.

[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:32.180]
If you notice that, the guy is just...

[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.320]
You wouldn't shake my hand.

[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:35.940]
Okay, blah.

[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:36.600]
We'll see you later.

[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:39.160]
Have a great day and get some rest and we'll see you tonight.

[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.960]
1214 on the IOD Network.

[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:47.920]
Catch the Rick and Sud Show today and every weekday from 2-6 on News Talk Radio 620, WSUN.

[01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:49.780]
I really think that guy had a good idea.

[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.860]
We're coming to a time here where nobody wants to give up anything.

[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:57.860]
But we have to take care of the debt and I don't want to get off on this, but you're seeing like...

[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:01.500]
Like that, well, that kid who gave up $1,000 out of his business.

[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:02.240]
Yeah.

[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.600]
Okay, and set it to Clinton to help relieve the national debt.

[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.600]
And that, and that's what it is.

[01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:06.960]
Well, yeah.

[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:12.900]
And then Clinton in turn set him back the paperclip that it bought for the B1 bomber.

[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:13.240]
Yeah.

[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:14.660]
That $1,000.

[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:17.820]
And he used $800 to call the kid and thank him from Air Force One.

[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:19.100]
Yeah, and they invited the whole family.

[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.060]
So now we're in debt from that $1,000.

[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:22.260]
So thank you.

[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.140]
Yeah, you went a little punk.

[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:26.480]
And just go to show you what happens when you give kids money.

[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:28.020]
They just go through something.

[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:29.080]
Yeah, you can put with it.

[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.980]
Be an adult, hoard it, okay?

[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.440]
Cheap the government and hoard.

[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.420]
Finally, entertaining AM radio.

[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:36.540]

Now, God, would you sleep and fall?

[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.480]
A lot less bastard.

[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:07.580]
But I feel secure.

[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:16.060]
Because your temp will watch while your windows open.

[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:21.240]
Did you just say something, George?

[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:24.000]
I'll do a heartless, relentless bastard.

[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:30.100]

Oh, look at that.

Keith and Susie Schwarzgeritz are out there doing it.

[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:42.120]
Back in the chair, man, this guy is so...

[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.060]
I want to tell you something.

[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:46.640]
That was one of the most frightening exercises I have ever seen in my life.

[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.480]
Oh, look at that.

[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.180]
Wait a minute.

[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:50.800]
You see that?

[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.300]
How his little finger crawls, his little pinky curl up.

[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:54.340]
No, it did.

[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.120]
Look at this.

[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.720]
When somebody shakes hands with you and they like do this, what does that mean?

[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.380]
Look how ready he is in a face.

[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:02.680]
Yes.

[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:04.640]
Kurt, it's just a radio show.

[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:07.300]
Susie, will you talk to him, please?

[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:08.400]
Why, Kurt?

[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:09.180]
Shake his hand.

[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:09.860]
He just did.

[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.020]
No, it's seriously.

[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:11.640]
Shake my hand.

[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.500]
He went like that.

[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:13.820]
What does that mean, Susie?

[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:14.300]
He did.

[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:15.700]
He did.

[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:19.560]
And then he was in here and he drew a picture and it looked like the state of Florida I thought.

[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:22.600]
God, it's just a show.

[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:27.880]
If I knew that he was so uptight about this, I'd picked on somebody else, although I can't find anybody in a building to pick on.

[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:29.680]
There's no way.

[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:30.480]
There's no way.

[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:31.400]
There is no.

[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:31.800]
You're right.

[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:33.780]
Well, I wouldn't say personality is the word.

[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:34.880]
But anyway, great.

[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.660]
Go get fizzy and do something.

[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:37.380]
Well, you're getting nervous.

[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:39.860]
Anyway, that was incredible.

[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:42.580]
I mean, how many people have you shaken hands with in your life who went like that?

[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.300]
And I can't do it on a radio, but it's like with a little finger like,

[01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:46.160]
Huh?

[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:46.580]
Never.

[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:47.340]
That's like a message.

[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:48.500]
It is, isn't it?

[01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:49.020]
I don't know.

[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:49.940]
Well, wouldn't you think so?

[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:52.000]
Well, it's like a silent message.

[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:56.080]
Well, it's like if you went in the elevator and somebody goofed you, it would be like a silent message.

[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:56.660]
Wouldn't that?

[01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:57.140]
What else?

[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:57.540]
Huh?

[01:36:57.940 --> 01:36:58.180]
Okay.

[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:00.660]
And you know what they say at the Metro Zoo, you can't pass up a goose.

[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.980]
That's what Ron McGill always says.

[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:03.480]
But what is the message?

[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:05.520]
So anyway, Joe Gerstin's in jail.

[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.500]
There's all kinds of crap going on.

[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:12.240]
And we're not, the calls we're getting, I mean, they've been fine, but they're not informative.

[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:15.900]
They're not, they're not like keeping us in touch with Miami.

[01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:19.420]
Well, the world with anything that's going on, which is why we're in such a good mood.

[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:24.060]
And by the way, the rug-a-loch from, you know, J.M. Schwartz's, Deli and Restaurant,

[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:25.480]
and we want to thank Michael again.

[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.320]
Those were the best I've ever had.

[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.780]
I've had some pretty damn good rug-a-loch in my time.

[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:31.980]
You know something I wish we'd have been here on Puraum.

[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.740]
Can you imagine a humontosh and he must have had?

[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.460]
No, seriously, have you ever had him?

[01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:38.040]
Didn't you used to have him when we did the show?

[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:38.360]
Yeah.

[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:39.320]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:42.600]
I can just imagine a humontosh and that this man must have whipped out.

[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:44.860]
I'm serious.

[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:47.240]
I mean, we had real good ones this year.

[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.560]
Thanks to our friend Steve.

[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.260]
We don't want to forget Steve, do we, George?

[01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:51.480]
No.

[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.520]
Just in case for a nut.

[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:53.360]
No, we don't.

[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.360]
Just in case for next year.

[01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:56.660]
So, we really only got four calls now or what?

[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.040]
Because I don't really plan on taking any.

[01:37:58.480 --> 01:37:59.480]
Do we have a bunch of calls?

[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.420]
Six calls.

[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:02.580]
We have said that's pretty good.

[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:07.520]
Because Keith is in there showing given instructions to Kurt on how to do something.

[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:08.940]
I don't know why he was banging on something.

[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:11.840]
So anyway, let's do a mobile insane peed.

[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:12.740]
Oh, I see what he's doing.

[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:13.720]
He's got a whole of the sousian.

[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:14.560]
Is this something new?

[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.480]
What Keith's wife going to think about this?

[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:17.460]
She's at home.

[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:17.960]
She don't care.

[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:18.640]
Hello.

[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:19.900]
I got some news for you.

[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:20.420]
Okay.

[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:21.300]
Okay.

[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.840]
I eat checkers every day.

[01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:23.820]
You like it?

[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:24.300]
Yeah.

[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:26.220]
No, good.

[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:26.780]
Wow.

[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:27.540]
What do you mean?

[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:29.080]
It's just something to work out.

[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:29.880]
Now, let me ask you.

[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:30.840]
Have you ever eaten a steak and shake?

[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:32.000]
Yeah, I haven't.

[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:33.040]
It's disgusting.

[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:36.200]
I got sick.

[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.000]
It was in bed for today, after I ate it.

[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:39.480]
You got to be kidding me.

[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:39.880]
Are you serious?

[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:40.660]
I'm dead serious.

[01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:44.820]
Do you realize that there are people in other parts of the state not to mention the much-drated

[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.020]
Miami and Fort Lauderdale?

[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.820]
We would kill for a steak and shake and you guys are eating a checkers?

[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:53.280]
Well, there's one over in Lakeland that I stopped at one time and I was taken to a steak

[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:53.280]

[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:53.680]
Yeah.

[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:54.880]
We have three.

[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:55.600]
I don't know.

[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.280]
I ordered a milkshake to start with.

[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:57.680]
Yeah.

[01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.780]
I got milk actually shaking.

[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:00.520]
That was about it.

[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:01.920]
They were still shaking it?

[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:03.020]
Oh, they were shaking it.

[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.240]
Maybe they didn't finish shaking it.

[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.440]
Oh, it was really hard.

[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:07.180]
Maybe it was.

[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:07.840]
It was really hard.

[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:07.840]

[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.240]
It made me ill.

[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:12.600]
You know, speaking of making you ill, I am watching a scene in here.

[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.100]
Are you trying to convince us?

[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.120]
This is something because we remain unconvinced to, is he?

[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:16.380]
Okay.

[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:19.480]
She is like slapping all over anybody, over every guy in the building.

[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.420]
Now she and Peter are like hugging and kissing.

[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:22.840]
George would like to be in on this.

[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:23.420]
I'll tell you that.

[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:23.880]
Absolutely.

[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:24.980]
Yeah, I'll bet you that.

[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:28.880]
She's playing a game over here for a little trim and everybody to have a hell of a time.

[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.000]
Did she hear the haircut lady?

[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:30.900]
What?

[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:32.160]
Did she hop and laugh to laugh?

[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:33.180]
She is doing it.

[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:33.920]
She's laughing it.

[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:34.680]
Well, listen.

[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:40.320]
So you like one vote for checkers and you're the first guy that responded to anything we said today for which we congratulate you.

[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:40.780]
Wonderful.

[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:42.300]
Or Neil, let me tell you something.

[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:42.620]
Yes.

[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:46.720]
Did Bob happen to leave you as a cart of Dennis Liri, the disco bit?

[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:47.860]
No.

[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:50.500]
It's the asshole phone but it's got a disco beat behind it.

[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.200]
I'll find it.

[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:52.760]
He's gone.

[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.140]
He went over a little nap before his next feeding.

[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:55.980]
Oh, naphy?

[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:56.600]
Yeah.

[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:57.880]
A little naphy poo.

[01:39:58.240 --> 01:39:59.040]
We'll dig it out.

[01:39:59.180 --> 01:39:59.900]
Hey, Neil.

[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:00.420]
Yeah?

[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:02.540]
You might want to put this up on cart.

[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.280]
Well, he isn't asshole.

[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:05.580]
He'll get it.

[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:06.700]
Okay, have a great day pal.

[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:07.940]
Excellent.

[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:09.240]
Now they're getting the drift of it, huh?

[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:14.780]
He actually responded and even though we may have not agreed with his response, well, maybe we ought to try checkers, although I'm not eating meat.

[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.720]
Maybe you ought to try it.

[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:17.300]
Do you have a checkers in Lakeland?

[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:17.540]
Yeah.

[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:18.880]
But I'm kind of hooked up.

[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:20.500]
Would you be willing to try it?

[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:21.160]
I guess so.

[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:21.720]
Over the weekend.

[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:22.980]
Hmm.

[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:23.560]
I don't know.

[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.260]
So Monday, you can call in with a report.

[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:25.920]
This will see.

[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:27.160]
This is like almost a topic.

[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:28.140]
Oh, God.

[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:32.500]
So in other words, you don't want to be the guinea pig.

[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:33.080]
Is that what you said?

[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:36.240]
No, but I think that you could do the drive through.

[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:36.800]
Okay.

[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:37.220]
Huh?

[01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:41.420]
Well, it's like almost like a Rick and Suds thing like a drive through challenge.

[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.280]
Oh, okay.

[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.060]
The challenge is whether you come out alive or not.

[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:44.640]
I think about it.

[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:45.240]
But you know, I got this.

[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:48.220]
It's kind of like going to Carl's, not Carl's, Juniors.

[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.200]
Is that the one where they had to think?

[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:49.720]
Carl's Jr.

[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:50.560]
In California?

[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:51.080]
Yeah.

[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:52.120]
Wasn't it all in the...

[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:53.540]
No, it was Jack in the box.

[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:53.840]
Yeah.

[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.200]
That's the Payphone Challenge.

[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:56.100]
I drive through challenge.

[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:56.520]
Yeah.

[01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:58.960]
I got those steak and shake coupons.

[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:01.120]
I'm kind of oriented to steak and shake.

[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:03.160]
But, you know, I'll make a sacrifice.

[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:04.280]
I will.

[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:04.580]
Yeah.

[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:06.720]
I'll think about it.

[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:07.860]
Oh, think about it.

[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:08.160]
Okay.

[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:08.860]
Check her.

[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:11.980]
Well, I think we've discovered a lot of very interesting stuff over here this time.

[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:13.380]
I think this has been a real...

[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:14.400]
Peter knows what's going on.

[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.960]
He doesn't dare tell me.

[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:17.420]
He just wants me to find out for myself.

[01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:19.100]
He knows what the lay of the land is here.

[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.920]
Very uptight.

[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:22.040]
Really uptight.

[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:22.580]
I mean, just...

[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:23.900]
Petrified.

[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.660]
So anyway, it's 1225 on the IOD Network.

[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.380]
Like a dream come true or a nightmare, Bob Lasseter is back.

[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:35.560]
You can tune in weekday morning 6 to 10 on NewsTalk Radio 620, WSUN.

[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:37.420]
The last day of set.

[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:42.840]
I'm Tony Alexander with Ormel SkiWatch on NewsTalk Radio 620 WSUN.

[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:44.900]
Brought to you by Dinky More Beasts, too.

[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.420]
The skiing is soft and sweet in Colorado.

[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:51.180]
Keystone Valance team both have their cover on the sloppy side up top.

[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:52.480]
The kind of wet towards the base.

[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.940]
Powder pocket showing up.

[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:55.980]
It veils backboles and Keystone's outback.

[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.360]
I'm Tony Alexander with Ormel SkiWatch on NewsTalk Radio 620 WSUN.

[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.180]
Brought to you by Dinky More Beasts, too.

[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.720]
A real meat and potato with meal.

[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.180]
How to make Dinky More Beasts, too, taste even better.

[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:09.680]
First, take a chairlift to the top of a hill.

[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.620]
Or better yet a mouth mountain.

[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:14.600]
Then, find a sign with a big black diamond on it.

[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.280]
The one that means most difficult.

[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:17.860]
Then, get after it.

[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:20.100]
Find the toughest path down and tear it off.

[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:24.160]
Then at the bottom, if you've done it right, you'll be ready for Dinky More Beasts, too.

[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.080]
And the big chunks of meat and potatoes will taste better than ever.

[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.880]
It's a most just reward for conquering a mountain.

[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:31.520]
Dinky More Beasts, too.

[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:33.480]
A real meat and potatoes meal.

[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:35.860]
Hey, mister.

[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:38.340]
I got a complaint about oil can't Henry.

[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.920]
Well, I'm here to make it right, sir.

[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:40.840]
What's your complaint?

[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:42.160]
That's his tip.

[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:43.160]
This politeness.

[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:44.160]
This yes, sir.

[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.020]
This no, sir.

[01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:48.420]
Letting me know what you're doing and letting me make the decisions.

[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.720]
I'm not sure that I understand, sir.

[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:54.900]
Well, when I go to get an oil change, I expect to be abused.

[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:58.380]
I expect to get covered in grease in a dirty waiting room.

[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:02.040]
I want an unreasonably high bill without an explanation.

[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.380]
Well, I'm sorry that we can't accommodate you, sir.

[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:05.520]
Don't say you're sorry.

[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:09.460]
You're worse than the guy who showed me the air filter before he changed it.

[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:11.180]
Look, take my advice.

[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:14.100]
You guys got to make this place a grimy mess

[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:17.660]
and start treating people like dead if you want customers like me.

[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:22.100]
At oil can't Henry's, we may offend a few people with our politeness and attention to detail.

[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:26.260]
Some people might not like old-fashioned service along with state-of-the-art technology.

[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:30.420]
However, most people will find oil can't Henry's to be there with a group of choice.

[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:34.440]
Oil can't Henry's in clear water, braiden tendon, even Oldsmall and Carol would open seven days.

[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:37.840]
Get into the pioneering spirit with a great American cleanup.

[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:42.840]
Help clean up 39th City of Tampa Park and Recreation Center, Saturday March 20th, beginning at 10 a.m.

[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:47.160]
You could win four round trip US air tickets anywhere US air flies in the continental United States.

[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.920]
Every day US air takes off more than 2600 times to over 150 cities throughout the US.

[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:53.860]
Remember, US air begins with you.

[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:58.560]
See the Grand Canyon, Washington DC or New York City travel restrictions apply must be 18 years or older

[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.080]
and present at one of the cleanups to win.

[01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:04.780]
From the Florida Aquarium, City of Tampa Park and Recreation Centers and Windex, Vanishing O-Ceter Products.

[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:09.200]
Newstalk Radio 620, WSUN. It's the Neo-Lodger Show.

[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:15.000]
You can talk to Neo Live by calling toll free 1-800-944-9463.

[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.060]
16 communities have a variety of items on the ballot with the exception of mayoral erections in Sunrise and Cooper City.

[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:28.100]
When I draw off, I want to be just like a tarman, because he's Alan Sherman in a disguise.

[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:36.440]
He's better than a bridge tender, or even a tree lady, or her bastard son, the guy with the eyes.

[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:43.740]
A vulgar Brian and a way great bitch will win some more than adequate, but even so.

[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:08.660]
Speak, Joe speak.

[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.680]
So, I could decide.

[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:21.480]
So, when I grow up, I want to be just like a tarman, and I'll never have to get a hotline.

[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:25.360]
Thanks for calling. I'll never have to get a hotline.

[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:31.620]
Bring Riley to do a spank. I'll never have to get a hotline.

[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:36.080]
So, as best as I could decide.

[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:40.880]
Joe Gerstin showed up in court this morning at 8.45, and the Judd said,

[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.120]
Speak, Joe speak.

[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:46.420]
And he didn't do it. And they threw his ass in jail. So, I understand.

[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:50.080]
And if these people would let us know what the hell is going on, we'd know, but I don't think so.

[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:51.640]
New York?

[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:53.920]
New York, New York.

[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:55.040]
You in New York, New York?

[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:57.680]
I am New York, New York, and I'm calling New York.

[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:00.580]
Yes, and you're speaking to New York.

[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:02.240]
And why am I calling New York?

[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:03.880]
Good question. I'm glad you asked.

[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.340]
Because I have a guy in Florida, my name is Alan Glyth, and he says, Max,

[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:15.180]
If you're working on this show called the Sheikardam U.B., why haven't you been in touch with Neil Rogers and invited him for the show?

[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:18.020]
Exactly. And you know why? Because he probably won't go.

[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:21.020]
Well, maybe he's missing something.

[01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:25.700]
Well, he is, but I don't think it's the show. But anyway, huh?

[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:31.880]
Well, you say you don't know what you're missing, and that's what you think. I know what I'm missing. That's what makes it bad.

[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:36.780]
Well, I do say that, that the Sheikardam U.B. to listen to the music of Irving Berlin.

[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:39.500]
Hey, I'm log.

[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:43.780]
Well, it's after all it got a fairly...

[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:46.340]
And the Jewish plumber in Braydenton said, Oy, a clog.

[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:48.840]
No, well, did he see it?

[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.620]
He saw it. Yeah, he saw it.

[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:51.920]
Well, let me give you the...

[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:52.480]
He felt it.

[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:55.600]
Let me give you the opportunity of seeing it for yourself.

[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:56.900]
Judge for yourself.

[01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:57.360]
Yeah.

[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:58.380]
You own judge, and judge?

[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:00.940]
Judge, not less DB judge. That's what the good book says.

[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:02.840]
Yeah, that can be, it depends.

[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:05.280]
But only the guy invited that.

[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:09.200]
Unless they're outside an abortion clinic, yeah?

[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:13.160]
Neil, you know, I didn't know you are now. I'm delighted to speak to you.

[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:13.420]
Yeah.

[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:14.120]
And I'm...

[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:15.200]
What do you mean you didn't know who I've...

[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:20.480]
You're calling me on the air. I'm over here in St. Petersburg doing like a remote from our sister-relaust, our toaster.

[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:21.540]
What was it?

[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.400]
Our toaster station.

[01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:24.660]
Yeah.

[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:29.780]
And you don't even know what the hell we're doing, and you're calling to try to get a free plug.

[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:30.460]
Man, I gotta give you...

[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:31.400]
I gotta give you...

[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.360]
Yes, yes, yes, why don't you admit it? Come on, I have no problem with that.

[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.980]
I was told to cord you and invite you to see the show.

[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:38.120]
You were told by whom?

[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:39.220]
By Alan Glyst.

[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:41.260]
Who's Alan Glyst, you know who he is?

[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:42.260]
No, I never heard of him.

[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:45.900]
Well, he owns a little operation called Alan Stewart.

[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:47.960]
What the hell is that?

[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:51.740]
Well, that's a manufacturing place in Florida.

[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:54.040]
Don't trust anybody with two first names, sir.

[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.360]
Oh, well, I just...

[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.520]
No, his second half is Kathy Glyst, and also...

[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:00.720]
Yeah.

[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:03.140]
And Misha and Misha, you put me two probably, right?

[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:04.980]
And Schmeckle and Chekl.

[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:10.320]
They also have another show called It's Oliver, and that's playing at the Browitz.

[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:12.480]
My grandmother used to have a very colorful expression.

[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:13.140]
She used to say,

[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:14.480]
Hock Marnus came trinic.

[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:14.940]
Would you please?

[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:17.540]
And I think that I'm about ready to repeat the same thing to you.

[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:19.340]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:20.020]
Huh?

[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:21.460]
For first looks to do it.

[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:23.880]
Don't start talking in four languages with us.

[01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:24.520]
Okay, let's...

[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.640]
I think it is not a far from life.

[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.700]
Unless it's an end of time.

[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:28.340]
Or in my...

[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:31.220]
Bobby also would have said Cox a hoist, but we can't do that on the year.

[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:32.140]
But you don't say that.

[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:32.740]
Not on the year.

[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.860]
Okay, well listen, have a great day and thank you for...

[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:35.420]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:37.000]
Can I wish you a...

[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.180]
And a happy...

[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:39.400]
forum, but it's too late.

[01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:40.040]
Have a great day.

[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:40.660]
I'm looking, Mr.

[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:41.720]
Happy, happy, she was.

[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:43.240]
Think of Abnyddi.

[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:43.700]
See ya.

[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.360]
I didn't understand one word of that.

[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.280]
I have no idea what Ellie was talking about.

[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:49.180]
And I think that makes at least three of us including him.

[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:49.700]
What was that?

[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:51.480]
Alan Stewart...

[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:51.780]
Clueless.

[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:54.320]
I think he was in a hockey game last night.

[01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:56.140]
And I do want to say,

[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:57.820]
how come that guy who was like the...

[01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:59.180]
the real groupie there,

[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:00.880]
and right in front of a blob last night,

[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:03.120]
who was like a barrel of fun and a loudmouth and a good guy,

[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:06.080]
he never recalled in today for about the hockey game.

[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.820]
Because I wanted to tell him that Dave Andrew Chuck

[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:09.740]
and Dave Hela were both out of our line of blasts.

[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:11.360]
Night two of our big important stars.

[01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:14.240]
So don't keep making excuses because you guys played just fine

[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.480]
and handled your own beaties and all the fights but lost in the game.

[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:18.980]
So I guess if you're like a macho man,

[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:21.360]
it's more important that you win the fights even if you lose the game, right?

[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:22.380]
Even you would agree with that.

[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.380]
Oh, yeah, no question.

[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:24.440]
Okay, we've got...

[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:27.000]
I think Dave and Broward are probably like laying down a little bit again.

[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:27.960]
Thanks, son.

[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.600]
We do have Key West on the Starline.

[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:30.640]
Hello.

[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:31.720]
Steve Brown is on the ground.

[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:32.860]
Let's see if it's not working again.

[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:33.260]
Hello.

[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:34.420]
It's Neil.

[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:35.080]
Yeah.

[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.600]
Is the bird there?

[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:37.440]
Yeah.

[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.700]
Can I ask him a question, please?

[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:40.280]
Yeah.

[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:42.600]
Do you paint your bull spot?

[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.260]
Oh, no.

[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:47.080]
Is this a rump, old people?

[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:48.980]
He'd like to respond, you sir, okay?

[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:49.620]
Please.

[01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:51.260]
I don't have a bull spot.

[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.740]
He's like a case of that spray paper, is he?

[01:49:57.920 --> 01:49:59.680]
We'll go out and get a case, how's that?

[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:01.200]
Send them to that junk guy.

[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:02.620]
Maybe he can do miracles.

[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:04.400]
Okay, have a great day, Tom.

[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:08.440]
Well, if we had time, we'd paint the bull spot.

[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:09.120]
We started now.

[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:11.360]
I think by next forum, we might finish the job.

[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:13.240]
I like that call better than the previous.

[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:18.120]
Yeah, a lot better than the Helen Gliss and the Sheik of Araby riding it on his horse through

[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:19.720]
anaples or whatever the hell he was talking about.

[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:20.880]
I have no idea what that was.

[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:21.920]
From the York knowledge.

[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:24.640]
He must have been confused with Abe Hirschfeld, huh?

[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:25.660]
He called from New York.

[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:28.860]
Can you believe Abe Hirschfeld would own even the players?

[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:28.940]
Yeah.

[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:30.680]
Even players forget the New York Post.

[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:31.420]
That is frightening.

[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.860]
And there was a Hirschfeld theater in South Florida, isn't it?

[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:34.400]
Right, yeah.

[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:37.980]
In fact, that's the only place when you go in your pay or money to get the ticket they spit in your face.

[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:39.360]
Yes, they do.

[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:41.100]
Anyhow, now how many calls have we got George?

[01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:43.040]
Because I'm getting a little bit nervous here, even a lot.

[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:43.860]
What have you got?

[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:44.980]
Cinco.

[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:45.820]
Five.

[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.940]
Well, don't start with this, esponule.

[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.160]
The first we got a guy in Hebrew.

[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:51.260]
Now we got Cinco, Cinque, all the way.

[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:52.360]
And Oive.

[01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:54.420]
Oive Filion.

[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:56.340]
He's driving into the Yonkers in the 10th race tonight.

[01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:57.620]
What was the guy's name?

[01:50:58.060 --> 01:50:58.700]
Mario's Winetti.

[01:50:58.940 --> 01:50:59.000]
OK.

[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:04.720]
In date 7519-463 and Broward 524 and out of townlines, and we're not even giving these numbers,

[01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:06.960]
and that's probably a bad mistake because I don't know what they are.

[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.240]
I think it's 1-800-944.

[01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:08.820]
Yeah.

[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:10.220]
946-3.

[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:12.340]
And we'd like to get a lot of response about steak and shake.

[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.500]
I can't believe that there's that.

[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:18.800]
I mean, different strokes for different folks, and it was a good guy, but he just got crappy taste except the show.

[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:21.640]
He likes checkers and he hated steak and shake.

[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:22.620]
Is that possible?

[01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:23.820]
Well, yes it is.

[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:26.760]
If I were still eating meat and a lot of grease and fat and stuff like that,

[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:30.100]
I would be at steak and shake right now just clawing my way in the inside.

[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:31.420]
I'd be grabbing at it.

[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:33.660]
You remember the story when I would be just reaching out to touches?

[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:34.400]
Oh, God.

[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:34.880]
Yeah.

[01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:40.460]
Three years ago when I moved up here to Lakeland, and the first night in town, where did I go to eat?

[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:41.980]
Does he ever get out of the house?

[01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:43.000]
I have never, seriously.

[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:45.560]
Other than, you know, you don't get W.O.

[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.020]
Yes you do.

[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:47.320]
W.O.R. on the cable over here?

[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:51.240]
You know, Cyrilli Kessler that does the new news with the white ghostly face.

[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:52.100]
Forget about the nuts.

[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:54.160]
Okay, he's like, he's like Cyrilli without the nuts.

[01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:57.420]
Pasty, white complexion.

[01:51:57.560 --> 01:51:59.160]
I mean, doesn't she ever let you out of the house?

[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.520]
No, seriously, this is Florida.

[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:05.800]
Okay, I realize it's the winter time, but that's dangerous man.

[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:08.840]
That is white and pasty and the complexion too.

[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:09.600]
So anyway, what?

[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:12.280]
Oh, what was I saying?

[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:14.600]
I was talking about the first night I moved up there.

[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:15.600]
I didn't say pasty.

[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.100]
I said pasty.

[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:19.480]
I went to steak and shake the very first night I was here.

[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:20.440]
I was craving it.

[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:21.900]
Yeah, and I went to the shake.

[01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:22.220]

[01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:23.900]
I'm craving it right now as a matter of fact.

[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:24.160]
Yeah.

[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:25.240]
That's all.

[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:25.740]
Oh, okay.

[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:27.960]
Well, I thought that was maybe a story there.

[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:29.500]
I didn't want to screw around with it.

[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:32.420]
Did you see in the trip the favorite radio station in town?

[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:33.140]
Did you see this?

[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:33.620]
Yeah.

[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:35.380]
98 Rock.

[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:35.820]
Right.

[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:37.320]
And the best morning show.

[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:37.860]
Run and run.

[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:38.060]
Run and run.

[01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:38.720]
I don't hear anymore.

[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:50.060]
I'm going to go to the next station.

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:50.060]

[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:50.040]
