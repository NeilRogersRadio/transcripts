[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820]
It's terrible.

[00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:01.340]
I know.

[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.240]
Yeah, it gains will, I can actually hear why and everywhere is on AM unless they're sitting

[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.920]
under just the right tree with their ass bent in the right position.

[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.700]
They can't hear it.

[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.020]
Exactly.

[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.660]
On AM.

[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.120]
For that, I'm telling you.

[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.160]
Well, this is this company.

[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.340]
Do you have any idea how frustrating this week has been?

[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.840]
I mean, you know, I'm ecstatic that we got the chance to be on there.

[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.080]
And I'm doubly ecstatic because it proves that there was an entire living and breathing

[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.220]
audience in there, all throughout that, you know, the rest of this state that would just

[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.640]
love to listen to this station, all of God, damn time.

[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.280]
But we stick it on a crappy AM station with a mediocre signal that cracks, poppels and

[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.680]
pukes.

[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.520]
And that's it.

[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.760]
Well, it's not just a signal.

[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.020]
The callers that have been calling from this area are better.

[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.600]
I mean, the whole show has been approved.

[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.800]
A million times better.

[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.100]
And I look, the first time we went over there, many months ago, and we did our first appearance

[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.600]
in Tampa.

[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.300]
We went to that clear water mall.

[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.680]
We had literally thousands of people, okay?

[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.360]
And it was great.

[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.620]
The only thing though I noticed that was different.

[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.600]
And including the last time we went to the West Shore Mall, we had a lot of people

[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.580]
than two, not as many, but still a really good turnout.

[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.600]
But not, you know, not the same crowd that we usually get, not as many young people, not

[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.740]
as many like college people are like, you know what I'm saying?

[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.620]
It was more like middle aged and older and craggy and those picking people.

[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.600]
The AM listeners.

[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.420]
Which is okay.

[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.180]
I mean, we love anybody and everybody who dares to be great and listen.

[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.660]
But at the same time, we like to reach those people that were trying to reach in the

[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.960]
first place, like over here.

[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.700]
Well, it's been great.

[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.080]
It's like, like I said, over in this area, we're so deprived.

[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.840]
We get things they take them away from it.

[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.600]
It was like a new toy this week.

[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.940]
I mean, I said, I said, I said to Bob Neil, I said to Bob Neil, I said to Bob Neil,

[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.120]
I point up how stupid they are.

[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.840]
I said, I got a great idea for you guys.

[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.460]
Why don't you just put a promo on an endless loop about listening to a Lasseter and Neil

[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.920]
and Rick and Suds and Randy, they're great on 620 WSU and just play that on Y&F from now

[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.700]
till the end of time.

[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.980]
Then you could say we would look at the promotion we gave you, went out and bought a whole

[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.280]
radio station to promote you.

[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.200]
Instead of putting us on there, they bought us a radio station to promote us on for a

[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.400]
week.

[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.400]
Incredible.

[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.780]
You should have heard Bob too.

[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.060]
When he heard that deal where he thought that Ron and Ron was coming back to 95, he was

[00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.960]
scared to death the other.

[00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.840]
Holy cow.

[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760]
He named him with that.

[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.660]
I call him up all the time and give him a hard time.

[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.580]
He called me anymore.

[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.820]
He called me at home on Tuesday afternoon.

[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.140]
I thought, no, Wednesday afternoon, I thought this man was going to blow his brains out.

[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.780]
You could hear his eyelids flapping.

[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920]
You could hear the skin laughing.

[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.880]
I'm telling you.

[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.920]
I felt so sorry for him.

[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.840]
He's worked so hard.

[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.180]
Yeah.

[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.380]
No, I want to say this again.

[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.540]
He and I ribbed each other a lot.

[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.300]
But I'm going to say this, they have taken this fat guy.

[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.220]
They have sat him in an empty studio to do a morning show.

[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.220]
Anybody who knows anything about radio knows that if you're going to do like an entertainment

[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.560]
show in the morning and carries a nice young lady and all that in spite of what Randy

[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.820]
said.

[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.720]
She's a nice person, but she's a board op.

[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.940]
She's not like a sidekick.

[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.920]
She didn't bring a lot to the, you know what I'm saying?

[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.280]
Exactly.

[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.360]
We have to have a couple of goofballs in there.

[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.460]
You have to have a news person that you can bounce off of.

[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.560]
You have to have some fun.

[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.520]
And here's this poor guy sitting in there sweating his balls off every day like desperately

[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.040]
trying to find a call besides a genome from my shore and PJ and TJ and the dead one from

[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.720]
Newport, Richie and it's almost impossible.

[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.240]

[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.620]
And you know, he's holding his own.

[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.360]
He's hanging on there.

[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.500]
He's built a little bit of a thing, but they got to give him more than that to work with

[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.540]
and they just don't want to do it.

[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.480]
They want this company and I'm not joking when I say this.

[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.900]
They want you to make to spin gold out of chicken crap.

[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.020]
And if there's anybody in the audience that knows how to do that, please, I'll be glad to

[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.580]
invest in your spinning wheel or whatever you need because I don't know how to do that.

[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.460]
How do you make gold out of chicken crap?

[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.840]
Well, let me tell you this and your numbers would have been phenomenal here.

[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.920]
It caught on really quick within one week.

[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.440]
It's amazing.

[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.580]
I mean, even here, like I said, in the Mexican restaurant, it would have worked very well.

[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.380]
I told them we could do a seven or eight year if they would leave us on a wine.

[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.340]
Oh, you really think so?

[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.840]
Well, how the hell do you ever know until you find out?

[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.180]
And I'm going to tell you another thing.

[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.320]
If they put some bogus crap on the worm, which they probably don't know.

[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.760]
You know, they don't know.

[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.120]
If they do that, then I'm really going to be ticked off.

[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.300]

[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.040]
Well, and close well almost because the reason I want to say this one more time and he didn't deny it.

[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.640]
The real reason that we're going back on SUN and staying on at AM is because they bought

[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.300]
that station.

[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.040]
They haven't got the foggiest idea of what to do with it.

[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.040]
They're paying us almost nothing to be on over there.

[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.420]
They're milking us and using us and manipulating us and squeezing us off over here.

[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.740]
And they're just praying that they can make that because they have no idea what else to

[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.580]
put on that station.

[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.720]
And that's the only reason we're on AM is because they don't know what to do with it.

[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.060]
I can tell them what to do with it.

[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.660]
Exactly.

[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.520]
But it works so well this week.

[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.840]
It's amazing that they would just continue what they're doing.

[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.700]
Yeah, they are amazing.

[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.300]
They keep, he was, Bobney was asking me this morning.

[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.880]
So you mean to say you had no, I said I had maybe a couple of complaints and those were

[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.340]
recent, you know, basically people who were upset that they lost their music but not

[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.560]
angry with us and didn't dislike what we're doing.

[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.220]
But they were just wondering where the hell are music went.

[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.940]
The only couple of calls we had that were like negative work, were cranks.

[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.380]
Right.

[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.620]
And I bet even those people that, you know, that were upset about the music, even by the end of this week,

[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.880]
you know they're enjoying the show.

[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.300]
Exactly.

[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.300]
I don't, I don't hear any grumbling in the morning.

[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.040]
I mean, starting, starting Monday morning, I'd hate to have to be the one who's going to

[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.000]
feel the phone calls.

[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.780]
I bet you they got the phone off the hook Monday for about the next six months over there.

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.020]
Yeah.

[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.040]
Well, can I ask a favor?

[00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.500]
Go ahead.

[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.320]
Can you play that Camaro card for me, the one that, you know, Camaro, you know what I'm

[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.160]
saying, making fun of Camaro's?

[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.200]
I don't know.

[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.080]
And I want to say one thing.

[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.120]
Time to think right now.

[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.480]
Okay.

[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.060]
1239 at WI.

[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.840]
Do that's what Father Otul's, tool said, a little as all you need.

[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.480]
Isn't that what he said?

[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.980]
We have an open line at Broward, 524, but a lot is better.

[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.720]
Here's four Myers where we're going off because I'm disgusting and gross.

[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.920]
Hey, Neil, speaking of pre-sense of hockey, you know, the pre-sense I'd like to get

[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.820]
their future nuns by the second period too.

[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.160]

[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.560]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.020]
You're still on.

[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.920]
I'm still on, hey.

[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.620]
Shocking, isn't it?

[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.140]
Wonderful.

[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.760]
It's amazing.

[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.260]
Yeah.

[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.860]
Now, and not really.

[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.140]
I waited too long to get cut off.

[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.540]
Okay.

[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.560]
Hey, this guy, you read your thing in your newspaper there.

[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.480]
The shock jock is being dropped because he took the name of the Lord and vain too often,

[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.860]
I guess.

[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.700]
Father Otul, God, you know, anytime they want to like put a deal on you, you call your

[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.440]
shock jock.

[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.640]
Yeah.

[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.880]
What why is that?

[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.780]
You know, this expression, shock jock, which is another creation of these media assholes

[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.540]
is so ridiculous.

[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.380]
Anybody that says crap on you as a shock jock.

[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.020]
If they don't like you, they call you a shock jock.

[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.260]
Right.

[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.640]
If you're outrageous, if you're not just sitting there with your hand over your ear,

[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.180]
intoning for the audience for the masses, saying all the very polite crap that almost everybody

[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.480]
else says, then you're a shock jock and you're trying to titillate the audience.

[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.380]
Other crap.

[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.560]
Oh, did you say titillate?

[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.580]
I said titillate.

[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.700]
Oh, all of it.

[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.280]
Oh, they don't be in the paper tomorrow.

[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.440]
That will be in there tomorrow.

[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.800]
And big bull letters on the front page, titillate.

[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.960]
Well, believe me, I didn't come to Fort Myers by choice.

[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.120]
I got relegated here on transfer.

[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.100]
Fort Myers is such a little horse and buggy, Poetunk town and one thing to buy credit.

[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.200]
I'm not saying that now.

[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.140]
I've said that all along since the day, Tony Allen put us on here.

[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.280]
I have no idea why he put us on here.

[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.940]
And all we were doing was hoeing the signal because there were some people living and breathing

[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.880]
people over there, a small segment of them who really enjoyed the show.

[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.480]
And that was it.

[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.160]
That's all.

[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.680]
Exactly.

[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.920]
There's no culture at all.

[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.300]
Nothing.

[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.580]
No comedy clubs.

[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.620]
Nothing to do.

[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.060]
No place to go.

[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.980]
Nothing to see.

[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.740]
Speaking of Tony Allen, I got a good spy report on that, dude.

[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.220]
Yeah.

[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.440]
His latest hangout is one of their new sponsors.

[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.740]
One of the girls was telling me there's one of the girls that works there.

[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.700]
It's a place called Mermaid.

[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.520]
Really?

[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.840]
And at the Titty bar and they just say that he spends like the whole entire afternoon

[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.340]
camped in one of their booths in the back there.

[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.660]
What's going on with Tom Valvita?

[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.520]
That's the guy.

[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.940]
Yeah.

[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.980]
I love that.

[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.900]
I love that quote again from Amy says the main objection listeners had was that I used

[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.900]
a lot of bad language, especially objective when they took God's name in vain.

[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.260]
And this is a guy who calls up nosies on the ear and says what's going on with Tom Valvita?

[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.780]
Says the F word on the ear.

[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.680]
How do you like that?

[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.680]
I'm three radio stations on SUN, IOD and WWCN.

[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.900]
On three stations, blurt's out the F word and this is a man who's worried that I use the

[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.700]
name of the Lord in vain.

[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.960]
Well, you know, he's such a man.

[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.020]
I guess we could have said the F word that would have been okay, but just don't say,

[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.440]
oh God, that's good.

[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.680]
Well, he's such a purest.

[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.120]
He only takes that broker money from the brokerage shows and takes it down and gets lap

[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:53.920]
dances with it.

[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:54.140]
Yeah.

[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.800]
Well, he's almost as pious as a buddy but Paxen from the Homish lock network.

[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.400]
Well, there's got to be his good Christian values over there.

[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400]
Did you hear that thing?

[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.900]
The Paxen Broadcasting boy here on your station.

[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.540]
You're not just here to make a living.

[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.640]
You're here as part of a team to show that a Christian approach to business can succeed

[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.560]
in a secular world.

[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.580]
I wonder how Dean Goodman, the general manager of Love 94 over there in that same building

[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.240]
with Buddy, but I wonder how he feels about that with his star David hanging around

[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.580]
his neck.

[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.040]
I bet you don't wear that to work.

[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.540]
Well, maybe Tony Allen would fit in well there.

[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.100]
You know, the Hop-Hop, we're seeing all.

[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:27.420]
Yeah.

[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.700]
He would just be here.

[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.780]
He would hop right on that pop.

[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.300]
Hop.

[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.880]
We'll see.

[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.340]
Well, have a great day, pal.

[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:32.820]
Hang in there.

[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.840]
Okay, it'll get worse.

[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.740]
We have an open line on the green line.

[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.320]
We should mention that 1-800-944-WYOD.

[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.280]
And I want to say it again, starting Monday morning 6.20 on AM and we're on there right

[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:42.500]
now.

[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.740]
In fact, you can tune over there right now on AM just just to get the feel of it in

[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:45.900]
here.

[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.020]
All that noise and static and stuff and get used to it.

[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.260]
All these new people that we got on YNF, they're like thousand, I'm sure thousands of

[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.220]
them, which quite frankly is a hell of a lot more than we ever had in S U N the first

[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.580]
place.

[00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.460]
Because we've never been exposed if I can say that before to the real audience

[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.200]
that we're looking for.

[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.820]
By the way, thanks to, I got more stuff in the mail today and in the facts and all of

[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:07.980]
it.

[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.700]
This was a momentous day and then we even had little Torpy Bob Neal on here, ever

[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.960]
seeing him and David Paul together.

[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.460]
Unbelievable.

[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.300]
That's why he hired him because they look alike.

[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.420]
That's the only reason they're from the sound of the same tree.

[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.620]
They were hatched from the same egg.

[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.480]
Under an old oak tree and a tree.

[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.920]
In fact, ain't that the tree where Ned Bady was up?

[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.780]
I think right next to that tree they were doing it and there was this big gigantic old

[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.260]
egg.

[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.100]
What year was that deliverance?

[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.540]
About 75?

[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.320]
That's somewhere around in there.

[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.460]
Yeah, that would be just about right.

[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.080]
So anyway, here's Howard in Lake Worth.

[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.060]
Oh, that's not the right.

[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.420]
Howard wants to know about his satellite.

[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.200]
Just come on Howard, that's the wrong envelope.

[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.180]
Geez Howard.

[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.400]
Oh man, I'll write to you Howard.

[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.720]
I'll send you all the stuff from my satellite TV guide.

[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.860]
You'll get all the packages.

[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.640]
You'll get every, I'm going to take care of you Howard, but you're not the guy I want.

[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.700]
Believe me.

[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.080]
No, here's the thing.

[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.140]
Now that's not it either.

[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.820]
Wait a minute, is this it?

[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:02.580]
Here it is from John in St. Pete, who sent a letter complaining about a few things on

[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.060]
FLA to OP Gabe Hobbs, ops manager, or AK OP.

[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.600]
In fact, have you ever seen OP and Bob Neal together?

[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:11.760]
Unbelievable.

[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.000]
And OP and Bob Neal and David Paul.

[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.480]
Oh man, the geek trio.

[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.240]
So anyway, Gabe writes him back this long letter.

[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.040]
I'm sorry it took so long to respond to your letter, offering some criticisms of 970

[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.800]
WFLA.

[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.800]
I wanted to wait until the spring arbitraron ratings came out before I responded just

[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.040]
in case you were onto something.

[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.300]
Our growth and market dominance continues to be phenomenal.

[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.200]
I'm sorry if I sound like I'm bragging, but it is nonetheless true.

[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.960]
WSUN after 15 months on the air continues to flounder near the bottom of the ratings.

[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.060]
Okay.

[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.940]
Since Lord asked Limbaugh's the number one rated program in ten...
