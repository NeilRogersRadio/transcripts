[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]
Boy Gary that he sets all this up ahead of time. Oh, well Neil is gonna rip you and he'll

[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.100]
an asshole and that's just the way Neil is and you gotta understand Neil he kicked Alex

[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.080]
Bennett chased him out of town. Nobody chased Alex Bennett out of town. He chased his own

[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.200]
ass out of town. He was pathetic. He was a wimpy little cry baby. On television, he

[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.240]
was the biggest wimp I ever met in my life. Used to come in here during the news breaks

[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.180]
and he'd sit down and try to have a conversation with him and the only man I've ever met in

[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.540]
my life, you couldn't have a conversation with him for more than like hello and goodbye.

[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.340]
It was just impossible. Talk about two different worlds and they were just like him. So they've

[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.540]
already got it all made up that I set the stage for him that the audience hated them.

[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.860]
Although they think the audience loved them in their own deluded minds and that was Neil

[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.340]
was the bad guy and everybody in the building wanted a tape of the hour that they ripped

[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.920]
me out about how this is my favorite line from the whole insipid interview. Adam, the lovely

[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.420]
little Adam, my good friend Adam, that two-faced Adam. Adam explains to us that no one has

[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.840]
ever lashed out against Neil before tonight. Never. We're not cheerful. Get out of Miami

[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.120]
alive. At the end of our show, our producer, Adam Kirschner, informs us to Gary Bruce

[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.560]
call to make sure a copy of our one hour response to Neil is on his desk in the morning. He wants

[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.600]
to play at the annual Christmas party and then they go on to say how they came in the

[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.560]
station the next day. Several employees thank us for the one hour blast against Neil. We're

[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.840]
50 copies of the air check. Everybody in the building wanted one, including Dumburdo

[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.560]
no doubt. Talk about living a total fantasy. 1013 on the IOD network.

[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.600]
1016 to WIOD and on and on goes to this thing with Stephen and gridlock. I should take some

[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.560]
time to read the whole goddamn thing. It's incredible. It's amazing. Neil is ecstatic. He's

[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.720]
playing bits and pieces of our show on his show. He's having the time of his life. And

[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.540]
it goes on about how I did the first day they came in. I did my entire show on them. Have

[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.100]
I ever done my entire show on anybody? Of course not. It's like Joyce is the same thing every

[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.620]
weekend. Isn't that strange? How I do my whole show on him every day? And if he weren't

[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.380]
here, I'd have nothing to talk about. But I guess before we came down here, I must have

[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.920]
faked my way through just an anticipation of his arriving in town for many years. And

[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.280]
Neil did this. And Neil said that and Gary tells us this. And my favorite part though,

[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.160]
what one of my there's so many favorite parts is in the beginning of the interview. We

[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.360]
talk with Gary Bruce, program director of Cox Broadcasting's WIOD Miami, Florida. Here's

[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.800]
the great line. Gary is always looking for something fresh and creative and he loves

[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.100]
comedy. So he pops the question, would you like to fill in for vacationing Randy Rowe

[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.540]
with for we he's always looking for that fresh new comedy? Where have we heard that line

[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.060]
before on Sundays and sometimes Saturday? Unfortunately, without a thought we say yes, it would

[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.820]
be a real treat almost a vacation a week in Miami and Gary insists he pays on top of it.

[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.580]
He pays on top of it and fly us in there and bring in our father and father and law and

[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.180]
brother and sister and law and our pain in the ass kids and put us up in some 85 star

[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.480]
hotel like great expense. And it goes on and on and on and on and then it talks about

[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.960]
the fact the day that they came in here and pulled back the curtains and looked in here

[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.000]
like they were expecting an octopus or somebody in here and how I'd like to just soft spoken

[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.840]
pussycat surrounded by mountains of food and I'm sitting here be spectacle puppy face

[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.340]
little man chain smoking. I'm a chain smoker. I probably had one of my C-guards lit up

[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.480]
that day. So now I'm a goddamn chain smoker. Well, smoke this you idiot and of course

[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.720]
they also say about the language on W-I-O-D. It says you can regularly hear words like

[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.140]
a bitch and bastard and fart. In fact, Neil doesn't just say fart. He farts when he says

[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.520]
fart. How do you like that? I can fart on demand according to Stevens and gridlock.

[00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.000]
Oh, little one huh? What a talent. Yeah. But strangely enough, you can't say bull shot

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.680]
they say with the eye. Like that's strange. Like they don't understand that you can't

[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.980]
say bull shot on the air. Although they as I recall, didn't they let some crap go on?

[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.760]
Yeah, they have no. In fact, the first day they were on. They let some crap go on the

[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.200]
air that shouldn't have been on the air. Now it's all coming back to me. And then they say,

[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.880]
huh? It was shot. They let shot go? Oh, yeah. Well, somebody better explain to them these

[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.960]
great broadcasters with their great the comedy service and their fresh new comedy that

[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.500]
there are certain things you aren't allowed to see on here and shot is one of them. Every

[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.160]
hurry George, calling you morons and then they say at the end of this little diatribe about

[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.060]
how I fart on the air. We say this on the stage to be that we're uncomfortable using any of

[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.480]
these words they say Monday will be back home will be the most syndicated comedy action ready on

[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.640]
the country. Neil will still be an asshole. Yeah, asshole is okay, but fart is bad. Okay? That's

[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.520]
their thing where they draw the line. So anyway, I have this tape that came in the mail yesterday

[00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:02.260]
which I'm not even going to open. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. And Nicole Kidman, isn't he? I mean,

[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.480]
yeah, right. You ever see her? So anyway, the movie is far and away. And it's probably far

[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.820]
and away one of the greatest ever. And it's still a plastic thing. And if anybody wants it,

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.920]
just ask them. Just going to put her over to the side. I know, well, not generate a lot of calls,

[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.380]
but I have no interest in it. It was about some Irish thing. And you know how pasty and

[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.940]
the boring those Irish people are. Okay, here's a mobile in Naples. Hello.

[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.700]
Hello. So last caller call I was just letting no one, anybody else,

[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.980]
but the ESC is trying to make these things tonight. They are. Yeah. Woo. So heavy duty.

[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.800]
Other than people with the, the best thing is tonight. How come they only carry it when we

[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.500]
get embarrassed and we lose like the two first games in Detroit? How come are we playing Toronto?

[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.900]
We play great. They don't show it to the rest of the world. How's this luck? Maybe it'll happen

[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.780]
tonight. Right. Maybe we'll turn it around tonight. Okay. Thanks. Okay. There you go. You

[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.320]
axe and you get it. We have an open line in day. It's 751 and 2 on the green lines. Green lines

[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.320]
are very silent the last couple of days. They've got the blood to keep them warm. They don't need me.

[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:10.920]
1-800-944-9463. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. I love it. By the way, I want everybody who

[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.980]
listens to Hot 105, which is nobody in this audience to know that Molo is not black. Did you know

[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.900]
George that they won't send him out on remotes? Because they think that the audience believes that

[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.260]
he's black. I thought he was. He's as white as the fallen snowmolo. He's not black and old.

[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.860]
Go white and old. Yeah. And boring. Go ahead, sir. Oh, why are you, sir? Pretty good.

[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.020]
But that last little spiel you gave, you gave usually when you say, oh, and non, and non, I always

[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:43.260]
wait here. And not bad. Not too bad. Hey, you are too bad. Tommy Dennenberg isn't here. I

[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.540]
used to enjoy what Tommy would go in and go, okay, listen to this. This isn't incredible. You know how

[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:54.440]
there? There are. Oh, and by the way, the heat's going to WINZ. Anybody see that? It is. They are. The heat

[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.700]
sign with WINZ. The red capelin sign with WINZ and the heat will be going over there. Wow.

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.500]
Because starting next season, the Marlins have first crack on the QAM. Wow. And what I think is

[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.360]
going to happen is when the hockey team starts, the Panthers this fall, our QAM will probably pick up

[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:17.320]
the hockey. Listen to this quickly, sir. Yeah. You know how they want to hike up the prices on the

[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.860]
pool? Yes. Well, I thought, I'm surprised. I thought that the bumper stickers and the little

[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.360]
felt tip pen on the quarters. I thought that was going to do it. Well, listen to this. I do a

[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.260]
lot of traveling on a turnpike. The other day I get on the turnpike to give me four sheets.

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.880]
They expensive nice four sheets. Yeah, four sheets. Maybe they thought you were going to do eludes.

[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:44.920]
Four sheets of paper, okay? And telling me about the safety and the faceness of buckling your

[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.960]
seatbelt. Oh, great. Okay. So they're spending on it. I wonder how much it cost to print that crap

[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.520]
on. Well, we had a good book. Oh, there's boy Gary just came in. He did like a little Kassowski in

[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.260]
the room. We had a good buck. We kicked that. He's dancing. His job is safe. He's going to go

[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.220]
ahead and build that house right down my street. What? Anyway, Neil, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay.

[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:09.660]
Eight to what? Yeah. Our eight to we must add out tremendous month. That means even the next

[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:16.240]
couple of trends will be good. We'll think our way through. Oh, sir, we're all going to Tampa now.

[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.960]
We're going for months. We had a kick ass book and eight to George. That means we get our bonus.

[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.780]
What are you shaking his hand for? What the hell did he do? Probably that big nine to 10 hours,

[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:32.000]
the biggest hour of the day. Boy, how do you like that, sir? 25 to 54. We had a goddamn eight to

[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.100]
share. So the hell with all those crappy numbers we got in Tampa, we don't give a crap about that

[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:45.480]
because we're number one. Thank you so much. Who says they show us boring sand. You stupid

[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:51.660]
obnoxious bitch. God, I can't stand her. Too much sports. We got an eight to which is

[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.580]
sure better than your two to Sandy, which you're probably wearing today. Go ahead, sir.

[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.160]
Am I interrupting you? No, no, no, no. I guess the feeling you don't have a chance to say anything

[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.440]
here. You're doing great. You're doing great. I just want to call a friend of mine a douchebag.

[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.220]
Go ahead. Fernando, you're a dripping bleeding douchebag. Okay.

[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.320]
Later. Have a great life. Boy, open line and date one on the blue lines. How do you like that?

[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.060]
Just what our confidence is low after a horrendous thing yesterday, which is not my fault.

[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.920]
I mean, I know when I do a crappy show, believe me, two, three, four times a week. But yesterday,

[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.280]
that news department again sticking their little probe into our show, trying to see if they can't

[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.300]
drag us down to their level. So the numbers are coming in. These second will have like pages and

[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.280]
pages and pages of shot and will be reading numbers and genuinely reflecting and getting all

[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.640]
psychotic. Hey, we're great. We're great. Well, why don't we tell somebody we're great?

[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.540]
Why do we get a TV spot like that goddamn hot 105? Mollos right.

[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:53.040]
An old and bad. Well, Mollo means bad. He's trying to live up to his name, man.

[00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:00.320]
Mui Mollo 1024 on the IOD network. So the games on ESPN that I absolutely correct.

[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.160]
So I don't make police that that he tried Red Wing's game number five tied up at two games

[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.900]
of peace. It is going to be to all though I would tell you. It's a lot more exciting watching it on

[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:15.680]
the CBCA and not only that, but when you're watching on ESPN, you won't be able to hear the great

[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.720]
tones of the great with a ball spot Bob Cole. Yeah. Anyway, we don't want to play all that crap

[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.980]
because we don't want to get all those women upset. Did nobody ask for this tape yet? I can't

[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.720]
believe that. It must be really a bomb, huh? It must be better. They saw the Tom Cruise is really

[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.780]
a hunchback with a good face. He really is. He's something wrong with him. You know what?

[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.720]
You notice in Rainman from the chin up. He's pretty good, but boy, after that, oh, he was good in

[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.820]
risky, a frisky business. He was good in that. Remember, remember, a frisky business? That

[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.200]
was pretty good. That had this moment. You never saw Born in the Fourth of July. I don't want to see

[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.620]
Born on the Fourth of July. I don't want to see that. I don't want to see any Tom Cruise movies.

[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.000]
I don't want to see any Rob Lo movies. I don't want to see any Tom, although I will say Tom

[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.980]
Hanks, although I'm very sick of him because he makes 700 movies a year. A league of our own

[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.460]
was pretty good with Madonna. Well, even though it was a baseball movie, you would have enjoyed it.

[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:13.140]
It was cute. It had its moments. So where are those numbers already? Come on. Let's have a party

[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.820]
over here. Let's call up mom and say, hey, I can't make it today. We're having a party at the

[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.400]
station and we're going to celebrate. Now you go ahead and meet. Here's Miami on the

[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.160]
Star Line. Hello. Hey, now how you doing? Pretty good. I can't believe some of you listen to

[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.640]
the biggest and on American history. And they don't know why is that? Why is that? What's that?

[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.180]
You mean the guy who never heard of G Gordon Litty? Yeah. I got news for you, sir. You know,

[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.580]
every now and then there's another one of these articles that comes out about they take a survey

[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:43.160]
of college students who can't find the state that they live in on a map of the United States.

[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.880]
And all this other crap that goes on, this country has more stupid people per square foot than

[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:53.420]
a place in the universe except maybe Uranus. You're right. It's shocking and nobody gives a crap.

[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:58.900]
It's it's in to be stupid. That's why Rosanna is so big. So to speak. Yep. With her loose meat.

[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.800]
But anyway, you got to let me pick a trick at them all. Well, he's right in there. Have a great

[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.060]
life, Phil. He was good. Open line on the Star Line at Star IOD. I'm trying to give away this

[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.840]
movie and I can't do it. High rated show here. Oh, somebody wants it. Look at that. Now,

[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:21.160]
it isn't that to tip off. There's one call in Broward. Those are the only two lines on a whole

[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.760]
goddamn board that are open are in Broward. The blue lines and this person on five has got the

[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:32.160]
hoots but a call for the tape, right? Hello. Hey, you want the tape? Yeah. Where are you?

[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.180]
Okay, I create. And you're the only person in Broward that has any interest in the show and that's

[00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:41.090]
because you want something. That's right. It's free. Right. That's all I call for. Well, you got it.

[00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.090]
Thank you. How do you like that? That's pretty easy. See, if somebody else would have called from

[00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.770]
Broward, they'd have got it too. But while I'm so intimidating, you're not intimidated. Are you,

[00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:54.570]
sir? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Absolutely. Absolutely. Correct. Right. Well, you hang on

[00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.570]
and George will get all your stuff. All right. Take a plug. And your name too. Okay. Hold on.

[00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:03.870]
Okay. There you go, George. There's your winner. You asked and you got it. Still in its virgin

[00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:10.250]
plastic wrapping there. A wonderful movie called A Far and Away. Tom Cruise and the Cole Kidman,

[00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:19.390]
who really, she looks like something. Anyway, WIOD. Hello. Yeah. Neil, what's happening? What's that

[00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:24.350]
tape? Too late. What's that? How you doing? I'm doing great, man. How about those boilers, man? Yeah,

[00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:29.390]
not bad. Hey, we have an open line in Broward. Which one was that? I can't even shoot.

[00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:35.690]
Shulis, Shulis and Cole. He reminds me of Shulis, Joe Jackson 1919 Black Sots.

[00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.570]
Get out of here. That was one scandal. Don't you learn from history? Get out of our face.

[00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.450]
Go away. You and our Rogers. You low. Go on a honeymoon somewhere. Well,

[00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:54.390]
say, well, pack your sandwich. WIOD. Hello. Only if Stan Stan and Don. That must have

[00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.470]
inspired by our Don Johnson thing we played yesterday. Boy, that cart was gathering dust. I'll tell

[00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:03.230]
you that. So where are these numbers already? How come Goy Gary up there is running around? He's

[00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:08.730]
like high five and slapping and squeezing George's ass. How come everybody that goes in there like

[00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.710]
whether it's Miriam or Boy Gary anybody that's just a lovable cute little huggable George?

[00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:18.590]
God, if they got bad taste and bad eyesight. George is all right. Just need to tan. Pasty. God,

[00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:23.710]
you're so pasty. I'm working on it. Go out. Yeah. I bet you are. Here's a lady in West Palm Beach.

[00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:28.010]
Hello. Hi, Neil. Our first lady of the day. Yeah. Where are the ladies this week? God,

[00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.630]
are they sour this week? Yesterday in the middle of all my trauma, you'd have thought they'd

[00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.090]
would have come there by rescue. We're here now. Well, thank God. With your video club, you have

[00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:40.870]
bought a ton of videos or received a ton of videos, right? Not a ton, one a month. Well, I can't

[00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:46.110]
get necessarily one. What? You didn't necessarily one. No, but I forget to send the card back. That's

[00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.330]
right. Well, I don't forget. I'm just too lazy to send the card back this way. I don't have to

[00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.210]
open up that big envelope from Columbia House or whatever it is. And I just toss it in the waste

[00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.990]
basket. And I know I'll get a video and maybe I'll want it. And if not, I'll give it a

[00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.470]
way on here because I'm a real generous guy. Yeah, but you would have thought by now you would have

[00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:05.210]
had positive response with them. What? We've got, I don't know how we got it, but about a year ago,

[00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.050]
we're in the club to say the card came and says you don't have to send that card. You don't have

[00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:14.450]
to do anything unless you want it. And they won't send you one. No, not you're not in the same

[00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:22.630]
in Columbia House. Columbia video. No, I'm telling you, I never send a thing back. Well, I know. You

[00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:28.110]
said, if you don't send it, will you calm down please? You must have had to check something off or do

[00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:33.110]
something somewhere. No, just out of the blue. And we don't buy, we don't buy that many, but you want

[00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.750]
a time when you should be able to have that too. It's a good mic. I don't want to give them a call.

[00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.330]
Then I got nothing to give away on the year here to my wonderful audience. They enjoy the,

[00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:45.290]
that guy in Coke and a creek. This is going to make his whole week. That's true. The 10 seconds

[00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.210]
of his life. He got a tape for free. It's probably the only thing you'll ever win in his life. That's

[00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:53.450]
true. But you probably write it in his memoirs. Why don't you get IODs and fund your membership? No,

[00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:58.190]
no, I got the big bucks I can afford to pay for it. I'm not some kind of a tight wad. I know that.

[00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:04.330]
Not some kind of a cheap skate. Okay. And now that I got this big number, I got this big bonus

[00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:08.050]
coming millions of dollars here. I can go out and buy another Corvette. Then you can buy it on

[00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.090]
videos at Maruni, Sheavelay. That's right. Or maybe I'll go up the street here to tropical. You know

[00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:15.350]
it? That'd be something to think about. Have two or three or four. Right. What's wrong with that?

[00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:20.310]
I already have two. Okay. Well, then you can give us all videos one a month. Okay. Thank you. See you.

[00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:25.770]
He just jealous. Oh, speaking of important stuff. Yesterday, of course, Rick was no dummy yesterday.

[00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.670]
He knew that it was a dead day for the phones. So we killed almost the whole first hour calling

[00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:34.670]
Hot 105. Great job, Rick. Nice going. Call me the other end of the building. Spend a whole hour on that.

[00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.650]
Talking to some bonehead up there at Hot 105. Was it Manny Tavaris?

[00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:47.070]
I bet you have. Manny Tavaris, AKA Joe Brennan. Who the hell are you kidding, Joe?

[00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:54.330]
What is it? Manny Tavaris is Joe Brennan on Hot 105 and they think Molo be black. Well, I got news for

[00:16:54.330 --> 00:17:00.350]
it. I don't want to burst your bubble. Molo is a whiter than George. That's how pale he is. And old. I mean,

[00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:05.890]
he is real white. That's how white he is. He's like an albino. Molo. He's got pink eye.

[00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.390]
Just one of them like in the middle of his forehead like cycl... he's a white cyclops.

[00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:15.570]
So all you brothers and sisters out there that think that Molo is the hot stuff, the real hot brother

[00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:20.470]
in the morning on Hot 105, man. All I can say to you is, oh, brother, oh, doctor.

[00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.510]
Speaking of that, we got to talk about the doggy doctor because I heard somebody call him, Rick.

[00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.990]
The first part of the show is called Hot 105 yesterday and the second part was like doggy dude.

[00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.850]
Was the whole from what I heard. So being the doggy dude expert, I'm going to straighten that out again.

[00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:40.010]
We have an open line in Broward 524. What on the green lines? Come on Tampa St. Pete. How come we got an

[00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.590]
eight-two-year-over here and we got to want something over there? Huh? What does that tell you about

[00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.710]
them and tell you? Yeah, exactly. George's stuck his finger up his nose all the way to his earlobe.

[00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.230]
Man, get your finger out of your nose over there in Tampa St. Pete and let's get with it.

[00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:59.250]
Let's get on the bandwagon. Let's cut the crap. Let's stop being childish. Let's grow up. Can't we all just

[00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:09.450]
goddamn get along? 1036 on the IOD network. Okay, 1039 at WIOD and all I can say man is thank you, thank you,

[00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:15.410]
thank you to our loyal but very passive audience. We're number one, dammit. Oh, now look at this.

[00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:21.350]
Here finally after all this tease, number 29 in our hearts is on the phone. Good morning Neil. Dave. How

[00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.350]
are you doing? Now what's been going on Dave? I heard that tease call last Friday and all weekend

[00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.870]
long. I was like psychotic and then yesterday I got my days wrong don't I? Last Thursday you call.

[00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.290]
No, I think it was Friday because I had to go to the beach. I had to go to the beach. Yeah, we were

[00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.990]
going to do the whole thing. Well, it used me for interrupting your social life. Your busy and

[00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.810]
cluttered social activities. Well, it was nice while though and we had to have fun. Something fun to

[00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.610]
do. I want to congratulate you on your numbers. Well, thank you so much, Dave. Man, that's

[00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.050]
the thing. Here's a guy who never even knew who I was like two weeks ago and now he's calling to

[00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:51.350]
congratulate me on my numbers. How do you like this? Well, I want to ask you something in order to

[00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:56.010]
promote good relations between Tampa and Miami. Yes, if you're just a guy, you're just the guy

[00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.650]
to do it, Dave. Right. If you can promote it really. You take me to a Marlon's game. Yes.

[00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.730]
You would? Absolutely. Okay. Well, we got a deal then. You're coming to Miami?

[00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:08.650]
Oh, yes. Sometimes then. Okay. You let George know ahead of time when you're coming when

[00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:13.870]
just checking. You got a schedule? Not really. I'm pretty open right now. No, I don't mean yet.

[00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:20.230]
I'm talking about a Marlon schedule. Not yet. I'll find out. George, haven't we ever talked to a

[00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.790]
million? This guy's like Orlando. It seems to me. This is another one of these. Come on, guys.

[00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:28.310]
He's pretty open. He's like, he'll be here anytime I want him. Come on, Dave. You got to play

[00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:32.350]
a little harder to get than that. No, not come on. We might even let you rub elbows with

[00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:37.410]
Drake Bear a house key if you play your cards right. But anyway, no, seriously, we got those

[00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:42.390]
founders' club seats for all of Marlon games. You will sit three rows behind the dugout. You'll

[00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:47.810]
be treated like a king and a queen and you'll love it. And you can be our spokesman when you go

[00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.670]
back. You can tell everybody how great the stadium is, how great Ryan Bowen is and everything.

[00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.850]
That's right. It's a great, it really is a great place. Okay. Like I said, it's one

[00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:01.790]
to say again. Congratulations on the numbers. So what do you do now that the hockey season's over?

[00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:06.970]
Well, I still got some events there after your reign that I'll probably be attending, but not

[00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.150]
much. What do you mean you'll be attending? What does that mean? That you'll be working on? Yeah,

[00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:15.230]
I'll be there as a security guard. Yeah. So, but that's still pretty open. I'm not doing much

[00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.810]
of anything. Working out going to the beach, taking an easy one. God, what a rough life. He's

[00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.910]
working out. He's going to the beach and coming over to see the Marlon games. That's right. Okay.

[00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.950]
Well, I guess somebody slips a bag of money under your door every morning, right? And it's a way

[00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:31.770]
to do it. Well, listen, let George know when you're coming. Okay. Certainly well. And to the game, too.

[00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.190]
Okay, Dave. Thank you very much. Take care of yourself. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Wow.

[00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:43.890]
What was that? I must have dreamed that. A little bit too friendly and a little bit too

[00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:48.530]
cooperative. Oh, God. Yeah. I know what that's all about. Now he's a good guy to stay. He's great.

[00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:56.350]
God is he. Anyway, so let me, can we look over these numbers a little bit? I'm just, I'm flabbergasted.

[00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:01.810]
Rarely am I at a loss for words, but I don't know what to say, Dave. I'm speechless. Man, he can

[00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:07.230]
come over and guard our body. Miami. Hello. Oh, Neil. Oh, we'll just guard his. Yes.

[00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.950]
Dave, what's up, Hayden? We're doing it, man. We're kicking ass. We're number one. We're number one

[00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:16.250]
and a half. Rick and Scott, how did the goddess do we better check hers out, huh? And her numbers.

[00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.210]
She's probably doing great. She's probably sitting on the throne right now, getting all nervous,

[00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:25.190]
weighing me here, these big numbers. Hey, Neil. Yeah. I rented that movie that you've been talking about.

[00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:33.230]
Which one is that? Get fatty, Junior. Oh, a fatso. Yeah. Yeah. It was all right. It wasn't all that bad.

[00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:40.050]
It wasn't all that bad. Well, there was only. Oh, man. How can you have you ever been fat?

[00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:45.090]
I guess I have. And you didn't love the movie. I mean, especially you don't have to have been fat

[00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:49.590]
to love the movie, but if you ever have been fat, you have to love the movie. Okay. Well, the story.

[00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:54.790]
The story's on it's pretty cheesy. The story. What do you mean by that? Well, it's, you know, one of

[00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:59.750]
these, I don't know it. It's just the little things that like you didn't like when he went out and

[00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.190]
ate all the Chinese food in the car and away back home. Yeah. You didn't like when he got the

[00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:08.830]
birthday cake for Anthony and he ate the only and that clock was was sticking her fingers in there.

[00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.190]
And were you ate the only and she was ripping the cake apart with her fingers and getting all

[00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.950]
psychotic? You didn't like the part when he was like four speeding the pizzas down his throat,

[00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:21.490]
the whole thing. How about the coffin? Yeah. In the beginning of the movie, when he goes in,

[00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:26.550]
he is cousin that used to eat the chocolate bars in church. His cousin died. His young cousin.

[00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.990]
And he's crying and the mother is screaming and he goes in the kitchen and he takes a little piece

[00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.230]
of Italian bread and he dips it in the sauce that's bubbling on the stove and he drops it in the

[00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.850]
Amazon cheese. That's right. He starts eating and he stops crying. All of a sudden he's like,

[00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:44.010]
yeah, now he feels okay. Yeah, but what about what about when his brother's born and he's,

[00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:49.630]
he's sitting there, you know, the little clips where if he starts crying, he gets fed and if he

[00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:55.370]
gets fed. Right. Well, they're changing the his little brother's diapers. How do you like when

[00:22:55.370 --> 00:23:00.030]
and was it and bankrupt that was screaming at the casket or was it the mother?

[00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:05.410]
You had to go and die and I said, I'm up there screaming. She's great in that movie. She's the best.

[00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.330]
Yeah, he directed that movie too by the what's her. He directed that movie and bankrupt.

[00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:14.610]
It was it was a it was a very very funny clip. But you just got through. Tell me the movie was

[00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:20.010]
mediocre at first. And how about the how about the scene where he rips the where Oscar LaPitas

[00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:24.450]
rips the damn coverage off the thing with the change at all. He rips him off. Yeah, me that where

[00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:28.410]
it gets the honey junior and then he starts screaming for the keys and he puts the keys in his mouth

[00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.350]
and he swallows them or something and they rips the coverage right off the damn mother wall.

[00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:37.950]
Geez, what a pouch that guy had. Yeah. Oof. Scary. I would fill our Reese's peanut butter

[00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:43.290]
and cut me the way. Jolly, don't up melt it in the oven. Hey, um, actually, you know what,

[00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:49.630]
I also saw one one floor over the cookers. Not did you notice that Mr. Martini had the same

[00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:56.650]
twinkle in his eye that Dom did? Yeah, pretty scary. Absolutely. Oof. I want my sickle

[00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:02.590]
red miss ratchet. My cigarette. That's the best scene in the movie out of many. Neil, but also when

[00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:08.690]
what? Have a great day. Yeah, gotta go. Got more numbers here. We're not giving any of them out.

[00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.870]
And that's not fair. By the way, love 94 had a gigantic book. So they've prepared if you're

[00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:19.290]
listening, your job is safe, I think. So anyway, getting back to buddy bud, the deal is Kaplan is

[00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:24.150]
going over from QAM to INZ to do his late night in Sipa. How do you like that, Mr. Green? How do

[00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:29.510]
you like that? Not only do I bring you the Montreal Canadian hockey wins on tape, but also we bring

[00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.410]
you this gigantic book. So I was starting to say, wait till the heat fight out what a great night

[00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:37.830]
time signal. They got it. I and Z. They're going to be very sorry. They ever made that move. Let

[00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:43.350]
me tell you when I worked at W I N Z for five long ponderous years at midnight. And I would leave

[00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:47.990]
there at midnight. And on my way home, I would get from the station, which is in Carroll City. It's

[00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:54.010]
maybe a mile and a half mile from Palm Avenue. It's on Palm Avenue, but from like Pines.

[00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.550]
And I get to Pembroke Road, which is like a half a mile from the station. I couldn't hear it anymore.

[00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:04.130]
It fades out. No, they're Broward signal at nighttime is non-existent. North of 595, anywhere you

[00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:10.110]
can't hear I in Z at night. So a nice move by me, heat. Too bad for any Kaplan because he's a good guy.

[00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:15.790]
See there is somebody I like. How do you like that? And Bob Green just came in smiling from

[00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:21.430]
ear to ear and oh boy, you guys are great. I guess you are going to Tampa now. See we got to buy

[00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:26.830]
the short hairs now. We got these gigantic numbers. Where is that 25 to 54 again? I want to

[00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:31.650]
gloat. I want to sit here. See you people. Why did you go through this? It's boring. It's not boring.

[00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:37.150]
It's all we got. It's all we got. I realize it's a pilot crap and it's a very, very slip shot

[00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:45.790]
and best the way they do it. But it's it's all we got. 6 to 10 am 25 to 54 from a 4 5 to a 4 4

[00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:51.150]
W I O D hangs in there. In fact, move from number five to number four. And that's even with a month

[00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:57.090]
of old Rineri. Rineri. I'm not saying nothing about that morning show. Chuck, I wish you the best.

[00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:01.430]
You're a great guy. You're a tremendous talent. Congratulations on the penguins, but that show.

[00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:11.190]
Midday 10 am to 3 p.m 25 to 54 from a 75 to an 8 2. Number one by a mile. Beating out the tragic

[00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:17.830]
and boring W. L. Y. F. Radio slush and W. R. T. O. Radio ritmo with a 5 8's number three no

[00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:23.710]
speaking English and love 94 with a gigantic jump from a 4 1 to a 5 7 midday 25 to 54.

[00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:30.010]
Followed by W. X. D. J. I don't know what that is. That another no speaking English. Isn't that the

[00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:33.590]
Russell Way. Sustation that he swaped with R. R. R. T. More or something. I don't know what it is.

[00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:38.370]
W. F. L. C. The coast had a crappy book. Sorry, Fleetwood. Fleetwood's a great guy and I really feel bad.

[00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.750]
7 O to a 5 O for number two to number six.

[00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:47.010]
Soon in midday followed by W. E. D. R. They seem to be slipping and sliding. How to how 105 do?

[00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:54.030]
There she. There's kiss. There's joy. There's Zeta dropping precipitously. There's power.

[00:26:54.770 --> 00:27:00.050]
Hot 38 to a 3 5. So already the Cox broadcasting influence on the FM is already kicked in.

[00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:06.130]
Knocked him down from a 4 2 in the summer book last year to a 3 8 down to a 3 5. So they can only go up

[00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:11.110]
especially now that everybody knows. Molo's white. He's an albino with pink eye.

[00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.650]
1048. On the I. O. D. Network. Well, he is. He's a white guy. Okay.

[00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:19.550]
Hey, listen, if you're.

[00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:27.490]
Join us this afternoon, beginning it to for Rick and such. Then at six. It's sports talk 16 right here.

[00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:33.930]
If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now. I'm taking your goddamn teeth in.

[00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.890]
Yeah, Alex, another crybaby who gave us song in a dance about Rick and suds and if those

[00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:43.310]
people ever appear again and Mr. Ego and fat Hankel over there with your big ugly body and fat face

[00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.130]
and Rick and suds suck. Emission that. Well, let me tell you also that little time,

[00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:53.530]
Jerka, Jika, Geek, Ed, the Sun, Sentinel, Rick and suds mid afternoon 25 to 54 from number four

[00:27:53.530 --> 00:28:01.750]
with a 5 4 in the fall book to number one. With a 6 4 in the winter book. How do you like that?

[00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:08.310]
This radio station has never ever had a 6 4 in afternoon drive in the modern era since the

[00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.750]
the advent of like more than two stations in the market. This radio station has never had a

[00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:20.050]
number like that in afternoon drive. How do you like that? Six four. All these all year,

[00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:24.510]
Hankel is going to replace them and this one's going to replace them and Mr. Ego knows that

[00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:31.510]
knows this and you're getting canned. Yeah. Rick and suds are God and wait till you hear this.

[00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:43.850]
At night, the goddess from a 4.8 in the fall book to a 5.65.25 to 54 at night.

[00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:51.590]
Oh! And let me say it again. This radio station has never ever had a 5.65 to 54 in the modern

[00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.690]
history. When I say modern history, I'm talking about, you know, in the early days,

[00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.830]
there were only like two or three stations and the numbers didn't mean anything. I'm talking

[00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:04.490]
about now with AMF and BM and PM and Sherway. Just shocking and astonishing, astonishing.

[00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:11.130]
And where did we go down and what they, by the way, Randy from a 3.6 to a 4.12 plus at night.

[00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:16.710]
He's the only one on the whole station that went up 12 plus. We were like a 4.65 to a 6.4

[00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:22.610]
and Rick and suds 4.6 to a 4.5. So about flat, the morning dropped off 12 plus, but probably because

[00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:27.530]
some of those oldsters from the old days dropped off from a, what are we having in the morning.

[00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:33.150]
12 plus. Come on, I know you're on there somewhere, Chuck, from a 5.2 to a 4.

[00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:37.230]
But that probably kicks out a lot of old parts. You know what I'm talking about? We hope we

[00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:42.550]
shouldn't have prayed. Here's a lady in Tampa. Hello. Hello. How you doing? Pretty good.

[00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:47.270]
I need your help, Neil. Well, that's why I'm here. Okay, I need the horse racing expert to solve

[00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:53.670]
a problem here. A daily, ma? Couple weeks. The dolly, daily, ma? I went in for Santa's on

[00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:59.630]
Hello, dolly. Anyway, when I was down in he was saying for a kind of term, it's you, but we still.

[00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:06.070]
I read in the newspaper in the sports section about a horse and I could swear it's name was

[00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.610]
Bowling the Feather. Right. In the Heather? Well, in the Heather. Okay. That's one of the favorites for

[00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:16.830]
the Kentucky Derby. He is? Yeah. He won the Florida Derby. Right. And he didn't, wasn't he

[00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:22.770]
bought for like $60,000? I don't know. Okay. And in his bone, the Heather, and he's going to be in the

[00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:27.530]
Derby. Right. Okay. That's what I need to know. Now the second thing is, did you see the buffalo

[00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:32.850]
sabres and the Boston Bruins game on Saturday? No, I did not. Did you hear about it? Yeah. It was

[00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:37.370]
unbelievable. What do you mean by that? If you were a sabre span of us? Well, but I'm not, no,

[00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:43.870]
actually I'm a Detroit Red Wing fan. Oh, God. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. I apologize.

[00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:49.250]
I was going to have to beat your ass tonight. I don't think so. Do you think the way you're on an

[00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:54.190]
uncle meal? No. Bowling the Heather. Let's see. He's got eight lifetimes starts. He's got two wins,

[00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:59.170]
two seconds. He won the Florida Derby by two lengths. Right. And he was second by. Twenty-two

[00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:05.230]
to one. Yeah. And he was second by a head to forever world in the Flamingo at Halea. Really? Right.

[00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:11.710]
Now what do you think on Erhu's cancels? Because I'm trying to decide what to do for the Derby? Yeah. None. None? No.

[00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:15.530]
Then I'm betting on him. Okay. All right. Neil. Good thinking. Good thinking.

[00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:19.590]
Yeah. I'm going to give fat rich your number at home so we can call you up and give you like you

[00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:23.730]
did to me this morning before I left the house and give you the rundown on every race at the track.

[00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.590]
I had the four over the one two three. I had the five of the and Kevin Wallace had the lead and Kelly

[00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:34.350]
Shepherd came on the outside. I thought I'd never get out of that guy damn house this morning. I

[00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.950]
don't want to hear a life story of every race here. And of course every time. Oh, it's

[00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:42.450]
been great. Came into six horse and the guy with no teeth came into three horse. Oh, man. I'm

[00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:46.970]
going to start. I'm going alone from now on. I'm sure you heard his feelings when you call him fat rich.

[00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:52.250]
No, he loves it. He loves the publicity. He never had this much attention in his life. Okay.

[00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:58.630]
My pick for the Kentucky Derby is personal hope with Gary Stevens. You're crazy. Okay.

[00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:04.850]
Felix Top Van is God. We're number one. See you. Bye.

[00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:09.810]
Boy, talk about worked up to a frenzy. Felix Pop Van is God. In fact,

[00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.430]
Felix Pop Van and Steve Iseman are going to do a little number for us before the game tonight.

[00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.490]
Get a 95 share with Ed. Here is a candle.

[00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.910]
What was that? Take this out.

[00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:28.710]
Oh, you're listening to that. You're the first guy.

[00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.310]
You're not going to talk to me. Are you going to speak to me or what?

[00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.710]
I played that whole thing yesterday. You're the first caller I've made.

[00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.890]
That one. I just got it yesterday. Yeah, I get to believe it's a thousand dollars for my

[00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:45.190]
thoughts. Yeah, right. I thought wow, thousand dollars. Hold your breath. Keep checking the mailbox

[00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:48.750]
every day. See? Yeah, right. You're like Bob Green going to send me a grand for my thought.

[00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.790]
So, um, this is funny. It says Neil Rogers is either kind.
