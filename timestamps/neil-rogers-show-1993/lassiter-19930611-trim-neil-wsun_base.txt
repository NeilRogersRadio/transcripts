[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.120]
Already here comes Velvita with a selection of snap all over the place

[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.880]
I ran for you today great. I should have picked up that stock when it first opened. He opened at 20 what 29

[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.180]
Yeah, grab one. That's really this is about 40 now. I think

[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.420]
I like the lemonade. Flying upwards. It's zoom in. Well, I gotta tell you something this red guy is a real apple. Yeah, he is

[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.860]
Oh, man, I can't believe you even put him on here

[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.900]
What show you're listening to Bob will put anybody on there you go listen Bob

[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.960]
I noticed since today's last day I'm gonna be here. He is using all the call today

[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.600]
He is pulling out all the time. I got burned on that

[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.740]
Ray a kind of thing right in here. Oh, I did. Oh, that's just for behind the traffic. Well, I didn't know that

[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.400]
I thought it was some kind of you know a great bit. Yeah, and I'm sitting here and I'm waiting and I'm waiting

[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.260]
It's going on you like 45 seconds. I would have heard that that must have been entertaining. Oh it was

[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.000]
Hey, Neil. Yeah, good to see you up here, man. Well, thanks a lot now. You coming out to West Shore tomorrow

[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.140]
Hey, listen great talking. I just will be the cup signs that

[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.780]
That I see I called about five weeks ago

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.400]
Couple of signs I see that says that you are going big time Robert is that

[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.240]
You're you're getting a lot of commercial airtime and and it's very difficult to get through to you guys in the lines now

[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.440]
Well, thank you very much. So keep up the good work and Neil

[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.780]
Have a happy trails down back down to Miami and God bless you my son. See you man. Okay. By the way, I got a report that

[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.460]
The buzz in the lobby at WFLA's battle

[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.860]
Yeah, the buzz in the lobby was a laceter and Rogers everybody was talking

[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.900]
Because a lot of people didn't know that I was back or that you were on over here and everybody kept saying to everybody else

[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.480]
I'd worth echoed hall last Tuesday night for for their battle the talk show. Oh, oh, yeah

[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.360]
The battle of the talk show has come. Yeah, what a catching in that it really is a must-emade opi really happy

[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.960]
All that promotion very well

[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.420]
They are pathetic and thanks to channel 13 by the way who did a really nice segment that they came out to shortses and peed all over us for like hours

[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.780]
and did about two minutes on the 11 o'clock news last time and then some guy named opi apparently showed up and smashed their windows and afterwards

[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.860]
I wouldn't be surprised if I triggered that guy. I don't want to admit it

[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.020]
But you know, he did show up around midnight the segment came on at 11 o'8 then probably I triggered something inside of that came

[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.760]
Maybe it was his David Katen like

[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.400]
inner

[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.040]
repressed emotions. I didn't see the bit that I get a lot of airtime

[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.140]
The top of your your ball spot was on air and she had my face. It was a Neil Rogers piece

[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.760]
Now they showed your face briefly. I said yeah, the the real fat guys there too shut up on taking calls here. Hello

[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.100]
Hello, hello. Yeah, I

[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.920]
Yes, I just wanted to share my feelings about your show and and Neil

[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.280]
Uh-huh, I just don't don't like Neil at all. Oh, why not? It's a problem. I feel so

[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.900]
I like you a lot better

[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.920]
Well, guess what guess what sir next week you'll be here all by himself. I'll have those charcoal those certificates to give away

[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.920]
We'll be back in Miami with all the other heathens and you can rest easy

[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.660]
Well, we won't be here intruding on your space. He got to understand

[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.500]
Got to understand that after you're taking off of that crap it starts

[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.120]
What about you have Randy Rhodes disease? What the man speak?

[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.160]
Yeah, what's what does he have to hear it? It's not a clock in the morning and the man is in coherent does he has Randy

[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.200]
Rose and doggy downers. Well, why don't you take the paper towels and the spritzer over there and go clean up the studio

[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.460]
Me when Neil Neil doesn't want to hear something he's not gonna let the person speak go right ahead take all the time you like and I just

[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.320]
I don't I don't think you

[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.820]
Kiss your butt. Yeah, I don't want to kiss his butt or your is either sir. Okay. I'm not into the

[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.780]
Out of the matter with my fight. I don't want to kiss it. Why not even your in-laws don't want to kill your wife said

[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.100]
Somebody could kiss it last night about that car. She's still frosted about

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.320]
Oh, tell me I tried to make make a light of it to try to loosen her up a little bit

[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.880]
I said you're one of the people that mentioned it to her

[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.000]
Oh

[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.080]
A match made in heaven this can now this can try can try my ass

[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.400]
Bony just calm down relax just take a deep breath on your head another problem that can't you stick a relaxed spot

[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.500]
Oh, you can't touch good

[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.260]
So you should have been here earlier because like a George and boy cheese were off the hall and

[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.040]
George was gossiping left and right about boy Gary eyes. It is not it is not

[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.960]
It's true and the funny thing is gossiping about boy boy was saying a boy Gary does that some boy Gary does that does no

[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.700]
He doesn't well. I know he does but the funny thing is is the boy cheese

[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.180]
Listen to this walking turdburgers. He does have Randy Rhodes disease in a

[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.680]
Decadement to the future of the isn't there any known cure?

[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.980]
Isn't there some kind of vibe you know of injection we can give him?

[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.680]
They'll be stuck in Judea Park so anyway like I'm saying

[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.140]
Boy, Jesus ended up in the hall shaking his head going on

[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.140]
He's stuck in perpetual park and virtually everything that George is saying is stuff that boy cheese does and boy

[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.840]
Jesus out there. Oh, that's terrible. I don't know how you work under those conditions. Oh, I feel so sorry for you. Oh

[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.320]
It was absolutely disgusting. I've never seen anything like in my entire life

[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.880]
I was not you're not gonna say anything. What am I gonna say to respond to that?

[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.920]
What would it be the purpose why would I waste my time? Why would I dig my mind? George when I come on it came on the air and said this

[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.640]
I said boy you should have heard what I just heard out there then George. I mean, oh he's on the air

[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.700]
No, I didn't say that. No, I didn't say that what would you totally intimidate about you?

[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.760]
Now should I do my attack on the bird now or should I wait for 105?

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.380]
I guess I'll wait there's no point doing that for eight or twice what an asshole you are bird brain

[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.560]
What an idiot. I thought he was gonna be here for a couple of days in fact Monday. I'll confess I

[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.080]
Invited him to come back. We had a pretty good time Tuesday was a debacle. It was a disaster

[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.080]
He started bringing some of the old rodents out of the woodworking. I thought well, okay. Let's not press our luck

[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.620]
We went out to park him out at two o'clock. I said thanks have a great day drive carefully

[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.040]
But I never expecting to see him in here again. When's the morning? I'm sitting here with you. I'm gonna shut that off

[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.380]
I can't stay there because it can be my show

[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.500]
It is so bulky

[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.300]
What's this obsession with hockey?

[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.960]
So you're saying so anyway, I'm sitting here and it's like a quarter to ten

[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.920]
I look around all of a sudden here he is again. Yeah, I said I didn't think you were coming in today

[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.440]
He said neither did I

[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.420]
He did it. I

[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.380]
How you do that well. Yeah, and then there's day he's here again

[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.940]
Yeah, feeding him and feeding him and feeding him and you can tell the audience is like foaming at the mouth and George

[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:24.640]
Tells me like 80% of the people are calling down there who are bitching about when the hell is he going back to Lakeland and getting the hell off the show

[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.800]
So then he and George apparently

[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.380]
It's all the time though. I finish with one story. You are the biggest loud mouth just smokey

[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.080]
Randy Rhodes is smoke your bag if they're in shut up for a minute. Will you blob all right?

[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.720]
So he you know can't just leave here yesterday

[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.440]
It you know, let's say at the end of the show. Well, it's been fun

[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.960]
I'm not coming back tomorrow. It's been enough

[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:50.220]
But you know thanks for the lunch and thanks for the memories. No sticking around a while to suck around with Rick and suds under the

[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.460]
Guys of well, he wants to talk about some of the local personalities Jack Harris

[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.320]
Like I don't know who Jack Harris is right and all this other crap and he spent about 30 seconds on that

[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:05.920]
He spent about 30 seconds saying the channel 13 is the best local news of any station in America and we do love all our friends

[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.340]
The channel 13 who love us to a point of almost neurosis. They're good

[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:17.820]
But to make a statement like that is so asinine as to be absurd rhymes with turd and bird and then he goes it launches into the whole

[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:23.520]
The real reason for him staying here is a ledge camaraderie with suds because he says well

[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.780]
You know suds being a sidekick is such a tough job and you have to walk that fine line

[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:29.920]
and

[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.500]
Goes through this whole

[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:39.740]
Self-aggrandizing thing and sucking around about how their show on driving should be in the broadcasting hall of fame and about suds is such a great and of course

[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.460]
You know when Neil used to be out sick. I used to fill in for him and just like you suds. It was always a great show

[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.640]
And the audience is out there just spitting blood. You can just see them

[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.640]
Just fuming and saying get the hell out of there already go the most self-flags

[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.400]
He still lives in perpetual denial

[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.100]
Distributed like he just lives in a state he doesn't want to admit that he was canned by me not by Disney

[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.480]
Oh speaking of Disney boy, that's gonna be a great story. What?

[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.580]
The WCKG story still going on. I talked to food last night and he didn't really have any details

[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:17.720]
He said it's still going on so apparently we don't know the guys names litigation. I did I forget it to tell you the truth

[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.960]
He was in Minneapolis. Oh, it was a different right big dude in the studio

[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.280]
No, I wasn't taught he was doing some type of an FM you know morning music kind of show

[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.500]
And that's what it was higher for what you guy like that should be doing a sports show 350 a year

[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.840]
Have you told a story on the year? Yeah. Oh, I love it. Yeah
