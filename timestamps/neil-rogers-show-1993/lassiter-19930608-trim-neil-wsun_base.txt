[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]
I understand they were working before.

[00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.380]
What are you doing?

[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.840]
First of all, you're in the wrong path.

[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.720]
I am.

[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.400]
I thought they're all over here.

[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.820]
How come it's not doing?

[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.480]
I don't know.

[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.900]
They were working earlier because I was playing stuff

[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.580]
out of them earlier, because they really

[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.500]
sounded like crap in mind.

[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.180]
So they have to be in your emotions.

[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.460]
Kara, did you buy any chance to switch in the other room

[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.780]
that would control this?

[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.680]
These car machines they were working earlier?

[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.420]
No, I can't do anything about it.

[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.640]
Wait a minute.

[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.520]
Wait a minute.

[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.620]
I've learned on hand.

[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.520]
There we were.

[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.140]
He's the guy who makes dumb, Delaware's cry.

[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.080]
He likes to think he's dead.

[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.040]
I was a geek.

[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.080]
I was a geek.

[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.960]
I was a geek.

[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.700]
I was a geek.

[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.840]

[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.000]
And then you got to be head geek here.

[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.320]
Yes.

[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.920]
And so I became head geek.

[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.280]
Well, you see, in essence, what you have just heard

[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.640]
is for off-practical purposes.

[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.060]
That was the entire hour that I did with our beloved

[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.900]
operations manager, Boy Cheese.

[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.440]
We thought we'll put him on for an hour.

[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.200]
People will rip the hell out of him.

[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.660]
You know, it was a Monday type of thing.

[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.420]
You know what Monday's are.

[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.700]
Yeah, we had calls about that.

[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.680]
Really did.

[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800]
Even the Japanese never saw a bomb that big.

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.600]
Oh my God, it was absolutely horrible.

[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.620]
I mean, he would put him on the air.

[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.500]
It was his idea.

[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.220]
Said he's lacking in certain social graces.

[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.840]
Well, that's true.

[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.580]
Speaking is one of them.

[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.600]
Well, yes, it is.

[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.240]
One and two word answers.

[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.280]
And that tape that you just heard was like about a 15-minute segment

[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.640]
of my trying to fill time.

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.500]
And so after you worked with Syracuse, Tom, where did you go then?

[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.780]

[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.620]
And in Milwaukee, Tom, what were some of your duties?

[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.080]
I was a geek.

[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.660]
That's it.

[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.660]
That's the whole thing.

[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.760]
Here comes again.

[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.180]
Look out.

[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.520]
Look out.

[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.920]
That was a geek.

[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.080]
That was a geek.

[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.840]
That was a geek.

[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.560]
That was a geek.

[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.880]
And then you got to be head geek here.

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.180]
Yes.

[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.740]
And so I became head geek.

[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.340]
I really glad you're enjoying that.

[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.820]
It's a I love it.

[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.460]
Oh, God.

[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.340]
What are you eating now?

[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.140]
A little tuna salad with cheese.

[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.060]
All of it is my breakfast and lunch now.

[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.360]
I know.

[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.020]
No, he said he said that has to last for the afternoon.

[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.680]
I said, I don't want to have lunch.

[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.640]
Oh, OK.

[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.120]
No, not the whole night.

[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.840]
You eat all of it now.

[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.520]
Oh, OK.

[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.920]
That's good.

[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.540]
Schwartz has brought in a tray of sandwiches

[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.680]
that, oh, God, all might be the June made unbelievable.

[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.020]
June has this talent with sandwiches.

[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.860]
She basically takes two pieces of bread

[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.940]
and nine pounds of meat.

[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.240]
A little bit of lettuce, maybe sometimes

[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.580]
some special sauce or mayonnaise.

[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.400]
And man, oh, man, oh, man.

[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.360]
I thought my grandmother.

[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.300]
Oh, anyway, if there's any horny guys out there

[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.380]
that are really desperate, just walk around the parking

[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.820]
line at the Mary Out West Shore at night.

[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.780]
And just pretend you're trying to find the dollhouse guarantee.

[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.560]
Why are you soliciting on the air again?

[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.760]
I'm not soliciting you.

[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.280]
Oh, you think I like your nose here?

[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.980]
You're looking for hookers.

[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.140]
Well, no, I thought you said horny guys, you know?

[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.940]
I didn't know that you were working for the hookers.

[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.320]
I'd say I'm thinking about your anal fixation.

[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.800]
And let's take a call or two, shall we?

[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.340]
Oh, you have any?

[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.960]
Yes, of course I have calls.

[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.600]
They haven't caught all that you're on yet.

[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.820]
The calls yesterday for a Monday.

[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.800]
Yes, we did.

[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.520]
Let's go to Greenleaf.

[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.100]
You know, I'm saving your ass up here, man.

[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.820]
You don't have to worry about being embarrassed

[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.980]
with this type of thing anymore.

[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.200]
Let's go to Greenleaf.

[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.360]
I green your on the air at WSUN.

[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.240]
Hey, Buenos, too.

[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.840]
You're high, Neil.

[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.580]
How are you doing?

[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.320]
How are you doing?

[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.800]
Great.

[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.380]
I'm so happy you're up here.

[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.060]
I love it here.

[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.980]
I was driving across the Howard Franklin Bridge this morning,

[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.920]
and I was thinking how much I really love it here.

[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.160]
I don't think I'd want to live here, but I love it here.

[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.980]
Why wouldn't you want to live here?

[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.440]
I wouldn't mind being here like Monday through Friday

[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.680]
working here and then going home on the weekend

[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.080]
as much as I like of whatever I want.

[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.740]
Yeah.

[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.100]
That sounds great.

[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.900]
And even cars that she dressed curt in a tank top in spaces.

[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.800]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.660]
Listen, I just wanted to tell you, I don't know.

[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.740]
If there's anybody that needs a little son, it's that kid.

[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.800]
I'm telling you, he is the pastiest looking human being

[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.900]
I've ever seen in my life.

[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.620]
Yeah, but for the...

[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.900]
He looks like Bella Legosi suck every drop of blood

[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.860]
out of that kid's body.

[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.600]
Yeah, but by the time he's 40 years,

[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.520]
he'll still have skin and soft as a baby's ass.

[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.200]
If you can imagine a 40-year-old baby.

[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.560]
Yeah.

[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.960]
Listen, I just wanted to tell you the guy,

[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.400]
the evil man who is up here

[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.560]
said nasty things about you guys in Orlando, talk radio.

[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.180]
Who's that?

[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.460]
Jim Phillips.

[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.600]
No, Jim.

[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.820]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.240]
He's a blacklist.

[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.460]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.000]
Yeah, Phillips.

[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.620]
But listen.

[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.220]
Another pretender, another one of the great pretenders.

[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.720]
All those guys heard that little station

[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.040]
has just had a hemorrhage.

[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.920]
They've thrown people off the air left and right,

[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.660]
top to bottom, it's incredible.

[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.040]
Well, isn't that Buddy Bud station?

[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400]
Yeah, well, what do you expect?

[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.800]
It just got lost though.

[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.640]
Pretty soon they're going to be doing headline news

[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.940]
24 hours a day again.

[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.900]
No, actually Buddy Bud just sold it.

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.440]
Oh, Danny.

[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.960]
Yes, what?

[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.380]
I never got my coupon for charcoal.

[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.680]
Are you serious?

[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.800]
Which is the real person?

[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.240]
Oh my god.

[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.840]
No, it isn't.

[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.480]
Because I didn't want to.

[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.860]
Why the hell did you bitch in Mona?

[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.460]
Kara, she's a charcoal bitch.

[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.600]
Because we love Kara.

[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.780]
We only bitch in Mona too on her orders.

[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.720]
Oh, man, is she giving me dirty looks?

[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.620]
Oh my god, is she?

[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.180]
Now she's waving a finger at me.

[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.220]
Is she?

[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.880]
Yes.

[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.320]
What?

[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.940]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, one second here,

[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.240]
call it.

[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.440]
What's the problem, Kara?

[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.140]
Why are these people getting their charcoal?

[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.900]
I told you it's promotions.

[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.060]
It's velvita.

[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.160]
There is no promotion at this date.

[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.900]
It's velvita.

[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.920]
It's velvita's a pig.

[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.240]
Yes, he is.

[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.460]
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll give you back to Kara.

[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.920]
We'll try to get this straight now.

[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.860]
We'll throw in a refrigerator magnet for you too.

[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.380]
Hey Neil.

[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.880]
Yeah.

[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.600]
We love you.

[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.840]
576 WSU in in Penelope.

[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.980]
Oh.

[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.840]
Oh.

[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.860]
He's a Lanciter.

[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.740]
You better worry.

[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.520]
He may get scrappy.

[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.060]
God, you really polished off that food, something fierce.

[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.340]
Whoa.

[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.820]
I'd say shorts.

[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.020]
Thanks a lot, shorts.

[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.960]
Thanks a lot, shorts.

[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.740]
Thanks a lot, shorts.

[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.120]
Thanks a lot, June, who put together that sandwich that you just devoured there.

[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.960]
Unbelievable.

[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.820]
And I, what the hell, let's take some more phone calls, why not?

[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.760]
Let's go to Tampa.

[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.320]
Hi, Tampa.

[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.580]
You're on there at WSUN.

[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.480]
Hello, Tampa.

[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.500]
Tampa wants.

[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.260]
I can hear you groaning there, Tampa.

[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.620]
Hello.

[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.740]
Yes, yes.

[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.620]
Yes, yes, why?

[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.880]
This is a sample.

[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.820]
This is a sible.

[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.100]
Is that what you said?

[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.540]
Are you doing it, Sible?

[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.260]
Yeah, we're never going to...

[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.060]
Sible or simple?

[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.480]
No, man.

[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.720]
Simple.

[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.920]
Oh, a sible.

[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.580]
Yeah.

[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.940]
What's shaking the head, Sible?

[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.100]
Yes, I give you a call, man.

[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.900]
So, my complaint is gone to you.

[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.640]
Yeah.

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.000]
Yeah.

[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.480]
And you want the money?

[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.700]
Yeah.

[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.640]
And what's the answer?

[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.080]
Well, I'll take it.

[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.140]
You could win a million dollars if you give us the right answer.

[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.680]
What is it?

[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.200]
Oh, this is a bonus.

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.220]
And the shoe I like to have in the same bag.

[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.480]
Yeah.

[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.880]
And what's the answer, Selma?

[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.400]
Well, that's a good question.

[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.180]
Man, we've been searching for it for years and years and years.

[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.700]
Just as soon as Neil and I figured out we're getting the hell out of the business man,

[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.880]
we were counting on you to tell it.

[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.760]
Yeah, it could get calls like this.

[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.360]
I'd be up to a one-share in this market.

[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.920]
Oh, you would.

[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.160]
You got me there.

[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.020]
Now, I got you.

[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.920]
That's it.

[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.240]
Yeah.

[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.140]
That's it.

[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.160]
That's it, man.

[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.700]
I'll hang it, Selma.

[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.360]
Huh?

[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.340]
I said, see ya.

[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.920]
Oh.

[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.140]
934.

[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.300]
God, you just bring up the best of the callers, man.

[00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.880]
I tell you.

[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.040]
I bet you that Yahoo preacher guy is going to call back again after 10.

[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.520]
I bet you're for his third call of the day.

[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.160]
He doesn't call back on a real retentive.

[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.060]
Yeah, but when I'm in town, man, he gets to the hots.

[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.280]
He can't control himself.

[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.620]
God, almighty, look who's here.

[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.440]
Look who's here.

[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.040]
Come on in.

[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.800]
He can come in.

[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.220]
It's okay.

[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:16.900]
Oh.

[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.620]
God.

[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.360]
Well, I'm in.

[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.920]
He heard the phone was here already.

[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.200]
Yeah, let's get him in here while the food is still fresh.

[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.560]
He can't hear while the food is still fresh.

[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.940]
Oh, I tell you the first is walked in.

[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.980]
Oh, what a celebrity cast here today.

[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.520]
We didn't do a good job for yesterday.

[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.200]
So today, uh, Schwartz is monitoring the food yesterday.

[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.560]
Did you?

[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.120]
He got food.

[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.220]
I didn't need to.

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.560]
I would try my best behavior.

[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.360]
Who brought you the food?

[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.140]
They wouldn't tell it.

[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.780]
No, because it wasn't a sponsor, right?

[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.920]
But it was okay.

[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.380]
They wouldn't tell you because somebody goes out of his,

[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.900]
out of his way to free food down here for free.

[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.580]
If they marry out west, you're actually good.

[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.040]
And they all even go all over the world.

[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.600]
It's the second and third time you said that.

[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.100]
There you go.

[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.880]
There's nothing.

[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.520]
Yes.

[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.000]
No.

[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.500]
No, I'm paying for my own food.

[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.720]
What the hell are you going on and on and on and on about it?

[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.660]
I never knew you'd a rave about food you paid for.

[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.040]
It's okay.

[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.840]
Have you ever known you'd a rave about food you paid for?

[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.860]
Now that you mentioned it.

[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.200]
No.

[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.520]
No, it is good.

[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.120]
For hotels.

[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.660]
Okay, let's go to Tampa.

[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.560]
Hi, Tampa. You're on the air.

[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.360]
It's a WSUN.

[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.600]
Morning, Bob.

[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.820]
Good morning, Tampa.

[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.580]
Morning, I tell you, sir.

[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.680]
And you guys together.

[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.920]
This is really a beautiful thing.

[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.640]
A beautiful thing.

[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.600]
I'm telling that if we could do this all the time.

[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.940]
Uh, Neil and the bird and I could just do a radio show.

[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.500]
We probably have this sucker up to, uh, what?

[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.180]
You figure about it.

[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.660]
Two two.

[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.980]
Two one, two two, um, two two.

[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.240]
What do you think as well?

[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:27.960]
What do you think?

[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.360]
Excuse me.

[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.040]
There's a radio show going on.

[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:30.940]
You're talking about this.

[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.120]
How this is worse than Miami?

[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.060]
This is worse than Miami.

[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:34.500]
Here.

[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:34.860]
Here.

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.720]
You're talking out loud.

[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.580]
I heard what he said.

[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.000]
You got to hear what he said when I was taking this office.

[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.740]
What did he say?

[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.940]
He said something about, I was talking about the magnets.

[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:43.420]
Yeah.

[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.400]
He doesn't know why you did that.

[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.320]
He doesn't know why I did it.

[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.740]
And I said, well, you have to get out the razor blade and cut the

[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.820]
some country thing off the bottom of these magnets.

[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.140]
He said, no, Bob can do that.

[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.860]
He's got no calls in here anyway.

[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.760]
That's what he said.

[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.220]
He hate you like poisoned.

[00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.880]
Bob, can I have a magnet?

[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.540]
Sure.

[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.060]
You're right.

[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:01.940]
Oh, great.

[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:02.720]
Look at it.

[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.340]
Oh, I'm going to stop.

[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.480]
I was debating about coming back here.

[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:07.720]
Here.

[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.420]
I'm going to stop.

[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:08.640]
I was debating about coming back here.

[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:08.640]

[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.580]
A bag of charcoal.

[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.100]
A magnet.

[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.280]
And about 20 or 30.

[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.940]
A little bit.

[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.600]
That miserable, little son of a, he's coming in here with snapple

[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.760]
for the other people.

[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.000]
I see an empty bottle over there.

[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.320]
No, I buy that.

[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.280]
I buy that.

[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.860]
I mean, here's the cap with a price zone.

[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.200]
I buy it coming in in the morning.

[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:24.860]
Where do you buy it?

[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.800]
It's 7-11 up the screen.

[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.300]
Circle K.

[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.180]
Circle K.

[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.440]
And here's your charcoal.

[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:28.980]
Yeah.

[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.400]
You didn't tell me that I'd get a magnet if I came back.

[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.380]
Well, I didn't want to promise too many things.

[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.800]
I just like to figure it out.

[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.300]
The old one with the gorilla is no thank you.

[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.640]
Oh, Randy left a place like a toilet after Rick left it like, you know, a bigger toilet.

[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.540]
Ben, I work with Slombs.

[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.060]
You ought to see it out.

[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.820]
You think this is a toilet?

[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.520]
You ought to see it.

[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:46.700]
It's a toilet.

[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.020]
I think somebody threw away the Q-sheet for the new rock comedy album.

[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.620]
Oh, nice.

[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.180]
That's gone.

[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.560]
It was sitting right in here.

[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.820]
That's gone now.

[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.400]
Somebody threw away my JNJ.

[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.460]
There's more stuff than you.

[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.080]
That Camaro cut is good.

[00:09:59.340 --> 00:09:59.340]

[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.760]
What was the one we played yesterday today?

[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.060]
Today, it was good.

[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.960]
Yeah, I heard that.

[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.100]
That was good.

[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.280]
It's coming up again today, 20 or 30 times.

[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:09.980]
What's wrong with that?

[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.960]
How come I can hear the colors when they're all right?

[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.920]
And I can't hear the colors when the pubs are...

[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.900]
No, we still have a caller on there.

[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.300]
I'm sorry, we forgot all about you.

[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:19.700]
You there?

[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.100]
He's a caller, she's a tremendous...

[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.460]
Oh, we can't hear this guy.

[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.460]
I can hear nothing.

[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.080]
I'm calling you because I really need a...

[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.240]
You need a wife?

[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.340]
I need a magnet.

[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.340]
You need a...

[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.380]
I had a two-year-old come visit me the other day.

[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:30.720]
Yeah.

[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.680]
Which is nice mother.

[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.360]
I mean, kids suck, but especially when they're two.

[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.200]
Tell me about him, man.

[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.720]
I had them tied a year ago.

[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:37.980]
Tell me to this mother.

[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.940]
I really dig his mother.

[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.480]
She's beautiful.

[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.320]
How old is this kid?

[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.080]
The kids, too.

[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:41.780]
Oh, too.

[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.380]
Now, we have the famous WSU and toilet magnets.

[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.720]
Oh, you stick on the jazz.

[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.500]
Tell me.

[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.860]
This kid is something.

[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.680]
I mean, I'm in a living room.

[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.040]
Well, the kids in the living room with his mom,

[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.200]
and I figure she's watching them.

[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.760]
And I'm out there just hiding my bones because the kids here,

[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.000]
you know, I'm to drink the warm water.

[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.300]
I'm just having a good day.

[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.600]
And what did the kid do?

[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.080]
He picks up an atomizer, a spray bottle that my roommate,

[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.360]
girlfriend here, and sprays her hair down.

[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.460]
And he goes over and emulates his mother with Windex

[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.600]
and sprays down my TV.

[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.960]
But of course, there's no soap in it.

[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:10.980]
So it goes into the TV.

[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.240]
Shorts the whole TV out.

[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.120]
Oh, man.

[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.020]
I'm gonna be 100 bucks.

[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.360]
God.

[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.680]
The worst thing that happened was when I go back into kitchen.

[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.080]
Yeah.

[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.700]
I look on my refrigerator, and your picture and neopictures

[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.360]
there with magnets.

[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.220]
He took your picture down later.

[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.200]
He wiped.

[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.560]
He's my magnet.

[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.040]
And he puts my lipstick all over the refrigerator.

[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.520]
I know all over the, your picture.

[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.320]
Oh.

[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.120]
I'm gonna have to come and see you, Sarah,

[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.440]
and I hope you have more pictures to hand.

[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.900]
Oh, yes, sure.

[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:35.800]
Sure.

[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.460]
Oh, okay, man.

[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.200]
Look, let me hand you back to Cara.

[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.020]
That's the saddest dance story.

[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.700]
What a lucky day it is that, you know,

[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.100]
this is a refrigerator magnet day here at the station.

[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.540]
That's really lucky for you.

[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.560]
Nice talking to you guys.

[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.000]
Okay.

[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.540]
Just another Tom Zelvita idea and presentation.

[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.400]
Those refrigerator magnets.

[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.140]
When I came in this morning, and Cara said, you know,

[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.200]
hey, Bob, we got 600 of these refrigerator magnets

[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.760]
to give away.

[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.640]
I said, are you serious?

[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.060]
This is as big a bomb as the charcoal giveaway.

[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.660]
And, yes, that's right, Cara.

[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.800]
He's number one, honey.

[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.180]
That Tom Zelvita.

[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.400]
He is number one in my book.

[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.900]
Go to Newport, Richie, a bill.

[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.060]
Bill, is that you?

[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.300]
Oh, Newport Richie, Bill.

[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:17.760]
Hello.

[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:19.700]
Hello.

[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.200]

[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.740]
Yeah, hi.

[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:21.600]
Hello.

[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.880]
Oh, it's not Bill.

[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.600]
No, how come every time I call you think it's Bill?

[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.180]
Well, we just get real excited when we see Newport Richie

[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:28.800]
up on the screen.

[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:29.780]
It's a little lady.

[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.160]
Well, oh, I had told the little lady from Newport Richie.

[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.240]
I'm doing fine in the fight and get over the shorts

[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.920]
as you're gonna eat yellow for dessert.

[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.920]
Oh, you're gonna bring us dessert?

[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.160]
So I carry calls to Newcastle.

[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.440]
Start for you, yellow.

[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.480]
Oh, that's sweet.

[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.540]
How was your sense of indiatry?

[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.460]
Pretty good.

[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.320]
Pretty good.

[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.200]
You know, the things that I went out of my way to look for,

[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.120]
that was a disaster.

[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.920]
But, that is so, I felt so old.

[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.100]
Yes, yes.

[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.980]
You know, especially when that shopping center that had disappeared

[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.260]
and I stopped and asked about it.

[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.480]
And people looked at me like I was crazy.

[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.180]
Like, just as this has been gone for decades, fella.

[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.340]
Hey, and you tell those guys that when Randy talks at night,

[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.520]
she says she cleans up her place every night when she comes in

[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.100]
at some level.

[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.900]
No, I think she cleans up her apartment every night.

[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.980]
No, she cleans up the office where she works every night.

[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.520]
She picks up her papers, does cleans around wherever she talks from.

[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.800]
Well, I'm telling you, she left this place so bad last night

[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.300]
that the FM morning mama complained.

[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.920]
Well, you have to forgive her today because she had a bad sunburn.

[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.040]
Oh, that's why she, oh, okay.

[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.700]
Yeah, you have to forgive her today.

[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.680]
Well, forgive her then.

[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.080]
She said she was cooked.

[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.120]
If you ask me to forgive her, all forgive her.

[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.760]
Well, you can look over your shoulder.

[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.900]
I may be haunting you when you're eating your dinner.

[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:41.780]
Great way.

[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.760]
You're nice, Sharon, from him.

[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.860]
Don't forget.

[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.500]
I want one of your, one of your magas.

[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.520]
Oh, you want one of the refrigerator magas, okay.

[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.780]
God, you see there are so popular kneel.

[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.120]
What were you next to one if you say it?

[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.640]
Would you, maybe I could have cut it to you.

[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.120]
It's all we did to get a few of those refrigerator magas for your show.

[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:57.380]
Yeah.

[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.400]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:58.940]
See ya.

[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.260]
Oh, you're going to love this one, Neil.

[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.740]
You're going to love this one.

[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:03.960]
What?

[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.100]
Every time you give away those magnets, I have to sit in the thing and chop them up.

[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.680]
No, you're giving away the warm ones.

[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:12.820]
No, we're not.

[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.280]
That's what I want to give away.

[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.260]
He says, no.

[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.160]
Why not?

[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.320]
It's promoting the the worm, man.

[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.640]
That way, you can't repeat what he just said.

[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.780]
That way you can put down on your little sheet of Bob Neil.

[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.040]
You know, you had all this time to promote the worm and it didn't cost anything.

[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.160]
You'll get brownie points.

[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.120]
My God, the next time he comes down, I'll buy you a Coca-Cola.

[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.000]
That'll be great, Tommy.

[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.580]
Just great.

[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.940]
Let's go to, um...

[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.200]
Oh, geez, you're going to love this, Neil.

[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.740]
How low, Rose.

[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:40.940]
Hello, baby.

[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.460]
Oh, how you doing, honey?

[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.440]
How was your vacation?

[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.660]
Long time no here.

[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.240]
Pretty good.

[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.000]
Yeah, well, I don't want to be a chronic.

[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.800]
No, you're not a chronic rose.

[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.380]
God forbid.

[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.840]
Hey, super Neil.

[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.600]
Why don't you ever call me, I'll show any more, Rosie.

[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.860]
You want to accept my call.

[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.260]
Right.

[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.980]
Well, hold your belt, then you're nose or something when you call.

[00:14:59.160 --> 00:14:59.820]
Try to trick George.

[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.640]
You know what?

[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.540]
He always liked my calls.

[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.000]
He never said one thing bad about my calls.

[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.600]
All of a sudden, one day, he hates me.

[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.100]
Oh, no.

[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.740]
I'm really glad that you were a chronic that called 600 times a day all over the radio dial.

[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.220]
We don't call for a call.

[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.720]
Yeah, but you only call one time per station.

[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.080]
That's for hours.

[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.460]
That's not true.

[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.220]
You only call last or about every three weeks, stupid Neil.

[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:20.660]
Yeah.

[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.400]
Well, it's only been about a week and a half this time, Rosie.

[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:23.720]
Yeah.

[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.280]
At Bitchy Rose.

[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.300]
Neil's a bitch.

[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:25.940]
Yeah.

[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.920]
Yeah, you are.

[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.560]
Uh-huh.

[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.180]
Now Rose, remember what happened the last time you got into a scream and shout-

[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.640]
Max with somebody on the radio.

[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.080]
See what in a second here.

[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:35.580]
chronic.

[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.140]
Do you remember Rose?

[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.620]
What happened the last time?

[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.200]
No.

[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.940]
Yeah, he taped it.

[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.600]
It was me and Bill.

[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.060]
And what happened to Bill?

[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:43.760]
He died.

[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.060]
That's right.

[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.460]
Well, don't you get your lesson, don't you go call and, uh, Neil, any names or nothing,

[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.040]
now Rose?

[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.440]
Hey, really, Bob, would I die or Neil die?

[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.120]
I don't know.

[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.060]
Neil would die.

[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.100]
Well, I'm dying from the call already Rose.

[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.680]
I already died a couple of days ago.

[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.880]
He wasn't getting any calls with.

[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.040]
Yeah.

[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.300]
So wish he could be on a 10 in the morning.

[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.140]
We're working on it, Rose.

[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.040]
I think he should.

[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.400]
We thought that we thought that the refrigerator magnets would do it today, but he is, uh, he's survived

[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.860]
and is in great shape.

[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.940]
Now, it's just too early, but if you can make it a six-bobby, you can make it anywhere

[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.340]
and anyhow.

[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.480]
That's right, Rose.

[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.800]
944, the time you can land on AM620 and I look up and there's a furry.

[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.120]
A little friend out there eating out of the, more to go.

[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.340]
And it's just about time to take it.

[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.940]
So we better run, cram in some calls here.

[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.540]
Let's go to Sarasota, hi there, Sarasota, you're on the air.

[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.600]
Hey, Bob, morning.

[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.580]
Good morning.

[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.200]
How you, Neil?

[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.380]
It wants to know how you are, Neil.

[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.760]
How great, great.

[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:39.360]

[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:39.600]
Oh, good.

[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.060]
He didn't have his headphones on yet, sir.

[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.300]
Anyway, I felt like a real jerk this morning, you know.

[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.260]
I would have said, hold up, but that's where I could pick up the phone and I called it.

[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:47.740]
Yeah.

[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.380]
Now, look down on my roller dexon.

[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.820]
I was dialing the IOD number.

[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.180]
Yeah, we got them both on them.

[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.660]
They're both W. I got them both on the same way.

[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.560]
I'm chucked in the answer.

[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:57.780]
Nobody answered.

[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.680]
I'll be damned.

[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.620]
I had a call down there this morning and nobody answered.

[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.500]
Neil, did you hear that?

[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:02.940]
Anyway, that was the 800 number.

[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.340]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I gave you something.

[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.380]
I followed you up north and I was up in New York here.

[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.860]
You were the one following me.

[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.740]
And I got to hear the big Howard sperm for the first time.

[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:14.940]
What'd you think?

[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:20.120]
Well, I had a ran a car and I drifted across the dial and it wasn't on the automatic key.

[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.360]
And then I had to sort of search it out.

[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.100]
I was in Newark and on he came.

[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.540]
That's one thing that's just a weak edge.

[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.260]
A lot of time.

[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:27.780]
Hey, Ron.

[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.980]
He's on a station called K-Rotting.

[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.660]
Yeah, right.

[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.060]
And I thought, if you guys ever thought you had a whole bunch of people in the studio at one time,

[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.180]
he brings in a whole box.

[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.960]
He's going to have it as some people to do the show with him.

[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.220]
He does.

[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.620]
Plus a lot of people off the air doing a drink.

[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.520]
He was down on the floor getting a massage from his gal who sent in nude pictures from Cleveland.

[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.800]
And he flew her in and talking all about the different ways they do things in Cleveland.

[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.620]
And he got all the time.

[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.920]
They do it differently in Cleveland.

[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:55.680]
I think so.

[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.600]
You only do about this Niel.

[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:56.980]
Please.

[00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.860]
Anyways, Mother Call, did you ever heard that bit?

[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.940]
His mother called.

[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.720]
Oh, she ripped some of the other ones.

[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.640]
I mean, she says, powered, boring, boring, show this one.

[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.320]
I mean, you know, it's horrible.

[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.840]
Well, Cara's mother calls her on the dark hole.

[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.060]
Maybe that's where she got the stun from or maybe it's where Howard got it from.

[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.740]
Maybe Howard's been listening to the dark hole.

[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.280]
Randy's mother calls her on here too.

[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.540]
That's when the Niel started calling.

[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:18.540]

[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.780]
Well, when her mom started calling.

[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.760]
Yeah, but I'll tell you, it was a different show.

[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.520]
It's really different.

[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.220]
Sounds different.

[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.000]
Cram was commercials and there's big bites of them.

[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.440]
I'll run back and forth in Niel.

[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.560]
A lot of promo and stuff and comedy acts and stuff.

[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.680]
Yeah, well, we don't do that kind of radio here, man.

[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.000]
But anyhow, these guys are bad influence on you.

[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.020]
Bob, coming up from Miami.

[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:36.820]
Do you think so?

[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.500]
How old are they?

[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.260]
All they do is eat and eat and eat.

[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:40.640]
What do you mean?

[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.040]
I'm the one that's been getting the food for them.

[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.060]
They didn't get any food on their own.

[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.460]
Oh, but boy, they all eat.

[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.700]
Such as a pig.

[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.540]
You know, he's always...

[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.060]
I mean, Niel fed me for years down there, well, months down there in Miami.

[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.380]
And I'm just trying to return the favor.

[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.640]
Well, anyway, all Niel, I was on prodigy with Jim Skyler.

[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.480]
Well, that wasn't for Jim Skyler.

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.420]
That was for prodigy.

[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.860]
He must know you money or something because he was really giving you all sorts of accolades.

[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:06.260]
Great.

[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.040]
Talking to that guy from Milwaukee, to be in WFLA and to evening, he's on there all the time.

[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.200]
Oh, yeah, Jay Marvin.

[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.660]
All the people with no lives are on prodigy, right?

[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.160]
Well, hey, Niel.

[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.340]
Don't do whatever happened to.

[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.140]
That sort of interesting.

[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200]
Name all these names of them.

[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.120]
Yeah, dynamite.

[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.080]
Yeah, like their own names.

[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.300]
What happened to Rob Hyland and Bob Hyland?

[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.040]
He died, I heard.

[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:23.620]
Yes, dead.

[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.240]
Well, thanks for the accolade, man.

[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:25.520]
Okay.

[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.260]
Take care.

[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.300]
All right.

[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.480]
It was Bob Hyland.

[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.520]
Bob Hyland, I don't even know him.

[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.540]
PMOX, St. Louis.

[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.020]
Oh, the General Manager.

[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.520]
I used to call you at three o'clock in the morning because he was just going to bed at that hour, just getting up.

[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.000]
Oh, yeah, just coming into the station.

[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:38.940]
We're out all about him.

[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.160]
Yeah, man.

[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.660]
Pinellas 576 WS U.N., that should do the trick.

[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.920]
Lasseter on A and 620 WS U.N., it's not...

[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.200]
Yeah.

[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.180]
But I'll tell you what, good, brother.

[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:48.540]
Yeah.

[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.460]
I would rather listen to you fart and hear pretty girls sing.

[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.340]
Don't ever do it.

[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.100]
Carabit.

[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.580]
Oh, well, when some loosen.

[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.680]
Let's go to...

[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.260]
I'm a risk card.

[00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:58.820]
It's going to go.

[00:19:59.300 --> 00:19:59.980]
We may have got to go.

[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.760]
Like that last one.

[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.060]
Week.

[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:01.740]
Week.

[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.420]
It's the best he could do.

[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.040]
Week.

[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:05.780]
Who was that?

[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:06.980]
Are you serious?

[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.240]
You didn't recognize that voice?

[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.180]
I had to wait for it to...

[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:11.860]
...cute up again.

[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.640]
Oh, that does have a fast cut.

[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:13.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.280]
Great.

[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.920]
Round and round and round.

[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:17.720]
She goes where?

[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.200]
She's down.

[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:18.900]
Nobody knows.

[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.520]
It's one of those two-second drop-ins on it.

[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.400]
Oh, two-and-a-half minute-card.

[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.080]
That's always fine.

[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:22.980]
But it's cute up, Bob.

[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:23.640]
Yeah, I know.

[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.660]
I was looking for something else.

[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.980]
Well, let's just hear that.

[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.180]
Schwartz.

[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.120]
God.

[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.500]
You don't recognize that voice?

[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:30.980]
Kurt.

[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:31.900]
Yes.

[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.460]
But here, you see, when Kurt's really into what he's doing, this is the kind of enthusiasm

[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.240]
he can have.

[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.480]
Bob, God.

[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.340]
Isn't that great versus...

[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.020]
The beating.

[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.020]
God.

[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.680]
Oh, my God.

[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:46.540]
Let's not go too hard.

[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.480]
Let's not go anywhere.

[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.160]
Let's say...

[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.300]
What is my show?

[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.000]
You were ripping Randy and Ashton.

[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.300]
Nobody heard it earlier this morning.

[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.560]
She did very well.

[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880]
The fact that she's not...

[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.980]
Why is she always bitching about what everybody else is on?

[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:01.820]
Well, since you brought it up, I kind of explained to her this morning that, you know,

[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.540]
23 years and years and years and years of success is what gets you.

[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.700]
The box, a couple of trends, is not exactly what they're doing there.

[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.160]
I know.

[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.540]
She thinks that because she was on she and she was in New York, that has...

[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.140]
No, it has nothing to do with this thing.

[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.240]
Nothing to do with this.

[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.280]
It's a whole new ballgame, honey.

[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.760]
You got to pay your dues, bitch.

[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.720]
That's right.

[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.520]
And, you know, pay them to me and to Neil.

[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:23.420]
Right?

[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.040]
And to say, it's not much of a check.

[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.980]
We understand that, but we'll take it.

[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.340]
For Night with Heaven or Heather or whatever your hell name is.

[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:29.580]
I understand.

[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.580]
And then, then, then, then, forget about the cash.

[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.520]
Oh, okay.

[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.960]
Now, can I take a call?

[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.760]
In fact, this morning, Randy was still wandered around in the parking lot.

[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.740]
Wait for me to see if any of those hookers were still driving around?

[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.120]
Really?

[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:38.740]

[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.140]
Are you serious?

[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.420]
That's a true story, by the way.

[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:41.920]
Did you know that?

[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.640]
Randy was in the parking lot looking for the hookers?

[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.700]
He's driving around the parking lot across from the dollhouse.

[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.240]
No, I never heard that.

[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.840]
In fact, probably during their off hours.

[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.080]
I'll be damned.

[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:50.440]

[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.700]
Now, can I take a call?

[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.080]
Please.

[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.380]
You know, we can...

[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.100]
Well, you actually...

[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.320]
You got a whole bunch of calls.

[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.100]
I know I have a whole bunch of well here.

[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.200]
And all those people that call you, they're all OP,

[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.960]
OP holding his nose and stuff.

[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.680]
I do well here.

[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.340]
80% of the calls that we give them down here are OP calls.

[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.380]
They're calling right in his room.

[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.180]
Really?

[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.000]
Yeah, I'll be damned.

[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.060]
Let's go to Brandon.

[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.120]
Hi there, Brandon.

[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.260]
You're on there at WSUN.

[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.340]
Hello, Brandon.

[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.180]
Hello.

[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.160]
Yes, hello there.

[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.120]
Hope we didn't take you with anything.

[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:17.640]
Hello.

[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.040]
How are you doing?

[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:19.860]
Oh, great.

[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.340]
Yourself?

[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.200]
Okay.

[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.920]
Hey, thanks for calling to inquire.

[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.040]

[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.660]
Let's go to a cellphone.

[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.400]
Hi, self.

[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.820]
Well, the people here are so friendly.

[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.300]
You'll be able to just call up and ask how you're doing.

[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.140]
Hi, self.

[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.320]
And Ozone, you're on the air.

[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:30.960]
Good morning, Bob.

[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:31.660]
Good morning.

[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.340]
Now, this question is directed to you.

[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:33.960]
Okay.

[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.860]
I've been to the Yatsude Show for the first time caller.

[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:36.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.140]
Who is the bird?

[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.400]
What does he do?

[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.380]
And why is he on the radio?

[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.680]
Well, to tell you the truth, I can't answer that.

[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.140]
The bird is Neil's friend.

[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.380]
I think they used to be...

[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.260]
You know, the bird used to be your sidekick, right?

[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:47.640]
Yeah.

[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:48.960]
For three years.

[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.020]
For three years.

[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.360]
For three different radio stations.

[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:51.780]
And...

[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.000]
And, uh...

[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.760]
What do they do now?

[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.380]
Well, I'm retired.

[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.680]
He guest appears with Neil whenever he's in Tampa.

[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.520]
I'm retired.

[00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.920]
He lives in like you there.

[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.320]
Right, and he listens to this show occasionally and takes notes and calls.

[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.600]
Neil and, uh, gives him a vicious fiery porch about how bad I'm doing.

[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.220]
Do not.

[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.800]
You do, too.

[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:09.640]
I've heard you.

[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:10.460]
Maybe...

[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:10.840]
No.

[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.660]
Yeah, Neil says, well, how's he doing for her?

[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.800]
You go, uh-huh.

[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.420]
No.

[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.660]
He's right.

[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.800]
And he goes like that, no matter what you ask.

[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.060]
That's true, you know.

[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:19.980]
Yeah.

[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:20.740]
I don't know.

[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.480]
I've been to that lab.

[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.120]
One more time.

[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:23.960]
Do the lab, Bert.

[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.540]
There it is.

[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.160]
Bert.

[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:29.260]
Bert.

[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:29.660]

[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.180]
Bert.

[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:30.400]
Bert.

[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:31.760]
Bert.

[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.000]

[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.280]
Bert is good.

[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.540]
Bert is good.

[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.260]
You got it, man.

[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:34.620]
Okay.

[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.440]
Take care.

[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:35.840]
Good one.

[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.560]
Off it is to Salah Hassey.

[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.400]
I have to tell Ahassey you're on the air, WSUN.

[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.460]
Yeah, too much to cover.

[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.080]
No time.

[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:41.920]
Unbelievable.

[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:42.920]
Well, that's a problem.

[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.340]
We don't have around here too much to cover.

[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.700]
You're being bored and David Corrested by the way.

[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.320]
Yes, indeed.

[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.280]
Hey, Bert.

[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:47.840]
Hey.

[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.700]
I got your tape.

[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.020]
Oh, hey, Tim.

[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:50.660]
How's it going?

[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.180]
Good.

[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.400]
How was it?

[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.120]
Oh, very good.

[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:53.880]
Very good.

[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.200]
Tim, we don't have time to get into it.

[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.600]
Now, what are we doing here, man?

[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.620]
We've got his own plant call set up here.

[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.940]
Why don't we just go home at 9 for the rest of the week, you know?

[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:11.580]
You know, you need what you need to do, Bob, to change that cart from Kara, Bitch.

[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.160]
Yeah.

[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.240]
The Kara got us and Randy Bitch.

[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.460]
Oh, really?

[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.020]
That's what you need to do with that.

[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.240]
Bob, God.

[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.160]
Well, I work on that.

[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.220]
You know, Kara got us.

[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:29.920]
Well, of course, if you know, she throws out my shorts menu again tonight, I think we just might come up with a Randy Bitch, a cart.

[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.540]
Randy Bitch.

[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.040]
Woo.

[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.540]
Yeah, cart that up in there.

[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.920]
Want to see that first thing in the morning.

[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.080]
I want to do, I want to back a charcoal, which I didn't get the first bag yet.

[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.800]
And I want a refrigerator, Megan.

[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.120]
Okay, I'll put you on hold.

[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:52.580]
Take care of that with the person on the other end of the phone, who probably will send you even three magnets now.

[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:52.780]
Oh.

[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.360]
For a shallow woman who has no idea what the hell is going on in the world, and you're right around in your little car,

[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:05.180]
your little guy, damn, double phone, and have nothing better to do than call up and say, oh, your language is offensive.

[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.320]
I was going to hell in a hand basket, lady.

[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:08.260]
Glaceter.
