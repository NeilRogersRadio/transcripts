Okay, 117 at W I O D and Randy the goddess is here briefly. She's on her way to the airport to pick up Jim

[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.020]
Oh god, come on. Come on. We have definitely different taste. Okay. I'll tell you one thing

[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.740]
Take Jim and put him into control room before the afternoon is out and then they won't be concerned about me at all

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.480]
Yeah, just a joke Randy just a little joke. So anyway, I love Jim. Do you love you?

[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.260]
Is he flying in on a plane or just flying in on a plane? My mom

[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.300]
He is paying for the plane ticket as part of my birthday present. Yes, yeah and and we're going rollerblading

[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.040]
And I asked one little thinking question. I said how do I get to Bay Shore so I can go rollerblading on that big

[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.400]
Unbroken sidewalk that they have and

[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.880]
Velveda sticks his head in here and he goes

[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.840]
Marilyn is working on a map for you right now. We'll have directions to you in 40 50 seconds

[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.980]
Okay, now can I show you something out of computers pick your head about the thing here? You know what's that?

[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.160]
Yeah, pick your head under the thing and pick your nose and there's like you don't see any broward names on their day

[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.560]
No, no, it's that way consistently

[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.000]
I don't do ever say it but I wouldn't make any difference

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.260]
Don't use that as an excuse. It doesn't make any difference because they don't want to talk to us

[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.360]
Don't you understand? They're not interested in us. They hate it. They can take and take and they never listen

[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.160]
They like soak it up, but they don't want to squeeze it back. It's true and last but are just to change the subject

[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.240]
Because a nice man, but very insecure now. You have to

[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.880]
But you see yes very insecure. So you're all right. Who's writing on there? Check back with us is Kurt writing check back with us on a thing there

[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.640]
Check back with us. Yeah

[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.240]
Check back with us and what yeah check back with this baby. Okay, let's do

[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.020]
See and and you told me something that got me like off freaked out in here

[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.680]
I thought like he's got a good sense of humor and everything and all

[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.100]
Psychotic. He's got paranoid in there. Yes. Yes. Well, that's good because any I have always

[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.920]
When if you really wants me, you know, Velvita's gonna make me like let him have me

[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.980]
That is correct. What time is it now? He said we're here to serve. Yeah, really? Yeah

[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.340]
So what would you tell us or what? Yeah, well, you want to bat around some balls?

[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.440]
No balls if that's what you want. That's what you'll do. It's just a radio show

[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.680]
Okay, and like I always say when I don't care what you think she thinks you're ugly by the way, Kurt

[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.740]
But I don't care people who look good should have to pay a price of taking a lot of crap about it

[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.460]
I don't see where he looks so good. Neil we have such different tastes to somebody

[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.820]
Well, he's cute. He's like one of those little ivory boys if you can case everybody out there's wondering like what kind of taste

[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.200]
I mean ivory boy as an ivory soap and don't drop it. Yeah, well, that's what he's nervous about is he yeah

[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.640]
But he's just one of these you know fresh face

[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.020]
He's saying in my hand. You're all like they all are he's not first. Oh, he's not 17 years old

[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.220]
He's not 17 years old. Maybe what 21?

[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.480]
There you go. I would say like 20 right right right he's a youngster. Yeah, and he's got that fresh

Jim is stunning and brilliant and wonderful and I love him now

[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.860]
What does that thing he just gave me on seven? What is that? What was that?

[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.940]
He just gave me a thing like I don't know what the hell that meant seven o'clock tonight. No, I'm gonna be busy Kurt

[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.780]
He just put like a thing on here. Okay. What are we doing George? I think they're just totally losing him here

[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.920]
Hey, George. Hi, Rudy. Hi, you're 27

[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.240]
Get out of here. Yeah, get out of here. You're 27 my ass man. You're 27. No, no way

[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.180]
You really are now do you think he looks better at 20

[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.320]
Well, yeah, he looks terrific exactly see what I'm saying. You're always well preserved

[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.900]
I only came to work for sure in public to kiss your ass in public to worship you to thank you

[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.220]
And don't you think that he and Susie make a real cute couple Susie looks exactly like boy Gary's wife

[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.480]
Exactly so Susie hold out you can marry a program director. You don't need to be a deal with a boy now

[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.620]
I was crude. I come in here and beat the crap out of you

[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.780]
I would just slap the taste out of your mouth right now

[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.980]
I don't remember boy gerry's wife

[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.180]
I have tried to forget everything. I'll never know. She's beautiful. She's smart. She's nice

[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.800]
She's got a great sense of humor how smart can she be she married him because you know, he makes all the money that I don't

[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.220]
You really think he makes a lot of money. Yes, I do isn't he moving into your neighborhood, huh?

[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.840]
He allegedly is building a house on my street lucky you which is another reason why I must I must move over here immediately

[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.020]
Yeah, see let's not go please Neil. Let's not go. Let's not go back there who the hell's going back

[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.160]

[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.140]
All right, and my dogs are coming over here express and that's it. What the hell more do we need nothing?

[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.420]
Nothing we got everything we need here. I'm serious this place is unbelievable. It's amazing. I'm so relaxed

[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.040]
Yeah, so unpsychotic and so happy and excited at the same time

[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.860]
Do you know what I mean? It's like that relaxed but excited feeling that you have just don't want to relax

[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.060]
But excited feeling I can relate to that right now

[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.620]
So you're gonna go pick up Jim now. Yeah, I gotta go great

[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.860]
I'll have a safe trip and enjoy your rollerblading this chapter now

[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.660]
All right, what am I gonna do? I think I might just actually go back and take like a little nap

We

[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.140]
And it wouldn't be quite so bad if they were going to die

[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.560]
I love to die

[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.680]
I want the people to be Canadian

[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.600]
Who weighs me hundred pounds

[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.600]
They run around with the speed of art

[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.440]
And they're perfect hanging down

[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.620]
They hold

[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.140]
They cheat

[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.620]
And they are dead

[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.160]
They hold

[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.720]
They cheat

[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.900]
And they are dead

[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.740]
I don't have a phone spot

[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.460]
They cheat

[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.040]
And they are dead

[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.820]
This has been an experience

[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.860]
I could like do the closing comments starting now for like the next 32 minutes

[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.180]
Do like a closing monologue

[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.300]
Is the ball lasted or would do but I'm not going to do that

[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.220]
Opening monologue I did

[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.820]
Sorry

[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.340]
But seriously this has been an experience

[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.220]
Maybe the audience thinks I'm building the earlier something but they can ask

[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.760]
Any of us who have been here including Rick and Pud and Randy

[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.000]
And it's just been amazing or Bob because Bob the first thing he said when he came here today was

[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.460]
This is almost embarrassing they're treating us so well

[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.920]
I mean they are taking care of our every need they are like wiping us from head to toe

[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:45.220]
And spraying us with cologne and putting lilacs and beautiful petal flowers on our pillows at night

[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.920]
And just they're massaging everything including our egos

[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.720]
And amazing

[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.400]
Here's Naples hello

[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.120]
Yes Neil

[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.700]
Oh okay I heard you calling no colors from Fort Myers

[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.380]
We made it we had a WWC and mystery voice from Naples before 2 o'clock

[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.800]
Thank God you saved Tony Allen's ass again pal

[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.660]
All right

[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.940]
You saved him from oblivion

[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.060]
Speaking of I got a little Joe and Stan spy report for a couple of real geeks

[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.940]
Just swiping some of your material

[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.840]
Not again

[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.280]
They were swiping the dolphin song last Friday

[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.860]
And the very keen paint your ball spot

[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.180]
They were swiping that stuff

[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.960]
Yes sir

[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.580]
The whole thing

[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.900]
See Tony Allen likes to give us this song and a dance about well no they're just doing it on the promos

[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.760]
And they're just promoting your show and all this other crap

[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.620]
And the meantime I'm sure they're stealing our material

[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.140]
When you've had your material stolen as many times as I have not

[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.340]
Not to include present company in this room

[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.740]
It's just you get used to it I guess

[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.600]
Okay so you're enjoying the west coast

[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.400]
We are enjoying it the weather is great the pelicans are beautiful and friendly

[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.660]
And everybody in this building is like dynamite

[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.680]
And it just it's I've never had an experience like this

[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.080]
In three plus years in this business I've never had an experience this pleasant

[00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.260]
Oh okay a little bit laid back and lazy that's probably another reason why you're not getting any calls from this area

[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.980]
Yeah a little laid back lazy in the geriatric right

[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.120]
And you want to want to hang on the phone for 45 minutes or an hour

[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.220]
I guess they got other things to do

[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.480]
Right they have a life a life

[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.740]
Well listen you have a great weekend and thanks for saving Tony's bud

[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.220]
Okay

[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.020]
Have a good one

[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:15.740]

[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.860]

[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.780]
That look nothing like her but she only wishes

[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.960]
And I bet she she brings Jim along

[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.340]

How you doing today?

[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.200]
Pretty damn good pal

[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.140]
How's camp on?

[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.700]
Almost too good to be true

[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.880]
Have you been to Papuses yet?

[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:20.800]
Have we been to what?

[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.460]
Papuses

[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.420]
What the hell is that?

[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.940]
That's a real famous Greek restaurant up here

[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:25.380]
No

[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.940]
Oh I hear it's really good I've been there myself

[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.540]
But they keep telling me to go there whenever I'm up there

[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.080]
Food here is out of sight

[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.260]
I thought the Tampa was basically like Brandon

[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.800]
I thought it was basically just a series of fast food chains

[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.280]
And steak and shake and crystals

[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.000]
I thought that's basically what the series was

[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.220]
But they got some food that are not your thing off

[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.820]
It's a really good Greek restaurant

[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.220]
Here it's out in the springs around here

[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:48.660]
Okay

[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.480]
I'm sure one of your columns will tell you

[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.660]
Anyway that's not what I'm calling

[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.640]
As soon as you said Greek

[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.320]
Well somebody just ran out of the other room

[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:55.700]
Go ahead

[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.640]
I'll just flip that in

[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.700]
Listen last time they had the hockey

[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.240]
I sent money in for the tickets

[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.060]
Yes sir

[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.160]
I got refunded

[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.360]
I got money for three seats

[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.860]
And I was wondering if you knew anything about the

[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.160]
season ticket yet

[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.860]
You mean for the Miami team?

[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.320]
Yeah

[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.060]
I'm not following you got money for three seats

[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.520]
Yeah I want to get season tickets

[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.140]
I tried the last time around and they set the money back

[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.600]
There was a number but needless to say I don't have it here

[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.740]
So you'll have to wait till Monday I guess

[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.440]
We'll get that all figured out

[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.620]
Because now that I got my new rekindle hockey enthusiasm

[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.580]
After last night

[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.060]
I'm gonna promote the hell out of it man

[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.820]
Oh I'm they took me to Buffalo

[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.060]
I was a kid and I was there for the one time

[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.200]
They got to the Stanley Cup with the French connection

[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.080]
But that was it

[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.180]
They don't do the shot anymore

[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.120]
So anyway can I call somebody a douchebag?

[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.820]
Yes sir

[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.940]
Dean Bucksbaum at Creative Directors

[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.580]
You are the douchebag

[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.420]
Okay have a great weekend

[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.080]
Okay well straight into hockey crap out on Monday

[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.000]
So anyway I got all my stuff

[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.280]
I got my maple leafs

[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.160]
Fact book here, a big thick stuff that's got like all these pictures and autographs and stats

[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.160]
And all these statistics upon

[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.400]
I mean to give you an idea of how thick and how complete this thing is

[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.840]
It's got every penalty shot

[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.100]
That the maple leafs have ever taken and taken against them

[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.240]
Everyone

[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.240]
And the all time goal-tending roster

[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.000]
There's Johnny Brower and there's Turk Broda

[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.280]
And there's Ed Chadwick and Doug Favelle and Bruce Gamble

[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.360]
Bruce let's take the gamble and Caesar Maniago

[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.620]
Oh God Caesar

[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.980]
And Mike Palmatier and Bernie Peront

[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.160]
And Felix Potman who played a great game last night

[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.620]
Not a good game, a great game

[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.240]
And Jake the snake, Jacques Depline and all the other good stuff

[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.860]
Every statistic gets autographed by Foster Hewitt

[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.700]
And it says Bill Hewitt is still alive

[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.240]
And we'll give you his address and shoe size

[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.940]
Here is St. Petersburg

[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.580]
Hello

[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:53.600]
Hey Neil

[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.280]
Yes sir

[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.220]
Hey how you doing

[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.420]
Tremendous man

[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.420]
Great great great

[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.140]
Hey Taylor and he put it in park

[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.740]
Can you believe that? That's a true story

[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.100]
Yeah

[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.580]
She had that baby in reverse and the car too

[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:05.600]
That's incredible

[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.320]
Hey listen I just want to confirm

[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.760]
You're going to be on the show tomorrow

[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.660]
We're going to be on that show

[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.720]
The cast fountain show

[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.620]
So what?

[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.240]
The Kathy fountain show

[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.360]
What the hell is that?

[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.540]
For Channel 13

[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:19.980]
No

[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.280]
Oh you're not going to do that?

[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:21.640]
No

[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.800]
I thought you were out of town

[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.080]
We told him the stuff that thing

[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.760]
Are you kidding me?

[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.440]
I misunderstood

[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.720]
Which maybe is why they didn't bother to show up today

[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.820]
Because we don't want to do one of those stupid pubic service kind of shows

[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.020]
I'm not interested in that crap

[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.560]
It's like in the biggest waste of time

[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.620]
Well it's boring

[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.140]
It's terminal

[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.700]
I was wondering because today they were doing something on monster trucks

[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.140]
And I'm like Neil's going to do this

[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.040]
No, no way

[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.820]
So I'm okay

[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.760]
Well never mind about that

[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.480]
We got a few more important things to do tomorrow

[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.400]
Like meet our pubic out there at the clear water mall

[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.180]
Yeah really I'm going to try and get there too

[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.320]
I'm really nervous

[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.280]
So tell Kathy to put a sack over it, okay?

[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.320]
Okay listen we'll see you tomorrow pal

[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:56.840]
Okay

[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.520]
Have a great day

[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.380]
134 on the prestigious IOD network

[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.740]
Live from the WSU and studios in St. Petersburg

[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.060]
It's the Neil Rogers show on News Talk Radio 620 WSU N

[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.880]
138 so Georgia have a very important question for you

[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.320]
George

[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.380]
Yes

[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:19.700]
Do you remember a real idiot and more on that work that WIOD his name was Mike Grayson?

[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:20.920]
Yes

[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.660]
And you remember the stunt that he pulled at time he came in the control room

[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.780]
And he pulled his pants down he dropped his drawers for the entire world of say

[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.000]
Grey fruit of the looms

[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.840]
Grey fruit of looms and Mike Grayson told us at the time that he learned that trick

[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.580]
From one of his friends in the Tampa St. Pete area

[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.940]
About dropping your drawers

[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.040]
Remember that?

[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:40.800]
I remember

[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.460]
Yeah

[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.060]
So we're all still sitting over here waiting

[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.920]
Oh I need your love, John

[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.760]
Yes you know it's true

[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.840]
I hope you need my love, John

[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.640]
Just lift me fast for you

[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.920]
Oh oh oh me

[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.800]
Touch me

[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.740]
You and me

[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.060]
But me

[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.760]
I need my share of love, John

[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.220]
Eight times a day

[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.440]
I love you every day, John

[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.100]
Just look straight after blind

[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:24.800]
Oh

[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.340]
I think this is my best side

[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.680]
I get a tight shot of my behind

[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.320]
Oh oh oh me

[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.900]
Touch me

[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.900]
But like that, you and me

[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.380]
But me

[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.960]
I need my share of love, John

[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.520]
Eight times a day

[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.200]
Eight times a day

[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.660]
It's just a lowball average

[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.220]
Eight times a day

[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.200]
It's just been love to pay my bail

[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.480]
Oh I need your love, John

[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.120]
That's why it's this week for you

[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.300]
I hope you need my love, John

[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.020]
My house payment is due

[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.420]
Oh oh oh me

[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.400]
Touch me

[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.840]
You and me

[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.560]
But me

[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.000]
I need my share of love, John

[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.680]
Eight times a day

[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.460]
Eight times a day

[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.940]
To teach my husband how to

[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.340]
Eight times a day

[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.340]
It's good to see you, Danny Quail

[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.840]
Love me every day, John

[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.920]
You're always on my tail

[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.580]
Make me a dream or pay, John

[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.420]
Cause through I'll be in jail

[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.740]
Oh oh oh me

[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.640]
Touch me

[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.440]
Use me

[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.020]
But me

[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.500]
I need my share of love, John

[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.040]
Eight times a day

[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.340]
Eight times a day

[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:10.820]
Oh

[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.300]
Eight times a day

[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.620]
So the saddest part of this whole thing is that it's going to soon come for some of us to a bitter end

[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.880]
If I can say that, I mean like it's over

[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.140]
We're just getting the drift of it, man

[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.280]
We're just getting the lay of the land, we're just getting the feel of it

[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.840]
142 at WIOD, here's a lady in St. Pete, hello

[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.760]
Hi, Nils, how are you?

[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.700]
Hi, yes, man

[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.180]
Glad to have you guys here

[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:45.380]
This has been the most the warmest, the kindest, the gentlest frightening, amazing

[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.220]
You know, I'd like to thank Fel Vita for that because I was ready to move

[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.680]
I think maybe there was something wrong with this here

[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.740]
No, not at all

[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.460]
I think Tom Fel Vita resurrected the entire Bay Area

[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.600]
Well, you know, he's treating you guys good

[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.520]
Single-handedly

[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.280]
I'm glad to hear that

[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.680]
Which is what he excels in, yes

[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.960]
But is he going to pay Randy?

[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.960]
Yeah, he's going to pay Randy

[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.000]
In fact, I think at the mall tomorrow he ought to whip out a gigantic check and lay it right on it

[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.680]
Right, I just want to have everybody, I agree

[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.000]
Right

[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.980]
Seven hours is the best of Nils, as much as I love you, it's just too much

[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.000]
A little bit much, amen, amen

[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.880]
But I'd like to say that Bob was my first talk so host I ever listened to

[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.700]
I never had enough nerve to call him, but he was my first

[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.100]
Right, but you will call him now though

[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.260]
I don't know

[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.320]
You've got to call him not because he's going to be so insecure and so psychotic, you must call him

[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.860]
You know, they call him Matt Dogg for a reason though, right?

[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.400]
And what is that?

[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.220]
Well, he's just real tough on him

[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.100]
No, he's a pussycat, believe me

[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.620]
But I love him, I'm so glad he's coming back

[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.260]
If you come out to the mall and lay your eyes on him tomorrow

[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.760]
You'll understand what a just absolute wimpy pussycat this guy is, believe me

[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.140]
Good, okay, I'll give this shot

[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.220]
It'll take all your fear and paranoia away

[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.500]
I hope so

[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:57.940]
Okay

[00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.420]
Have a great weekend

[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.160]

[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.380]
Do you see a horrible special on the surface of the world?

[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.620]
No, I forgot all about that damn thing

[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.840]
I forgot all about it

[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.920]
That was the search for the Godfather, right?

[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.100]
I can tell you, it is about at least a minimum of 100 hits out on him now

[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.800]

[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.900]
so anyway it's uh... the deal is now we're not leaving that's what we just

[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.340]
decided

[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.920]
you know you sound like you've taken about three volume

[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.700]

the whole thing about the health not just the food but about the stress

[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.920]
yeah we could each add twenty years to our lives by staying here for like

[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.720]
about the next six months and that's the damn truth your blood sugar

[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.560]
all of the evidence take a little brownie cameras man

[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.160]
i think brownie is the operative term for him before he got a whole of it you

[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.900]
know something one thing i love randy don't get me wrong but i have discovered

[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.120]
that that woman has the more crappiest taste

[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.360]
i heard

[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.380]
i was kind of listening to that yeah

[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.120]
no seriously that that's just that with curt because curtsa to over his twenty

[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.620]
seven to turn out she thought it was seventeen

[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.260]
but if you ever wondered why she wound up with gym

[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.260]
yeah which we don't want to go into a lot of adjectives put your arms down

[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:15.500]
gym

[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.400]
uh... and your feet down on the ground

[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.240]
bad eyesight is a benefit to a lot of it that would be

[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.400]
absolutely oh yeah

[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.720]
yeah rich you know that because he's had two wives who both had like uh... the

[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.660]
worst of it like a blinders on exactly

[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.800]

and cost those what's valid it's good for you they are it is good for its

[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.400]
tremendous from the Columbia restaurant no doubt which i'm sure suds is

[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.340]
going to be all psyched about

[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.480]
because i'm sure well you were uh... when you work with him in serisota

[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.520]
he did afternoons

[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.260]
and the world famous suds called on kpx on uh... yeah kpx

[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.500]
on the kx-y

[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.920]
what did i say kp oh i'm sorry piper i apologize sorry

[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.260]
no there was that thing in the paper about k there was that thing in a paper

[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.000]
about kpx there they was on my mind no about kx-y

[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.440]
and uh... but who worked at y&d beside me in johnny dark nobody and so when you

[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.320]
guys worked at y&d well i got a raise they offered me i was making ninety

[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.580]
did paxon on it then yes and he paid you no he just offered he never paid

[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.140]
anybody he just he makes you a good deal and then you never get paid you to offer

[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.480]
is an offer is that necessarily commitment yeah

[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.340]
so how about that hockey game huh uh... it was rick's first hockey game ever

[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.200]
he did not think it was a great game because it wasn't close he didn't let's

[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.340]
tell what was going on but uh... for somebody like you when you've been made

[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.600]
believe for thirty five years and you just keep and i you know every time he

[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.060]
scored except the one time i didn't see the goal because joe was asking me a

[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.120]
lot of stupid question right and i jumped up and screamed at all and nobody got

[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.960]
uh... you know nobody gave me dirty looks i mean the fans were great and it was a

[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.740]
very enjoyable place and even though it's you know only temporary i all is crap

[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.620]
that we hear is just that it's crap these people don't know what they're

[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.860]
talking about all the fighting was done on the ice the people there were nice

[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.600]
looking people well-behaved people just there for the fun of of being at a

[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.920]
game so you know just because somebody tells you something it's better to check

[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.180]
it out in person for example suzy i was talking to the hallway and she said the

[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.100]
court is lousy and bad and i figured just because somebody says something is not

[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.580]
ever taken ever taken it uh... you know you have to check these things out

[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.540]
first hand

[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.280]
can i say that's why we all have our own feelings yeah yeah as in fuel this

[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.080]
now this has been an experience that has been uh... top-notch man and and again i

[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.840]
don't want to sound like a primordana like i want to take a lot of the credit for

[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:33.160]
it or that i deserve any special treatments or favors time favors uh... but

[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.160]
well you would have gotten it anyway it's just no no no no no no no way no

[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.260]
like this and their wildest dreams they never great i whoever i have to think i'll

[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.440]
think of all because it's just been wonderful it's uh... there are no see the

[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.040]
audience in my and while everywhere because the people even here are experiencing

[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.220]
it but this has been they were even the queen never gets treatment like this

[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.280]
that's why she carries the silly little bank account a good work and i write
