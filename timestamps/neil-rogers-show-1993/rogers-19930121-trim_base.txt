[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]
Joan Collins speaks of romance.

[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.040]
I've loved hundreds of men over the years.

[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.560]
Okay, just this morning.

[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.120]
Hey, guys.

[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.340]
That's why I've created a perfume to be guile to a trun.

[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.320]
But you can't really come up.

[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.380]
If you can, it's exactly the same as what you do.

[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.780]
Joan Collins, floppy seconds.

[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.360]
The perfume to have to be your having more than one.

[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.720]
Like my perfume.

[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.200]
You know you're thin.

[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.380]
Apparently you say Joan Collins, floppy seconds.

[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.720]
Every morning I'm a model, atomizer, or fire extinguisher size.

[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.540]
With a very similar setup, we got a beautiful board.

[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.400]
We're sitting right out here by the water.

[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.260]
It's polatial.

[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.200]
The pelicans are dropping on the rent of cars.

[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.260]
And this is great.

[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.260]
Are we on?

[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.940]
Are they getting anything?

[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.840]
Hello, America.

[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.800]
I feel like Lloyd Lindsay Young with no math.

[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.740]
We still don't know.

[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.840]
Got a bird is here.

[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.140]
Yeah.

[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.220]
And we're just talking to each other.

[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.160]
And the engineers who got their finger in their...

[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.960]
Miami lost it.

[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.720]
Oh, we're gone in Miami.

[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.860]
Oh, right.

[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.920]
They brought one.

[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.880]
And Jan was born down there and he can't find it.

[00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.460]
Uh-oh.

[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.900]
Has none of this been on in Miami?

[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.660]
No.

[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.080]
But it's good practice.

[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.900]
It hasn't been on in Tampa either.

[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.660]
So no.

[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.920]
Been on in the production room.

[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.260]
Oh.

[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.820]
That's good.

[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.540]
We can do a show for the guys in the production studio.

[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.460]
How do you like it so far?

[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.660]
I can't fit either.

[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.240]
No, not in the production room.

[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.320]
Are they going to give us a signal when we're on here?

[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.180]
I can't fit either.

[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.400]
I can't fit either.

[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.120]
It's on.

[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.660]
It is.

[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.240]
It is.

[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.200]
We're on.

[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.680]
I just like saying that.

[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.160]
It's great.

[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.960]
It's great.

[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.260]
It is just like this.

[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.940]
It's over.

[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.800]

[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.860]
It might be.

[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.480]
It might not…

[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.860]
It's great.

[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.360]
It mightник out.

[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.460]
Right, Darbright throttle.

[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.180]
It might not be.

[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.260]
Are we on in Miami either?

[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.360]
I think nobody's on.

[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.200]
I might drop you.

[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.560]
It's 75 of the Paul Beaches, 89 degrees in Miami.

[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.740]
For引 I still have been from the radio.

[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.420]
Hey, worth me $50.

[00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:02.160]
Some times I steal the bits from the Neil Rogers show.

[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.400]
Hey, that's ponderous, you dishback.

[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.320]
Oh, really, really.

[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.480]
Then I steal them and I make them mine.

[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.840]
I have the creativity of a fly.

[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.120]
I steal bits from the Neil Rogers show.

[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.120]
It may not be as bad as it will think, so I, uh, alright,

[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.760]
let's take another call. I'm tired of this. I'm hanging up on you.

[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.560]
Join us this afternoon to getting it to for those wild and crazy guys,

[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.160]
Rick and Suts, and at six, it's sports dogs six ten.

[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.940]
Come on you, I don't need.

[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.820]
This is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.980]
Right, sure, 100.

[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.840]
Don't keep you up.

[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.560]
I don't need any questions.

[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.280]
We're going to be doing this for two hours.

[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.560]
Huh?

[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.660]
Are they hearing us?

[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.640]
This is a set up.

[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.920]
It's open hiding under the board and they're a one.

[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.540]
All the S you went, people have been taken hostage by a J-Core,

[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.360]
and OP is behind the whole thing.

[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.920]
It's a plot.

[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.840]
It's a plot.

[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.920]
What they don't understand though is we're used to this.

[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.840]
We enjoy it.

[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.860]
We're having a good time.

[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.420]
It really brings back some old memories.

[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.120]
Oh, yeah, the best.

[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.300]
So we're not on the air right?

[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.060]
Guys, they say nothing.

[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.140]
They don't say yes or no.

[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.640]
Yeah, in other words, they don't know what the hell is going on.

[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.860]
So let's just say a few choice words.

[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.520]
Now that Clinton's in here, we'll see, then we'll get an answer, I bet.

[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.000]
Huh?

[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.800]
What's the deal?

[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.740]
Tom?

[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.420]
Belvita?

[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.220]
What's the deal, Tom?

[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.320]
You said your box is too low and the birth's too high.

[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.760]
Oh.

[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.160]
But how come we didn't hear the card?

[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.020]
We heard the card.

[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.440]
You did?

[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.120]
We heard the card.

[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.920]
We didn't hear it.

[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.000]
We sure as hell didn't hear the card.

[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.780]
We heard it was great.

[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.940]
Oh, the Neil Rogers show.

[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.120]
Well, how come we don't hear it?

[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.600]
Why didn't it have to be in Q?

[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.000]
Dave Slenzky, Chief Engineer.

[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.640]
Wait a minute, let me try it again.

[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.940]
Okay.

[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.940]
Now I want to hear it.

[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.940]
I don't hear it.

[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.980]
This is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.780]
I do not hear it.

[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.780]
Now either I hear it.

[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.040]
This is the Chief Engineer.

[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.320]
Any question of income in Q?

[00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.640]
So I can hear it on a year?

[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.740]
What is he from like the Mitch Wien School of Engineering this time?

[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.700]
Get out of my face with this guy.

[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.540]
This guy wouldn't know a card.

[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.380]
He's a little bit of a woman.

[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.060]
I've loved hundreds of men over the years.

[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.680]
I'm like his own.

[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.540]
That's why I created a perfume to be guile to a bra.

[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.600]
But mainly to cover up.

[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.660]
Any idea what I'm doing?

[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.100]
You're with this Bjorn Collins floppy second.

[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.760]
The day to the hour.

[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.620]
The perfume to have when you're having more than one.

[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.380]
Like my perfumes, man.

[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.460]
Nothing worked.

[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.560]
It's getting you only product.

[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.860]
It's just like Bjorn Collins floppy second.

[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.960]
In bottle, atomizer, or fire extinguisher's eye.

[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.100]
Come in any minute now.

[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.360]
I don't think he's going to come in here at this point.

[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.120]
I can't blame him.

[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.660]
Well, I want that to be great when some people are in here alone playing with a succulent

[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.400]
equipment every day.

[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.420]
That'll be really great.

[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.200]
So what's the deal?

[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.680]
Are we on?

[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.560]
We don't know.

[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.200]
We don't know.

[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.600]
Why do you give me headsets?

[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.460]
What's he going to do?

[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.400]
He won't hear the card.

[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.880]
We have...

[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.660]
Can I have this fresh...

[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.400]
You're going to aim one at each of us?

[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.900]
I'm going to aim something at you in a second.

[00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.360]
Believe me.

[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.720]
Okay, anyway, it's 10-15, 10-14, something like that.

[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.520]
And we're on the air.

[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.860]
We don't believe we're on the air.

[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.120]
I think they're just pacifying that.

[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.420]
We don't go ballistic here.

[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.100]
Nobody's on the air.

[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.800]
It brings jokes.

[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.740]
It brings back this big flood of memories from Zeta.

[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.980]
Yeah.

[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.100]
He just comes to the air.

[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.920]
George, we've been taking hostage.

[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.060]
Please call emergency immediately and get us to hell out of here.

[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.140]
Anyway, I get in here yesterday afternoon.

[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.760]
Tom Velvita and Todd.

[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.100]
What the hell is Todd's last name?

[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.880]

[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.080]
He doesn't have a last name.

[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.520]
Lisa is in a Lisa Campbell.

[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.720]
And they meet me at the airport and I get my rental car and they give me directions and I go to a polatial.

[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.200]
I mean an incredible hotel.

[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.280]
And I'm like, what are they call those things?

[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.220]
Like in the penthouse.

[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.960]
I mean, in the suite, the most beautiful, the most incredible, and really polatial.

[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.780]
You just couldn't believe it.

[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.660]
Knock your socks off.

[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.120]
And of course, they didn't wear any socks.

[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.940]
And then they picked me up and took me to an incredible, and he walked out of here again.

[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.880]
To a phenomenal Italian restaurant.

[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.780]
I must say that's immediately the food in Tampa is, if that's a barometer.

[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.180]
Yeah.

[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.140]
Because we know Bernstake House, everybody knows that.

[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.320]
And we know Crystal and Stake and Shake and you bet.

[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.780]
But they took me to an Italian restaurant on Dale Maverick, which is just down the road from Crystal.

[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.280]
And right across the street from the very prestigious building pancake house.

[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.860]
And it was tremendous.

[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.320]
Tremendous.

[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.080]
I'm telling you.

[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.360]
What are you laughing about?

[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.740]
Well, you know, you're having change.

[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.580]
He's still laughing.

[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.420]
It's not funny.

[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.460]
It's not funny.

[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.300]
He's still laughing.

[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.900]
I was just thinking about that.

[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.420]
Is this an audition for the Joey Reynolds show?

[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.940]
Not at all.

[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.840]
I'm telling you, I just knew there was a reason why he came here so early.

[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.860]
It's an audition for Joey.

[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.160]
Bill Marshall is getting still.

[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.180]
He just can't, like you can.

[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.720]
He can't.

[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.580]
He can't do it.

[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.160]
He don't have it.

[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.060]
The original is always the best.

[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.340]
Yeah.

[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.060]
Uh-huh.

[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.940]
That's what Joey says doing in his case.

[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.720]
Trust me.

[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.220]
It proves that old things aren't always true.

[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.200]
So anyway, we have this tremendous meal.

[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.340]
And then, Velvita takes me back to my hotel.

[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.860]
I go back up to my polatial.

[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.020]
I mean, there's like a bath.

[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.540]
They put a bathroom about for you.

[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.540]
And there's like a dancing violinist.

[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.340]
And, uh, well, now most.

[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.220]
And here's a big platter of like vegetables and dip.

[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.000]
We're a said dip on it.

[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.180]
I think they were talking about me.

[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.120]
And, uh, seriously, in the many bars like having your own convenience stir up there,

[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.460]
they are really doing this right.

[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.120]
I want, and I called up Randy on here.

[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.860]
I was so excited.

[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.640]
And I want to repeat it again.

[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.960]
Everybody on our staff, including Rick and Suds and Randy.

[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.880]
Uh, I was going to say in gym, but I don't think I want to say that,

[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.000]
because he might take me up on it.

[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.220]
Should kiss me all over my body, because I, we had a tailgate party a week ago Sunday,

[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.060]
the one for the San Diego game.

[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.840]
And Bob Green and little Torpey Bob, have you ever seen him with David Paul Neal?

[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.880]
Show up at the tailgate party.

[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.160]
And I just seized the opportunity, you know, because Bob Neal is such a,

[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.040]
when a guy has like an imposing presence, like Nick Tregoni,

[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.060]
I'm not saying he's imposing, but he does have somebody,

[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.120]
does have like a broken nose.

[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.640]
So he really knows some important people.

[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.240]
And you don't want to step on his toes.

[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.980]
But Bob Neal is such like a nebush.

[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.260]
And so you don't have any compunctions about like jumping all over him,

[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.620]
just grabbing him by the neck and picking him up and just shaking him all over it.

[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.160]
Like get some crap done, man.

[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.240]
Take care of us.

[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.240]
Treat us like stars.

[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.320]
So we have gone from originally was going to be, I'm the only one coming over.

[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:14.860]
Yeah.

[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.000]
I'm going to have to hitchhike.

[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.580]
They're going to put me up at the YMCA from that kind of an ambiance to royalty treatment.

[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.680]
We've gone from one extreme to the hysterical opposite,

[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.120]
where everybody gets, uh, Randy's getting a Lincoln town car when she comes in today.

[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.480]
No.

[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.980]
You're serious.

[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.360]
Yes.

[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.480]
Yes, I am serious.

[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.120]
You know what it's going to be like when you go back home to IOD.

[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:35.480]
To be pressing.

[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:35.880]
Yes.

[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.840]
And I hope that Mitch Wien is listening right now, by the way,

[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.660]
because we're sitting here.

[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.120]
We got a polatial.

[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.600]
I got my own board.

[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.760]
I can control the levels.

[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.420]
I can shut his mic off, which I'm looking forward to.

[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.380]
Yeah.

[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:47.900]
There we go.

[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.040]
It's like kyle eyes.

[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:49.500]
Yeah.

[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.520]
And we got like equipment up the ass here.

[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.440]
If I can say that and we got these beautiful.

[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.360]
What are these?

[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:55.860]
Deenon.

[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.480]
Deenon.

[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.340]
The CD players.

[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:57.920]
CD players.

[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.520]
I mean, like state of the art that you put like we have on the coast,

[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.940]
that we can't have on the AM because it's only a puky AM station within a cheermer day.

[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.320]
Yeah.

[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:05.900]
Right.

[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.680]
So this is like downtown, man.

[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.040]
Plus.

[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.720]
Plus we have WSU and country music fans.

[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.020]
Yeah.

[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.020]
We got country music on a stick.

[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:15.540]
Yeah.

[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.640]
So for those of you who loved Rick on a stick and Neil on his stick,

[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.800]
you're going to love picking your nose on a stick.

[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.220]
Or with a stick.

[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.420]
As a matter of fact, it's got like a little thing in there.

[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.040]
And it says right nostril and left nostril and shows you which one you can pick with.

[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.160]
I want to try again.

[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.040]
Can I try a cart?

[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:30.780]
Which one?

[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.020]
Well, what did he do?

[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.960]
He said, okay, I'm going to point my head.

[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:36.720]
My head is.

[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.340]
He said, I'm going to point a head set.

[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.860]
What does that mean?

[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.800]
I'm going to point a head set at each one of them.

[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.400]
Well, it's there.

[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.440]
You get one side.

[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.180]
I get the other.

[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.320]
Are we going to hear it through there?

[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.440]
Well, let's see.

[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.060]
Let's try it.

[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.680]
Good question.

[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.500]
I mean, it could be four hours of agony or four hours of ecstasy all depending upon what you say.

[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.540]
Yeah.

[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.300]
Yeah.

[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:55.680]
Yeah.

[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.020]
Yeah.

[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.820]
It was Bob.

[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:57.460]
Who?

[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.420]
I know where's the control for that.

[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.120]
Where's the level?

[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.520]
Oh.

[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.280]
Now, you're asking a lot.

[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:02.740]
Wait a minute.

[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.300]
Here we go.

[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.100]
How about if I crank that up just a minute?

[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.600]
This is fun.

[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.160]
Yeah.

[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.820]
That's great.

[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.340]
It's not you don't have the sense that you're on ear anywhere.

[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.860]
So I'm about to say almost anything now.

[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.500]
Not even close because you're so loose and so relaxed.

[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.600]
It's like a dry run.

[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:16.940]
Yeah.

[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.640]
Can I say that?

[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.800]
If you only have a thing we can say dry run now.

[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.100]
Nothing like being on the ear.

[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.740]
I'm not going to say just the runs, which I think I had after.

[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.400]
So what was the name of that restaurant, Tom?

[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:26.560]
Tom.

[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.100]
You know, I got news for you, man.

[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.860]
This guy has got a personality like my dog's ass.

[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.740]
This guy is such a...

[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:39.140]
The restaurant, the great Italian restaurant where we ate at last night, which all Todd kept talking about us.

[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.360]
How everybody had their nose out of joint and they kept doing it.

[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:41.920]
Like this.

[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.260]
Does that man want to live or not?

[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.920]
It keeps, oh, there's Guido and he keeps pushing his nose up to this side.

[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.400]
That's not a good way to make friends and influence people taught.

[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.300]
What is it?

[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.060]
Donatello.

[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.780]
Donatello.

[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.380]
I want to show you how much clout we got in this market already, okay?

[00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.420]
Because having been over here like about 12 hours, everybody in this whole area should be over here kissing our ass right now.

[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.260]
Don't you agree?

[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:01.840]
Absolutely.

[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.480]
The fact that we even would put our signal into this place.

[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:04.800]
Yeah.

[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.640]
The whole world.

[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:06.740]
Donatello.

[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:07.740]
Donatello's?

[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.200]
Yeah.

[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.480]
What do you mean?

[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.500]
This man is on top of it.

[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:13.860]
God.

[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.960]
And if he ever gets off.

[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.000]
Now, here's the next excitement.

[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.380]
The phone calls are starting to come in.

[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.460]
Now, will we take a call?

[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.620]
Do you want to take one now?

[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.380]
No, I don't want to take one.

[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:22.580]
I want to take one.

[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.140]
I do a break.

[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.300]
Let's see if it works, okay?

[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.780]
Hey, George, we're going to see if it works.

[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.680]
Here's a...

[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.200]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.200]
Are we going to hear the call the same way we heard the cart?

[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.060]
Do it.

[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.380]
Do it.

[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:35.700]
Do it.

[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.660]
That was George.

[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.320]
That was George from Miami.

[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.200]
No, seriously.

[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.280]
Are we going to hear the caller over the headphones?

[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.500]
Hey, do the...

[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.700]
Put a lid on it.

[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.240]
Hot shot.

[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.780]
Okay, I'll talk to Guido about you if you don't cut the crap.

[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.660]
You want me to turn you on a little speaker?

[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.880]
We're going to hear it in a little speaker.

[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.220]
Okay, let's punch it up, George.

[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.240]
Like I said, for Lauderdale.

[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.520]
What the hell is going on over there?

[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.820]
Hey, yeah.

[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.780]
It works.

[00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:58.920]

[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.540]
How time?

[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.140]
Now, where's that coming from?

[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.520]
Are we on or are we on?

[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.840]
Hey, that's part of the ambience that we enjoy, man.

[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.800]
Don't go peeing on our parade, okay?

[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.300]
Oh, I'm not.

[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:08.820]
I'm not.

[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.280]
Hey, let me see if this works.

[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.920]
Hey, you're doing it.

[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.540]
We are doing it.

[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:13.820]
And...

[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.640]
So what's going on over there?

[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.200]
What are we missing?

[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.640]
Well, nothing today.

[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.180]
So far.

[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.420]
Tell them on the go at any good snuff films on there or what?

[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.360]
But I will tell you this.

[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.180]
When I drop Randy off at the airport, I'm going to tell her what a good time she's in for.

[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.660]
When you drop Randy off?

[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.820]
Yeah, I'm taking her to the airport this afternoon.

[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.500]
Who is this?

[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.180]
This is Lenny, the limo drive.

[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.320]
Oh, Lenny, the limo guy.

[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.340]
Yeah, I heard you, Lenny.

[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.740]
Were you listening last night when I called Randy with a great call?

[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.100]
Oh, I must have missed it.

[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.400]
What happened?

[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.500]
Like I said, he had to be there, Lenny.

[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.580]
No, I...

[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.440]
I was at the beer-ly.

[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.640]
We can barely hear you.

[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.160]
Now, is this going to control that level or what?

[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:47.460]
Wait a minute.

[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.200]
I can barely hear you.

[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.140]
Oh, yeah, I got it.

[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:50.660]
Yes!

[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.420]
Yes!

[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.300]
Let's hear it for the WSU engineering staff, man.

[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.980]
These guys are on top of it.

[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.580]
Neil, you're...

[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.800]
And if they ever get off of it, man, it's going to be big news.

[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.140]
You sound better on the phone now.

[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.100]
I could hardly hear you before.

[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.900]
Well, there you go, because I just cranked it up, man.

[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.500]
There you go.

[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.000]
I just reached over and cranked that baby one time.

[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.020]
No, it went to the like over there.

[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:06.580]
It's great.

[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.140]
It's beautiful.

[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.960]
It got like pelicans over here and it got like vast wilderness.

[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.480]
And you can smell the salt in the air and you can grieve, huh?

[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.160]
Are you in the mall?

[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.740]
Are you in the mall?

[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.600]
Are you in the mall?

[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.020]
Are you in the mall?

[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.100]
No, we're in the radio station where the polatial beautiful

[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.260]
state-of-the-art WSU engine can get off the floor studios.

[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.640]
Yeah, when you first went on, I was like, what's going on?

[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.600]
I heard all this mumbo jumbo.

[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.940]
Yeah, that's what we're here for.

[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.080]
It's lots of mumbo jumbo.

[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.620]
In fact, that's what we're having for lunch.

[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.520]
Mumbo jumbo.

[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.360]
There you go.

[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.160]
This is great.

[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.920]
Well, you guys sound like you're having a good time.

[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:36.920]
We're having a great time.

[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.580]
The bird is here.

[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.820]
We have a special surprise guest coming in any moment who may reconsider the whole idea

[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.840]
of the way that things go on.

[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.080]
So listen, Lenny, now what's the deal?

[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.100]
You're taking her to the airport.

[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.000]
I'll take her to the airport.

[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.860]
And I want you to tell her that the Tom Velvita and I, how do you like that?

[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.480]
The King and Queen are going to be there to pick, I'm not sure which is which.

[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.080]
Pick her up at the airport because Tom has never met her before.

[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:58.660]
Oh, OK.

[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.100]
I'm taking her up at two, so she should begin there.

[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:01.540]
Right.

[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.580]
And then I'm going to take her in her beautiful town car.

[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.780]
I'm going to go with her to the hotel and show her the polatial digs over there.

[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.500]
Get her situated.

[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.260]
It's going to be great.

[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.720]
She has never had royalty treatment like this.

[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.720]
Well, she may come off the plane suddenly.

[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.160]
I bring her a little bottle of champagne.

[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.580]
Great. Well, tell her just to rush up to me and kiss me all over my ass immediately.

[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.520]
Oh, let her know.

[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.200]
OK, Lenny.

[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.760]
All right, deal.

[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.420]
Have a great day.

[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.580]
Bye-bye now.

[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.420]
OK, so it's all working out.

[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.280]
This is exciting.

[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.000]
It's unbelievable.

[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.420]
Oh, my God.

[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.280]
The day is lost.

[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.580]
The day is lost.

[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.640]
It is all over.

[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.680]
Oh, I knew it.

[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.100]
I knew it.

[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.080]
So anyway, why don't we keep hearing that voice over an over 1028.

[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.820]
We're broadcasting from the the spik and span, the polatial, the so clean.

[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.600]
It's almost nauseating studio.

[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.340]
No, sir.

[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.180]
Stereol is the word that comes to mind.

[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.760]
It's beautiful, but there's a certain amount of sterility.

[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.200]
OK, like there's IOD.

[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.100]
No, listen to me.

[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.500]
There's IOD on the one hand, which is basically like a toilet because it's been abused.

[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.040]
And because people are there have no respect for the equipment and they write on stuff.

[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.460]
And it's like, it's like crappy.

[00:14:59.620 --> 00:14:59.820]
OK.

[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.280]
And this is the ultimate other extreme where it's like so sterile.

[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.720]
It's almost like a like there's going to be some kind of open heart surgery in here.

[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.460]
Oh, that's an FLAA.

[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.660]
There's going to be the open heart surgery.

[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:18.000]
So anyway, I mean, it could be four hours of agony or four hours of ecstasy all depending upon what you say.

[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.840]
Look who just happened to pop into studio here this morning.

[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.300]
Bob.

[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.420]
Is Bob on tape or is Bob lying?

[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.700]
I will not talk about it.

[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.060]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:28.380]
Listen.

[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.640]
First, I got your what phones.

[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.120]
What a pre-ordana and an asshole, man.

[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.520]
Hey, one head phone.

[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.560]
Yeah, just a minute.

[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.100]
Wait a minute.

[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.480]
Happy birthday to Adam.

[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.340]
We love you, sweetie.

[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.020]
Adam's like, what, ten today or something like that.

[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:42.820]
Adam's birthday today.

[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.240]
Adam is 22, 23.

[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.380]
Hey, that's the birthday greetings now.

[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.300]
Oh, you knew it.

[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.720]
I'm on after the micronary show.

[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.320]
Don't you understand?

[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.500]
Birthdays are an important part of our show.

[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.420]
I like what I was doing.

[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.660]
Yeah, that's for damn sure.

[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.240]
Not so fat.

[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.620]
And you either Bob.

[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.860]
Boy, I tell you between the two of us, we've lost like probably a whole Opie.

[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.960]
And what I was kidding about that.

[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.120]
And maybe even a Bob Neil.

[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.000]
You want head phones?

[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:05.300]
Yes.

[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.600]
Well, there are headphones here.

[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.460]
I don't want to damn things, but then I'm not going to hear.

[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.820]
I'll pass them over.

[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.180]
Go ahead, have some headphones, Bob Lasseter.

[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.360]
First, it's got to be.

[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.220]
Oh, pre-ordana.

[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.060]
Get your own headphones.

[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.620]
I want my headphones, Nurse Ratchet, well, God, get out of my face.

[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.480]
Here with a head phone.

[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.240]
See, they won't perform without headphones.

[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:22.980]
Oh, I can't.

[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:23.540]
Yeah.

[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.540]
That's what his wife said.

[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.060]
My fault.

[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:25.820]
Cheers.

[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.940]
His wife says he will not perform without headphones.

[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:28.520]
Ha!

[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.540]
Or at least part of it, anyway.

[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.540]
1030 at the WYOD.

[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.400]
What did the Schmendrichs down in Fort Myers must think of this?

[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.780]
All right, let's take a call while he's trying to get his body put together again.

[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.800]
Now, I don't understand what the OIC is.

[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.620]
So in other words, we've taken the lines and what we've done is I got it.

[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.220]
Clear water.

[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.260]
Hello.

[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.100]
Good morning.

[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.540]
Welcome to the West Coast, Neil.

[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:48.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.040]
What a tremendous.

[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.160]
The air is fresh.

[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.320]
The birds are dropping.

[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.000]
And it's an enormous stuff on our heads.

[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.580]
It's great.

[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.920]
Well, I was at the game Sunday and you signed my poster for me.

[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.240]
I really appreciate that.

[00:16:59.360 --> 00:16:59.580]
Great.

[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:00.480]
I had a lady singing.

[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.380]
It was good to meet you.

[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.900]
Well, it was great to be head, man.

[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.540]
And I'm bringing my sister down to meet you down in clear water.

[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:05.980]
Great.

[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.300]
Clear water, mall Saturday.

[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.560]
230 to 430.

[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.720]
We want at least 5,000 people there, OK?

[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.440]
Kim the frog.

[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.260]
Huh?

[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.240]
Kim the frog.

[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.420]
Yeah, Kim the frog.

[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.460]
Yeah, she'll be there.

[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.020]
Great.

[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.220]
And from, hey, Bobby, what have you been up to?

[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.620]
Oh, the.

[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.140]
Bobby.

[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:20.580]
Wait a minute.

[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:21.880]
You know, you know, I can't wait.

[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.180]
I'm going to talk to the caller because I cannot hear the caller in my head phone.

[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.660]
You will not hear the caller in my head phone.

[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:26.860]
Oh, man.

[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.140]
You guys want to reconsider.

[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.840]
This man is the biggest prima donna in a business, OK?

[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.820]
I cannot hear the caller in my head phone.

[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.980]
You're not going to hear my nose head phone either.

[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:37.360]
Are you?

[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:37.960]
I don't know.

[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:38.980]
You hear it?

[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.860]
Go ahead, talk, guy.

[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.480]
Well, scouts and corks.

[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.540]
Well, you do hear the phone.

[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.180]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.220]
OK, get his cords untied.

[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.420]
OK, let's get the surgeon in here to untie Lanceters corks so we can get him to hear the damn thing.

[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.280]
I'm sitting here as long as I know that I'm on the ear.

[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:52.980]
I can function.

[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.200]
This guy's like, oh, God, he's got to hear those deep tones of his own voice.

[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.740]
We're reporting back and he's got his earphones.

[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.080]
Yeah.

[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.260]
Can you hear him now?

[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.520]
Oh, yes.

[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:02.860]
Better?

[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.280]
What's better?

[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:03.600]
OK.

[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:04.340]
Go ahead.

[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.400]
Now I can't hear the guy.

[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.360]
He's got a muffler himself.

[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.560]
Since he put the headphones on, man, it's not like somebody put a sock over your head.

[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.660]
He's got a muffler.

[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.400]
Can you understand what he's saying?

[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.200]
No.

[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:16.460]
No.

[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.260]
Can't understand a word you're saying, man.

[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.520]
You are so muffled, it sounds like you got 40 pounds of Bob Neal in your mouth.

[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.620]
Hey, so is Bob going to be down there tomorrow?

[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.820]
Bob is going to be at the mall Saturday.

[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.480]
That is correct.

[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.580]
He's going to join us for a little appearance just to say hi to his old friends in Tampa.

[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.840]
And just to irritate open.

[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.080]
Well, I'm working on the gel.

[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.040]
Bob Neal.

[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.460]
How about Tom Velvita's?

[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.940]
Tom's going to be at the, you know, marginal.

[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:40.360]

[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:40.520]
He's marginal.

[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.840]
Depends if he can get enough security.

[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.820]
I think he's afraid of you.

[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.280]
Yeah.

[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.600]
Well, listen.

[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.660]
So you're in the water?

[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:46.580]
Yes.

[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.600]
And how is the beginning of the show today?

[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.220]
It, like I said, it's definitely going to be the cheese on, but you have to show it in signal.

[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:59.440]
If you could get inside Tom Velvita's car and just take a whiff of the aroma of head cheese, seriously.

[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.140]
The aroma of head cheese in that car.

[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.320]
I have never seen anything so filthy.

[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.500]
So this question, so grotesque.

[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:06.880]
I mean, here's this.

[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.480]
They're really doing it up big, putting us in these polatial digs.

[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.560]
And he picks me up in a car that I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Himmler, man.

[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.000]
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.600]
I have a great day, pal.

[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.000]
I'll see you.

[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.780]
I'll talk to him on a douchebag.

[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.580]
Okay, wait a minute.

[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.040]
Go ahead.

[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.880]
Ditto on Daniela, your douchebag.

[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.020]
Oh, thank you.

[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:22.340]

[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.360]
See you, see you Saturday.

[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.060]
Have a great life and get out of her face.

[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.600]
Am I right?

[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.980]
Oh, you haven't seen his car.

[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.620]
So Bob Lasseter is here and what brings you by, Bob?

[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.860]
Oh, just a little neighborhood view.

[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.660]
I'm not going to pass him by.

[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.700]
I heard that you were going to be in town and...

[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.220]
He can't talk with the headphones on.

[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.600]
He can't talk with the headphones on.

[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.080]
What happened to my other Lasseter car?

[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.160]
This is a mess.

[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.520]
Yeah, and this is exciting.

[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.960]
All right, now Lasseter can take one or two approaches.

[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.940]
If he wants to be on Tel Amundo, no, seriously, he can always do...

[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:56.420]
He can always practice that or he can go back to...

[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.200]
To...

[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.260]
To his trademark, which means you're going to have to put a sock over your mouth

[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.660]
when you start talking on the station.

[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.180]
What?

[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:04.840]
What was that?

[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.420]
That noise.

[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.640]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.160]
No, no.

[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:10.660]
That.

[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.400]
That's you, man.

[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.400]
That's your trademark.

[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.460]
That's the mark that you've left that you imprinted on the ass of my irons...

[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.500]
By irons, from Tampa to Chicago to back to Tampa again.

[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.840]
We'll talk about Chicago.

[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.080]
I was bigger than you.

[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.100]
WLS should have brought my WS tingles along.

[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:25.540]
Yeah.

[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:26.440]
I would have been great.

[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.120]
That would have been nuts.

[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.440]
It would have been great.

[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.240]
Let's do a couple of hours on Camp City's Broadcasting and how much you love their ass.

[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.020]
And then we'll do the Lass Tours on J-Core.

[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:34.700]
Oh.

[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.480]
Yeah, that covers the whole show today.

[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.700]
I'll just get up and leave now.

[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.160]
Oh, right.

[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.040]
No, seriously, they are treating us so well.

[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.740]
I'm not used to this.

[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.400]
I'm going through culture shock because this is Cox Broadcasting.

[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.500]
Isn't it still owned by Cox?

[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:45.980]
You bet.

[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.080]
That's a monologue here.

[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.740]
As a matter of fact, when you work for this company for 25 years,

[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.580]
I didn't know this, but Henry Barrow told me this,

[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.160]
that some companies give you a watch when you retire,

[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.340]
and they give you a beautiful ring.

[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.720]
It's known as the Cox Ring.

[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.460]
What's wrong with that?

[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.900]
Well, after your first year you got a set of glasses.

[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.840]
Now, you noticed I would not have said that in Miami.

[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.140]
Okay, 1035 on EIOD Network...

[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.340]
Uh, Martha, I can't get up.

[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.360]
What do you mean?

[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.400]
Well, the older I'm getting, the tougher it is to climb at a bed and start today.

[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.720]
George doesn't know it, but this morning he's getting prune tang.

[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.440]
A brand new breakfast drink that will get him up and active before he knows it.

[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.340]
Here, honey.

[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.700]
drink this. Mmm not bad tastes like

[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:42.420]
cranberry juice and tuna. I'm feeling good. I feel like a good move of

[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:48.680]
mountain. Come here little muffin. Oh, George. Don't let age get you down. Try the

[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.520]
new breakfast drink sweeping the rest homes of America. New prune tang. Prune

[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.000]
tang. It stores everywhere. What's napple two

[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.700]
mothers? 1039. I W I O D and W S U N and W W C N. I hope I just are not thinking

[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.840]
about them today. Never hear about it. Don't feel bad Tony Allen. We just don't give a

[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.840]
crap about you today. Okay. We got more important crap going on here today.

[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.640]
Speaking of crap. So Bob Lasseter is here with his centaurian tones and I can just

[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.100]
hear that staff meeting at F L A this afternoon at noon.

[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.400]
Oh, see. There's that lady over there at noon. So what they do start Bob?

[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:30.300]
Oh, I don't start that crap. Don't start on the wrong foot man. I'm

[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.000]
going to hire me over. They found a better talent for them. Well, they hired you over

[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.140]
here. Bob Lasseter starts on W S U N any day now. Well, well, Monday at February

[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.720]
first, Monday, February first, a week from next Monday. Lasseter is going to be on at

[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.600]
what time? 6 to 10 in the morning doing morning drive. We finally got to leave it.

[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.820]
We finally got to leave it, which means getting up at about 3 30 in the morning every

[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.620]
morning and getting like two pounds of mucus out of your assinuses going to be a kind

[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:59.740]
of like a mad dog's breakfast diner where we'll be serving bitter coffee and I will be

[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.740]
the surly waiter. What the hell is that? I have no idea. In other words, you have no idea

[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.860]
what you're going to do. You don't need the money. The executives of the cocks they love

[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.780]
the idea. So here's the deal. All you and we I don't want to hear from all those old

[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.280]
ladies. Please, I'm begging you because it could clear the whole deal if I can use that

[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.220]
expression. It could shower the whole thing.

[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:24.580]
Things dry. Yeah, right. Trust me. If the first call about Lasseter being on S U N is

[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.700]
a call. Hello, Bob. It's so wonderful. We're so exciting. We're changing the water with

[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.420]
our philosophy bag. That's it. Why is it those calls are okay for you? That's why they

[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:40.340]
have the escape clause in trust me. Okay. So there you go. S U N Tampa Bay, Lasseter returns

[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.260]
and at just a time we saved it till about 20 of so that by noon they can have lots of

[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.460]
KO pectate for the F LA staff meeting today. I've been here since like, you know, the

[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.840]
crack of dawn. I've been hiding the I think they're ashamed of me. So in other words, this

[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.320]
is a first I was sanded the bird that this is one of the few times in a history of the

[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.040]
business that anything anything has been kept under wraps because I've known about it

[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.920]
for about what two weeks. Yeah, something like that. And it never seeped out. No, didn't

[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.920]
have a clue either. Didn't have a clue what was going on. No, absolutely. And nobody is

[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.740]
nobody's never do. Well, inside the building did not know about this. That's why they all

[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.720]
have sour looks on their faces now, but they'll get over it. And no, the good part of it

[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.720]
is nobody's getting canned. When you feel bad if people were getting blown out for you

[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:32.040]
to be on an arcade. Boy. Oh, man. Oh, you just broke his day. Yeah. You know,

[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.540]
what goes around comes around. So in other words, you would like to have some people feel

[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.480]
the same at us. And you got when you got your ass tossed out of L S. I know. Well, that's

[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:47.280]
not they just that's not really true. It's not really what happened. Yes, it is. It's

[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:54.300]
got fired man. I did. I fired crappy ratings. Wow. Terms of show. Wow. Did you have a great

[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:59.580]
show up there? It's a crappy station. Well, I what really happened in L S. I was doing great.

[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.300]
And then I called this friend in Miami and I had him. Yeah, your show every day and send

[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.800]
it to me. Yeah. And I sat home every night and I transcribed everything that you said.

[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.220]
And I went in the next day and did your day. I think you got that. I think you started

[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.720]
doing that about seven, eight years ago. When you started doing that. Oh, let's take a

[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.980]
call. Now let's get these phones smoking. I have no idea what's going on on the phone

[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.900]
because the phones are coming in down there. 524 W I O D in Broward 751 W I O D in day. You

[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.520]
cannot smoke in here. I not that I'm interested, but you can't smoke in here. No, seriously,

[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:36.920]
is that true or what? Well, and 1 800 944 W I O D on the Tampa line. That line should

[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.800]
be smoking as I speak. If that line isn't smoking now, if all those old ladies aren't just

[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.440]
just rubbing their knees together, man, there's something wrong now. Bob, Bob, do you know

[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.840]
where green leaf is? No, I've no idea. Let's do green leaf. Hello, green leaf. Good

[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.300]
morning. Green leaf is near Lakeland right where the bird apparently. Oh my God. They

[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.780]
were heard of it. Well, look. Yeah. Well, Neil, if if bird wants to, if bird lives near

[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:11.780]
Lakeland, he must want to live in a place where family trees don't branch. I'm telling

[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.700]
you, if you want to test the limits of their expense account over there and they took

[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:20.300]
you to Donatello, have you been to Donatello? Yes, sir. In my right is it tremendous. The

[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.820]
positive was a positive was some of the best I've ever had in my life, seriously. Have

[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.520]
him take it to I mentioned this one I call for to Armani's on top of the Hyatt West Shore.

[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.160]
Yeah. It's the best Italian restaurant. There's a beautiful view at night and there, I mean,

[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.220]
their credit card will smoke when they have to. Good. That's the idea. I even had dessert

[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.100]
last night. I haven't been eating desserts for a month, but I had a last night just to

[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.340]
boost the bill up a little bit. Oh, yeah. I'm real happy to hear you in Central Florida.

[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.520]
I'm glad that Bob's coming back. You can buy a lot of stock and depends because it's

[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:58.620]
going to go up over there. Uh-huh. I'm here. Here are your folks over here. Here are

[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.600]
new folks over here. It's great because it's like going back to go back to South Florida

[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.620]
where I used to live. Now I was in that hotel room last night waiting for a Rick Orrally

[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:11.620]
to show up because he drove over with his a cheerleading wife. And seriously, and so he

[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.620]
shows up a quarter after midnight with the carts and all the stuff I had to bring in here

[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:19.420]
this morning, which was a heavy box by the way, Riley. And so I'm listening to Randy

[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.860]
and I got so animated and excited. I caught around the year to tell her the good news about

[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.580]
how well we're being treated. And then I got to listen to the best of Nealtapes again.

[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:32.280]
And I was enjoying it. Oh, yeah. Which is frightening. Okay. But sitting over here in this area

[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.160]
and being able to hear like a real radio station, yeah. These people should be absolutely

[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.100]
just just licking us all over our body parts. Well, Neal, the next time you come up here,

[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:46.300]
maybe we can get you into Central Fort. He can over and trash the parks on the air. Great. Can I call

[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.680]
somebody a douchebag? Sure. If it'll end the call, you bet. Okay. John, a girl bank,

[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:56.700]
village branch, your douchebag. Okay. See you. Bye. Here it is. Everyone have to end their call

[00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.160]
that way. No, they do not. They can do whatever the hell they want. They just can't start their call

[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.660]
that way. Are you going to start attacking my tremendous success in my eight-year and mid-day 25 to 54?

[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.620]
God what? I mentioned. I think you want to start.

[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.880]
Look at your book. That's right. That's right. My mom.

[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.360]
Who would you like? Go ahead. Who would you like to call a douchebag? Just go right ahead. No one.

[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.460]
How about Oopie? How about Oopie? Is it a douchebag?

[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.020]
It's disgusting term that shot about Oopie is a douchebag.

[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.760]
It's a W man pig. It's a disgusting term that should not be allowed on the air.

[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.700]
Is that his power pig? Yes. No, it's not his power pig. Yes it is.

[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:38.420]
Oh, I can't wait to tell those stories. Like what stories do I and not at FLA? Why I left

[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.060]
FLA? Yeah. Why did you leave FLA? Why don't I leave?

[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.100]
Not for my give, man. No, but I mean just a little taste, just a little tease.

[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.280]
A headline. Why? It's a little... Alaska. Alaska.

[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:55.200]
Alaska. Fair banks? Anchorage? I tried. Maybe they're going to get any more out of me.

[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.960]
Guys do this. Maybe the reason you're not at WLS anymore is your mic technique blows, Bob.

[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.480]
No, if I had headphones then I wouldn't have popped another one.

[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.580]
Well you have the headphones. What happened to them?

[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.880]
Heroboels. That's why it's mic. Heroboels.

[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.620]
I think that's why he got blown out of L.S.

[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.480]
Can't really hear bad mic technique and hard of hearing. Other than that.

[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.620]
No, seriously because he's got a really great voice but he just can't hear himself.

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.020]
So he screams and shouts and gets raspy and then gets all psychotic.

[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.380]
What do you mean I scream and shout?

[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.340]
You have been...

[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.480]
You've been hysterical. You've been hysterical.

[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.180]
Yeah, I mentioned Opia in FLA and...

[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.060]
And that Randy might be about a month and a half ago.

[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.020]
About Opia.

[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.440]
Opia did.

[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.180]
Opia job?

[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:37.660]
I'll be back.

[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.180]
Offered Bob Lasseter nights.

[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.000]
For like three seventy five.

[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.980]
He did not offer you one.

[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.540]
He offered me the opportunity to audition for a night for nights.

[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.500]
Come back to hearing audition.

[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.000]
You know what auditioning on the air for a job in Tampa is like...

[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.700]
That's the station.

[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.900]
You got to get the job.

[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:57.880]
Can you hear Bob?

[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:58.720]
I don't hear him.

[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.440]
Oh, I see.

[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.500]
You know something?

[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.760]
Having this board, having controls.

[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.780]
This is what it's all about. It's like Zed again.

[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:08.260]
Yeah.

[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.440]
I don't have to put up with pompous asses like him.

[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.860]
I can just like shut the mic.

[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.060]
He used to do that to me, Bob.

[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:13.260]
Yeah.

[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.260]
You're both off.

[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.880]
Look at that. They're both off and they just say they're bop-bop-bop.

[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.560]
They're both off.

[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:19.900]
It's great.

[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.080]
It's power man.

[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.140]
It's like the power pig.

[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.100]
I could be like the next power pig.

[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.900]
And Bob could just be like the next pig.

[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.860]
Now Bob actually lost a lot of weight.

[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.060]
I want everybody, all the old ladies out there to know that Bob has lost a lot of weight.

[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:33.600]
Looks good.

[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.280]
Should we do a break?

[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.220]
1048, honey.

[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:36.700]
I would do that.

[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.820]
You two stop eyeing me.

[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.080]
Grab me some thighs.

[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.100]
I feel myself.

[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.500]
I'm like the guinea pig.

[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:56.840]
Yeah.

[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:57.380]
Yeah.

[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.220]
Do you have somebody said that a guido is lies and I got punched down.

[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:01.880]
What is it?

[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.920]
I wanted to put my finger on this piece of pita bread here.

[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:05.860]
Oh yeah.

[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.280]
I'm not trying to bring that.

[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.400]
I didn't bring the bird sandwich.

[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.180]
We can do it live.

[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.120]
You got to admit that Jim Skyler, man.

[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.720]
He took him a while.

[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.260]
He was a little rusty at first, but he has come back to great form.

[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.540]
You know what's interesting is he plays.

[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.980]
I believe he plays you in those bits and he plays me.

[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.180]
Think about it.

[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:23.280]
That is.

[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.400]
That's covering a lot of territory.

[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.160]
Boggles the month.

[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.400]
All right, let's take some of these calls because I know that Bob is.

[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.660]
His ego is very deflated.

[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.920]
He thought that the phone would just blow right out as soon as he made the big announcement.

[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.720]
Either that or they think it's a joke.

[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.360]
Let's do St. Pete.

[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.620]
St. Peter's bird isn't it?

[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:37.820]
Hello.

[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:39.820]
St. Pete.

[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:40.540]
Neil.

[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.020]
Yes.

[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:41.780]
Oh.

[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:42.900]
Hey, hey.

[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.860]
Yeah, I'm going to.

[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.840]
Soon as you made the announcement.

[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.900]
Do them in destruction when I get up in the morning with my coffee.

[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.180]
What's that?

[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:53.640]
That'd be great.

[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.320]
Butt butt butt butt butt butt.

[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.920]
You left that one where you go.

[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.620]
I have no idea what you're talking to.

[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.460]
The one where the one where he called you and went.

[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.500]
Butt butt butt butt butt.

[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.600]
You have poisoned their mind.

[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.800]
You had spent eight years of your life poisoning.

[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.160]
Oh, we go.

[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:14.720]
Yeah.

[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:15.440]
Yeah.

[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.320]
Yeah.

[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.000]
You're looking forward to an artist, sir.

[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.940]
But they need to get you animated in the morning.

[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.520]
You just start throwing things at the radio and just bang and scrap all around the room, huh?

[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.500]
What are you going to keep the Congress and all these other thoughts?

[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.920]
They're like, uh, they're going to go get Bob coffee in the morning.

[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.760]
They're going to be, uh, you know, go for it.

[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.160]
They're not being fired.

[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.180]
Oh, they're not being fired.

[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:36.880]
No, they are not.

[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.260]
And nobody's out the morning news gigs here.

[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.100]
They're going to be doing the news, man.

[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.780]
They're going to be around here doing the news and the weather and the traffic.

[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.640]
It's going to be your news weather and traffic station.

[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.880]
It's Cox Broadcasting, man.

[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.980]
And Bob is going to be reading the birthday list.

[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.080]
And you think about which movie grossed the most of the box office and all that other stuff.

[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.600]
This day in history, the all the night.

[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.220]
The guest is older.

[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.260]
You're going to be going in with the fans, huh?

[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.360]
Then he can compare who's audience is older.

[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.480]
His or Mike Brennery.

[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.760]
You read the birthday.

[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.060]
Although I will say this, I'm sure that Bob's got a bigger.

[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.240]
Yeah.

[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.180]
Have the have the news geeks, guess?

[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.580]
No, what they need to do.

[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.500]
Well, they are.

[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.740]
Who wants to feed you?

[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.720]
I have the studio.

[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.380]
Yeah.

[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.900]
I have a great place in town called Bob.

[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.580]
Well, the bird was just sucking around for some free lunch, by the way.

[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:23.780]
Okay, because they got a great place in town where I eat.

[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.260]
It's got very good vegetarian food.

[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.860]
It's in the Italian place down in Forestry.

[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.040]
They're an issue in sponsor.

[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.040]
And it's called Pasta's.

[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:31.980]
You have a break in the city.

[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.820]
You must have a piece of that place.

[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.500]
I'm telling you, this is about the 85th time you called us about that.

[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.520]
You really believe that Neil's a veggie ball, huh?

[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.660]
But did I have any meat at that dinner last night?

[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.280]
Mr. Lasseter, Mr. Loudmouth, Mr. Fajita?

[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.540]
Did you order any from your plate?

[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.560]
No, I did not.

[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.460]
Did I have any from anybody else's plate?

[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.200]
Yeah, this man is still full.

[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.160]
That made me, you know, I mean, I don't know.

[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.480]
60 pounds myself doing the same thing.

[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.260]
Yeah, that's great.

[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.360]
Finish that prime red?

[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.600]
Well, listen, you're continuing to be one of the most

[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.220]
elucidating colors in history.

[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.100]
So you have a great day and a great life, okay?

[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.380]
And thanks for the big tip.

[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:07.340]
See you.

[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.540]
So you can call out like Mickey Mantle

[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.440]
when it's his birthday and then the news geeks can go.

[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.140]
Baseball.

[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.360]
Yeah, you know, it's great.

[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:13.920]
It's a great one.

[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.580]
That's what it is.

[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.640]
Isn't that what the show's going to be?

[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.240]
Mickey Mantle.

[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.200]
It'll be like Mike Greenery West, isn't it?

[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.620]
Let's do Miami on a star line.

[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:21.720]
I guarantee you they're not still there.

[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.000]
Hello.

[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.080]
Hello, Neil.

[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:23.920]
You are still there?

[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:24.620]
Yeah.

[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.300]
What a guy.

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.380]
Oh, man, I've been here for a long time.

[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:27.720]
I'm going to go.

[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.680]
Hey, I'm from Miami.

[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.740]
Got to tell you something.

[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.820]
I want to say it.

[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.920]
Drift back to real fast.

[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:33.720]
Wait a minute.

[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.120]
Wait a minute.

[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:34.940]
Wait a minute.

[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.140]
Are you listening to our show today?

[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:37.820]
Yeah, I taught douchebags.

[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:38.520]
Huh?

[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.020]
It taught douchebags today.

[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:40.480]
It is.

[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.920]
We've got a bunch of douchebags over here.

[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.420]
That is correct.

[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.480]
But I mean, don't you want to have like a little verbal intercourse

[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.600]
before you jump into that?

[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.020]
And just just no.

[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:47.880]
Well, no, wait a minute.

[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.500]
How he used to do two and three?

[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.540]
Just a pretend.

[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.020]
I shut his mic off.

[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.200]
And just I did.

[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.040]
And just pretend that you like had a read.

[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.260]
You wanted to call and say hi.

[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.080]
And it's great here in your.

[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.200]
How do let me ask you something?

[00:34:59.300 --> 00:34:59.960]
How does it sound?

[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.200]
Oh, it sounds great.

[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.760]
I haven't seen you like in six months.

[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.100]
I saw you once in a piece a lot.

[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:04.820]
A long time ago.

[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.180]
Yeah.

[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.400]
And it was exciting.

[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.040]
Yeah.

[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:13.000]
We're going to be at Pizza Lop next Tuesday, 53830 in the BM.

[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:13.560]
Yeah.

[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.940]
I still have your sign autograph picture and everything.

[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.500]
Boy, here's the guy with the real life.

[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.860]
Like I said, who do you want to call?

[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.840]
Let's get this over with.

[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.680]
Who do you want to call what?

[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.060]
OK.

[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.780]
Let me just store this guy.

[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.300]
This guy is certified in everything.

[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.960]
I mean, he's certified in Fort Lift Operator.

[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.520]
Certified as a Lymphventory Clerk.

[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.620]
He's certified as a part of the company.

[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.240]
Yeah.

[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:35.240]

[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.380]
This guy has it all.

[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.540]
His name is Lewis Bellow.

[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.200]
Yeah.

[00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.380]
And he works with me in the city.

[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.000]
And he's going to leave now.

[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.640]
He's going to be a certified Maytag washer dryer mechanic.

[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.620]
I think certified is the word for this car.

[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.480]
I see you got the right word for him.

[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.020]
Oh, man.

[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.160]
This guy has better over 20,000 women.

[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.060]
He says, and he weighs 280.

[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:54.800]
Wait, wait.

[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.120]
He's bent over what?

[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.900]
Over 20,000 women.

[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.800]
He's bent over 25,000 women.

[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.200]
What is he, a carapractor?

[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.700]
I don't know.

[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.860]
Sometimes we say the amount of weight he's better

[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.900]
or the amount of women, because it's very, very.

[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.360]
I mean, this guy says the first woman he had

[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.700]
was when he was 10 years old.

[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.740]
So I want to call Lewis Bellow a major, major, major lead

[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.240]
douchebag.

[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.120]
OK.

[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.320]
OK, thanks.

[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.320]
I knew there was something good coming at the end of this call.

[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:20.900]
Have a great life.

[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.380]
Now, I think there's a limit on those heavy machinery

[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:25.620]
often.

[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:26.800]
Audio limit.

[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.060]
Where did this carlager come from?

[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.060]
Where does this voice come from?

[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.200]
Who was that?

[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.200]
That was neat.

[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.700]
How long was he still on there?

[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.960]
Oh, George must be playing grab ass with that over there.

[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:36.960]
Well, it's Adam's birthday.

[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.840]
No, I was saying I don't think.

[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:39.260]
What?

[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:40.580]
What?

[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.000]
What are you getting on the air here for?

[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.000]
George?

[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.440]
Oh, man, this guy.

[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.320]
See, he's at the opportunity all of a sudden.

[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.340]
He's getting like Marvin now.

[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.100]
Pretty soon, he'll be driving around with Bobo.

[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:51.900]
Please.

[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.040]
Yeah, please.

[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.780]
So anyway, Rick and Sutts are going to be here this afternoon.

[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.040]
Aren't they going to have a good time?

[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.420]
Oh, boy.

[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.380]
You are going to have a good time when you head for them.

[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.460]
They don't even need head for them.

[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.440]
I don't know too many primadanas in his business.

[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.920]
You need head for professionals.

[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.420]
No, they do not.

[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.060]
Professional assholes.

[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.660]
You have to film Bob.

[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.420]
I don't need no head for them.

[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:13.880]
So where'd you go with that cut?

[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.360]
Now, let me ask you a question.

[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.060]
Are you going to be like you're going to do your show

[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.120]
in here right now?

[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.540]
I don't know.

[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.120]
Are we going to go about Don now?

[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.760]
Are we going to be talking about Bob being on S u?

[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.880]
And they must think it's a joke.

[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:23.580]
I don't know.

[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.240]
I think he will be in this room.

[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.180]
I'm pretty sure.

[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:30.280]
going back to Iowa. New department just got a report that like there are

[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.480]
tremendous massive crowds on the top floors of every building in town.

[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.740]
Huh? Is that mean it's time to jump? Everybody join hands and let's jump

[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:43.760]
together okay? Yeah. Well, it's just a tone in the voice. Nothing personal

[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.960]
but tone in the voice. They are depressing tone kind of like

[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.200]
you're good. That's the one. That's the one. That's the one.

[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:57.020]
My audience is mine. No, I'm I am building up the town. I am building up for you a

[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:01.460]
crowd. It's going to be there going to be that. I was big in the town. I was big.

[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.640]
Yeah. I have big numbers. Then the day when you needed two chairs to sit in this

[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.100]
damn place. Okay, now I should do the thing about the commemolus house. I have no

[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.560]
idea of what's going on with that. We had a little over 133,000 yesterday. We're

[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.000]
doing spectacular. We got our thing at pizza lot. Tone up Tuesday night five thirty

[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.960]
to eight thirty and the toll free number is one eight hundred eight five two

[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.200]
006. Is that right George? Is that right? I'll get lost.

[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:33.080]
Hi, this is Jim. Love your show. Nio. Love you. Love you.

[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.640]
All across the country people are eating beef or dinner. In Laredo, Texas, the

[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.700]
Bingham family is being poisoned by a bad butt loss. In Milwaukee,

[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.300]
Stan Fletcher is choking to death on a water-fulenium and in

[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.740]
Kittering name, the Johnson's are watching over Jean Havocornary.

[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.680]
The doc says the lifetime of eating burgers is blocked as arteries tighter than

[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:59.480]
a hangman's news. At the end of the day, nothing kills so many people in so

[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.660]
many different ways. Beef. It's what's for dinner.

[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:07.160]
Pick me up. Possibly your last dinner. Chop, pop. You know what I mean about this

[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.720]
guy? This guy belongs in his business like I belong before happy to see the

[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.400]
burgers that weigh an Arnold sound. Yeah. Now, I heard speaking of Bob, you

[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.860]
missed this because this was only on the S.U.N. news. Are you sure that you want

[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:22.860]
your mic this low? Uh, I didn't. How about like this? I'm sorry. This was the, uh,

[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.580]
this was the story that just ran on the Tampa news, right, which they did not

[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.200]
hear in Miami or the Iowa prestigious IOD network. And just like the old days

[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.260]
is eight hour, I will read this. I'll read it cold. It's got some good, it's got

[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:38.020]
some good words in it. The irrepressible area of

[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:43.280]
sight and always entertaining Bob Lasseter will join News Talk radio 620 WSUN

[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.500]
on Monday. That's where he's one. Yeah. Why are you making that face and sticking

[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:52.300]
your finger in your mouth, Neil? Lasseter will host WSUN's new morning show

[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.200]
from 610. The call informat will highlight his unique

[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.080]
interactive style with his audience. Brief news, cast and traffic reports will

[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:07.120]
keep his listeners informed as well as entertain. You got it, baby. You got it.

[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.700]
Lasseter's not my light. Lasseter's not my light. Well, somebody said it.

[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.000]
That sounds a lot like you. Lasseter's show will be the first local talk program to

[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.240]
originate from WSUN's Tampa Bay studio since the station changed to its News Talk format in June.

[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:26.600]
The balance of the talk show programming originates from WSUN's Miami sister in law station

[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.380]
WIOD AMA longtime favorite with Tampa Bay radio listeners.

[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.620]
Lasseter left the area in June of 89 to become the midday host

[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:42.540]
on Chicago's legendary WLSAM while announcing the hiring of Lasseter Todd P. Lesser,

[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.440]
Vice President and General Manager of WSUN commented, quote,

[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:51.260]
since changing the News Talk last June, we've received a steady stream of calls from Bob's

[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:56.940]
Tampa Bay fans requesting his return. Needless to say, we're delighted that we've been able to

[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:02.580]
honor their request. The way first is today's 6th and 8th Monday through Friday is the time

[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:07.520]
News Talk Radio 620 WSUN is the place for a lively entertaining start to your day.

[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.240]
Bob Lasseter is the answer from our information called Tom Belvida.

[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:16.140]
Okay, and it does say Belvida. It does say Belvida. Anyway, Joel is here, Frankenstein with

[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.260]
probably some grubs. So anyway, we're really doing it. It's 11.08.

[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.580]
Doing that begging for food. Yes, we're up. Of course.

[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.880]
It's a job with some crap. Okay, let's get these, George, let's do the 800 lines.

[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.760]
Okay, I want to see the tremendous respond. Old smart. Hello.

[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:36.820]
Hello. Yes, sir. Hello. How you doing? Welcome, Bob. I wasn't around to listen to Bob when he was

[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:41.980]
here before, but I'm looking forward to it. The reason I called you, Neil. Now it's over here on the East Coast.

[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:48.540]
I'm over here on the East Coast. I'm sorry. I think you're looking at like an upside down.

[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:53.160]
Stand facing the other way. Okay. Those people over on the East Coast, they're jealous.

[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:57.760]
About what? Well, first of all, we don't have a baseball team. They do.

[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:02.660]
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. We didn't have to suffer through the playoffs in football.

[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.280]
Yeah. We did. Yeah. We have a hockey team. They got one coming on.

[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.040]
Uh-huh. They're just extremely jealous. Yeah.

[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.620]
You're just not. I tell you something. We're having a great time.

[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:18.180]
I don't know if this would be a great permanent, but we're having a hell of a time.

[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:23.600]
It's great. Well, we treated like royalty. You think you saw some royal balls last night?

[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:30.920]
In this period of our attitude over here, we have filed suit today in federal court

[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.760]
to block you and Randy and Rick and Spud from leaving.

[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.080]
Great. That's really good. You know, I mean, I figured that's all the BS

[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.300]
that goes on between tap and Miami and we'll just turn around the other way.

[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.360]
Okay. Thanks for your load. Have a great day.

[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.140]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got a question for you.

[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.840]
You made a comment a whole month ago. You're talking about Bob Prince.

[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.920]
Yeah. And you said his wife controls his...

[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.080]
The tapes, yeah. Why wouldn't KDK control those?

[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.860]
Uh, because he didn't work for KDKA. He worked for the pirates.

[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.300]
And the pirates wouldn't control them?

[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.740]
No. Well, I mean, it all depends on the contract. Every contract is different.

[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.260]
And evidently, that was part of what he left, along with the empty bottles.

[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.580]
They were a bunch of them. Yeah. I mean, towards the end, he got...

[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.140]
He was pretty bad. He was coherent, yeah.

[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.160]
Yeah. I mean, remember when he came back and he did the ABC Monday Night Baseball?

[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.380]
Right. And he had the game in Pittsburgh and he gave him that incredible ovation

[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.560]
and he almost broke down and it was tremendous.

[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.280]
Well, listen, you're really a hell of a collar, but, you know, the time is up.

[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.920]
See you. Have a great life. Have a have fun.

[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.680]
The duck just fell. By the way, if that isn't the worst show that's been on in recent memory.

[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.160]
What? What? Uh, with Bill Cosby. You bet your life.

[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.360]
Oh, yeah. I've never seen him. Oh, my God.

[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.220]
Talk about him, man. Yeah. Run away. Ego.

[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.040]
That shows, uh, going soon. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.160]
They're going to rest. Run away. Ego. Yeah.

[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.460]
Now, and let me ask you about this first card. This card. You have a number one.

[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.140]
This card.

[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.380]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.280]
Tell them, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.040]
Yeah, that's from Telemundo.

[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.720]
You know, you can't see enough of those Telemundo tapes.

[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.540]
I think we may have heard that, though. Yeah. I think that's enough.

[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:09.460]
Okay. I don't know. So anyway, look, and we got Tampa and Tampa and Clearwater and

[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.200]
there they come. Antonio, man, the word is spreading like wildfire, like a gigantic

[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.840]
good disease. We're only 48 minutes away from the FLA staff meeting at noon,

[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:21.180]
where they're going to be handing out KO Pectate and the doggy bags and Jun Allison is going

[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.860]
to be bringing in some depends. Huh.

[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.320]
And they're going to be changing their food to the loom like every five minutes.

[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.880]
And of course, they're big deal. Oh, last and a we don't really care about that.

[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.320]
He's old news in Tampa. You know, the way they operate with everything like they don't

[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.480]
really care, but they will be taking, I mean, they will be taking every minute of every show

[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.880]
when you're on the air and they'll be writing letters to Arbatron and writing letters to a WLS

[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.400]
and everybody in America, you know, trying to make some kind of a thing.

[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:50.600]
I'm a little bit concerned. I don't see all I can possibly compete in this morning.

[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.760]
God, he had to die to my lady on himself up for a living. Oh, great.

[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:07.440]
I've made a mistake. We're going to try to go back and you know,

[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.240]
cart weight. I mean, listen, oh, we go. Yeah, you think it's muffled.

[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.340]
It's not muffled. It's just the way he speaks. He's like five yards.

[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.640]
He's like, hey, have a great day. It's like five yards off Mikey right hand over.

[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.540]
It's off like that. That's why I need headphones.

[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.660]
And the one we did in this market that can relate to stuff they can understand.

[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.740]
Oh, we don't know what he was saying, but he sure had a wonderful voice.

[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.960]
It was those soothing. I was the Neil Rogers of Tampa.

[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.920]
12 minutes after you should only live so long.

[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:33.760]
12 minutes after 11 on the IOD Network.

[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:47.320]
first morning on here that first Monday. So Joel is here with some

[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.780]
my pairing could go into the last of the rest of my life. I'm now into my fifth

[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:56.700]
week and you see just because you have five weeks. Oh my god. He brought some

[00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:00.480]
problems at. He brought some stuff. He's only like you know the four kids like the

[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:07.260]
craft. This is the worst craft I've ever eaten in my life. You want me to lie?

[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.160]
You want me to say oh god this is so good. Please. Huh? You like it? I like it too

[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.360]
but not this. He did this using with Richard Simmons. No I did not. This is

[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:21.000]
garbage man. I haven't. I haven't. I haven't. I don't use salad right on

[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.060]
rice. It's salad. Get out of here with his craft. Your intentions are great.

[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:30.180]
Haha. The olive is good. Oh god. That's the best. Yeah. I've had in years. I like the

[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:34.340]
salad. Hmm. The salads very good. Like the salad. Yeah. The lettuce is like

[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:39.300]
wilted man. This tastes like crap. It does. You're used to this right Joel? He

[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:44.120]
want me to lie to him. God. It's like saying boy that was sure a great

[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.080]
driving at race Peter huh? And he's like a backing through the field on the

[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.660]
outside. So anyway is it Derby Lane? You were wrong. It is not Tampa dog track. Derby

[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:56.860]
Lane is open. All right. Hmm. I think so. I said Derby Lane is open and they're

[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.720]
right up the street from the radio station. We passed the damn thing on a way

[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.980]
over here. It's like two minutes away from the radio station. I thought the

[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:07.520]
station was in Tampa. I didn't realize. Yeah. You have no clue what's going on. What

[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.000]
are you going to do with this crap? God. This is horrible. Okay. Let's do a

[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.460]
candle. Hello. Kindle. Speak to us. Neil. Yes sir. Hey. This is fabulous. We have

[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:22.280]
the bird back. The bird is back briefly. Yes. And he sounds like he has never

[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:26.840]
left. That's right. So he picked up right where he left off man. He's eating and he's

[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.540]
having a great time. He's cackled up the storm. Cackling up the storm. And Bob is

[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.580]
just eating and the eating and eating. Yeah. Did you bring the cart that I hate the

[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:40.100]
bird cart? No. Oh man. I wouldn't if I wouldn't realize he was going to play such a

[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.740]
prominent role in the show. I would have brought that foot. Well, history is repeating

[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:49.480]
itself today and just not all that bad. Wow. You're going to be. You hear that? Let

[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.300]
him come in. That let's end it. Compliment. In other words, that is the left hand

[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.020]
to come in. In other words, it could be worse. He could be coming back to stay, right?

[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:00.600]
Yes. Right. Please. He's looking good. He's looking fine. He's no worse for the

[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.700]
wearer. And he's looking good. He's added 20 years to his life by getting out of

[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.960]
business. Well, the reception here in Miami is kind of distant. What do you mean by that?

[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:13.420]
Well, you know, it's just not quite as sharp as it is. So, you know, something. This

[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:17.200]
is all psychological. I have and I do want to say this. No, sir, I'm glad you mentioned

[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.180]
that because we keep getting these calls probably OPs people because half our calls from over

[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:25.340]
here have been from FLA anyway. But we keep getting go all, you know, it just doesn't sound

[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.560]
right on SUN and there's something about the quality of their signal and the sound of

[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.980]
the. Let me tell you something. It sounds like we're sitting right inside the goddamn

[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.460]
transmitter. I listened yesterday and it's not really. It sounds perfect. It sounds great.

[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:40.280]
It's over here, doesn't it? Huh? Not over here. You mean today? Today, right?

[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.040]
Well, like on a scale of one to ten. I'll give it a maybe four and a half.

[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:50.140]
No. That bad? That bad. George, is it that bad? Yes. It is that bad. What's wrong?

[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:55.640]
Wow. What's the problem? What is the main thing? I just muddy and stuff. It's muddy.

[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.300]
Well, we don't give a crap about that. That's only when Lassiter speaks. It's not.

[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.900]
Oh, yeah. See? Muddy.

[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.300]
I call it Lassiter a deep back.

[00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:06.400]
You Lassiter, yeah.

[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.080]
See ya. Great call.

[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:14.360]
What you're going to get. Oh, yeah, you like that call. He calls Bill Lassiter.

[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.280]
He calls Bill Lassiter a reduced factor. Are you going to take it personally?

[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.980]
I'm going to take it. Are you holding the bag for every Lassiter?

[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.560]
Are you using me for eight years now?

[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.020]
Further your career.

[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.600]
If we had a shovel in here, man, I'll tell you we could start now and by the time

[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.300]
Rick and Suds came out, we'd still be digging. That's how deep it is.

[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:40.200]
The last agreeable Bob, you played the worst swill I have ever had in my life.

[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:45.380]
And he worked for hours to cook that rice and to like pick the lettuce and tomatoes and

[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:49.360]
you pick them up, place or whatever. We'll get some other stuff in here, won't we?

[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:53.060]
Anyway, Tom is hovering around outside of Tom, Belvita.

[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:56.900]
Get in here Tom. Seriously, come here Tom. Come on.

[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.940]
Can you get us some good stuff in here for lunch?

[00:50:59.260 --> 00:50:59.900]
What kind of stuff?

[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.660]
How about like some, can we get some pasta or something?

[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.920]
Not no meat. I'm not going to go back especially with Mr. Egor sitting here

[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.340]
over looking the operation. He went to the first week on that and what a BS artist

[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:14.700]
Neil Rogers, how he's eaten, like in the family members sitting there with your

[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.980]
beggings. Eat the bread from me. Yeah.

[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.460]
Join at any working. Can we work on something?

[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:23.420]
How about for getting warehouse? This is the worst crap. You eat it. You eat it.

[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:28.140]
Okay. Remember in Godfather 3 and she gives him the canola. He says, oh you're so skinny.

[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.420]
You eat it. Tom, you're so skinny. You eat it. Okay.

[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:32.720]
Staking shake?

[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.120]
Yeah, we got some canola for it.

[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.980]
Oh, oh. Staking shake.

[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:36.060]

[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.360]
Then I would go off my thing. I'm not going to do that.

[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.040]
No, go off your thing for you.

[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.900]
You see what an asshole we're dealing with here. I'm trying to get on the road to

[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:46.680]
better health and he wants to take me down to path to fat my arteries again.

[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.640]
One double steak burger, ain't going to kill you.

[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.320]
I'm not going to do that. I am not going to do that.

[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:54.560]
But she's not. I am not going to do that. No. No change.

[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.440]
What do you want? You're going to stay. You're an asshole, Tom.

[00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:58.840]
What are you really on?

[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.100]
I want pasta in here. Don't ask them what they want. I'm the star.

[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.080]
Okay. I'm the one that you're putting the $8,000

[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.800]
night room up there in a penthouse. Get some goddamn food in here and cut the crap.

[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.000]
Go find some. Get on it.

[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.980]
I'm so sorry. I asked him to come out here.

[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:12.680]
He's going to go cook.

[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:13.500]
Huh? Yeah.

[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.300]
You're going to go cook this.

[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:14.920]
And I love it.

[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.960]
These guys are like incredible over here.

[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.000]
You're terrified of it.

[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.000]
You think that they had superstars over here or something.

[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:21.860]
We're just a bunch of slabs for my Annie, man.

[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:22.800]
Wait until you go.

[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.720]
That's like royalty.

[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.000]
This way till you go home.

[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:25.620]
Huh?

[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.800]
It's going to be incredible when you go back to the...

[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.500]
I'm going to let them.

[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:28.840]
Yeah.

[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:29.600]
What a let them.

[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.080]
Next Monday.

[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.640]
I'm going to have to feed the dogs in a whole bit.

[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:32.860]
Exactly.

[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:33.740]
Your dogs now.

[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.340]
I have two dogs.

[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:35.800]
Two.

[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.520]
I'm going to go jack.

[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:38.700]
Oh, she is.

[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.240]
Well, he's going to talk about it on a year.

[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.600]
God almighty.

[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.000]
I'm going to have many of you just kidding.

[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.520]
I'm sure I got it golden retriever.

[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:47.900]
You got one more retriever.

[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:48.320]
Hello.

[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:49.580]
What was the other guy?

[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:50.860]
Oh, my.

[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.040]
Miniature pincher, which I'm sure you can relate to.

[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.960]
Let's go to a table.

[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:55.540]

[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.540]
You'll leave me.

[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.000]
Tampa.

[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:57.600]
Hello.

[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:58.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:59.200]
Neil Rogers.

[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.560]
Welcome to Tampa, sir.

[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:01.600]
Thank you very much.

[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.600]
You're welcome to St. Pete.

[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.840]
Isn't the other way around.

[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.480]
Yes, it's great to be here, man.

[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.920]
It is a phenomenal thing.

[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.840]
It is a great honor to speak to you, sir.

[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:09.440]
Damn right.

[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.500]
I'm a big fan.

[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:11.740]
Oh, how big.

[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.580]
I'm about six, two.

[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:15.280]
But my brother, my brother,

[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.220]
when you mentioned, sir,

[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.900]
that is what I meant as exactly what I meant.

[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.840]
OK, my brother went down to Miami for the relief effort.

[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.420]
And he started listening to you.

[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.700]
And he came back to Tampa and he said,

[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.300]
you got listen to Mr. Rogers.

[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.220]
He's a phenomenal man.

[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.600]
Mr. Rogers.

[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.860]
Well, you had to allow our respect for you.

[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.280]
So do I.

[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:30.880]
God.

[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:31.900]
Neil, man.

[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:32.760]
You're new.

[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:33.940]
I am.

[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:34.940]
But what are the kind of want?

[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.680]
I'll be real brief with my call.

[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.320]
I want to say, you know, go fins, go marlins,

[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.480]
go bugs and go lightning.

[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.360]
You know, we're all full radians.

[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.520]
I'm going to be it.

[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:45.440]
Now listen, are you going to feel,

[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:46.320]
are you going to the game tonight?

[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:47.260]
I'm going to try.

[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.280]
Now, you're not going to hate me like poison

[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.160]
because I'm going to, I will be under my breath going.

[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.160]
The Leafs go.

[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:52.580]
Yeah.

[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.900]
That's the, I mean, 35 years of being a maple leaf fan

[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:56.960]
doesn't end quickly, OK?

[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:57.700]
But that's the story.

[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:00.180]
I mean, I hope the, I hope the lightning wins all the other games,

[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.720]
like maybe another one sometime soon,

[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.000]
because it hasn't been too much lately.

[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.680]
But when you're playing the Leafs, you know, definitely.

[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:06.720]
Oh, yeah, it would be great.

[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:07.860]
Well, see you there, maybe, OK?

[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.400]
Neil, you're up.

[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:08.780]
Hi.

[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:09.260]
Hello.

[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:09.440]

[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:09.640]
Hello, sir.

[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.700]
Can you hear the Messiah?

[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:11.220]
Thanks.

[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.560]
Can I call one person a douchebag?

[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:12.920]
Sure.

[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:13.760]
You're on Jones.

[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.220]
You are the biggest douchebag I know.

[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:16.980]
Oh, see.

[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.580]
Oh, I didn't know you were the Messiah.

[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:20.620]
I didn't know that.

[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:21.880]
I just see my sandals.

[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.960]
But I'm scared of something else.

[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.400]
When you, when you please, I'm begging you,

[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:26.740]
get even like close to the mic.

[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.060]
I know you have the gigantic,

[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:29.120]
that brilliant voice.

[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.120]
I just want to hear from you.

[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.380]
I know you're carrying around those heavy-duty,

[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.160]
walking on the streets.

[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.900]
I understand that you find top like, you know,

[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.980]
gee, me, all the kind of dogs you have to be boring.

[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:37.500]
It is.

[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.800]
However, when your car is called up and say things like,

[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:44.160]
uh, gold fins, that you consider to be good radio.

[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.500]
Did you hear that car?

[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.960]
Bob, that car was like a living and breathing human being.

[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.080]
He was like under the age of 30, even, I would say.

[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.440]
Well, under the age of 30, you probably had acne.

[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.880]
Oh, he doesn't have any acne, man.

[00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:59.280]
His skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom at times, right now.

[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:00.540]
Isn't it?

[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:01.500]
Oh, you've changed, Neil.

[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:01.960]
That's right.

[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.760]
Man, that piece is too big for me, Joel.

[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.300]
Anyway, it's 11.30.

[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.760]
Let's do a mobile in Miami, hello.

[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.860]
More than I can handle, yes.

[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:14.920]
Neil, man, porkers.

[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:15.500]
Yeah.

[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.400]
Oh, wait a minute, is this a pig me pork?

[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.040]
Absolutely.

[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:20.120]
I don't think I brought it.

[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.240]
I think I brought my, uh, pork.

[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:21.740]
OK.

[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.540]
Not bad.

[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.120]
Not bad.

[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:24.500]
OK.

[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.540]
It's on the Schillex pressway.

[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.540]
Just after the toll booth, there's five of them

[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.680]
over doing it, man.

[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.440]
Where is it?

[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.260]
Ah, Neil, Schillex pressway, 8.74, just north of the toll booth.

[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:36.760]
There you go.

[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.360]
Say, I found it.

[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.340]
That's caramel, no shock.

[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.760]
Have a rate they found.

[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.720]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.800]
People tell you up in the top and they tell you where the cop's

[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:46.800]

[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.740]
We have pig me pork.

[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.700]
That's a pubic service, and it, what I'm idiot, what I'm

[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:51.940]
more on, you better get with it, please.

[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.820]
This is how this isn't old the time.

[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:55.580]
I mean, the times they are changing, Bob.

[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.160]
Yeah.

[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.640]
I remember the times are changing.

[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.060]
Please, soon.

[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:01.740]
Level 31.

[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.280]
And I'm glad you were here today because you're starting

[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.500]
to get the grief of what Neil radio is all about instead

[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:06.880]
of that old.

[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.420]
Hello, Bob.

[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.760]
What kind of a dog you think I have, Bob?

[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.940]
And I have the problem with sleeve.

[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.700]
God, I'm itching from head to toe.

[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:20.360]
Can I borrow Sally's instrument for just a week or two?

[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.320]
I'll bet you'd like to.

[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.200]
I'm not this kid.

[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.840]
By the way, the paramedics have been living

[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:24.500]
boards out there.

[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.800]
They've been bored to tears since she got married the other day,

[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.600]
like a week and a half.

[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:28.180]
Oh.

[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.080]
Oh, look at these yentos over here.

[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.680]
Look at this guy from.

[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:32.920]
Where are you guys from?

[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:33.780]
What TV station?

[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.080]
I sure hope it's 13.

[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:36.440]
He can't talk.

[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:38.380]
He says he's not allowed to talk.

[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.580]
He's not allowed to talk.

[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.600]
He can't even say what number?

[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:41.440]
Channel 10.

[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.020]
Channel 10.

[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.900]
Police from Channel, like I said, my favorite station

[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.980]
in this market, ABC.

[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:46.060]

[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:46.620]
I'm a professional anyway.

[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.180]
Oh, bro.

[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:49.360]
Who the hell is that?

[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:50.040]
You still want your job?

[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.660]
I watched something in here last night.

[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.100]
And of course, I haven't seen that many balls

[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:56.840]
in many presidential elections.

[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.220]
Have you?

[00:56:57.500 --> 00:56:58.720]
I mean, there were more balls going on.

[00:56:59.000 --> 00:56:59.280]
11.

[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.500]
There were 11 balls?

[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:00.760]
Yeah.

[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:01.900]
Even Bob came, man.

[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:02.200]
It's that.

[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.960]
Let's go to a two.

[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:04.960]
Clear water.

[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:05.220]
Hello.

[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:06.740]
Clear water.

[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:07.600]
Yeah.

[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.580]
Neil, welcome.

[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:09.380]
Neil, welcome.

[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:10.020]
Hard ball.

[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.900]
The mad dog, last setter.

[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.540]
Yes, we got a last setter.

[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.080]
Caller and he's out of the eight of a hundred.

[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:16.120]
Oh, Bob.

[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.100]
That's over, much.

[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:17.640]
God.

[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:18.940]
As Muffy.

[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:20.120]
Muffy's great.

[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.620]
I think you're pardoned.

[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:22.860]
Muffy's my wife.

[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:23.280]
Oh.

[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:24.640]
The Muffy.

[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.260]
And how is your dog?

[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:27.420]
How's Muffy?

[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.500]
Uh, but I don't know.

[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.580]
I don't have a few.

[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.300]
It's no one's Bob.

[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:36.360]
I, uh, uh, a Trophy, uh, lives with my sister in law now.

[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:38.260]
It's so be dead, OK, though.

[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.300]
Oh, yeah, as far as I know, it's

[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.760]
don't be going to make any guess the parents

[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.480]
remember how so for you to come with you?

[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:44.520]
Oh, sure.

[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:44.940]
Sure.

[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.160]
No, no, no, no, no, no, dogs and no smoking

[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.060]

Ha ha ha ha.

[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.740]
And Bob's boggling coming back.

[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:11.380]
Yeah.

[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.200]
Yeah, really coming back.

[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.360]
We're going to have live people over here.

[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:13.860]
Morning.

[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:14.660]
Six to ten.

[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.820]
Well, it's live as I am.

[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:16.220]
Yeah.

[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.540]
Well, that's kind of like I even thought

[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.520]
I heard the actual bird.

[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.600]
The actual bird.

[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:23.260]
It is.

[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.000]
It is the bird.

[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.060]
Yeah, amazing, isn't it?

[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.920]
And we even brought his original cage back over

[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.000]
from Lakeland to his men, right?

[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.440]
And a change of paper.

[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.100]
Uh-huh.

[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:31.860]
Uh-huh.

[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.920]
So this is an exciting day, sir.

[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.120]
Excuse me.

[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.060]
I said, I said, no, you're done.

[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.220]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.680]
You're going to get the oil with your sand.

[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:42.360]
Get him out of here.

[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:42.760]
Yeah.

[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.620]
I got a crappy phone.

[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.220]
It's feeding back and it sounds like crap.

[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.160]
Let's do St. Petersburg.

[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:48.720]
Hello?

[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:50.800]
St. Tweet.

[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.120]
You just did him.

[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.380]
Well, I did not just do him.

[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.300]
I said, clear water.

[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.720]
So there were a little behind in here.

[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.880]
OK, there were plenty of little grab ass

[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.820]
in the other room with each other.

[01:03:59.440 --> 01:03:59.920]
Let's do.

[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:00.600]
Huh?

[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:02.640]
No, you have to.

[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:02.820]
You have to.

[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.420]
Try to read his lip.

[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.800]
Well, don't say that on there.

[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.400]
Don't start screwing around with us, George.

[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.460]
These guys in here and I got their crap together.

[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.120]
OK, so don't try to pull them over on us.

[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.000]
Do you guys have your crap together?

[01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:14.280]
Yeah, they said crap's the word.

[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.740]
Let's call it a St. P. Hello?

[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.020]
Clear water.

[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:17.760]
Clear water?

[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:18.460]
Clear water?

[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.200]
Good morning.

[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.080]
So with the other guy, I was in St. P. I don't know.

[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:22.880]
I'm confused.

[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.080]
We'll get you in trouble, too, little boy.

[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:24.680]
Let me say it again.

[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:25.460]
Clear water.

[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:25.940]
Clear water.

[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:26.360]
Yes.

[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:27.220]
Hello.

[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:28.680]
Well, you sound like crap, pal.

[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.100]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.560]
It must be the system.

[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.920]
It's getting muddier and muddier and muddier.

[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:35.400]
Oh, me?

[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:35.980]
Yeah.

[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:36.880]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:37.760]
OK, good.

[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.480]
I was coming over to the Campbell last night.

[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:40.820]
Yeah?

[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.540]
And heard you talk and you talked to Randy.

[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.300]
Yeah, when I called in, yeah.

[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.200]
Well, that was interesting.

[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.080]
He said you really liked it here now, huh?

[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:47.620]
Love it.

[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.040]
Yeah, it treated you like a kid.

[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:49.980]
And quick.

[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:50.560]
What's the big thing?

[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.140]
Wow.

[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.640]
Now, there was a call.

[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:54.440]
What did he say?

[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.020]
I don't know.

[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:55.720]
He went away.

[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:56.520]
He disappeared.

[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.360]
He said someone begged.

[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.600]
He did one, huh?

[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.840]
Oh, where are hours of it?

[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:01.400]
He did one.

[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.000]
He said crap.

[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.640]
Oh, he got dumped.

[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:05.600]
You got dumped, huh?

[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.280]
George, yes, he got dumped.

[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:09.180]
He got dumped.

[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:11.820]
That's the first one, the first dumpy of the day.

[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.100]
Really?

[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:12.660]
Very excited.

[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.080]
What do you have to say on this show to get dumped?

[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.900]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.320]
I would imagine.

[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:19.520]
I would imagine.

[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:20.040]
We want to try.

[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.200]
I mean, could you write it down on a piece of paper

[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.300]
or something and pass it over?

[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.100]
He turned his mic off.

[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.160]
If I could tell you how much excitement I

[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:28.780]
could do in that.

[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:29.860]
Sure.

[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.240]
Yeah.

[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:34.100]
I get nervous in my spine.

[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:37.080]
Here's a porine on a star line.

[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:38.720]
Hello.

[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:39.180]
What are you calling?

[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:40.360]
Hello.

[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.360]
When you said, do you hear that?

[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.300]
Where are you calling from?

[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.020]
Oh, man.

[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.580]
This George's talking about losing it.

[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:45.860]
Yes.

[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:46.860]
The guy's over there slow.

[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:47.600]
Yes.

[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.440]
Now, let's kind of hop on her.

[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.680]
You got to take first point.

[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.840]
We have birds of light and get rid of them,

[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.840]
because these are ruined on your show.

[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:54.580]
Big time.

[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:55.680]
Get out of my face.

[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.260]
That lamp is accurate.

[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:57.580]
Get them off the ear, pal.

[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.020]
OK, but you do have a point.

[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.200]
Let's go.

[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:03.160]
Well, the guy you wanted to make a point.

[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.420]
It's only for one day.

[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.840]
Jeez, there's so many patients.

[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.640]
He'll be gone tomorrow.

[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:07.580]
I'll be back in a minute.

[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.080]
That's it.

[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:09.440]
That's absolutely correct.

[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.120]
With his Tampa Tribune on the bottom.

[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.900]
Yeah, and look, I can't help it.

[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.120]
You know, I just laugh.

[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:14.740]
He can't help himself.

[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:15.740]
He wants to be here.

[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:19.020]
He wants to be a part of our passing parade.

[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:19.460]
OK.

[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.060]
Here's Brandon.

[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:21.720]
Hello.

[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.440]
You got Bob Blaschard in there?

[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:27.920]
Yes.

[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.480]
You know, Bob and I go back a few years.

[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.480]
The reason I said Brandon, I'm really cool and proud.

[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.460]
Because I...

[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.080]
You're calling from what?

[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:38.820]
Broward.

[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:39.440]
I take it part.

[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.300]
You're calling from where?

[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:40.900]
Broward.

[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.260]
I'm calling from Broward.

[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.540]
Well, like where in Broward?

[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.280]
Is there a city?

[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.460]
Is there like a place?

[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:46.420]
Sir.

[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:49.580]
I think there's over there.

[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.100]
I think there's over there.

[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.500]
No, but I said, call Bob Blascharder from Brandon.

[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.420]
When he was on WFLA, I say that.

[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.060]
Yeah.

[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:57.680]
OK.

[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:00.380]
Not again, Bob was on WFLA.

[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.960]
And he was one of my...

[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.620]
He was my privacy said to me.

[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.860]
He said, what has you been to broadcast the US?

[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.880]
You have said you've been for broadcast?

[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:09.160]
Yeah.

[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:09.820]
You really do.

[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.420]
How about Sunday's 10 to 2?

[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:15.440]
We if we ain't, don't, ain't, ain't, don't suck up.

[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:15.860]
We ain't.

[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.140]
OK.

[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.120]
Thank you.

[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.440]
But you wouldn't know.

[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.900]
So, don't suck up, Neil.

[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:20.200]
No.

[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.860]
I've been down here two months.

[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:22.320]
OK.

[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.240]
That's for Dan's or Sean?

[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.200]
No, Bob, I had you guys.

[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.300]
But if you get Bob Blascharder to get out of here,

[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.520]
you got something.

[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.880]
That guy is great.

[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.060]
He's not going to be on down there.

[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:32.980]
I beg your pardon?

[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.000]
He's going to be on up here.

[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:35.400]
What do you mean up here?

[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:36.100]
Where's up here?

[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.000]
Brandon.

[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:38.740]
Right up here.

[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.680]
Just take a little bit.

[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:40.240]
Right up here.

[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:40.560]
What?

[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.440]
Is that coming down here to Miami?

[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:44.140]
No.

[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.980]
So, in my back, what?

[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:46.980]
I'm not on your head.

[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.580]
You think you're talking to George Michael?

[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:50.920]
Hey, hey, Bob.

[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:51.360]
Yeah.

[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.340]
What are you going to be at?

[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:52.960]
What station?

[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.620]
It's WS UN.

[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.140]
So, WS UN.

[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:58.860]
It's the sun, right?

[01:07:59.180 --> 01:07:59.680]
Yeah, the sun.

[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:00.400]
OK.

[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:01.160]
You're not comfortable.

[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:04.100]
Hey, you put the sea out of here because this guy, Neil,

[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:06.060]
will change your ass out of town, baby.

[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:06.260]

[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:06.980]
Yeah, the rest of it, just.

[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.020]
Hey, he'll change your ass out of town.

[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.720]
But he's a, a Neil's great.

[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:13.660]
And you're a great, I'll catch you later, baby.

[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:13.960]
OK.

[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.040]
Which way can say the same?

[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:15.260]
OK.

[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.540]
Oh, I want to ask.

[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.220]
I'm 47.

[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.220]
On the IOD network.

[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:25.040]
Fire the goddamn teeth I'd take outside, kick my own damn ass.

[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:28.520]
I have no cavity, I don't know the fixer for you.

[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:29.200]
Oh, yeah.

[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:30.620]
You two.

[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.240]
You're a good fella, Charlie Brown.

[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:36.760]
Now showing on a double bill with Nightmare on Sesame Street.

[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.740]
Provo 6, the WIOD and lunches arrived.

[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.700]
I'm not talking about the crap that Joel brought.

[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.540]
I mean, Luigi BG.

[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:47.380]
He was right that BG's made lunch for us.

[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.260]
He BGB's.

[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.660]
The chef is going to cook special.

[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.680]
Remember, there was Moke Green said that.

[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:52.480]
No, we haven't him.

[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:54.360]
Yeah, well, we all remember Moke.

[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.740]
Yeah, nice.

[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:56.420]
Nice eye to the sky.

[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:00.540]
Yeah, nice glasses with eye in the sky with the on-parts and projects.

[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.920]
I have a high used to love that record.

[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.040]
I still have it.

[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.980]
I still do love it, but somebody stole my CD.

[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.240]
One of many that have been stolen from the IOD library.

[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:07.720]
Shocking.

[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:08.360]
Shocking.

[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:11.380]
So Bob Lanceter has gotten up momentarily and stepped out,

[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.320]
probably smoked a chain smoking in the kitchen.

[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:13.980]
I'm sure.

[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:16.660]
I'm sure that's what you say if he could be here right now.

[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:20.680]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, let's do a mobile.

[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.980]
Mobile in St. Petersburg.

[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:23.520]
Hello.

[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:24.460]
Hey, Neil.

[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:24.820]
Yeah.

[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:28.340]
Hey, you know, I was just trying to find up the FLA studio

[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.640]
by the G&B Bull of Art.

[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.020]
Yeah.

[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:35.420]
And they had these barriers up to the 60 of Pugh all over the ground.

[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:36.080]
Really?

[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.160]
I had a hell of a time getting screwed there.

[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.820]
And I got a dog story for you.

[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:41.240]
Yeah.

[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.720]
What do you call a little dog?

[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.100]
with very short legs and steel balls.

[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:48.780]
Next call for it.

[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:52.940]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.680]
Was that the time of someone throwing up?

[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.040]
Oh my God.

[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.020]
Are you okay Bob?

[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:57.760]
You alright?

[01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:58.500]
Yeah.

[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.040]
Ha ha ha.

[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.040]
Listen, we can't all be as classy as the Bob Lancet or short.

[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:05.360]
Okay.

[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:06.700]
That is Bob.

[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.900]
I would like to make notes.

[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.600]
I would like to get one of those calls.

[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.240]
Seriously, I think it's my fault.

[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.120]
I know we'd be loaded.

[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.180]
You'd be like below the board out over there if we would love those people to call.

[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.140]
I don't want to repress you.

[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.000]
I don't want to hold you back.

[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.140]
I don't want to like give you.

[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.380]
I want to jumpstart your show.

[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:24.300]
We want you up to at least a 10 share after the first trend in the morning.

[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:24.620]
Okay.

[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.560]
Well, I think what I'm planning on doing right now.

[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.020]
By the way, I look at the hour by hour here and boy from 10 to 2.

[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.380]
We shouldn't do too bad in that book.

[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.440]
And also the 6 to 7 and Randy did pretty well.

[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.080]
And Rick and Sud.

[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.160]
No, I'm serious.

[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.260]
We actually had a couple hours and two is there.

[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:43.520]
I'm talking about my ratings here and like at dinner last night, all he's talking about.

[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:49.520]
Well, I was up to like a 72 share in the afternoon and you could look at the book and see the rest of the day was in the toilet at FLA.

[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:52.780]
And as soon as I came on, the numbers went skyrocketing to it.

[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:55.300]
And as soon as I went off, the radio was all went in the office.

[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.100]
All three.

[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.640]
Every word of it was the word of it.

[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.800]
Why did you admit it, you fony, you fat fony?

[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.400]
Why don't you admit it that you're a pompous ass like all the rest of it?

[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.380]
Please, fat fony.

[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.020]
You admit it yourself when I walked in here that I've lost a lot of weight.

[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.660]
And almost fat fony like me.

[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.320]
You have to be fat fony.

[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.100]
It's part of the club.

[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:10.800]
It's Neil and Bob.

[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.080]
They used to be fat fony guys.

[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.040]
We're now just going to put on more weight.

[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.300]
I can't wait to put on more weight.

[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.000]
By the way, sorry.

[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.740]
I don't ever say this is from Luigi B.G.

[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.080]
Pasta and pizza factory.

[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.220]
And it's good stuff.

[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:26.520]
When you shot up already, my Korean parmesan spaghetti with black olives, mushrooms, onions, broccoli, and green peppers.

[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.600]
And no meat, Bob.

[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:28.840]
No meat.

[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:30.200]
I'm not going that far.

[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.100]
Here's a lady in Weston.

[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:32.860]
Can you meet again?

[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:33.680]
Hi.

[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:37.100]
Did you, Bob, just come and get it?

[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.240]
Then don't keep the please off.

[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.000]
Oh, that's right.

[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.620]
Come and get it dog food for your dog.

[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.540]
You'll never have fleas.

[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:43.120]
Your dog's skin will be like silk.

[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.620]
You need your dog food too.

[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.240]
Didn't say I endorse it.

[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.000]
That's what I use.

[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.060]
It is not a sponsor.

[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.060]
It's just something that a product that I love.

[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:50.700]
Come and get it.

[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:51.580]
It's in the purple bag.

[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.240]
You can get them on.

[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.000]
No, I'm not trying to get them on or get them off for that man.

[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.760]
So are Bob's ratings real?

[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.080]
Or they kind of like Joey?

[01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:01.440]
Kind of make believe.

[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.460]
My ratings were very real.

[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:05.700]
No.

[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.460]
I know.

[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.560]
I know you don't like requests and you probably don't bring your cards.

[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:13.300]
I brought some.

[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:13.920]
I brought a few.

[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:14.720]
Not the one you want.

[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.480]
Whatever it is.

[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.520]
Do you have the one with the guy?

[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:19.800]
Is he going to get him to get off?

[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.700]
No, I hate the bird.

[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:21.040]

[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.240]
Second request for that.

[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:25.120]
That's still number two of the bulls.

[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.560]
By the way, you call him in a recreated life.

[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:31.080]
Are you excited about Bob coming back to Tampa even though you're not here?

[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:31.760]
Just say yes.

[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.460]
Make him feel good.

[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.240]
Oh, sure.

[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:33.740]
Yeah.

[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:34.640]
Oh, God.

[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.640]
It's a jolly over there with him.

[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.520]
Have a great day.

[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.300]
Okay, bye.

[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:39.880]
Bye-bye.

[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:43.600]
It's amazing that my presence here would suddenly make people think of that card.

[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.260]
They want to hear it.

[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:46.560]
They have to hear it.

[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.460]
You can tell where I'm embarrassed.

[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.420]
It comes as a surprise to you.

[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.260]
I didn't know.

[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:52.400]
I think there's a message there.

[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:52.740]
Yeah.

[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.100]
That's what I was getting at.

[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.180]
I'm not sure what it is, but I think I have an idea.

[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.720]
Say hello to Gail Saran.

[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.500]
Hello, Charlie.

[01:12:58.940 --> 01:12:59.240]
Hello.

[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.180]
Who's that?

[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:02.340]
He's one of the anchors on Charlie.

[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.280]
Is that a good channel now?

[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:03.900]
Who's 10 now?

[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:04.960]
Before they really suck.

[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:05.740]
I like 13.

[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:06.560]
Personally.

[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:07.780]
Yeah, take that, Charlie.

[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.920]
I like 13 all the guy from 80's.

[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:10.020]

[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:11.400]
It just came out.

[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.320]
That won't make the news.

[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:12.880]
I don't think.

[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.660]
They can't edit it.

[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.600]
He's talking about the age of the girls he likes.

[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.400]
It's okay.

[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:18.180]
No.

[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.500]
It's okay, but 13's a little better.

[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.220]
They're my favorite.

[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:21.620]
Yeah.

[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.600]
It's great to say that right while the guy is standing right here.

[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:25.720]
I say this.

[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.300]
It's a real big help.

[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.040]
You know, he has his number on the camera too.

[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.740]
Oh, Charlie, we love it.

[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:30.940]
Yes.

[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.340]
Hey, Gail Saran.

[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.000]
13-year-old girls in Lakeland, by the way,

[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:35.480]
the birthset.

[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:36.880]
You're going to be right on the way home.

[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.640]
Can you look, girl?

[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.500]
So let's do, uh, now we got to have more calls than add on a board.

[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.080]
Huh?

[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:44.660]
I bring up there on here.

[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.500]
I think in George keeps blaming these guys over here.

[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.480]
I was doing a tremendous job, by the way.

[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.460]
These people at S.U.N.

[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.240]
are what are you talking about?

[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:52.400]
They're the best.

[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.080]
Oh, I wasn't.

[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.760]
I said they are the best and they're doing a good job, too.

[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:01.160]
524-15751 in date and the auto town line.

[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.400]
That's where we want to get these tremendous.

[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:02.980]
Come on.

[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.260]
Let's have some of Bob's old friends, man.

[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.720]
Underline the old.

[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:13.780]
1-800-944-946-3-1-800-944-WIO-D.

[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.560]
Try this, Fabitary.

[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:15.860]
Yes, I promise.

[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.440]
I haven't even officially started yet.

[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.420]
He's a year time.

[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.320]
You're f-h-h-h.

[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:19.940]
I'm sorry, you.

[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:21.860]
12 minutes after noon on the IoT network.

[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.860]
I'm Mr. King.

[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:31.880]
Hi, I'm Jim Morrison, and that was me 25 years ago.

[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.980]
I faked my death because I thought Warkin' Roll was dying.

[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.660]
And the future was in retail.

[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:37.800]
And I was right.

[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.720]
Just listen to these great specials.

[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.800]
We're having down at my gift shop, The Lizard King.

[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.420]
That's right, The Lizard King.

[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.020]
We're the Mojo might be rising, but the prices are falling.

[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:47.020]
Come on, baby.

[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.000]
We're lighting a fire under these specials.

[01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:51.520]
Like fine, lizard boots, handbags, belts, and wallets.

[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.560]
And this is not the end, my beautiful friend.

[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.500]
Break on through to the other side of savings,

[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.040]
with great deals and lizard longs array.

[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.000]
Lizard hand tools, even lizard dishware.

[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.580]
So come on, there's no time to wallow in the mire.

[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.200]
Hurry on down to The Lizard King.

[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.840]
Where I am, The Lizard King, and I will sell anything.

[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.400]
What just happened there? Did you see that?

[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:13.220]
That was bizarre.

[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:15.800]
I didn't know if that was the real Bob or if that was the card.

[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:16.500]
I couldn't tell.

[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.120]
Is it real?

[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.780]
Or you got it, baby.

[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.100]
You got it.

[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.560]
Why did you just have the Argyll Saco?

[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.340]
Anyway, 12, 17 at WIOD.

[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.160]
I think we got it under control now, don't we?

[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:29.380]
It sounds crisp and clear.

[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.460]
If you think it sounds muddy, then you're out of your mind.

[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.680]
Because everybody in here tells me it sounds sensational.

[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:35.760]
And don't pay any attention to that.

[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.000]
Well, look at that.

[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.500]
Here's our pompano harness copy.

[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:39.180]
Thank you, Becky.

[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.240]
We still love you, Becky.

[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:41.740]
All right, it's a hell of a lot better over here.

[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.340]
Oh, my first reps in Tampa.

[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:46.680]
Okay.

[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:47.840]
I feel so much better now.

[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:48.880]
And that was not contrived.

[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.560]
That was the real one.

[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.520]
Oh, I think Jolz is backing up now.

[01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:56.400]
That sounds...

[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.260]
You just got the ring.

[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:58.700]
Let's do it.

[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:01.660]
Let's do it.

[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.040]
Let's do it.

[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:02.600]
Oh, you changed.

[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:03.300]
Hi, Leah.

[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:04.100]

[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:05.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:05.960]
Not the older man.

[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.540]
All right.

[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.900]
Okay, pass on, man.

[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.180]
I just want to tell you something about the emergency broadcast system test.

[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:12.940]
About what?

[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.240]
The emergency broadcast system test.

[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.300]
The emergency broadcast test.

[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:17.600]
Yes.

[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:18.580]
CBS.

[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.460]
That annoying content on sound should be changed.

[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.680]
But for some more sort of a point, maybe it's like...

[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.160]
Oh, no, no, no.

[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.080]
Yeah, this has been a test of the emergency telemundo system.

[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:37.920]
So anyway, over here, they're showing it over and over and over again.

[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.800]
And just over and like from right side and left side.

[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:42.720]
You know, it's the best day from the back side.

[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.460]
It's the best day I've seen in a while.

[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:44.840]
Yeah.

[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.440]
What a handshoes, sir.

[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:47.820]
About your partner.

[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:50.000]
What a handshoes.

[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:50.580]
What words?

[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.600]
And what one show I've seen that we can't say it on the...

[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.060]
Lionel.

[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:56.240]
We can't say that.

[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.260]
And can't say Lardass.

[01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.600]
Yeah, but we cannot say Lardass.

[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:00.900]
Did I get to listen to that?

[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.980]
Who is that asshole that's on over there from 9 to noon?

[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:03.580]
Mark Larson?

[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.040]
Oh, yeah.

[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:06.180]
That Lardass want to be...

[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:06.760]
I mean, that guy.

[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:07.600]
It's pathetic.

[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.360]
See, I've heard all those people over there.

[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.000]
And don't give me the sawdust about the Lionel.

[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:12.720]
He's a really a good guy and he's got a great said.

[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:13.700]
Lionel blows, man.

[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:15.680]
And he's got the most irritating gravel voice.

[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.720]
I found like something.

[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.600]
He did a roto-ruder in his throat or something.

[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.640]
And maybe they did.

[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:20.960]
Here's Tampa.

[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:21.420]
Hello.

[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:23.180]
Neil.

[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:23.940]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:24.960]
Welcome to Tampa.

[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.120]
Thank you so much.

[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.780]
We are so damn excited to be here.

[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.380]
It's great.

[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:30.340]
Far beyond our wildest expectations.

[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.140]
Cool.

[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:32.860]
Yeah.

[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.680]
Ah, yeah.

[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:37.740]
I'm like...

[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.840]
Your choke's up is what you're...

[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:39.320]
Yeah, really.

[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.640]
You're choking on it.

[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:40.940]
Yeah.

[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.940]
You know, this is John from Public.

[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.940]
Are you kidding me?

[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:47.900]
I'm not kidding you.

[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:48.780]
It's Public's John.

[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:49.800]
You remember, John?

[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.360]
He used to come down in South Lake.

[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.440]
He used to do things down there like...

[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.080]
Yeah.

[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:54.860]
And Kennell, right?

[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.020]
Yeah.

[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:55.440]
Yeah.

[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.200]
I remember him vividly.

[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.100]
How you doing, John?

[01:17:58.380 --> 01:17:58.720]
Pretty good.

[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:02.420]
I just probably take a little bit of a blend and I'm looking forward to seeing you all on Saturday.

[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:03.260]
Are you coming by?

[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:04.460]
Yeah, I'm going to come by.

[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.020]
That's right.

[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.920]
And I'll worry you, what are you doing these days?

[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.820]
I'm still working at Public's up here.

[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:09.940]
I'll be done.

[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:11.780]
I'm still going to anybody at Groatsbury Bank.

[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.100]
This is career, Public's John.

[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:17.200]
Well, yeah, I'm still going to school today.

[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:17.760]
Great.

[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.300]
Why do you sound so depressed?

[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:19.980]
Yeah, done me.

[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.040]
You sound very depressed.

[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.080]
I was always depressed when I was...

[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:23.380]
Yeah.

[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.440]
Oh, it's true.

[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:26.900]
He always liked the last time you called me.

[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:27.760]
It was great hearing from me.

[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:28.680]
He sounded like manic.

[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:30.540]
Four people blew their brains out after your call.

[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:31.700]
Two of them.

[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.040]
Yeah.

[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.940]
Is that going to be their assignment?

[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:38.860]
I don't think so.

[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:40.180]
He's certainly welcome to come by.

[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.040]
I know. What else are you going to do?

[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:42.640]
Well...

[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.760]
What is he up to these days?

[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.280]
He's going to sign the bird on a stick.

[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:45.840]
Yeah.

[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.180]
I don't think they want to see me.

[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:49.380]
You know, up here.

[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.040]
See, Miami, I mean something to people.

[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.080]
But I'm here, they don't know me.

[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.260]
They don't know me.

[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.880]
He's got to go to the mall in Lakeland and hang out.

[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:56.260]
Yeah.

[01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:57.860]
What do you do when these days want?

[01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:58.780]
I'm retired.

[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.380]
Yeah, he's officially retired, yeah.

[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.220]
Yeah, been retired?

[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.740]
No, I've been retired for just over a year.

[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:04.480]
Can you believe it?

[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:05.820]
It's wonderful.

[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:07.360]
I like it.

[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.480]
I thought you were retired for the last three years.

[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:09.940]
Oh.

[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.820]
Oh, John.

[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:15.720]
John, it's a great pleasure and honor and a treat.

[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:16.960]
Butch up and we'll see you Saturday.

[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.140]
See you later, Glenn.

[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:19.800]
Bye.

[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.260]
Boy, it sounds pretty good.

[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:23.740]
It does, I mean.

[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.040]
Good.

[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:24.320]
It's a good kid.

[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:24.520]
It's a good kid.

[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:25.040]
It's a good kid.

[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:25.320]
It's a good kid.

[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.760]
It makes me want to split my wrists.

[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.380]
Get an 80's here.

[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.260]
Get an telemundo by four times.

[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:33.180]
That's the new man.

[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.020]
Yeah.

[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.640]
Birds, let's rinse.

[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.840]
I just frame by frame.

[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:37.180]
Yeah.

[01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:38.320]
That'll do anything for a break.

[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:38.760]
Oh, yeah.

[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:39.280]
Oh, yeah.

[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:39.380]
Yeah.

[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:41.720]
It's 1221.

[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.680]
So here's Loots speaking a shot.

[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:44.840]
Hello.

[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:45.420]
How you doing?

[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:46.180]
Pretty good.

[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.960]
I like to personally sit my hand to friendship to you.

[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.540]
Six o'clock on a candy bridge.

[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:51.080]
Yeah.

[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.280]
I can knock your teeth on your throat.

[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.520]
Let me say this, asshole.

[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.220]
Extend this.

[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.040]
Next call, George.

[01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.280]
That was your old friend.

[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.100]
Get into your old brother.

[01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:58.640]
You're buddy.

[01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.360]
You'll spend his hand.

[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.000]
Just stand out there and middle of the candy bridge and six o'clock

[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:02.800]
we'll be seeing you, pal.

[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:04.940]
Let's see who's daydland.

[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:05.220]
Hello?

[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:06.980]
Hello, Neil.

[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:07.540]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.280]
Sorry I was on the speakerphone there.

[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.020]
Hey, listen, you know how you see this, um...

[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:12.500]
This, uh...

[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.220]
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:13.960]
Over and over again.

[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:14.420]
Yeah.

[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.500]
Maybe it's kind of like the emy fish fitting.

[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.320]
Maybe that was Joe Buttafuco that did the shooting.

[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.900]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:23.720]
Sounds like Joey.

[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.840]
Well, listen, I've been trying to get in touch with you

[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.060]
last week on, uh, uh...

[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.540]
On, uh, on the rigs and chairs, 10 o'clock news.

[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:31.000]
Yeah.

[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.720]
uh... he comes back on a segue from the sports

[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.820]
when they're talking about the uh... the dolphins possibly beating the bills

This is the lady, how you doing, honey?

[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:41.060]

[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:43.160]
Oh, Bill, you ought to do the jugs on this, babe.

[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.080]

[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:45.700]
I have to do it.

[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:46.640]
I...

[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:49.980]
You're going to burn in the hell and I'll stop you with the video.

[01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.400]
Oh, Bob, tell us about that.

[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.380]
Yeah, but can I touch those jugs before I have to burn?

[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:53.840]
Oh!

[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:54.820]
Oh!

[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:56.040]
Oh!

[01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:56.140]

[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:58.800]
I like her.

[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:05.020]
Oh, you need her call all the time, yeah.

[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:07.540]
She sounded like she was right on the edge of a...

[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:09.600]
I think maybe she's the one at Font Sally's apparatus.

[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:11.560]
Anyway, it's 11.

[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:12.660]
Now, that's 20 hours.

[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:22.760]
Ellen Box was a normal man, with a nice home, a lovely family,

[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:25.540]
and a cushy job with his father-in-law's company.

[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.780]
Normal that is until just three weeks ago.

[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.580]
Hi, honey. How was your day?

[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.100]
Some of the Nessutoric Monday I feared would end up being button on the west.

[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:39.100]
Let me see if I can't focus it in to the best of my ability.

[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:43.380]
Ellen Box is suffering from Bob Lasseter disease.

[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:45.420]
Oh, are you feeling all right, Ellen?

[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:46.940]
Absolutely insane.

[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:49.560]
I see things that nobody offends to see,

[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:52.320]
or at least cares to admit that they say.

[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:55.700]
Bob Lasseter disease attacks the central nervous system,

[01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:58.760]
causing otherwise normal people to communicate like some people

[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.200]
suicidal maniacs.

[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.100]
How with you today?

[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:02.780]
I don't want to talk to you.

[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:06.580]
What's more, Bob Lasseter disease is the one form of depression,

[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:08.340]
which is actually contagious.

[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:12.280]
God, just listing that voice, I want to jump off a building.

[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.360]
You're the lowest of a low you're at.

[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:16.520]
Nate, you're at Gumbag.

[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:20.460]
Please send whatever you can today to post office box

[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:23.060]
1-800-DEVIN-PORT-IOWA.

[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:25.440]
Honey, it's Friday night.

[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.320]
You know what that means.

[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.060]
Betching and moaning and screening and hollering.

[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:31.020]
Please, help.

[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:32.720]
Yeah.
