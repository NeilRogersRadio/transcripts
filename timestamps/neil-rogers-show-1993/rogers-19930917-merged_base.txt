[00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.320]
Hurry though, Sears Brand Central's birthday sale end September 18th.

[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.720]
So when you get your invitation, oh wait a minute I just invited you on the radio so I

[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.500]
licked all those stamps for nothing.

[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.720]
Oh man.

[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.320]
Until my allergies told me, I never knew what a histamine blocker was.

[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.220]
In Park Davis introduced the histamine blocker Benadrill.

[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.080]
Allergy sufferers have had a powerful ally because when allergens attack Benadrill blocks

[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.800]
the histamine in your body from triggering food in itchy watery eyes, running nose.

[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.380]
No wonder doctors have trusted Benadrill longer than any other allergy medication.

[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.280]
When allergens attack depend on the histamine blocker Benadrill.

[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.740]
It's powerful protection.

[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.760]
Use is directed.

[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.140]
Tonight after Randy Rhodes, it's Don and Mike.

[00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.060]
It's National Bake Bean Month and we're asking what do you like about baked beans?

[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.900]
In case great.

[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.520]
They're nutritious.

[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.360]
They make me smart.

[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.020]
A lot.

[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.800]
Bake beans.

[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.740]
They're delicious, nutritious and they make you smart.

[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.400]
A lot.

[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.100]
Yes they're baked beans but all my parties because nothing breaks the ice like break and

[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.420]
win.

[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.780]
I'm going to do a really big one here.

[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.080]
Listen.

[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.180]
I locked the eater holding mess of beans and then say the dog did it.

[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.280]
Here it comes.

[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.900]
Big beans make bubbles in the back.

[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.020]
Ready?

[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.180]
Here give me the microphone.

[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.020]
These make us smart.

[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.420]
These lots of baked beans.

[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.040]
During National Bake Bean Month.

[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.180]
It's going to be big.

[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.880]
This mess.

[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.300]
It's brought to you by the National Bake Bean Council.

[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.660]
Wow.

[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.480]
False alarm.

[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.960]
I, Luis Miguel.

[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.320]
See.

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.840]
It's 1129.

[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.480]
See this?

[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.780]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.980]
524WID.

[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.340]
The reaction is last night.

[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.240]
First ever.

[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.960]
Panther's game is just so underwhelming that I'm astonished.

[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.020]
We had two calls.

[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.020]
One from a guy who had no idea what the score was.

[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.000]
Then from some no picker in Tampa who thinks that Darren Pupa is God and Felix Potman had

[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.980]
the best year he ever had in the NHL last year which he doesn't have any idea what he's

[00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.480]
talking about.

[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.260]
That said.

[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.100]
Hockey in Florida.

[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.460]
Maybe it's a mistake after all.

[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.320]
Here's Cutler Raid.

[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.520]
Chilla.

[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.360]
Meal.

[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.980]
Yes sir.

[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.700]
Let me make it short.

[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.240]
Let's go to the sports for a second here.

[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.920]
Okay.

[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.320]
Here's the hits.

[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.340]
The hits.

[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.700]
Man.

[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.640]
The hits are.

[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.180]
Yeah.

[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.680]
Okay.

[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.500]
The hero again.

[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960]
If you have nothing else to do then you can watch him.

[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.320]
Yeah.

[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.440]
The top is I'm a great football fan but I wish him all the luck.

[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.140]
They'll need it.

[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.700]
Okay.

[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.140]
Marlins.

[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.040]
Marlins.

[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.740]
I've gone to about 25% of the games.

[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.160]
Right.

[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.780]
Oh God.

[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.360]
I'm not a season.

[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.280]
I'll take it harder.

[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.760]
They are.

[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.580]
I'm not a season.

[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.680]
I'll take it harder for the Marlins.

[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.220]
You're nuts.

[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.200]
The station is.

[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.940]
I get die squeezed off their tickets.

[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.900]
Oh okay.

[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.340]
Oh yeah.

[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.020]
Look at you.

[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.460]
Now, listen, hockey.

[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.420]
I've been in the USA for 15 years.

[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.680]
Right.

[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.960]
And never been able to watch more than five minutes except for last night.

[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.540]
Yeah.

[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.700]
Oh you watch the game last night?

[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.680]
Goal pants with all their weight.

[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.960]
Right.

[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.240]
I got excited last night.

[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.920]
Well thank God.

[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.080]
I agree with it.

[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.040]
It was a pretty good game.

[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.680]
Big time.

[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.300]
And there were behind three nothing and it looked like, you know, they just roll over and

[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.180]
they kind of play dead just get a little practice and they got right back in there and they kicked

[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.040]
them ass and they did it.

[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.100]
And that's where you were after one game is not day anymore is we.

[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.840]
Right.

[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.600]
Now you're talking.

[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.940]
Outstanding.

[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.540]
Okay.

[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.240]
I'll see you there.

[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.000]

[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.060]
Take it.

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.280]
Yeah.

[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.940]
Outstanding man.

[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.660]
There's a word that goes between out and standing but I can't say it.

[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.260]
Out.

[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.600]
Instanding.

[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.560]
Anyway, we have an open line and day 75.

[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.160]
Once we got one new hockey fan there which is good because we'll find him a good seat.

[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.000]
I can't find any but we'll find him a good one.

[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.940]
Right there in the front row right in front of the weasemakingel.

[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.560]
Okay.

[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.720]
Let's do Tampa.

[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.180]
Hello.

[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.240]
You know how you doing.

[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.620]
Okay.

[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.520]
It's at a very good conversation with George.

[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.640]
Yeah.

[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.600]
It's a fantastic guy.

[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.920]
Anyway, consider talking about the hockey game.

[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.980]
Did he tell you to say that by the way?

[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.260]
No.

[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.820]
Okay.

[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.960]
Let me correct you on something.

[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.680]
What did I say now?

[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.140]
Okay.

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.820]
First off the capacity of the Lakeland Civic Center.

[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.360]
Five thousand.

[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.100]
Right.

[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.980]
But last night they anticipated about 4,000 people there.

[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.520]
Why is that?

[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.460]
We had 38, 76 because that's what they had last year.

[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.320]
They just really said there's not much enthusiasm on going to the games in Lakeland.

[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.760]
Why not?

[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.260]
That's just the way it is.

[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.220]
It's a bad place.

[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.380]
It's a bad access.

[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.220]
That's a small area.

[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.480]
I mean, it's not a good place to see hockey.

[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.900]

[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.580]
No, no, no, no.

[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.600]
I'm just saying you were just going to win.

[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.420]
I hope you're right.

[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.260]
I hope you're right.

[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.680]
I just thought that because I'm hearing so much about this hyped up rival, we had a thought

[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.500]
they'd been standing online all the way to Bartolome.

[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.140]
No, no, no.

[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.600]
You just went to the Dunderdome.

[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.360]
Do we get over there?

[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.220]
Well, that's a good crowd.

[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.120]
Well, you're supposed to break the all-time record.

[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.880]
It's a Dunderdome.

[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.560]
I tell you 25,000.

[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.860]
I think we're going again tonight.

[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.740]
Where are they playing tonight?

[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.860]
They're playing tonight.

[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.000]

[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.760]
Playing the blues.

[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.780]
Oh, they're in Lakeland again tonight?

[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.960]

[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.900]
Yeah, Lakeland again tonight.

[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.340]
Yeah.

[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.640]
Curtis Joseph won't be there.

[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.920]
Oh, aren't you lucky?

[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.420]
Exactly.

[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.940]
What?

[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.920]
What's the hell was he taking in some of those games against us last year and against the Blackhawks?

[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.400]
My God.

[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.960]
Okay.

[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.000]
This guy was on heavy duty juice.

[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.560]
They must have run out in the last couple of games against the Leafs, but boy, he was doing it.

[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.340]
I don't know about right now.

[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.160]
Yeah, he is doing it.

[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.740]
He's definitely doing it.

[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.460]
The first game, in fact, that clip I played at Gilmore Scoring in the second overtime, he had 62 saves in that game.

[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.880]
Yeah, he's playing.

[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.460]
And the game that I went to tonight, Tuesday night, the game I went to, he had like 20 some saves in the first period.

[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.900]
Right.

[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.040]
26 saves, I think.

[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.240]
Well, I'm not sucking up to you, but I love the Leafs.

[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.880]
That's my team.

[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.000]
I'm going to stand behind the line.

[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.760]
So, how do you like that guy that called me for about Felix Poffen about how he probably had the best year he ever had?

[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.280]
I didn't hear.

[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.800]
Oh, really?

[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.380]
That's what it does.

[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.520]
Yeah, he's trying to tell me about how Darren Pupas so great and Poffen isn't so good, it was probably the best year he ever had.

[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.980]
Of course, it was his first year in the league.

[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.440]
He was a rookie, but don't confuse this guy with the fact.

[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.840]
I hate to disagree with that man.

[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.260]
He's wrong.

[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.740]
Yeah.

[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.700]
That's the only wrong.

[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.620]
Okay.

[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.800]
I have a great thing about that.

[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.440]
That's the Zito and Bobby Clark kissed him made up last night.

[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.180]
Yeah, you know, Anthony was working to get Joey Reynolds now.

[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.220]
He keeps sneaking up behind guys and kissing him.

[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.320]
Guess who I met last night?

[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.280]
This is no shot either.

[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.620]
Yeah.

[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.320]
I met D-Man, Heizinka.

[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.040]
Did you?

[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.460]
Yeah, he was wandering around.

[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.660]
He was dressed really fine.

[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.740]
Did you let your kissing on the ball spot?

[00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.000]

[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.440]
I think his ring.

[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.940]
I didn't think I was going to be coming up.

[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.640]
I guarantee that.

[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.920]
I guarantee that S-Zito ain't going to be coming up between behind Wayne Heizing and kissing him on a cheek.

[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.720]
I guarantee you that.

[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.840]
Well, of course, yeah.

[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.380]
What do they call him the Waste Magna.

[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.060]
Or whatever.

[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.720]
Bad jokes.

[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.600]
The Waste Magna.

[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.360]
Yeah, right.

[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.620]
As in Waste, you better watch out.

[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.900]
I'll waste you if you don't watch it.

[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.860]
Hey, we're not scared of him.

[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.100]
We're not worried about him up here.

[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.620]
No, not at all.

[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.920]
Brett Gretzky's playing tonight, too.

[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.480]
Is he?

[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.840]
Yeah.

[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.740]
So tonight will be an exciting game.

[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.660]
I thought you said, wait a minute.

[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.300]
I thought you said you're playing the Blues tonight.

[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.760]
Yeah.

[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.160]
And Gretzky's playing?

[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.620]
Brent Gretzky.

[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.500]
Oh, Brent Gretzky.

[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.020]
Oh, okay.

[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.360]
Yeah.

[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.440]
Anyway, uh, we're playing Gretzky.

[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.360]
I wish we weren't playing Gretzky.

[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.720]
We're playing.

[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.440]
I'd come over there and he's sticking right in the nose.

[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.760]
We're going to come back up here.

[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.760]
What?

[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.260]
When are you going to come back up to Tampa?

[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.580]

[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.940]
October 9th.

[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.040]
October 9th.

[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.860]
Oh, for the Alistair.

[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.300]
I mean, yeah.

[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.920]
Yeah, okay.

[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.620]
I'm all excited here.

[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.900]
Sorry.

[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.520]
And when the Leafs do play up there, which is, uh, I forget when it is the 13th or so.

[00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.180]
Probably a little bit later.

[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.420]
I'll be up there for that.

[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.000]
Okay.

[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.540]
Good to you.

[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.900]
Trust me.

[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.500]
All right.

[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.100]
They call me Mr. Puck, man.

[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.860]
Don't forget it.

[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.280]
You are a Puck.

[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.700]
I know.

[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.400]
Well, look, I'm going to keep this rivalry going.

[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.380]
If I'm the only one.

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.840]
Okay.

[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.380]
I'm not kidding.

[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.480]
Have a good day.

[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.020]

[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.940]
I hope Lightning kick ass tonight.

[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.340]
I have no problem with the Lightning.

[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.180]
They got a nice team.

[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.720]
I like them.

[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.780]
Even though Terry Chris needs some help with this hair.

[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.940]
Oh, speaking of help with this hair, there's Orlando.

[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.800]
Look at that.

[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.160]
Who used to be very popular here until we found Louise McGell.

[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.640]
Used to be a number one in our hearts.

[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.800]
And in our mind, there he is.

[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.200]
Bill.

[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.540]
Good.

[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.420]
And I thought it was going to be real exciting.

[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.300]
But since we got our Louise McGell video going.

[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.520]
Well, we'll compare notes when he comes in here.

[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.840]

Or would like to anyway.

[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.900]
So wait, what do you think?

[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.120]
You think he circumcised your what?

[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.480]
I don't know, Neil.

[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.460]
What did you ask him?

[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:24.840]
We might.

[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.160]
We're making, we got some, you want to run that bias again, George?

[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:28.640]
What we got?

[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.220]
We got an agenda so full here today.

[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.640]
I may not leave the building all day.

[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.220]
We got the stuff coming in the mail.

[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.600]
We got everything coming.

[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.740]
You have no idea what the facts.

[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:36.680]
We got what?

[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.040]
The bio is coming over on the fact that the bio is coming on the facts machine.

[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.440]
Okay.

[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.700]
23 years old.

[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.980]
He's not circumcised from we'll do it for a price.

[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:45.660]
What is it?

[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:46.720]
We a Latina.

[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.660]
That's the Latin division of water.

[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.420]
I don't know.

[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:52.960]
I don't know.

[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:53.580]
I don't know.

[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:53.580]

[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.900]
You want to just give me a guess, okay?

[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.440]
Damn, you know, I don't know.

[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.860]
In other words, what I'm trying to say is if you were like really desperate.

[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.440]
Yeah.

[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.620]
Just can't get it out of this guy.

[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.620]
You know, if you just can't weasel anything out of you.

[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.040]
That's all right.

[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.660]
Just sit there and watch and keep your hands on the table at all time.

[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.540]
You said that he used to have long hair.

[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:14.820]
Yeah.

[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.920]
I remember watching a show.

[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.360]
I keep it working out a lot.

[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:18.880]
Is that true?

[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.240]
It looked like I'll built up now like one of those.

[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.000]
Really?

[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:24.520]
Yeah.

[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.860]
I'll work it out of my house.

[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.960]
Yeah, you know with who?

[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.420]
With anybody I have weights in my house.

[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:30.720]
Yeah.

[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.980]
The membership at the gym expired.

[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.160]
How come?

[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:33.840]
Look at him.

[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.600]
How come every time you come in here, you sound like a real Julio.

[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.700]
Well, the day that he came up before, remember the time you came up to my seat at the dolphin game?

[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.020]
Right.

[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.440]
The one time you didn't shine and showed up.

[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:43.600]
Right.

[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.560]
And he sounded just like like a regular guy.

[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:51.300]
And you come in here and you have that it always is like a good, like an act and act.

[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:51.760]
Yeah.

[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.840]
You sound like you're putting us on or something, putting you on.

[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.240]
Yeah, you probably were born in Jersey or something.

[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.180]
Oh, no, I did live in Jersey.

[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.760]
I told you before I came down.

[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.580]
Now look at this.

[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.780]
Do we take care of your what?

[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.360]
All right.

[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.060]
Here's Flores with 45 pounds.

[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.500]
But only one slice of pizza.

[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.520]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:08.820]
Okay.

[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.060]
Just a little warning because if you eat the second slice, that's it.

[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.720]
Thank you, sir.

[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.480]
You're a great American.

[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:15.820]
Okay.

[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:16.640]
Now what is it?

[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.360]
See how he told us fingers apart like that?

[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.100]
What is that an indication of?

[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.200]
He was like, he was not between fingers.

[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.980]
He was like this, like about the two inches apart.

[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.000]
Is he like a message there or something?

[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:30.740]
It might be.

[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.060]
It might be.

[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:32.500]
I don't know.

[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.300]
You got to call me.

[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.760]
I haven't done with anybody.

[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.700]
So reluctant and so we call us to drink.

[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.160]
Can't this be a great day in your life?

[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.360]
Can't this be the day that you just, uh, I don't know.

[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.240]
No, but wait a minute.

[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.360]
What do you mean I act like a Julio Julio Julio?

[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.900]
You know what a Julio is?

[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.000]
Julio?

[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:49.400]
Yeah.

[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.220]
It's like a professional Cuban, you know.

[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.400]
It's like a Julio.

[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.240]
That's what we call him on this show.

[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:54.800]
They love that.

[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.680]
Julio and Dutch remember Julio and Juliette?

[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.260]
Aromio and Julio.

[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.480]
Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio.

[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.260]
Now you're talking.

[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.140]
Okay.

[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:05.860]
Let's take some calls.

[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.000]
You can start eating by the way.

[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.360]
Anytime you want and the food too.

[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.580]
Here's the Davy on the star line.

[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:10.860]
Hello.

[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.660]
Yeah, hi, Neil.

[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.240]
How you doing?

[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.780]
How about those panthers?

[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.900]
Yeah, pretty exciting.

[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.500]
Now wait a minute.

[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.080]
Are you going to go to the hockey games, Orlando?

[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:17.540]
Hi.

[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.220]
Yeah, Merbin O'Hon.

[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.400]
I have season tickets.

[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.280]
I'm so excited.

[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.780]
If you got good seats here because if you do, I hate you like poison.

[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.620]
Well, then I won't let you hate me.

[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.240]
Okay.

[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.580]
I'm in the upper deck, but I'm on center right.

[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.080]
Oh, okay.

[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.200]
I'm on center right.

[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:31.800]
Yeah.

[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.340]
Okay.

[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.420]
But those are the seats I chose.

[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.440]
Those are good places to throw the octopus from.

[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.940]
Oh my God.

[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.280]
Tina Waltz just came in.

[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:38.860]
Oh no.

[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.460]
Did you buy this?

[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.440]
Well, thank you so much.

[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.060]
God almighty.

[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.920]
I knew we had one salesperson back there.

[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.920]
We had our head on straight.

[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.280]
Look at that.

[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.000]
Look at a look on it.

[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.700]
If you can see the look on Orlando's face when I showed him this, uh, the CD.

[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.660]
Uh, embarrassing.

[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.320]
I'd be embarrassed to have looked like that.

[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.680]
Well, I wish I'd look like that.

[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.200]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.920]
Were they unbeasurable or what?

[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.840]
The beasur is dynamite, man.

[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.120]
The unbeasur is.

[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:06.700]
I really.

[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:06.740]
I really.

[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:06.740]

[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.980]
I really, I really, I was getting into that game when, you know, we were two men short over and over all these penalties.

[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.380]
I know I was getting into that game like it was a playoff game there at one point because I mean it was so intense.

[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.960]
And here was the first exhibition game we ever played.

[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:20.600]
It was intense.

[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:21.340]
It was.

[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.620]
It was unreal.

[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.360]
Yeah.

[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:25.500]
And.

[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.280]
So I hear you're also going to Vegas, huh?

[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:36.700]
Well, I wasn't planning on going to Vegas, but I just found out that Lewis, uh, my buddy, Louis Miguel, who's my best close personal friend is doing at Caesar's.

[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.200]
This weekend.

[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.120]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.100]
I'm not going to Vegas.

[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:39.960]
You're not going.

[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.800]
I got a great restaurant for you to try.

[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:42.920]
Did Italian restaurant?

[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:49.800]
Um, no, actually it's more like, uh, like a steak, uh, seafood, continental type thing.

[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.660]
Nice watcher, Amanda.

[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.360]
It's called Hugo's.

[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:53.700]
Yeah.

[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.560]
And it's in the Union Pat Festival seller.

[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.780]
But they have a great Italian restaurant there, too, don't they?

[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.200]
Um, the vineyard or something like, I don't know what it's called, but I've heard that the Italian restaurant in Caesar's to die from.

[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.180]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:07.820]
I didn't eat that.

[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.000]
I ate it to Delhi there in the form shop.

[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:10.520]
Yeah.

[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.140]
If you go eat it to the plate.

[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:12.620]
Okay.

[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.540]
It's unbelievable.

[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.780]
You'll have corn beef coming out of your ears.

[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:17.520]
Mm-hmm.

[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:19.720]
Okay.

[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.800]
Well, listen, uh, hey, um, if you're psyched, I'm psyched.

[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.240]
I'll tell you that.

[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:23.920]
I was into it.

[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.540]
No wait.

[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.580]
There's one other thing though.

[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:25.900]
Yeah.

[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.500]
Have you ever heard of that new, uh, game show called the Caesar's talent?

[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.500]
Well, I'm odd Rashad.

[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:31.920]
No.

[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:32.400]
Okay.

[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.560]
It's taped at the vaguely.

[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.400]
Yeah.

[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.940]
It's taped at that Caesar's.

[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.080]
Well, when I went in July, I was a contestant on that game show.

[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.340]
Really?

[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.040]
Yes.

[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.120]
And how'd you make out?

[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.260]
How do I make out?

[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.940]
I don't want to talk about that.

[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.760]
Oh, bad, bad question, huh?

[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.240]
Yeah.

[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.140]
But it was fun being on the show and it was pretty wild to meet on my Rashad.

[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:53.880]
Yeah.

[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.400]
He's okay.

[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.280]
He is okay.

[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.380]
He never stole a freight train.

[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.080]
He's not.

[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.200]
Oh, God.

[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.120]
Sir, I'm going to have to leave you now.

[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.900]
Like Luca Brassi said.

[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.700]
I know you're a busy man today if your daughter's wedding.

[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:05.700]
Oh, okay.

[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.800]
Good luck, you're back.

[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.340]
Take it easy.

[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.260]
Oh, my God.

[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.180]
We're going to have to terminate the show right now.

[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:12.900]
Look at that.

[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.480]
Look at that.

[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.500]
Don't look at it too close, Orlando.

[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.480]
You might start getting nervous.

[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.120]
He is turning such a dark shade of purple man in his face, too.

[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.780]
Anyway, it's 1146 at W-Y-O-D and W-S-U-N.

[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.660]
Boy, that Tina, man.

[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.580]
She knows how to do it.

[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.640]

It's a great way to spend the spring afternoon.

[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.060]
But spring is over.

[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.220]

You bet your carabans I did.

[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:08.140]
New 94, 7 passenger carabans with factory air, automatic and two airbags from not 20,000 or 18,000.

Well, that's great.

[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.320]
And you're in here, dittling around with the food.

[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.020]
They all played.

[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.560]
What an asshole, man.

[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.520]
We're busy in here.

[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.660]
That was your tune up mine.

[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.240]
Well, how I helped was I supposed to hear it, you idiot.

[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.400]
How do you know they all played?

[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.480]
You assumed they all played.

[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.640]
They're all the lights are flashing.

[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.780]
Maybe they never fired.

[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.400]
We're too busy showing on net Luis Miguel.

[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.680]
And she said that looks good to me, but he needs a haircut.

[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.200]
This hair looks okay to me.

[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.240]
So we're in here.

[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.500]
So how about Orlando?

[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.380]
What he doing a pinch?

[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.040]
We can't get Luis Miguel in here today.

[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.460]
What are you looking over there for?

[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.280]
He's over here.

[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.660]
Okay. She's so goddamn bashful, man.

[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.780]
Her husband's going to hear about this.

[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.180]
She'll be finished for life.

[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.280]
Everybody is so intimidated, so bashful, man.

[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.760]
I'm not bashful. Just watch.

[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.080]
Okay, here's a lady in North Miami Beach. Hello.

[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:36.460]
Hi.

[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.280]
This is Marlon.

[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.120]
I got the tickets from you on Tuesday.

[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.280]
He gave me for my birthday to the Marlon's game.

[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.020]
And I had a really good time except they totally blew.

[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.020]
Except for the fact that they're in a coma now.

[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.920]
You picked a bad time to go.

[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.240]
You picked a really good time to pick the worst time.

[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.620]
I swear, the weather was great.

[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.600]
It was nice that it drizzled like two seconds.

[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.220]
But then they really just totally blew.

[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.440]
They bit the big one, yeah.

[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.720]
Yeah, I was upset about that.

[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.440]
Did you go?

[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.080]
No.

[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.040]
You didn't go.

[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.460]
Well, flying over the stadium with a...

[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.000]
Flying over the stadium with a twin engine.

[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.760]
And his engine stalled out right over the stadium.

[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.980]
That's not the guy that was carrying the gigantic banner of Markey Markin.

[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.860]
And his Calvin Klein's was...

[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.980]
No, no. He wasn't carrying a banner.

[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.220]
But his engine stalled out right over the stadium.

[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.080]
Oh, that's great.

[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.620]
And all he could carry was everybody just breathing in.

[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.160]
It was great.

[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.060]
What a rush.

[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:33.260]
Beautiful.

[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.700]
I think for the next dolphin game to turn our luck around instead of having a Markey Mark poster up there.

[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.980]
We'll have Orlando and his Calvin Klein's like trailing over the dolphin game.

[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.020]
There you go.

[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:44.800]
For the Red Skin.

[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.380]
Red Skin's in four skins.

[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.120]
Oh, here's ESEA.

[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.060]
Now we have to...

[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:50.900]
Now before we do...

[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.960]
We got to rewind the tape.

[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:52.840]
Okay, for ESEA.

[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.760]
Can you see on the VCR down there below?

[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.380]
Where it says rewind?

[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.880]
You have to give instructions.

[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:00.880]
I have to give instructions.

[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.420]
The wireless is a crappy VCR.

[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.200]
You're folded down.

[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:03.800]
There you go.

[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.600]
Just keep holding it.

[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.240]
Here we go.

[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:05.820]
A little longer.

[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.460]
A little longer.

[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.340]
You bet anytime.

[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.340]
Okay, let it go.

[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.880]
Let it go.

[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:11.340]
Hit play.

[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.000]
Play.

[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.580]
Believe me, you see, you'll appreciate this.

[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.040]
You'll thank me for this and your will.

[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:17.640]
Okay.

[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.560]
She's a big Luis Miguel fan.

[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.120]
She's obsessed.

[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:21.780]
Anyway, go ahead.

[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.220]
I'm sorry.

[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.200]
That's all right.

[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.100]
I just wanted to call somebody a douchebag.

[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.900]
Paula, you are a big, beautiful, teeny tiny.

[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.840]
It's a bitty little douchebag.

[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.540]
Okay, I'm glad you had a good time.

[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.220]
It's part of the fact.

[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.520]
I can't be responsible for our team sucking a big one.

[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.380]
But it was still fun.

[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.100]
Thanks a lot, Neil.

[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.240]
Bye-bye.

[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.980]
We're on the air in here.

[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.480]
Okay, you want the audio here.

[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.360]
Get out of the way, Bob.

[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.520]
She wants the audio too.

[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.900]
She may have an accident in here before we're finished.

[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.660]
This woman is such a gigantic Luis Miguel fan.

[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.460]
If she knew that he was at Caesars in Vegas this weekend,

[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.860]
I might even take you if you speak real nice to me.

[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.840]
Would Joy Reynolds, yeah?

[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.260]
Yeah, but you don't have to sell me, okay, Andy?

[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.500]
And look at this Tina being the great goddess that she is.

[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.160]
Went out and look what she bought.

[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:12.980]
Yeah.

[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.760]
She is Tina's a goddess.

[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.800]
湴 emotions.

[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.980]
He both Andrew and Charles were free.

[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:35.980]

[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:44.680]
Nick, play slowly.

[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:44.680]

[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:44.860]
How are you feeling, Harry?

He is good that would be up three or four goals one that will be worth yeah, that's right

[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.880]
I'm glad they would have left him in the whole game. I hate to break the news to you

[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.160]
But we would have won the game. Yeah, what was I gonna say? Oh

[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:34.740]
D for God

[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.560]
Anyway, I was on the phone for small on the phone for over an hour. That's why you forgot that's the way we plan it

[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.040]
It works like a charm, doesn't it? Yeah, y'all look pretty sleazy in the in the first period

[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.700]
But I guess you got that fire then you know you know underneath your butt. Yeah, the first period

[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:54.040]
Well, wait a minute. How about the lightning in the first period you guys had a two-man advantage over and over again and couldn't score at

[00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:00.540]
Kathy Willow's house. Let's get serious. I know 50 minutes of that game was was penalty you guys couldn't score it Orlando's brisk

[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.200]
Yeah, the big demilal choke a few times. I thought of Bradley. They whip right down the open net

[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.120]
Yeah, but yeah

[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.500]
That one Bradley had the whole open net man. He just choke big. No, he just he was choking

[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:16.980]

Open line and bravo. So much excitement going on in here

[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.940]
You would almost think we didn't even have a radio show. I wonder how much dead air there was at the end of that break

[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.680]
Huh, we'll never know

[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.640]
Maybe the lady in North Miami Beach can tell us hello

[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.460]
I have to be blind, but that shouldn't stop. We have an open line indeed 751

[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.280]
You believe that now someone now we got people playing tapes of blind Mike on here

[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.360]
That's the best part. Maybe they wanted to pull them out

[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.860]
Maybe they had some jingles. They wanted to play the promo show on WSBH

[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:55.080]
Huh?

[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.280]
What is that be stand for an SBH blind?

[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.540]
Huh South Beach blind station?

[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:08.000]
Or they should call this one that because this station basically consists of the blind leading the blind here is clear water

[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.460]
Hello, hey, how you doing Neil pretty good sir? You really have to excuse the people in the West coast

[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.820]
How about sitting on a bench? Well, whatever in your case stuck on a bench, maybe true

[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.360]
But in Randy's case it would be stuck on a bench

[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.880]

Beautiful

[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:28.600]
When it bigger it's better, yes, when it build my hand

[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.480]
It's not my chest, oh when it moves

[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.500]
It ruined my best, it came out of my jeans

[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.340]
And into my life, oh how it makes me feel fine

[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:47.580]

It's about 7 to 2 W.O.D.

[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:58.500]
So anyway, I guess if you keep your hands in your pockets all day, have a grin on your face

[00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.780]
Is that the message you're trying to give me?

[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:00.660]
Is that what you're saying?

[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:02.960]
Yeah, okay

[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:09.520]
Anyway, geez horrible stories Orlando's telling me during the news break about the guy trying to give him to go to Texas

[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.500]
Can we tell that story on here?

[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.540]
Can't we tell anything that's... there was nothing grotesque about that

[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.260]
What was wrong with that story? Why wouldn't you want to repeat that?

[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.120]
I guess, go ahead

[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:26.000]
No, no, you go ahead, because then I'll say something and say, oh you didn't say that

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.680]
Oh, dude, good

[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.080]
Right, what happened?

[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.280]
I don't know, you go

[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.580]
Okay, let's skip it, okay, it was a bad story

[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.540]
Nothing happened, you were smart, you didn't go, the guy was like trying to con you with something

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.200]
And wanted to give you a job, some kind of a job

[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.800]
Okay, here's, oh speaking of a guy who wants to give you a job, here's Bobby

[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.080]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.300]
This is Sandy's Bobby

[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.860]
Yeah, how you doing? Why am I always associated with her?

[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.000]
I don't have an identity of my own

[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]
I notice you don't seem too happy about it

[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.300]
This audience can understand, they can relate to that

[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.920]
I have no identity of my own

[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.360]
True

[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.240]
First thing George says, this is in Sandy's Bobby, is it?

[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:06.560]
Yeah

[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:07.920]
So how you been?

[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.060]
I understand you're circumcised by the way

[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:10.960]
Yes sir

[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.880]
How do you like that?

[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.400]
Oh, it's very neat

[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.080]
Not one of the unclean masses out there like Orlando

[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:18.600]
Barbarian

[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.920]
Barbarian is you George, are you uncircumcised swine?

[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.800]
I tell you what, we have no cling on

[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.100]
Yeah, that's right

[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.280]
Anyway, Sandy's on the other side now

[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:30.480]
Meaning what?

[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.000]
She's listening to Jerry

[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.520]
Is he really?

[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:33.960]
Yeah

[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.460]
All I can say to that is

[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:35.940]
Oh

[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.300]
Hallelujah, thank God, we got rid of her

[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.420]
She's working on the English only campaign now

[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.780]
I believe that, yeah, she and Sandy are going to start the anti-bilingual campaign

[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.920]
That's Sandy to the power of two

[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.900]
Well, what's going on with you guys?

[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.720]
You sound like you're having a little falling out

[00:35:53.720 --> 00:36:15.240]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:44.960]
I don't know. Where is she going? Going up to Tallahassee. Maybe she's going to we'll up with Wichner. No, she's going up to Tallahassee working on the campaign for English only. No way. She's going to go to Lava in Tallahassee. She's not doing that. Get out of here. Hey, she's going to Tallahassee. Are you serious? She's going to Tallahassee tomorrow morning. For what? She's going to go to Lava starting Monday. You're yanking at me. No, I'm telling you. She's Sandy. She's really gotten into Sandy. Okay. No, what I mean? Yeah. Tell me me. Maybe she can.

[00:36:44.960 --> 00:37:14.940]
She can move up there permanently. Well, we've been trying, but they won't take us. Hey, look, I wonder, you know, I can't. I was sitting here.

[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:51.420]
Star I would be roses and douchebag is it somebody we're supposed to know is this Rosa? Didn't you tell me to say that?

[00:43:53.180 --> 00:44:03.780]
Oh, okay. We got so much inside crap going on here and I have no idea what it is and I keep forgetting to look back at this little thing here that was in the CD that was brought in.

[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:08.800]
Let's just play the music. How with anything else? Okay, let's just put the music on and we'll all eat together.

[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:20.220]
Rosa, you're not a douchebag. George said roses are douchebag. George is dead me. He's dead me.

[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:45.200]
So I guess we can assume Louise is making a little bit more per hour than you are Orlando. We don't want you to get a big swelled head.

[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:53.500]
He's not making more than you are. A lot more like millions millions and millions and you're probably like just as talented as he is.

[00:44:53.820 --> 00:45:07.660]
I can't say no can't think. Look almost as good as he does. Anyway, so now we got this interview with Louise Miguel by Manuel Pila by Manuel Labor. Where did this come from by the way?

[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:13.360]
That's from the girl. That's from Eltha from Warner. Oh, this is what it's worth is but.

[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:24.680]
Well, excuse me. Look at that. Here's a whole biography career of Louise Miguel 1982 in the two years span from agents 12 to 14. He records and succeeds with four albums.

[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:39.860]
One and one equals two in normados in normados. What is that? Oh, in Amorados. I thought it said enormous. Well, I choose you where my mind is. Here's the mobile as they're gone on the mobile.

[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:53.340]
It looked like that for just a second. He said it's enormous. Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale on the star line. Hello. Hi, Neil. Hi. I have a quick dog father question is driving me crazy. Yes, man. Here. I'll take your crap.

[00:45:53.340 --> 00:46:08.580]

[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:20.780]

[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:32.720]
And he's having a thing there with Tom. They take the Robert DuValle and they take him under the thing there and they're holding him hostage and he says. Well, the way to Luca Bromsey comes after you or something like that. He says he gets that.

[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:46.100]
Cheshire cat grin on his face is let me worry about Luca. Luca. Okay. Good. All right. Thanks. Is that it? Okay. It's the answer, man. We have an open line in the star line star. I would do one and brown. Don't shake that too hard now.

[00:46:47.060 --> 00:47:02.100]
Let's go to a lady in my. My. Hi. Hello. Hi. How you doing? Great. First of all, I want to tell you that you have the wrong CD. Oh, you have to get the one that. Well, listen, look, Tina went out and bought this for me with her own heart and box. She came in here all

[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:20.960]
away in here. And I'm very grateful, especially for the one picture in here where like you start naked. Oh, pretty close. I'm sure that was worth it. Yeah, but no Orlando City had too much clothes on. He'll never make it modeling Calvin Klein. Now the new the old CD, which is Romance. That's the really nice one because it has all those low spec. The.

[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:50.940]
The song was the song. Yeah, that's the one you have to get really. Yeah, well, this one will make do the one where he's got his hands deep in his pockets in the big ring on his face. Now you have to know he looks a lot different now. When he first started. Yeah, he used to have this. You know, shoulder lanes hair. Oh, and all he would do. That's what Orlando said. He said he used to have hair down to his public. It was gross and all he would do is jump around and stage and just yank his hair and all. And he used to jump around and yank it. And it's here too. Uh huh. You know, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I

[00:47:50.940 --> 00:48:02.120]
was just pulled it. Tugged his hair in the front. And then he'd do like an Elvis move. Yeah. Oh, he was gross. In other words, he was trying to be like Michael Jackson. He'd grab it at his thing and jump it around a lot in a

[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:13.060]
little boy. This huge mansion and alcapocal. Yeah. And he has all these wild parties with whom? Well, maybe we can slip in. If there's that many people, they'll never notice us.

[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:20.020]
I'm saying you can slip in. Huh? Well, it's all go. We're leaving right now. The bus is leaving in a half an hour. Anybody want to go in party with Luis? Huh?

[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:28.540]
Go to Vegas. I guarantee you there'll be somebody there for everybody. Well, you got to get that CD. It's really, really good. What's it called roman say?

[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.420]
Romance. My tongue keeps getting stuck on my mower. Anyway, wait a minute. What is it? Romance.

[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.100]
Rrrr. Rrrr. Rrrr. Rrrr.

[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.520]
It sounds like Sally Fitz is in the building. You hear that?

[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.920]
You know, or the apparatus is in 10th gear, man. It's about to take off into orbit.

[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.800]
You know, Neil Ornanda has a real sexy voice.

[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.480]
He does. You ever see Orlando? No, I've never seen him.

[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.140]
Oh my God. He would make you forget Luis Miguel in no time.

[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.700]
Well, I don't like really Luis Miguel. What do you like about Luis Miguel?

[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.640]
You don't like his looks? No, he's too thin.

[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:10.100]
What? What do you like? Chubby guys? No, not Chubby, but he just looks like a real young kid.

[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.960]
Oh, that's why you like him. He's 23 years. Don't say that.

[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.460]
He's legal aid.

[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.700]
As long as they're not jailbait, that's right up my alley.

[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:19.780]
Okay? Leave your number with George.

[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.340]
Now Orlando is more your, Orlando's 28.

[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.700]
I've seen Orlando's 28. He's a male model.

[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.980]
Oh, there you go. He was an amen from Cuba calendar,

[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.460]
in which all the other guys were ugly and he was out of this world.

[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.300]
Out of this world.

[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:35.860]
I'm going to tell you something Orlando. You locked out because you stood out and you must have had something to do with that.

[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.500]
You must have had some pull if I could do this.

[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.280]
What stood out? What stood out?

[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.920]
He stood out. It's stood out.

[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:45.420]
No, really, because if you go down on South Beach, you will see so many beautiful Cuban guys.

[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.020]
I mean, really hot looking guys. Am I right?

[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.040]
Yeah, you do.

[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:50.820]
I'm asking him. Oh, but no.

[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.500]
No, don't, when you stop it, why is he so quiet?

[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.140]
Why is he so quiet?

[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.440]
Because he's turning a deeper shade of pale, man,

[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.400]
because he is a mama's list in right now. I get very embarrassed easily.

[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.920]
Your mama's list is for this?

[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.340]
Your mama, yeah. Your mama.

[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.300]
My mama?

[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:05.840]
Yeah.

[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:06.740]
Why mama?

[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:12.020]
But anyway, so they could have probably found a lot of really hot looking guys down here on South Beach.

[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:16.520]
But they had all these ugly guys in Orlando, who's like a 45 on a scale of three.

[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:16.940]
Wow.

[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.080]
Yeah. And it stood out. That's why he became a big star now.

[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.440]
So he's an calendar and he's in everything.

[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.900]
If you open up any magazine, he's modeling all over the place.

[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.840]
He's like in Calvin Klein's things. He's all, he's, this is a major star we have here.

[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.000]
He gets naked for money.

Wow. Hey, how much?

[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:34.580]

We got a girlfriend.

[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:33.860]
I don't even have an address.

[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.940]
And make a new enemy.

[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.720]
Now it's time to kill you.

[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.360]
Nice and gun.

[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:44.740]
On an all new Risco County Junior at 8.7 Central.

[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:49.740]
Then, they were warned not to open the FBI's most secret files.

[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:55.080]
They've got a UFO here and they'll do anything to keep it a secret. They should have listened.

[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.860]
The ex files and all new episodes.

[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.420]
And late night tonight, our top story is, Chevy Chase.

[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.080]
Is real and finally agreed to get the Palestinians a homeland.

[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:08.780]
Unfortunately, it's Bosnia.

[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.460]
The seven-kill show tonight on Fox.

[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.980]
He's still not ready for blind time, but he's appearing late night on Fox.

[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.540]
For a night of comedy, music, and surprises, catch the Chevy Chase show.

[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.080]
Tonight at 12 midnight on WSBN 7 Fox.

[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.800]
How do you handle hundreds of rowdy bikers?

[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.280]
I've gone about the Hollywood for sale.

[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.640]
The Hollywood, the motor to Hollywood for sale.

[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.620]
Howdy handle hundreds of Love Struck Casanovas.

[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.540]
Bonjour, Walsh. How about the Diamond Ring of Soft Settlement Clashy Five?

[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:40.220]
The Diamond Ring for sale. The Diamond Ring. Diamond Ring.

[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:44.200]
How do you handle hundreds of callers responding to your son's sentinel classified?

[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.740]
There's only one answer.

[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.820]

This Saturday and Sunday morning right here.

[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.820]
Howdy, Walsh.

[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.040]
Are you cereal?

[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:39.020]
Who is bending over in the motor home and she wasn't wearing any underwear?

[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.080]
Go ahead.

[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:43.940]
Donatella. Donatello.

[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:44.720]
Donatella.

[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.700]
If we don't hear this, I tell you one thing.

[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.200]
Love. Donatella.

[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.020]
Who is Donatella?

[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:51.700]
She's getting me trouble.

[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:53.160]
No, I'm not. Who was she?

[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:55.760]
Okay.

[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:58.380]
You're not going to tell us?

[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:04.840]
How come he's so verbal during the break, man? And as soon as the mic goes on, he clams up like a like a clam.

[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.480]
Who is she?

[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.820]
How old is she? What is her story?

[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.220]
What does underwear she was?

[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:11.680]
Exactly.

[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:15.540]
Well, she was wearing any of this.

[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.680]
Yeah, I couldn't tell you.

[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:20.160]
Okay. No big deal. That's what she said about you, too.

[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:22.960]
Okay, let's do a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:29.800]
Yeah, Neil. Holy canolea. I woke up this morning only to find Jerry Jones at Diary of the Wallet.

[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:30.200]
Yeah.

[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.040]
He served up a real nice plate of ammits.

[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.480]
I guess those two losses really got the job done, huh?

[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.160]
Yeah.

[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.860]
They convinced them to get out the old checkbook and cut the crap.

[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:42.600]
Yeah, I think he cut him 4 million to start with.

[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:43.340]
Quirk Quirk.

[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:43.700]
Yeah.

[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.380]
But you know, you know,

[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:47.940]
Quirk Quirk.

[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:48.300]
Yeah.

[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.860]
It might be the kiss of death for him.

[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:50.920]
You know, like two fumbled games.

[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:51.220]
Yeah.

[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:51.680]

[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:52.760]
Yeah.

[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:55.360]
And of course, that's our luck again.

[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.620]
Amit Smith signs before we get a chance to tackle the Cowboys.

[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.260]
Just like what's his name?

[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.760]
Riffin will be back. He'll be all healed up for that Monday night game when we play the Redskins.

[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.500]
That'll be the day he comes back.

[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:06.520]
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.900]
And then, well, of course, I think I'll week off, too, after this, you know,

[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.960]
from the catch of breathing and learn how to catch the ball and all.

[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:13.340]
Yeah.

[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.400]
You might have forgot that.

[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:14.740]
Yeah.

[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.200]
Not to change the subject, but I won't change it anyway.

[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:21.760]
I was just thinking, you know, the old Fort Lauderdale is then working their butts off around here

[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.120]
with all these illegal aliens.

[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:24.420]
Why not?

[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:28.500]
When the legal aliens come in, give them a rental car.

[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.440]
I was going all over it and maybe a map taped right up on the old dash.

[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:32.680]
Yeah.

[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.040]
Oh, and then blast all the way.

[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:35.420]
Yeah.

[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:36.040]
Yeah.

[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.240]
And give him a little sheet that says, by the way, when you get a slice of pizza,

[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.900]
always ask for a second one for free.

[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:42.760]
Yeah.

[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.040]
Well, anyway.

[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.740]
Okay, listen, have a great time at the A Clan Rally this weekend.

[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.160]
We have an open line in Broward 5249 460.

[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.000]
Was that from Davey?

[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:50.780]
Must have been.

[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.600]
Well, he'd have been really upset if we had Cubans in the building today.

[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.660]
Okay, let's do Miami.

[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:56.060]
Hello.

[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:57.660]
Miami.

[00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.880]
Wayne is tardy.

[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.480]
Long gone.

[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.600]
Okay, probably got too excited when he started talking about Donatella.

[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.120]
We have an open line in Davey.

[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:08.600]
754-9463.

[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:10.860]
Here's a lady in Port Charlotte.

[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.020]
I sure hope it's not Margaret.

[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.680]
It certainly is.

[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:15.620]
Oh, my God.

[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.060]
Joseph and Mary.

[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.520]
Am I the only one you call?

[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.980]
Oh, there goes that last.

[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:21.860]
There goes that last.

[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.360]
I heard that yesterday too.

[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:24.660]
Good.

[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:25.400]
There goes that.

[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.520]
Primance to be on radio without even calling you.

[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:30.060]
How about that?

[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:30.760]
What do you mean by that?

[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:31.480]
I'm not just saying.

[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.020]
I'm a lady.

[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:34.000]
I'm a lady call.

[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:34.380]
Yeah.

[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:34.940]
Yeah.

[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:35.060]

[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:35.220]
Yeah.

[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:35.340]
Yeah.

[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:35.400]
Yeah.

[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.120]
Your brother again.

[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.260]
No, it wasn't.

[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:40.160]
Anyway.

[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:41.600]
Yeah.

[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:44.440]
I think I've been on this thing an hour again.

[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:44.920]
Yeah.

[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:45.780]
How does it feel?

[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.920]
And I've rehearsed and rehearsed and rehearsed.

[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:48.320]
Yeah.

[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.040]
Well, you better do a good job then.

[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:56.480]
Well, I'm I wanted to tell all those gentlemen that are talking about the West Coast.

[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:00.220]
I'm on the West Coast and I'm a big hockey fan.

[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:00.620]
Yeah.

[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:02.420]
And I watched the game last night.

[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.080]
They called you the puck, Maister, right, Margaret?

[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:04.460]
Yes.

[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.660]
Don't do that to me.

[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:08.080]
Okay.

[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.040]
And it was a fantastic game.

[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:12.320]
You saw it?

[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.500]
Yes, I did.

[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.120]
Great.

[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.520]
On TV last night.

[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:15.820]
Uh-huh.

[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.720]
I love hockey.

[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.220]
Do you?

[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:18.280]
Yeah.

[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.960]
It was it was really a thrill because they both were very good.

[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:22.840]
They were real good.

[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.440]
Very good.

[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.180]
And some of those guys are better than others though.

[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:25.960]
Well, yeah.

[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:27.660]
Some of them were real good.

[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:28.300]
Well.

[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.340]
Some of them not so good.

[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:29.840]
Yeah.

[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.940]
But the score should have been bigger than what it was.

[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:33.880]
It should have been a lot bigger.

[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.740]
That's what I've always said.

[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:35.520]
It should have been a lot bigger.

[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.120]
But you have to make do with what you got, Margaret.

[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:37.580]
I know.

[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:38.820]
Yeah.

[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:40.480]
Okay.

[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:40.900]
Right.

[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:42.980]
Uh-huh.

[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:44.300]
Now to the depressing time.

[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:46.420]
Yeah.

[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:46.940]
Yeah.

[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:47.260]
Yeah.

[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.900]
And I got to watch.

[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:50.760]
I was fortunate.

[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.700]
I was fortunate as a case may be.

[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.280]
By the way, Margaret, do you ever read the advocate?

[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:55.240]
Oh, I'm sorry.
