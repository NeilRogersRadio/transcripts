[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]
Daisy Cun and the officer who did most of the blowing on the head,

[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.820]
Ron's Powell. I'm Frank Chantry.

[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.080]

Now, the Neil Rodgers Show, on New Stock Radio 610, WIOD.

[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.200]
It's me again, Bob.

[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.480]
Dush when you're done.

[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.040]
Alan Box was a normal man.

[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.620]
With a nice home, a lovely family, and a cushy job with his father-in-law's company.

[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.180]
Normal, that is, until just three weeks ago.

[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.600]
Hi, honey. How was your day?

[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.380]
Some of an esoteric Monday I feared would end up being buttoned on the last one,

[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.200]
let me see if I can't focus it in to the best of my ability.

[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.400]
Alan Box is suffering from Bob Lasseter Disease.

[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.520]
Are you feeling alright, Alan?

[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.620]
Absolutely insane. I see things that nobody else needs to see.

[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.380]
Or at least cares to admit that they say.

[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.760]
Bob Lasseter Disease attacks the central nervous system,

[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.320]
causing otherwise normal people to communicate like suicidal maniacs.

[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.940]
I don't want to tell you today. I don't want to talk to you.

[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.380]
What's more, Bob Lasseter Disease is the one form of depression, which is actually contagious.

[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.340]
God, just listening to that voice, I want to jump off a building.

[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.420]
You're the lowest of the low your life.

[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.520]
Nate, you're at gum bag.

[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.100]
Please send whatever you can today to post office box 1-800-DEVON-PORT-I-O-R.

[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.360]
Honey, it's Friday night. You know what that means.

[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080]
Fitching and morning and screaming and hollering, please help.

[00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.160]
I think it's too late. It's 11.07 at WIOD on a nice late back.

[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.440]
We had a late back Friday and now we're having a late back Monday.

[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.980]
Let's just all lay back, okay?

[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.740]
Comatose is the word we're looking for.

[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.620]
As we search for an audience, man, desperately scouring the sky,

[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.720]
scouring the Everglades anywhere out there.

[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.340]
If there's a creature, if there's a cretin' anything that's breathing,

[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.320]
we're a game for it. Open line at day two and brown.

[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.480]
One on the star line that looks like four.

[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.140]
Let's do with a grove. Hello.

[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.500]
Hey, Neil, how you doing? Is radius.

[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.340]
Okay, yeah, radius. What's happening, man?

[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.680]
Okay.

[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.520]
It's a Neil.

[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.960]
Yeah.

[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.480]
I went over to the piece of trough the other day.

[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.980]
Yeah. Don't say trough.

[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.640]
He gets very emotional about that.

[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.760]
I'm sorry, the piece of it.

[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.020]
He's very thin skinned.

[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.200]
Yeah.

[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.140]
Even though it fits perfectly over there.

[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.880]
What's wrong with it? I thought that was a cute line.

[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.140]
Tick out at the trough. I thought that was a...

[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.900]
One of our listeners came up with that last year.

[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.100]
It was creative, it was innovative, it was cute.

[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.360]
It was sure better than those crappy TV spots

[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.000]
that Ponytail runs, but he's like very sensitive now.

[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.580]
Can you wait, staff?

[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.260]
Our professional wait staff will take care of you.

[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.140]
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.480]
That's okay. Neil, they have some bunch of ugly guys there.

[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.520]
They do. You staff some cute guys working here.

[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.720]
I know. I remember I went one time and then...

[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.260]
I was a matter of fact, I went Saturday night

[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.540]
and they have some wrote, wrote, wrote, called test guys.

[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.600]
Yeah. I may not go tomorrow night after.

[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.680]
Hey, listen.

[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.540]
Let me start doing the hiring up there.

[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.580]
My boyfriend told me the reason why I know this bull

[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.200]
but he said he heard it somewhere.

[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.100]
The reason why you went on vacation?

[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.860]
Neil didn't go out on my answer.

[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.840]
Then he went some...

[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.200]
Jobs stuff over at Chicago.

[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.940]
Yeah, right.

[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.960]
And I said, you're full of crap.

[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.840]
He is full of crap.

[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.280]
I know, I know he's full of crap.

[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.900]
Neil, can you do me a favor?

[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.560]
I'm listening.

[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.220]
Can you do me a greetings from my recorder?

[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.180]
Do what?

[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.880]
The greetings from a message from him.

[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.560]
Oh, Jay's, please.

[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.100]
Are you rolling it?

[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.620]
Yeah, I'm rolling it as you're speaking.

[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.980]
Hi, Radius isn't here now, but when she gets back,

[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.920]
if you leave your name number in the jock size,

[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.960]
maybe she'll call you back.

[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.640]
Thanks a lot.

[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.180]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.540]
See you. You're the greatest.

[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.360]
I am. See you.

[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.100]
We have two open lines in date, 751,

[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.480]
one in the blue line and broiled, 5249463,

[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.500]
and let's do a Pembroke Pine.

[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.840]
Hello.

[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.800]
Neil.

[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.240]
Yeah.

[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.500]
I guess this voice that's not heard during the movie.

[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.700]
Mississippi Burning was on ABC last night.

[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.920]
Yeah.

[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.760]
It is segment.

[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.860]
Joe Angel was doing the voice to the ball game.

[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.660]
When he was in the living room.

[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.660]
What's the overacting?

[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.460]
And it's out of here for home run.

[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.900]
Oh, Joe, I mean, just 20 years for overacting, baby.

[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.740]
I can't.

[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.180]
Save.

[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.900]
I just can't stand it.

[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.880]
These 20 melodramatic calls.

[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.500]
I mean, if you're into the game, if you're a fan of the team,

[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.380]
which you should be when you broadcast the games,

[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.040]
the excitement should come naturally and spontaneously.

[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.740]
It shouldn't have to be one of these things

[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.260]
where there's this melodramatic stage pause

[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.320]
and then this fake stage, it's like a fake orgasm, man.

[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.520]
It's like listening to Joe Angel.

[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.480]
I can't stand it.

[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.760]
I just hate his corny jokes.

[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.320]
Yeah.

[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.900]
Somebody tagged somebody right in the growing last night.

[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.260]
He's making all these different ones that were aww.

[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.160]
Guys seeing triple and all kinds of things

[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.340]
that they can sense at all.

[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.740]
Mm-hmm.

[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.540]
But I like his stuff.

[00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.260]
I don't.

[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.300]
Hey, I like Dave O'Brien.

[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.420]
Dave O'Brien is good.

[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.440]
Something's fishy on that attendance.

[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.980]
I was there Friday night for the game.

[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.700]
You're going to tell me that was the largest crowd.

[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.500]
You see you don't understand it.

[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.240]
The National League up until the season,

[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.040]
the attendance that they announced was the number of people in the stands.

[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.100]
But now the National League does the same as the American League.

[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.040]
And that is however many tickets are sold is the attendance.

[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.400]
So there were 43,000 tickets sold,

[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.360]
but there may have only been like 35,000 people in a ballpark.

[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.260]
Okay, I was going to get a lot of no-shows.

[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.840]
You know what's also going on too?

[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.560]
I think Mars get a victim of this

[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.580]
because it's telling the touch of cheap general mission

[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.120]
and giving such good promotion items out.

[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.780]
People buying this $4 thing to go through to turn stuff

[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.460]
a couple times to pick up the item.

[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.320]
I've seen it happen, especially on pin nights.

[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.880]
Yeah.

[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.260]
And there is a go through it.

[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.440]
They have their great seat arrest.

[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.400]
And they go buy another one.

[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.440]
And they go, but they get a couple $4 tickets

[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.660]
going through and buying and getting a pick up some pins

[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.820]
and reselling them for $20.

[00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.600]
So what's wrong with that?

[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.520]
That's called creativity.

[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.060]
It's great, but I like that.

[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.700]
The margins are great.

[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.280]
The margins are great of marketing.

[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.020]
Especially the children's one $1.50,

[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.940]
then your kid's duty are a couple times for a buck.

[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.700]
Send them through their 20 or 30 times.

[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.540]
They'll never know the difference.

[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.160]
There's a whole bunch of punk kids going in there.

[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.800]
They'll never remember.

[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.180]
Send them to the different turn styles.

[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.300]
They know Thursdays will have time for the picnic area.

[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.660]
Like when Larry King used to go to the window at the track

[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.020]
and get a fistful of tickets and the stiffed teller

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.860]
and I'll be right back and then he'd go to another window

[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.960]
on another floor and do the same thing all over the track.

[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.520]
Really?

[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.880]
Yes, stiffed the tellers.

[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.480]
Wow.

[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.160]
And never paid him back, by the way.

[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.680]
But also the picnic area.

[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.340]
That's why his hair is falling out in clumps.

[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.620]
The picnic area is the last Thursdays, the last time.

[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.460]
You're going to have that.

[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.060]
Yeah.

[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.640]
You're taking a whole thing down.

[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.560]
Just going to have seats there.

[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.620]
Why? Because of the football?

[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.260]
Yeah, it must be too much to put up and down again.

[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.640]
Yeah.

[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.100]
So they're taking it completely.

[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.760]
Well, football, I'm getting ready now.

[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.720]
I'm getting in the mood.

[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.600]
You know, I love my baseball.

[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.120]
I love the Marlins, but I'm getting ready.

[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.740]
But the pants is, they were there.

[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.180]
They announced them at the Friday night game.

[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.440]
They came out in cars and everything.

[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.320]
Yeah, I read about that.

[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.320]
It said that they had, they were lined up 25, 30 deep

[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.920]
and that they were.

[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.880]
The players were just in awe of how many people

[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.320]
were they were going to get their autographs and shake their thing.

[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.100]
That was something.

[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.520]
Yeah.

[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.520]
I got promoting.

[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.320]
Okay, Neil.

[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.040]
Have a great day.

[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.340]
Open line and day one and Broward is we're trying desperately

[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.560]
to build a little goddamn momentum here on a faltering radio station.

[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.820]
It's like on its death nail.

[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.560]
You can hear it gasping.

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.480]
But of course, the fact that he had the guy with the eyes on yesterday.

[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.600]
What does that tell you?

[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.540]
Does that tell you everything you need to know about what Gary Bruce is doing to us?

[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.580]
I want to go on record.

[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.080]
It's the 9th of August, 1993.

[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.280]
At 11.12 a.m. going on record to sing that boy Gary is like,

[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.500]
he and that Damianya guy.

[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.400]
I think they ought to send him both of the same place together.

[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.980]
Send him both to play a game of classic concentration with Alex Trebek.

[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.980]
It's 11.13 on the IOD Network.

[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.360]
Is it done or a league?

[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.340]
Or does it involve your behind?

[00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.600]
No, God.

[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.900]
1022 on the IOD Network.

[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.460]
You stock radio 610.

[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.200]
W-I-O-D.

[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:06.900]
We're here at Austin.

[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.680]
Is it done or a league?

[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.500]
Or does it involve your behind?

[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.120]
No, God.

[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.820]
The thermon thinks that only gays do this.

[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.040]
Most states have laws.

[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.420]
You could be jailed or they are fine.

[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.960]
The Senate now must pick which orifice.

[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.500]
Oh, side of me.

[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.960]
Peter Paltful covers right.

[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.620]
Send it me.

[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.320]
Oh, side of me.

[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.060]
The front door goes back side.

[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.380]
Just go and ask that Kennedy.

[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.120]
He's long as my base is in the Senate.

[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.420]
You will have a seat.

[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.380]
People without health care.

[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.180]
Folks lacking livelihood.

[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.140]
The way they act is really what is loo.

[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.420]
Boy.

[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.780]
Well, there's Helms, the model specter.

[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.200]
And Horn, if our pack would.

[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:37.720]
No matter where you stick it, we get screwed.

[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.280]
Look out of me.

[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.000]
The Senate's lost its mind.

[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.680]
There's stronger drugs than crime.

[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.240]
God knows.

[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.640]
Look out of me.

[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.400]
There's maybe no maintain.

[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.460]
With careings on the ratio.

[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:13.900]
Neal.

[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:14.420]
God.

[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.200]
Isn't that what they say at Mass?

[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:18.800]
Neal.

[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:19.620]
God.

[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.320]
It's a 1030 at WIOD.

[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.320]
And let's do, oh, look at that.

[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.720]
Speaking of kneeling, here's Ian.

[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.820]
Side and knee.

[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:28.720]
Classic.

[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.140]
How you doing?

[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:30.780]
Hel stars.

[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.620]
Don't arch your back.

[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.240]
Whatever you're doing.

[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.480]
It'll be band and Boston.

[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.300]
That's number one.

[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.280]
It's number one with 75 bullets.

[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.160]
And it's because I had the balls to play it.

[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.820]
And find out the part that personally offended boy, the Bruce Geary, who thought that we were going to lose our license.

[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.100]
Because somebody talked about the fallen archers or something.

[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.080]
Neal, you are the king.

[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.000]
You are so popular.

[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.380]
Let me tell you the king and the queen and the prince and the princess and the pauper.

[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.240]
Let me tell you a quick story last night, Krovenar and CJ's, right?

[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.080]
Yeah, doing what?

[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.740]
Do you know?

[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.100]
It's cool to be a knight.

[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:57.540]
Yeah.

[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.560]
Keep beer at your door.

[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.520]
Get him a little tipsy.

[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.120]
That way.

[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.380]
Easy, easy, that way.

[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:02.640]

[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.640]
Easy, easy, that way.

[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:03.840]
God.

[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.920]
Well, one of us said like, Neil, God, you know.

[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.940]
Some other team overheard us.

[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.100]
It was all nearly.

[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.920]
You guys big into baseball because a lot of people in the audience have been wondering like, who's the pitcher and who's the catcher in your relationship?

[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:15.420]
Go ahead.

[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.200]
I kind of throw.

[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:16.940]
Oh.

[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.160]
You know, right?

[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.560]
But the point being that this other team was sort of talking.

[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.860]
And it was like the whole night everyone was talking about you.

[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.500]
Really?

[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.040]
I mean, you are.

[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.420]
Everyone's like, oh, he's a fast.

[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.900]
I'm on the tip of everyone's tongue.

[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.080]
Make no mistake about that.

[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.320]
He's a classic.

[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.220]
Oh, God.

[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.260]
A popular guy in town.

[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:31.720]
Yeah, right.

[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.800]
And also you were saying someone dresses the Pope.

[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.460]
He has a personal male valet, valet.

[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.280]
Hey, he has valet porking.

[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.080]
That's cool.

[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.420]
Uh-huh.

[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:41.740]
Yeah.

[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.400]
Oh, even I like that.

[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.880]
Hey, so to speak.

[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.480]
Hey.

[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.820]
Yeah, that was good.

[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.240]
Hey.

[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.980]
I mean, can you believe we got like a whole section in USA today to find out what's underneath

[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.860]
the dress?

[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.080]
I mean, let's get cereal, man.

[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.060]
He's an old wrinkled up old man.

[00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.200]
What the hell are they expecting?

[00:11:59.540 --> 00:11:59.960]
I don't know.

[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.320]
I'd rather not even see it.

[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:01.640]
Oh.

[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.800]
Hey, how's your car doing?

[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.200]
By the way, Paradise Beach is on right now on Channel 39.

[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.920]
Oh, that's that.

[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.740]
I should never say this because we're off to a pretty amazing start today, but, boy.

[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.720]
That's that Australian show.

[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.140]
That is the way it showed down under.

[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.120]
You watch that.

[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.680]
And you're doing a lot of surfing with arched bags, by the way.

[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.460]
Oh, God.

[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.120]
Look at that.

[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.660]
Oh, that's good.

[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.580]
I have to flick it on.

[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.900]
Yeah, and the show too.

[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.000]
Hey, speak of that idiot red and stimpy, but do you ever watch Beavis and Budhead?

[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:25.680]
No, I do not.

[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.080]
I don't watch MTV.

[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.640]
Oh, that's kind of funny, though.

[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.620]
I don't watch MTV.

[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:30.320]
Okay.

[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.400]
I'm an old, daughtering man.

[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.740]
I'm not interested in MTV unless they got some hot naked stuff on there.

[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.620]
Well, I'm not into cartoons.

[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.200]
I'm not into silly little geeky characters.

[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.160]
Leave that for such.

[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.380]
Neil, are we going to sign Home Freeze now because Craven's doing great?

[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.260]
I sure hope not.

[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.360]
I hope not, too.

[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.400]
I almost forgot about that.

[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.520]
I tried to put it on my mind.

[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.480]
I don't think Craven looks.

[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:48.880]

[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:48.900]
Yeah.

[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:49.460]
You know?

[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.200]
Well, you have a great day, Neil.

[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:52.800]
Okay.

[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:53.600]
And out.

[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.920]
Get Calvin a big kiss for America.

[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.600]
I will.

[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.040]
Okay.

[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.440]
Thanks a lot.

[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.240]
And don't hurt your back.

[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:57.720]
Bye.

[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.500]
We have an open line in Broward, 5249463.

[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.040]
Isn't this the same one we saw yesterday?

[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.400]
Are these just the same two geeks?

[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.040]
Because yesterday on this show, they were like getting out of the shower of these two together.

[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.840]
And the one over there, the blonde, who looks real like a sweetheart, kept dropping the soap.

[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.440]
Here's Tampa.

[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:14.940]
Hello.

[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.020]
Hello.

[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:16.840]
Hi, Neil.

[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:17.260]
How are you?

[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:17.740]
Okay.

[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.220]
I live over here now.

[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.540]
I used to live here on Hollywood.

[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.820]
I wonder if you could recommend a Jewish bakery for some regular law.

[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.260]
I can't find any good regular up here.

[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.380]
Any good what?

[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.940]
It's a Jewish pastry with a...

[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.660]
What do you mean Jewish pastry?

[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.200]
What did...

[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.120]
Obviously, you know nothing about Jewish pastry.

[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:38.500]
I know.

[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.500]
My go is your friend.

[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:39.940]
I know.

[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.020]
You mean, Rogalof?

[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:41.620]
Yes.

[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:42.960]
Say it.

[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.020]
Rogalof.

[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.080]
Rogalof.

[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:45.980]
Rogalof.

[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.320]
Rogalof.

[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.480]
Rogalof.

[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.040]
Rogalof.

[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.900]
How about what's his name's Adele?

[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.180]
What's his name?

[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:54.740]
What's his name?

[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:54.860]
He's Adele.

[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.000]
There on Dale Maybey, where we did the appearance at time.

[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.920]
They've got great stuff.

[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.320]
Oh, the best Rogalof.

[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:00.800]
Rogalof.

[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.460]
Thank you very much.

[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:01.900]
Thank you very much.

[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:02.140]
Thank you.

[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.360]
Just say hi to our friend Mike Schwartz.

[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.140]
Mike Schwartz.

[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.240]
Thank you, Joe.

[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:06.980]
That's his name.

[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.140]
It may be funny to you.

[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:08.920]
That's his name.

[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:09.920]
What is his name?

[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.260]
Michael Schwartz.

[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.080]
Schwartz.

[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:13.840]
See it?

[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:14.940]
Oh, man.

[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.300]
So many goyam on a west coast.

[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.240]
We have an open line on the green line.

[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:18.760]
No, seriously.

[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.780]
I mean, just infested with goyam over there.

[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.080]
1-800-944-9463.

[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.560]
Here's a pompe-no.

[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:24.820]
Hello.

[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.480]
Pompano.

[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.120]
They're sitting there and they're listening to their thing.

[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.020]
That's impossible.

[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.460]
Pompano.

[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:32.840]
Yeah.

[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.140]
Wait a minute.

[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:34.940]
Hello.

[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:35.860]
Hello.

[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:36.600]
Yes.

[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.060]
Hi.

[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:37.940]
What's going on?

[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.620]
Hi, how are you doing?

[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.240]
I'm doing good.

[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:39.820]
I'm doing good.

[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.220]
I'm doing good.

[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:40.720]
I'm doing good.

[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:41.400]

[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.000]
I'm doing good.

[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.060]

[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.060]

[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.380]
Okay.

[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.320]
You know how this is?

[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.320]
Of course you don't.

[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.380]
This is a member.

[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.380]
I'm a Swap Shop person.

[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.200]
I call you sometimes.

[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.940]
And then you think about it and then you think about it.

[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.100]
The Swap Shop person?

[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:50.460]
Yeah.

[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.080]
Is in Swap What?

[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:52.880]
Swap This.

[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.520]
I'm not there today.

[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.080]
I'm at the festival today.

[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.540]
Thank God.

[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.320]
I'm out of that hall.

[00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:57.980]
Okay.

[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:58.700]
Good for you.

[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.040]
For a day, we've got to talk.

[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.540]
Oh, after about a half hour, the smell of that elephant shot just gets to you.

[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:03.900]
Oh.

[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.020]
Between the sawdust and the gigantic mounds of elephant dropping.

[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.700]
That place is just the poison.

[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.280]
It's hurting.

[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.000]
It's the worst.

[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.040]
Oh, wait.

[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.180]
Let me just say a high-end idea because he got very impatient.

[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:14.700]
He laughed.

[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.760]
And I told him to stay and say something to you.

[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.700]
But he got like not so.

[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.540]
Well, the hell is that?

[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.280]
What's he got?

[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.820]
A full-rich, busy life that he can't do.

[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.460]
He's very busy.

[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.340]
I think he's going to be.

[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.120]
Oh, great.

[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.860]
So, anyways, I was going to come out last night and see you.

[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:26.500]
And?

[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.080]
At the people.

[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.160]
We had an okay turn out.

[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.060]
It wasn't spectacular.

[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.460]
It was all right.

[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.480]
Jeff was hoping to have lined up all the way to Alapado, but it just didn't work out that way.

[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:35.860]
Yeah.

[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.480]
Well, I was thinking about those tickers and then you had the snapple.

[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.060]
Right?

[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:39.560]
That's right.

[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.820]
We had a two-for-one snapple.

[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.140]
We had my dolphin tickets and the great food.

[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.280]
A good time was had by all.

[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.440]
Yeah, I was talking about you know what?

[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:45.960]
We went out to the Marlinga.

[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.460]
A lot of the waiters by the way up there.

[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:47.680]
Really?

[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.100]
We went out to the Marlinga.

[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:49.900]
Yeah.

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.640]
It was fantastic.

[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.620]
I am exhausted.

[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.600]
Fifteen minutes.

[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.120]
And we do it again, man.

[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.700]
It's just going to be like a habit now.

[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.340]
It's just sparpling.

[00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.020]
That Bob Natal, or whatever is Neo Natal, is a hell of a guy.

[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.220]
And when they put him in there, we're everybody's going, oh my God, forget about it.

[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:03.920]
We're never going to win.

[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.180]
He's not so bad.

[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.160]
Yeah, he was good.

[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.500]
He was better than Benito.

[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.680]
But the game was good.

[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.340]
It was sparpling.

[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.560]
The weather was perfect.

[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.480]
The pitching was absolutely just amazing.

[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.820]
Yeah, but haven't you been reading Benito's happy with his performance?

[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.700]
He thinks he's good.

[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.840]
Yeah, I read that yesterday.

[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:19.640]
I don't know about that.

[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.460]
He got that neat earring.

[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.460]
We should all be happy.

[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.920]
No, you know, ever since they traded me eggs, it's been like, you know, I mean, they've been playing great the last four out of five.

[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.160]
They disturbed the chemistry of the ball club.

[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.380]
It just isn't going to be the same.

[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.520]
It's one of those intangible.

[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.200]
You can't put your finger on it.

[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.060]
But it's like the flow.

[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.320]
And it's like a psychological thing.

[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.500]
In fact, that's what Mark Ray told the Melrose Place lady.

[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.480]
You can't quite put your finger on it, but there's something amiss.

[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.920]
They said in our test easy lattice now and again, what we want it was a great game.

[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.300]
I always see like one for seven last night, something like that.

[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.860]
Yeah, he had a lot of opportunities to like be here.

[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.040]
He just didn't come through.

[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.240]
Yeah, I just thought, I got to tell you that story you told yesterday morning, with the state rich with the ribbon.

[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.300]
That's a true story.

[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.180]
I was paying in my pants.

[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:57.560]
Yeah.

[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.020]
Literally, I was just about paying in my pants, too, as the car was rolling forward there.

[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.800]
And here's this big 700 pound hulk trying to huffing and puffing, trying to keep up with the car.

[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.420]
And falling down in his glasses, they're flying and he's like, man, a second away from a stroke.

[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.880]
I was hysterical.

[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.960]
I was people were looking me.

[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:13.820]
I was listening to this.

[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.220]
And they were looking me and I was laughing out loud.

[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.620]
And I was like, how many somebody would I have a camcorder man?

[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.700]
If we had that on video, I could retire right now.

[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.920]
We could make billions for that.

[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:22.760]
It was a riot.

[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.420]
It really was.

[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.800]
I was trying to tell my husband a story, but I didn't do it, Justice.

[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.720]
I mean, he had to hear you, you know, hear you to open, by the way, hi, babe.

[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.000]
I'm always listening.

[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:30.500]
Okay.

[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.860]
All right, listen, you take care.

[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.560]
Have a great one.

[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:32.820]
Hang in.

[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.120]
Yeah, I'm going to try and get through to Stan.

[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.540]
I'm exhausted.

[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.080]
Okay.

[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.040]
All right, take care.

[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:36.300]
Bye.

[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.340]
Open line and Broward, 5249463.

[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.700]
I gave Ron and Ron one final shot again today.

[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.880]
I'm going to tell you why I figured out what the thing is.

[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.960]
The one guy is that Ron D.S. who sounds like Howard.

[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.080]
He's got a voice very much.

[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.020]
He, you talk about try to rip off Howard.

[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.320]
He's, he's got voice sounds very similar.

[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.460]
And if he listen to his phrasing, he's obviously been listening to hundreds of hours of Howard's turn tapes.

[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.480]
And so the sound is the same, but there's no material.

[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.460]
That's the difference.

[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.560]
No material.

[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.100]
And they're like desperately trying to be like the blue humor.

[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:11.420]
If you put your unit on the facts machine and send out facts of your unit, and does that make you gay?

[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.760]
But none of it is funny.

[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.820]
I mean, call after call.

[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.340]
I'll say this.

[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.560]
They're getting calls like from actual living and breathing people, but there's no material.

[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.680]
I mean, anywhere and none.

[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.640]
Zero zippity doodah.

[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.520]
But they're better than Don and Mike.

[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.680]
Oh, God.

[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.820]
Don and Mike, who I do in this freak show I heard last night, and they can't get any freaks.

[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.700]
It's like they're, they have all these different bits, but none of them ever happened.

[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.560]
And they did their phone booth challenge and they like were ringing phones.

[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.440]
And I thought they were running Jacksonville, Florida.

[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.160]
It's Jacksonville, North Carolina.

[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.180]
And I'm at birth to be on and for Myers.

[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.920]
Jacksonville, North Carolina population seven.

[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.440]
And they're like ringing these pay phones over and over.

[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.520]
And this goes on and on.

[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.180]
And finally they get some guy who obviously drove over because they tell you where the phone booth is.

[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.240]
And he drove over to, hey, Don and Mike, alright, we did it.

[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.660]
Yeah, they're doing it.

[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.900]
A 1038 on the IOD network.

[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:07.500]
If you're doing it, if you're losing your hair like in big clumps, if you got an embarrassing bald spot, Charles, Charles, I almost said Chuck again.

[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:08.540]
God, give up Chuck.

[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.620]
Charles Alfiehri is coming to South Florida to help you out.

[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.340]
Come on, you IOD.

[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.480]
Alright, this is Chee Gordon-Liddy and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.

[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.260]
Hi, I'm the lead tuba player in my marching band.

[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.740]
I can't afford to let diarrhea rain on my parade.

[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.060]
That's why I wear the pad.

[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.660]
Yes, when you're under a lot of pressure.

[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.880]
Forget foul tasting liquid detergments.

[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.340]
You need diarrhea relief that shuts off your worries fast.

[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.000]
You need the new diarrhea patch.

[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.420]
It combines advanced medical technology with a big dab of crazy glue.

[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.600]
Since I started wearing the diarrhea patch, I feel so confident.

[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.540]
Nothing can stop me now.

[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.420]
Oh no.

[00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:00.200]
And look for the new extra adhesive patch in the blubbing section of your drug store.

[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.340]
1043 at WIOD.

[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.720]
I was looking for the cart, the world's new biggest asshole.

[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.780]
I can't find the cart because I definitely wanted to dedicate it to Sam Itas or maybe Rick Alpurn.

[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.080]
I'm not sure which one really deserves it because after Rick Alpurn, let me just give you a little background.

[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.080]
Without being too specific because I obviously can't do it now.

[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:26.640]
But just before I went on vacation, somebody called and was talking about how it's my responsibility if I endorse products.

[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.920]
I had to check them out and this guy was very unhappy and obviously got ripped off.

[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.520]
And then we had some other calls and we didn't mention who it was on the ear.

[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.220]
But you know, we checked it out and there were some problems there.

[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.980]
And we obviously are not going to be endorsing those people anymore.

[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.600]
And we're helping those people try to get their money back and getting involved in it.

[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.340]
Because it's something called credibility which most of our salespeople don't understand and especially Sam Itas.

[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.940]
So Sam Itas had the ball so I don't ever want to see that man.

[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.620]
I don't want him in here when I'm in this studio or in the building.

[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:07.260]
Like in Godfather was in two or one and two when Michael says I don't want to be there when Fredo, I want a days notice when he's going to be there visiting our mother because I don't want to be in the house.

[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.220]
Same thing, I don't want to be in a building when Sam Itas is here.

[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.100]
And he was in here pitching some day.

[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.340]
I don't want to say what it was.

[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.920]
And I said, forget it.

[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.980]
These people are like the worst. They're like a shun. They're this grace.

[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:20.820]
I won't do it.

[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.140]
Rick Raleigh comes to me the other day.

[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.220]
Says, what do you know about Yatatai?

[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.580]
I said, I'll forget it.

[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.300]
Don't touch him with a 10 foot pole.

[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:37.800]
And Rick Alperen, our salesman, I thought his credit had checked into this thing and finds out, yes, you're right Neil.

[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.960]
It's the same shysters from and so fine.

[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.140]
Sam Itas comes in here this morning and says to me, well, what do you know about Yatatai?

[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.140]
I says, forget it.

[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.540]
And I've given chapter in verse what the problem is.

[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.780]
These people should not be allowed to promote their petal or crap.

[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.680]
And then he says, well, you know, they're out running a schedule.

[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:59.500]
Now, here's the sales manager after he knows that these are rip off artists.

[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.900]
Here's the sales exec whole Sam Itas.

[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.960]
And they don't care. They still go ahead and put them on here.

[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.860]
That's the thing that I just, I can't, it's unconscionable.

[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.760]
Are we that desperate for a few bucks and I'm talking about just a few bucks it's going to be?

[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.480]
Are we that desperate and is that like super servicing our audience to do that?

[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.400]
I think not.

[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.640]
Sam Itas and Rick Alpo.

[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.700]
Shame on you.

[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:20.900]
Shame on you.

[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:21.800]
Grave robbers.

[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.700]
Here's the lady in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:24.980]
Hello.

[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.180]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:26.480]
Great.

[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.380]
I just wanted to call you. I'm from Atlanta.

[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.640]
And down here I'm business for like six weeks and I've been listening to your show and you're trying to have that.

[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.000]
You don't listen to the WSB do you?

[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:33.480]
Absolutely.

[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.940]
Oh, is that a boring?

[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.680]
All the stations there are neo-Nazi. They're horrible.

[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.780]
That WSB is so boring, man. It could put you into a coma.

[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.540]
It's really, really boring. You're right.

[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.960]
They're so low key. I think that they were broadcasting the entry.

[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.660]
I know. And then the other station, their competitor is like neo-Nazi big time.

[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:49.780]
All right, wingers.

[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:50.460]
Yes.

[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.580]
They're horrible.

[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.060]
But I just wanted to call and say that I'm like categorized, elliptic, lesbian.

[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.140]
And I can't believe that you're gay and on the radio down here because in Atlanta you'd be like run out of sound on you.

[00:22:59.140 --> 00:22:59.600]
Oh, yeah.

[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.220]
Yeah.

[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.560]
They're like so pitiful there.

[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.160]
It's disgusting.

[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.240]
Believe me, they got plenty of closet people up there.

[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.040]
Absolutely. They got everywhere.

[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.240]
But they just would never get on radio.

[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.900]
Even John moved into Buckhead and they said, hey, you got a lot of money. We don't care. Bring it in here.

[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.080]
I mean, they let him come in, but I did a show on the competitive station to your cops.

[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.380]
Well, what is that? RNG?

[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.460]
No, that's W-A-G-S-T.

[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.360]
Oh, G-S-T, right?

[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.120]
Yeah. And they did a show where I got on there for three hours.

[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.900]
Now that's not that love-low on the porches.

[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.560]
No, no, no, no. He's not even anywhere. He's not local anymore.

[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.980]
He's national. He can believe that.

[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.400]
Yeah. They brought that Neil Boards back to be standing for boring on an SP.

[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.440]
That's exactly right. They took him from G-S-T.

[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:34.980]
Terminal.

[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.320]
It's terrible, but they had me on for three hours just so they could ask me questions without being gay.

[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.540]
That's how much these people know.

[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.540]
They wouldn't even do these people or disclose.

[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.020]
Like I said, they spent too much time up there in the woods with Ned Vady and Entry.

[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.080]
I think that was their problem.

[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.600]
Up in North Shore, Dumounting.

[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.760]
Yeah. That's about it.

[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.280]
They're doing it. Well, have a great time.

[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:51.860]
Thank you.

[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.280]
Bye-bye.

[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.040]
Okay. A Liz Bean from Atlanta. How do you like that?

[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.080]
How do you like them, apples?

[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.120]
Maybe Randy would like to have her on the show.

[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.380]
We have an open line. It's on the blue line.

[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.880]
5249463 and Broward. It's 1048 on the IOD Network.
