Oshan provocateur but uh he sat right in between us so i

[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.620]
wasn't even sitting by Bob and in addition to which i wasn't

[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.660]
sitting by him at dinner at Donatello's he was sitting

[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.000]
like uh do you think that's the one second

[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.300]

[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.620]
ear and say that i sucked up to him for what what is he

[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.380]

[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.760]
anybody say that it makes no sense nothing he says makes any sense

[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.840]
like he don't make any sense

[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.260]
his fla knows pickers that he's like the glue of

[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.320]
radio the big fat will in the small part

[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.160]
is the big fat way of his and market

[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.240]
because he knows he can't make it here he can't cut

[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.060]
the mustard here that we would never even consider him in a

[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.140]
major market doing anything

[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.660]
what i think that's it that they know that

[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.300]
he presents you for your success he resents me

[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.280]

[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.320]
and the dogs are listening oh really is that what you do now well because you

[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.280]

[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.140]
jab at the hockey game that she's looking like this

[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.100]
like that Neil she was beautiful at that time i

[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.060]
weighed 30 pounds more than i would have the broad of the hockey game last

[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.360]
time you weren't there is wife who's like a big fan of ours i

[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.080]
were cats from base side from the marketing department i hate everybody named cats

[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.240]
by the way yeah yeah so anyway she kept to give me these ugly looks and then he comes over to boy

[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.780]
curtain turns out that he's a big fan and like a buddy buddy with curts that should explain some of it

[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.280]
so we're going to watch some of your video after we watch the rain he's going to continue to be

[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.140]
here just out of spite in fact you said that just to piss Bob and carol she's going to work for nothing

[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.160]
she'll work for free forever just to agonize them and of course get him more material

[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.260]
now i heard him a couple of nights ago and it was the most scathing the most uncalled for the most bush

[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.420]
league the most outrageous and then when you're sitting you talk to somebody like i was talking to you

[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.360]
on the phone yesterday and if you would have come on the air and repeated a conversation i mean it's you just don't

[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.240]
do that it's just common sense if you have even a minute degree of professionalism or integrity which Bob lacks both

[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.440]
exactly you know you you called me back after i spoke to you and you said please don't mention this thing

[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.180]
right right you i go what are you out of your mind like anything that you and i would have nothing

[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.040]
nothing to do with anything that was just like a little time to do with anything exactly but like i would have

[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.660]
a repeat anything that you ever said to me in confidence and like you actually told him any of these things that he said

[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:07.900]
because none of it was based in reality Bob is not based in reality car is you know suckling something really seriously wrong

[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.900]
with a hearing the charges into carat too that's serious that he is not stop with this ridiculous

[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:19.860]
he will not admit it to you but i can assure you as sure as i'm sitting here that he's like got fantasies

[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:26.340]
about her he is obsessed with that fit you know it's a fat part who know did you see her husband by the way

[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:32.800]
but did you see her husband i can't even believe she's married to anything well not to anything to something

[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.080]
why he's good or really

[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.200]
i don't want to talk about what do you don't i love dogs don't insult the she is the most heinous person

[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.420]
i have here's a girl who they take out of the stupid little news room and they say okay here a little cheeky

[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:56.520]
we're going to give you like something to do you get to clean up after Bob and all of a sudden her ego gets to be like the size of

[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:02.460]
Texas she's out of control and she's sitting there trashing me like she's got something some right plus you got to realize how

[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:08.480]

[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.980]
okay let's take a caller to because somebody listening might know who you are

[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.880]
serisota hi there good morning that's her good afternoon or everything i thought it was when i started it

[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.420]
well i got my tongue out of that again after one beauty let's say you've had a chance at it

[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.480]
yeah anybody calling on this article i come that over here lawman get the bottom of case

[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.040]
now run it by me again it's about this lady who's been moonin the railroad engineers over here

[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.300]
moonin it yeah i'll be very re-fonded it's it's it's priceless two undercover palmetto detectives were on a mission to preserve

[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.240]
the community's moral order for several days it seems to see x railroad engineer and accrued found themselves

[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.000]
repeatedly insulted by a woman who ran from the back of the wild turkey bar and mooned them

[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.280]
she would stand eight feet from the tracks a few hundred yards from downtown on the main street

[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.500]
and bear her behind it irritated the railroad workers they sought police help now get this the detectives

[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.040]
decided to launch a stakeout they don't all t-shirts and jeans and stood look out on the slow moving cargo

[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:24.980]
when they reached eight and you and you're the horn and the and the sure enough woman appeared

[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:31.260]
she said she walked to the track pause turned around pulled her pants down then they said she bent over

[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.440]
and expected her rust colored cowboy boots and wag her buttocks at the train

[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.380]
oh she was wagoning beautiful the detectives jumped from the train made the capture

[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:46.800]
okay they placed the suspect in jail now then the guys at the bar they're all mad so what do they do they all get together and they bail her out

[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:53.080]
it was entrapment said a man with a pool cue the guy on the train honked the horn twenty times because he wanted her to do it again

[00:12:53.080 --> 00:13:00.300]
the deadensins of the bar took up a collection bailed her out I didn't do anything wrong she said later holding a pink drink we were having fun

[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.440]
and if the guys were mad because the coppers all arrested her now what was this this is empaume auto

[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.500]
oh and pal matter well we know what would they do there

[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.120]
they're three with each other making some troops

[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:15.400]
right the coppers go on to say that they're mad because they're wasting taxpayers money doing this

[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:22.720]
but the sergeants said the department had received a similar complaint and they knew who she was because they recognized her face

[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.200]
yeah they recognized her whatty cheeks

[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:33.160]
but the bar patrons didn't care later in the day in fact another woman at the wild turkey ran out to the railroad tracks rolled down her pants and screamed arrest me

[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:40.840]
i thought that was price that's beautiful i would have i would have a price list and probably got a price tag i don't like everything else

[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.680]
i want to ask you something is the call to trophy trophy that they give for the most valuable player

[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.800]
kind of all kinds of lies and stories this man who was stolen every idea every piece of material that i ever had

[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.000]
and done it poorly by the way very poorly

[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.240]
and so glad you finally seen the light on him because

[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:03.200]

[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:18.000]
what he said he's my friend well that's what i said to you i said i know this guy's your friend and you didn't correct me then and then you said

[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.860]
the last hour from over there and they considered for about twenty seconds and they said we don't think that's going to happen
