[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.240]
phony that's what bothers me about top with it all get out of here i remember

[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.500]
years ago he had on his old show he had Madeline Marie oh here's a

[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.540]
renegade son the one that found god all of a sudden he had that son on the

[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.500]
ear and he says to him after this uh... conversation about this and the old

[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.920]

[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.600]
that knows times there tells me is a flaming eighthiest just like i am all the

[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.960]
rest of your go is a phony see i don't go for that he's wrong

[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.660]
it's one thing for it to do show business but another thing to come out like

[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.380]
that it's that it would be like you coming on and saying you knew a straight

[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.020]
priest

[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.620]
yeah yeah i have a straight priest yeah right exactly i believe that

[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.320]
okay let me i choose we got to keep doing breaks here which is good it's food

[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.360]
breaks because in order to main just to maintain that weight can you imagine

[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.440]
no seriously i want everybody to stop and imagine how much food somebody has to eat

[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.880]
to maintain the kind of weight that this man is building and expand on it

[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.880]
because you are expanding rapidly but twelve thousand calories just to maintain

[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.460]
right and so there's like about twenty thousand there so by the time you get to the

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.740]
ballpark now how many seats did you have to buy huh how many how many rows did you

[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.200]
have to buy to sit your fat ass down there at your lobby stadium they're going to have to

[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.200]
drop this man down in a crane this is the only man who will attend the opening day in

[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.620]
a marlin's three drop from a crane so when you see this gigantic thing being lowered

[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.420]
into its seats you'll know it's the famous ale and be dropping free screw magazines out for everybody

[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.060]
unbelievable peaches good for the way it is have another piece eleven twenty three on the iod

[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.060]
network if you have to miss any of today's show live from ten to two remember you can join me

[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.360]
for the best of the elegant tonight from six till eight on news talk radio six twenty w s u n

[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.420]
this is news talk radio six twenty w s u n eleven twenty seven you want to repeat the conversation

[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.240]
we just had to break and no let's not no but i know what you're talking about the food of the

[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.420]
stadium i'm talking about the one we just had here about people thinking about love that yeah

[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.880]
haha

[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.660]
oh god this out he's always thinking about eating something this man i'll tell you oh god yeah

[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.900]
so anyway al is going out to jurebby stadium you've never been there before never been there and

[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.180]
and i'll you said they have great hot fudge sundays if if now somebody's going to have to call

[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.980]
george's uh... somebody who because we got a couple of lines are because they're getting uh

[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.500]
pissed off but but seriously somebody will call in and let us know if the marlins are going to have

[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.060]
the same concession stuff that they had for the dolphins uh... for the marlins i would assume so

[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.060]
huh because i think those places by their way in to the stadium no matter what the event is going

[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.600]
on there so anyway they do have carbell stands in there and you can get a hot fudge sunday with

[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.400]
not just a regular hot fudge sunday on chocolate ice cream of course not on vanilla because chocolate

[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.960]
is much richer and much more calories but with cherries and strawberries and like strawberry sauce

[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.300]
on top of the hot fudge and if that is at least five thousand calories well but i need that

[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.940]
so you need that first because that's end your blood sugar it elevates into at least a thousand

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.180]
and then after that nothing will make any of the point is a seven-tening stretch when i want to do

[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.420]
some exercise i have the main day the caloric intake um in fact that is my exercise i want to have

[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.080]
a tape called seven-tening stretch and that'll be the extent because most exercise takes too much time

[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.860]
and there's too much sweat too much expenditure so if you just do seven-tening exercises i could do

[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.660]
the chop yeah i could handle the chop here you can go from your ear look at the very very good shape

[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.940]
from the elbow forward you're an excellent shape if i bow to the fingertips well i pull my stomach in

[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.720]
let go it's it's it's a wave you would be great in fact let's fire dolphin denny's ass and make

[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.720]
out the new mascot for the dolphins this time i don't need an outfit god almighty you could just

[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.060]
bounce your ass out around i'd feel like uh incredible maybe in fact the heat off

yeah how many rabbis pedophiles very few right be becose they're not celibate

[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.960]

[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.420]
to fill in and the tallest knowledge stuff gets in a way and they can't they can't uh

[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.700]

how can you have that sex i think you are um jay alasde especially on Passover

[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.720]
a great stereotype for Jews because Jews traditionally have been much that's why there are so

[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.980]
few Jews in the world because they were never big on reproduction like catholics yeah

[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.480]
because uh or especially like the reandals look at them for crime they're almost all skinny and

[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.340]
they're like a billion of them because they're big on reproduction Jews it was like a mandatory

[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.040]
thing like just keep the family going and have one one of two kids at the most but eating was much

[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.640]

but the seriously if i lost 25 pounds for me i'd be in great shape okay but the thing is when you get

[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.880]
healthy nothing alarms you evidently because i had a little stroke yeah see that was a warning

[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.120]
i so yeah so i had the thing with the gallbladder i had that out i thought i was dying when they

[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.820]
took that out then i had a gallbladder attacking without the gallbladder i had to go back in the hospital

[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.320]
i've been through a crappy a couple of years and i've finally said to yourself you know like i can

[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.340]
eat this now but i'll compensate later in the day i won't have like a big meal where did i

[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:20.300]
get at night you know shall i know and only on the nights when i go to the track i have something

[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.200]
there i'm trying to cut that way back but other than that on other nights i don't even eat dinner

[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:29.480]
yeah you see i'm not scared you have to cut out you and i the sweet either i love ice cream

[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:35.060]
i mean ice cream is what i obsess over yeah well you never got hooked on now what were those

[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:41.640]
damn things i was eating those uh drumsticks yeah drumsticks did you ever try those with the ice cream

[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.180]
drumsticks yeah oh great i think you went really no drumsticks ice cream drums they just shove

[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.340]
them right in and when you go to the uh the supermarket see when you go to the convenience store it's

[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.200]
no good because you can buy one at a time i used to get them two at a time because between the

[00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:00.040]
convenience store my house was just enough time to eat two in the car with each other yes but if

[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.320]
you go to the supermarket you have to buy them in a box of like a dozen so you can eat 12 and i

[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.880]
would take i would take them home like on a Saturday morning i go to win jixie i'd buy the box of a

[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.680]
and by the end of the weekend they all be gone all of them yeah well that's one of them because

[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.640]
they're different kinds of the ones that have like the caramel cream in a center then there

[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.280]
ones that are like the chocolate on chocolate they're like three different kinds what do you laugh

[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.800]
at them by saying you're getting aroused no i'm not aroused at all you're the one that's getting

[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.120]
aroused you're sweating again you're red in a face and you're sweating again you need to be locked

[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.720]
up somewhere you were right when you said that you need to be locked away i have to be locked up

[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:36.860]
and they just is it a death wish or no no i wish it's it's it's it's it's it's being a two

[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.980]
is that a being a two i swear that's it food all these kind of overcompensating for the famine

[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.860]
that might come to realize in other words if bush would have got elected again you've

[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.720]
still been in good shape right if they sent us to summer camp well i would outlive you go

[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.660]
have an extra hundred pounds right you would die the 19th day i would die the 400th day yeah

[00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:00.720]
feeding with my fat beautiful why don't we have like a naked picture of algal

[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.520]
to be on the front of the next paragraph i'm telling you you'd sell like a hundred times as many

[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.620]
copies it's probably like buy the whole world up with the money you'd get from that so first

[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:15.400]
of therapy the paper would have to be larger yeah well just just make it this way instead of that

[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:21.400]
way just print it horizontal instead of vertical okay let's talk about your favorite binge with food

[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.880]
like how do you know how much this is a slice because i memorized there's no pyrroni the cheese

[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:20.020]
we can tell you the cheese is protein yeah there are a lot of things that are protein that are good for

[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:26.800]
cheeses so what's new on the porno scene now okay i made my first my first porno film four

[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.000]
weeks ago i don't even think oh god it'll be the outgoals in line of sex films you know how

[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.900]
the boring to say that point i'm not in it wait a minute is that a guy or a girl around a

[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.760]
right on Richard Bay is that a guy or is that is this another dyke show oh see is that a guy

[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:48.580]
or a girl it's a guy guy huh it's a guido it's one of those new Jersey guido can i ask you a

[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.280]
question i don't want any new yorkers to be offended but i've said it many times before why is it

[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.260]
not only well there are a lot of Jews in New York but why is it that people from New York are so

[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:04.180]
sexless almost what do you laugh in almost every new yorker that i've met they're cold impersonal

[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:10.420]
they have like sexes like a like a function there is no emotion no passion they'd be good in

[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.020]
at the church because there's no passion so they can't commit any sins there's this very cold

[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:20.420]
thing with new yorkers what is that oh yes oh absolutely no for the yorkers like it's so

[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:25.620]
so sexless so the weather is cold in fact you look on his show Richard Bay any day and once in a

[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.040]
while he brings some yeah she was pretty once in a while he'll have some people look like that

[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.760]
but more often than not see that on the the way forget about her on the stage the the woman

[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.580]
that's on the left the young right there yeah she's typical of what you see they're like new york

[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:46.120]
valley girls well they all live in jersey if you talk about Manhattan girls a lot of them are hot

[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.280]
i don't agree with you i think the ux city is great i'm not knocking new yorker you're talking about

[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.020]
people from the ux city i didn't say the girls you forget who you're talking to i'm just talking

[00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:00.720]
about new yorkers in general okay very sexless it's like Jews who are sexless which is most well

[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.100]
okay but Jews are looking for the next meal did they test it yeah but all the pets on what

[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.340]
you're into eating now i guess that's where it's at can you have sex if the dinner nobody are you

[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.580]
seriously i'm gonna have a line of point of you're not gonna be doing stuff in the marina

[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:18.860]
it starts with the hitchcock thing you know the silhouette of hitchcock and they've hitchlied

[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:24.720]
wide and a full of islands yeah yeah wide angle we had we had we had to have films but it's

[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.960]
hard because you spend twelve thousand dollars for a full-length movie five sex scenes we had to stop

[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.760]
to shoot for two hours because one guy cannot get an erection for two hours is that the one you

[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.800]
will tell me about or yeah it's amazing but the sex film can't be that good there is enough money

[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:47.480]
to do a set and take scripts on important and you'd rather have a pretty 19 year old girl in a

[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.880]
hands of 25 year old guy then somebody who could speak lines right exactly that's that's the genre

[00:18:52.880 --> 00:19:00.940]
so you just accept it right okay getting back to April her spread what are we gonna do about

[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:06.700]
this guy and you got his is he pressing his face with a gun yeah how can you be a press agent

[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:11.940]
for a person really like really you know I got to put him on the air he don't want to talk

[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:18.400]
yeah but I I had lunch with him I love him because he's nice he's absolutely so defibrillating

[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:30.540]
but he doesn't need as much as you do he's a lot he's he grabs my food does that I don't want to

[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:36.960]
it is fighting words no he is nuts the thing with the new post was the most exciting thing I'd

[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.400]
ever seen it would be as if you would take it over this radio there was like it was like he turned

[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.240]
in the air post into screw magazine for two days he would have if he had to had the time yeah

[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.080]
might have increased the circulation well I think that the papers in America should be like the

[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:56.660]
English papers have these page three women will you see breasts why not why not why can't we see boobs

[00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.880]
yeah I think we'll probably double the post circulation yeah I give it a shot you sound like how

[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.720]
it feel now you sound like something out of network no but it's true they'll go for it so for it

[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.980]
you do look center now don't forget I'm looking at you all over the console so I can see you

[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.460]
I don't even know why I'm trying to fill in like around the edges here you're right you have

[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.160]
nothing to do with this is this is just a sham this is just as I'm gonna this is the screw magazine

[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:24.560]
is just the means by which to break in the dough to buy the food that's exactly that's all it is

[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.700]
right because you don't give it crap you're right you're gonna go back a half an hour

[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.840]
and a quick waste of all this time you don't care about sex don't care about sex at all I don't

[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.480]
I care about good stuff cabbage but you don't care about even good food you in other words

[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.520]
any things as long as it has a lot of taste and preferably the higher the fat content and the

[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.200]
higher the salt content the more you like it it should be tasty and the higher the sugar content

[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:52.340]
yeah okay secho on food I had some peaking duck tonight to go it was very fatty I mean I'm

[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.260]
really concerned about food I went to just place the pomp on the market is a place upstairs

[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.260]
insulin doesn't make any difference you'll be taking insulin and they'll have to start chopping

[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:59.440]
your legs off every day you give yourself an injection no I don't take insulin I take uh thank

[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:07.000]
God I take oral medication oral can you relate to that you're a food pig no no I am a food pig

[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.180]
but I was a little bit of control I mean you have no control none none I have never seen a person

[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.900]
in fact I'm trying to think of a parallel like you if it were a cheese he will like me

[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:20.820]
fat riches but he doesn't look as bad as you do I mean he's big he may I don't know how much he

[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:25.760]
weighs but it's like more proportion but you're like the schmoo like I said it's like like uh

[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.980]
your head is like regular size I mean the neck is getting a little uh what do you think about

[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:36.580]
19 now yes yeah 19 so he was probably a 17 before I started at 16 okay I was a content

[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.840]
so your head if you took your head like right from the beard up beautiful perfect put it on the

[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:47.160]
wall somewhere huh onto the bed from the chin down yeah it just keeps getting bigger and bigger

[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.340]
and then around the middle which is the worst to your heart this is where it is it's like this

[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:56.460]
enormous schmoo like thing like I said it's like somebody took a tube and they put a helium

[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.840]
seriously I'm not joking about them like a blow up alcohol sting the walking blow up doll that

[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.840]
would be a good piece for screw everybody should have an algae of the gold thing pressing me so

[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.820]
no because I'm trying to get you what do you need do you ever do you have a mirror in the house

[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.780]
do you keep mirrors it do you do you like Dracula you broke all the mirrors you can't look at them

[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.520]
you have to look at a mirror you have to stand stark naked before this day is over I want you to

[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:26.100]
stand stark naked and look in the mirror but you'll probably have a donut in your hand while you

[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.280]
do it because I know you won't have anything else in your head because you can't find that

[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:35.280]
you're very cruel no I'm not I'm trying to uh to appeal to something but it's obviously not

[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:40.360]
it's gonna why don't you say this you don't care be honest with us you don't care what we can

[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.680]
make some news here we can make breaking news algol sting says for the first time he's gonna

[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.340]
eat himself to death but with a smile why don't you just say that is it's it's true I won't be

[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:54.640]
talking about no I won't do it for spite because I want to outlive all my ex-wives I really do

[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.840]
yeah that's the truth uh I'm gonna be thin within one year I'm gonna be here and you're gonna say

[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:06.320]
how do you do it lead me master I'll be in wake up with with my brethren but

[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.800]
truthfully you're gonna see it all you'll be in wake up yes you're gonna lock yourself in and

[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.280]
wait for pay saw what is that all about here's this far bison of maniac over there they're locked

[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.120]
up they said well when Passover comes then something big's gonna happen over there what is that

[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.240]
all about but you have to keep wanting that there were no Jews the otherwise you'd have pizza

[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.720]
delivery trucks and Chinese delivery trucks no food in in 38 days that's what you think Jeff

[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.120]
Cohen from pizza loft is probably on his way over there right now one of our people anywhere there's

[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:37.140]
a careful audience over look at this you started to choke on it now don't you do you have a tax

[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:44.300]
do you have like coughing attacks fits like a lot yeah but that's oh in and like many seizures

[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.860]
because you had one of those before because I said something during a break you said that

[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:54.660]
whether sweat instead it's a mama cast iron on yeah exactly as I want to start right after I

[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:59.280]
get full at the stadium I want them to have enough food so I'll be there then possibly any of

[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.080]
the concession people is you might want to call for takeout just in case because I know they're

[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.660]
prepared for a huge crowd for opening day they didn't count on you showing up so what would

[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:12.060]
you have there today on it every are you like three hundred peanuts no peanuts and no crap

[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.160]
you got to take them out of the shell to expense too many calories taken out of the shell

[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.580]
it's like exercise yeah any any food like you probably don't eat like crabs because it requires

[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:29.400]
too slow and requires a lot of energy to get in the shell the good shell okay and the three hot

[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:35.240]
dogs three hot dogs what else they have how about the big pretzels with mustard very high like in

great in not being able to be that slim whatever that you're over you're going the other way that

[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.380]
this is what we do this is the real thing in the fact is the frustration level causes you

[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.320]
because you can't in a few days wake up it looked like Peter North or whoever it is you want to

wait now but this man is going in the other direction so he ate four of these

[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.900]
he is busy had three but he had the other one without even knowing it I mean

[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:53.500]

hot-fudge carvel with this with the strawberries and the cherries here's Miami

[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.620]
on the star line hello yeah mister Rogers yes sir this is the weight watcher

[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.060]
addition this morning it's it is all you're talking about a food making me

[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:29.220]
hungry that's where we're at this I wanted to ask you something about the for a

[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.160]
long time we've been here and you read off the ratings and the trends what's a

[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.020]
good thing I didn't look in this bag for these blueberry muffins hmm

[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.260]
yeah you know you already started eating one of those I'm into it I was

[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.760]
a big round one not not that big these are like small I know the ones you're

[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.700]
talking about these are more human I explain to me how the ratings work and

[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:51.300]
the trends because I'm I don't understand the system what do you mean well you

[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.360]
you read off that yeah yeah that uh... uh...

[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.660]
uh... show went from a four point nine to five point three what how does that

[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.540]
work how does what work the trends in the race and out diaries they pick

[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.220]
uh... they they pick names out of a hat and they send them out and they allegedly

[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.660]
have this very scientific way of doing it and people fill them out in the

[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.980]
mail them in if they think about it if not the uh... get lost in the woodwork

[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.200]
and that's supposed to be a scientific methodology and if we talk about it they

[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.380]
list us on page five be the book is saying we're bad guys and they were

[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:21.340]
influencing the audience which is a bunch of crap but uh... what's the

[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.320]
highest is a ten would be your no i think we'll be a hundred hundred percent

[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:29.320]
i see so here of the audience when you're talking about five point nine and

[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.080]
five point nine percent of the audience of the people who are listening at

[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.020]
time right people that were pulled anyway no the people who are listening out of

[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.240]
who are pulled of the in they extrapolated over the entire listening audience

[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.100]
uh... alleged right

[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.240]
real scientific method right

[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.440]
okay just want to see how that work well it's like everything else it's a

[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.380]
pile of crap it's like everything else in life

[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.520]

looking

[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.980]
how

r

[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.380]
the Neil Roger. Wow, you know something? I could eat that whole bag of these. That's

[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:47.120]
a good these are. You want one short? See that's why you're a puny little run. That's

[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:52.220]
why you don't grow up like you ate your wheaties or something by your puny little thing because

[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:57.480]
you don't eat right. These are great. Now I take back everything I said about Al, okay?

[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.680]
He's just a natural guy. He's not trying to resist all these urges. He's just diving

[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:07.740]
into it. Go out of my sorry. I opened up that bag and I guarantee that in the back of my

[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.080]
mind when I opened up the bag it wasn't just to see how big they were or what they were

[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.360]
made of. It was to see if there was something good in there. And God were they ever. I could

[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:21.060]
eat the other four or three whatever's in there but I won't. Now you had. Here's a lady

[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:26.320]
in Miami. Yeah, hi Neil. Hi. I was just wondering what my tent is worth getting tickets today

[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:32.280]
for the game. Because I got my Tiger Jacks and my popcorn and my hot dog. But no. Can I answer

[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:37.920]
your question? Yeah. Unless you want to pay a scop or a hundred bucks a seat outside

[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:44.460]
the ballpark I'd say pretty slim. Really? Yeah. Oh well. Next time. Right. Just turn on your TV

[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:48.560]
and get your Cracker Jacks and popcorn and big pretzels and the 20 or 30 hot dogs and

[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:53.840]
you can enjoy like Al is going to enjoy it. Okay. Big loss. Okay. See you. Open line

[00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:00.600]
and date 751 food. Boy those are good muffins. I wonder where he got those. Huh? Where'd

[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.740]
you get those? Al, baby? Man, those were good. And they weren't the real. I know the ones

[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.100]
the caller is talking about. You know the ones that you get like at the mall. Those enormous

[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:13.280]
that are like for a big meal. Where do you get those? My favorite mother. Oh yeah. My favorite

[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.180]
mother in the F and two of them all. Right, Mike? Wasn't that his name? Mike. And don't

[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.140]
come bother me at the game, Mike. And don't come bother me at the track anymore. Mr.

[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:27.220]
a hot shot. Uh, pop it all flash. Running around probably telling all his pies on

[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:30.260]
the ground. There at the place where he works, which I won't mention on a year this time

[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:36.000]
again. Oh, I really told that son of a man job boy. I told him. Yeah. I mean, where did

[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.120]
you and true to pond my life? Did I discover you or was it the other way around? However

[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.600]
rich insist that you continue to give him those. He'll ritual tell you on the nights

[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.360]
that I'm not going to be there. Okay. I'm sure that's the way they got this covered.

[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.260]
On the nights when I'm not at the track and rich happens to be there. Those are the nights

[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:56.260]
that he comes forth with the good information. Oh, Wollop is going to jog. He's going to pay

[00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:00.420]
$16 and riches up there. He's making hundreds. He's making thousands on the nights when

[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:06.540]
I'm there. He's like giving them stifts. So I won't be there tonight. No chance it might

[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:12.680]
be in the pop it'll park. Rich is going to be there all by himself. Okay. Here's a plantation.

[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:18.240]
Hello. Um, how many food did he eat? What is it? How many food did he eat? How many food

[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:24.880]
did he eat? Let me ask you something. How old are you? I'm already 10. 10. Would you like

[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:30.880]
to make it 11? Yeah. Then don't ever make a call like this again. Punk. We have an

[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:36.160]
open line in day at 751 11 Broward 5249 for how many food did he eat? How many food did

[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.100]
your 10 years old? And that's the way you speak. God help us the human race man. There's

[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.540]
no hope for us at all. No wonder. All is just eating at least it tastes good. At least

[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:48.160]
it's satisfying his immediate urges because I think the guy in what the wacko and wake

[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.260]
him may have a point. This could be it. This could be our last pace off. You know what?

[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:58.860]
So let's just pick out. Expure butter on the monsters tonight guys. Bradenton. Oh, I

[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:05.580]
didn't do the thing. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. Uh, this is your chronic every three weeks.

[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:11.860]
I call you. You're one caller in Bradenton grade. Well, I'm not eating it. I'm not sweating.

[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:16.920]
So can I still be on your show? I guess. I won't give you a whole hour though. You have

[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.300]
to eat a lot and sweat a hell of a lot to get a whole hour on this show like either.

[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:25.300]
I'm not exaggerating. He was sweating so profusely in his face was so red, especially when

[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:30.940]
he started laughing. I was convinced that he was not going to make it through that hour.

[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:37.480]
I mean, he was just barely functioning. I want to wish you a baby chicie puff luck. Oh

[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:44.040]
and likewise back at you Japanese too. Are you serial Japanese you? Yes, I am. Well, how

[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:52.100]
much sushi do you have on pay saw? Unlikely, huh? A Japanese Jew? Yes. Is that by conversion

[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:58.440]
by marriage? No. No. There are Japanese Jews? No. My grandfather was Jewish. My grandmother

[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:04.700]
was French and Japanese. Well, I'll be damned. That's incredible. Well, not really. Well,

[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:14.480]
I'm a brother in Japan. Six? Not a whole lot. Never counted. Never counted, but probably

[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.420]
could have. He had there's a couple hours. I am American. Well, that's great. I wanted

[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:28.460]
to do a ask you is it all right for a straight lady to say Neil God? Oh, yeah. How about

[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:40.580]
in Japanese? Can you do that? Yeah, but I don't think I would. Why not? Let's give it a

[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:46.180]
shot. Come on. We'll make you a star. We'll put it on card. Well, I wanted to put some.

[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:52.840]
You remember when Marilyn Monroe saying happy birthday, president? Right. Mr. President.

[00:46:52.840 --> 00:47:00.760]
Right. Well, I wanted to and actually my religion is a bit more serious to me than putting,

[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:13.060]
you know, well, I can say Neil Hintar. That's it. Tired it up, George. But I wanted to

[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:27.000]
say Neil God. Well, that's great. May I? Go ahead. Neil. God. How's that? Well, it sounds

[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.880]
like Al got the audience sufficiently aroused, even if he wasn't. Have a great day. Hey, I

[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:36.200]
wanted to ask you happy pace. He asked. Was was the hockey game yet named? Was the hockey

[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.980]
team yet named? Yeah, go ahead. We're going to call him Miami. Go ahead. How do you like

[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:45.720]
it? Florida freeze. Florida freeze isn't bad. In fact, Al's probably eating one of those right

[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:50.840]
now and his way to the game. Okay, remember who said it? Okay. Do you have a happy? You too.

[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:56.580]
Bye bye. There's our Japanese you. We have an open line and a green line. 1-809-44-Pesaach

[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:20.000]
toll free 1-800-944-9463. Henry Aaron in the second inning walked and scored.

[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:23.820]
He's sitting on 714.

[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:32.920]
Here's the pitch by Downing swinging. There's a drive into left side of field. That fall is going to be

[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:40.980]
out of here. It's gone. It's 715. There's a new home run champion of all time.

[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:48.480]
And it's Henry Aaron. The fire works are going. Henry Aaron is coming around third. His teammate

[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.420]
is going to take the home plate and listen to this crowd.

[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:07.460]
Two balls, one strike. What's pinching? The runners lead. A lot of Roman right center. If he hits one there,

[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:14.160]
we can dance in the streets. But two runs. Swindle and Greg left there. One run is in. Here comes

[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.120]
Greg. Here's the front of the play.

[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:30.340]
So let me ask you that they win. 1228, we have an open line in day. It's 751. Hang your head

[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:34.860]
skipped. That was unconscionable, even in the moment of excitement. Harry is just frosted.

[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:40.160]
Here's the mobile in Tampa. Hello. How come these buttons are so soft and the same to you?

[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.900]
All right, listen, you and Rick and Scud's got to be doing something right. Everybody calls me from

[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:47.760]
New York to get put on hold because we got you on. Really? Oh, if you have an eye out at the

[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.960]
sky from the national magazine, put me back on hold. I never heard anybody calling, but

[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.920]
it do's back on radio. How about an asshole? Would that make him even more exciting?

[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.880]
I don't call people that that's a useful part of the body. Everybody have brown eyes otherwise.

[00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:00.340]
Okay. All right, listen. I want to leave you with a cockamorn and come back to the

[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.020]
useful part of the body for outgoals.

[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.800]
With the amount of food that he's packing away. Hi. Yeah. In the meantime, cockamorn and

[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.040]
and back to you. Thank you. Have a great life. Okay.

[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:17.620]
Open line and a green line, Al. 1-800-944. Did anybody ever call about the stadium concessions?

[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:22.860]
They did not. Why the hell not? And did anybody ever call with a cell phone from,

[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:27.040]
um, they're supposed to have more than just the football pair. Oh, they are. But I'm sure that

[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.700]
Carvelle still has that thing because I know that Al will definitely want to make a trip to that

[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:36.340]
Carvelle. See, ordinarily, as ice cream goes, I hate to say this because but Carvelle is not very

[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:41.120]
exciting. I'm sorry because there's some nice people that don't, you know, but especially on

[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.700]
paysoft because most people that own Carvelle are Jewish for whatever the reason was Tom Carvelle,

[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:51.300]
Jewish, I don't think so. But the stuff is kosher, even for paysoft. But the Carvelle at the stadium

[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:55.360]
is like extra special. I don't know what there is about it, but it just, I guess it's the cherries

[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:00.440]
and the strawberries and the hot fudge. And God is that good. In fact, after, you know,

[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:04.040]
I can have time at the dolphin game. Even if it's a crappy game, you have one of those

[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:14.100]
you say, Oh God. Yeah. Here's St. Petersburg. Hey, yes, sir. About Jim Skyler. Yes. I listen on the weekend

[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:20.880]
and he's actually my project is pretty good. But you know, when you get through listening to Joey,

[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:25.360]
it's tough to, it's tough to hear funny anymore. I kept hearing that line yesterday with a tough

[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.580]
act to follow and everybody meeting. How could anybody have an audience after Joey? And then there

[00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:34.140]
was some old bad name Ruth called in and he said, Why don't you have a real tough act to follow

[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:39.240]
because he's the best. And his credit, Skyler hung up on her and I was cheering in the car.

[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.780]
Well, I'll tell you, you know, when I'm working on the weekend, I'll just put the radio on and

[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:51.420]
it's background noise. Right. Until something comes up and then I'll listen. And so a lot of times,

[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:58.400]
you know, I'll have Joey on. And I'm not really hearing anything, but I've kind of reen

[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:06.720]
myself of that where I'm not turning him on because it really makes sound overbomb, but I think

[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:11.340]
it impairs my ability to hear humor. Yeah, it impairs your ability to function as a human being.

[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:17.260]
On Saturday, I think it was I get in my car. I turn on a radio, which I always have on 610,

[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:24.580]
being as loyal as I am until it comes time to turn it off. And he has got the first call was,

[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:30.040]
oh, that's right. The very first call was Bill from Newport, Richie. He hit him on for 15 minutes.

[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:34.700]
There is nobody on this radio station besides him. Well, even tolerate Bill from Newport, Richie.

[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:39.900]
He had him on for close to 15 minutes. He goes into a commercial break. He comes back and who do we

[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:44.760]
go to next? His buddy, Louie Jagger on the beach in Hollywood with his so-called weather report.

[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:51.260]
And that went on for 15 minutes. Oh, Joey. I mean, just every time you think he's had rock bottom,

[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:57.880]
he finds another death through a plum. I think it was Saturday. I turned him on about 15 minutes

[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:05.920]
before the end of his show. And I heard him tell a woman that he's not always funny because when

[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:13.020]
you really take risks, you know, sometimes you bomb. And I just want to say that God, loving for that,

[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:19.740]
maybe eventually, you know, the law of averages is on his side. Right. If you throw an up-track

[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:26.160]
up into the air, some of it will hit you. Yeah, like goodbye. Like goodbye. I would be in

[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:31.900]
hysterics if he just came on and said goodbye. Bye, bye. You know, that would do it for me. I go nuts.

[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:40.660]
But have a great day, pal. I got a question for you. Yeah. How would I know if my topic

[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:48.940]
is hanging down? People would be pointing and laughing. Okay. Have a great day. All right. See

[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:54.900]
you there. You know, I'm going to go to the other WIOD. It's 1232. Let's do Miramar. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. What's the

[00:54:54.900 --> 00:55:02.920]
succession with baseball? Here's a man who's got the fever. Not well. Come on. Get with it. I will

[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.800]
watch the game on TV. Oh, you're not going to be listening to Rick and Suds like I am.

[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:13.660]
Okay, I'll turn the sound down on the TV. You don't have Rick and Suds on the radio. No, you're talking.

[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:18.260]
Are they going to be at the stadium? No, they wouldn't let them out there. They wouldn't let them go.

[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:24.080]
QAM would not let them go out there. How did you guys let those losers get the game?

[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.080]
Because they're going to wind up losing about a million and a half to two million dollars a year

[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:32.340]
on it. So it was with our pleasure. We said, go right ahead. Be our guest. It's just money. Yeah.

[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:38.500]
You guys could be the dolphin station, the Marlin station, the heat station. No one in

[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:46.060]
other than the dolphins, we don't want any part of those. You could be the announcer for the

[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:54.200]
hockey team. The Miami ice. The Miami S. Hey, listen, when is Norm coming back on your show?

[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:59.720]
We have an open line in Broward 5249463. You talk about a guy who had nothing to say. And he always does.

[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.080]
That's the same guy. He never has anything to say. And what was that, the child he was molesting

[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:10.300]
in the background? Was that called from the rectum rear? What? 1234. Oh, and then did you,

[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:14.680]
before we take the break, there's the story about this priest here. What is his name? Oh, uh,

[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:20.700]
it's not his real name. Oh, they got a street named after him in downtown Miami. Opharole,

[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:25.640]
but that's not his real name, but they call him father Opharole. Well, it's something like that,

[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:29.660]
but they call him father Opharole. The street's name is Opharole. There's something like that in

[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:34.160]
downtown Northwest, the second street or northeast. It's like a second name to it.

[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:43.100]
And he has been charged with testifying. They were submitting false testimony, false war

[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:47.620]
and testimony, and was an alibi for this kid that was charged with theft or something like that.

[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:54.280]
And allegedly in exchange for sex with this 23 year old guy. And he didn't notice they were

[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:58.560]
interviewing some of the parishioners on the news yesterday. And they were all not father Opharole.

[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:02.700]
No, he would never do this. And just a conspiracy. It's against the whole Catholic church. And we

[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:09.420]
know the arrow out. Yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, right? Uh huh. Sure. So will the real Catholic priest,

[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:15.900]
the real straight one, please stand up. They're all still sitting down. 1235 on the IOD network.

[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:21.940]
The goddess Randy Rhodes tonight, 7 to 11 on NewsTalk Radio 620, WSUN.

[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.620]
I was so depressed last night. And I mean, you actually, I couldn't wait until you came on.

[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:31.180]
So like, it followed the way. Happy, right? Oh, tonight. I mean, like, I'm feeling much better

[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:36.520]
looking forward to your show. And now you're all depressed. So I think I better do something.

[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.720]
I've never called the radio station have I feel better now? I have been on the field better after

[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.520]
50 minutes just to tell you. I think you're fantastic. I want to tell all my friends.

[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:51.020]
The only thing though, you seem to have like a lot of guys calling. Isn't that a phenomenon?

[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:56.020]
Yeah. Why would guys be calling a girl? Well, yeah, I can understand that. But I know, I mean,

[00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:00.720]
I would guys are calling a deep-throated, you know, fast-talking honest speaking chick.

[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:05.500]
Yeah, but am I joining a new kind of geek club? No, I need to be. I'm not going to be like answering

[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:11.620]
one at for really lonely people now. Am I in this group now? You're in the group. You're going

[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:15.960]
to start getting weird mail just like, oh, God. I am now lonely.

[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:42.320]
Oh, and so now, I'm having a meeting. Everybody's on a date.

[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.020]
The coolest man in the bar bar is Greg Maddox.

[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:55.680]
And since the competitor, only 26 years old.

[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:01.420]
For the sixth, right here, you know, one 15 hour.

[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.760]
He's a very handsome young man.

[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:18.480]
Turned co. We can't stand you, Greg. We hope you lose 30 games this year for Atlanta.

[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.980]
1239, we have an open line on the StarLine Star IOD.

[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.600]
What sparks a champion?

[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.560]
Sparks you and champions.

[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:28.540]
Choose Wee-Dee.

[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.520]
Let's see that spark in action. Keep your eye on Fleetfooted Richie Ashwin,

[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.720]
patrolling center field for the Phillies. Here's the pitch.

[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:38.560]
Uh-oh, it's a low sinking liner out of a second. Looks like it's in there.

[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.820]
Ashwin's racing in. He makes a desperate time.

[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.020]
And he's up for that ball.

[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:48.780]
1250, you spring catch by Richie Ashwin. Man, oh man. He's really got that spark.

[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.220]
Champion Ashwin fires up with Wee-Dee's. How about you?

[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:55.080]
Remember what sparks a champion? Sparks you.

[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.260]
What sparks a champion?

[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.880]
Sparks you and champions. Choose Wee-Dee.

[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:07.720]
I guess uh- oh shut up already. I guess diving for those line drives is a good way to get a

[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:12.780]
Richie Asperin, huh? Open line on the StarLine at Star IOD. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.980]
Are you guys good? Yes, hello. Are you at the ballpark?

[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.120]
Uh, we're on our way. I got an insight. We're right in front of Calder right now.

[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.840]
All right. Yeah, we're pumped up. We're former New York Metthans out of New York.

[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.280]
I know you're supposed to stay on my first time call. I have heard you though.

[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:29.680]
Do you have to say anything? Okay, well, you know, my name is Danny O'Auto-Fordler.

[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.280]
I'm a good friend and Howard. Great. And we're going to be parked shortly and we're having a beer

[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.460]
and we're going to have a good time there. How's the traffic?

[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.400]
It's not that at all. Not that at all. We're right here at the entrance to Calder and it's real good.

[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.920]
It's uh, what do we got? 1239 or so? Great. We'll get there before our Goldstein gets here.

[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:48.000]
I'll tell you that. I'll tell you. There'll be nothing left to the concession stands.

[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.460]
They're not going to like it. Huh? I think I got some good food. I saw on the paper.

[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.520]
Yeah. Yeah. What do you like the best?

[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.760]
Hey, anything that's edible, man, anything you can stick in your mouth.

[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.940]
Have a great day. Enjoy it. Thank you. Okay.

[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:06.880]
Yes, a matter of fact, you know what else I saw? The founder seats, they have special food.

[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.780]
I was watching one of the pieces on the news over the weekend and they were showing one of the

[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:17.540]
concession guys and he was peddling some kind of seafood stuff with shrimp and lobster.

[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.940]
I don't know what the hell it was and they said, well, gee, this isn't like your real regular hot dogs

[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.680]
and he said, no, this is strictly for the founders section.

[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.520]
And that's where I'm going to be sitting. That's where all of our WIOD seats are.

[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.680]
And those great founder seats right behind the dugout like tomorrow night in the third row.

[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.800]
So what can I say? See how you played your cards wrong if you would have come with me to the game

[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:44.460]
tomorrow? You could have liked really gone nuts. You could have had like 10 times as much food and 10

[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:48.920]
times the excitement and cholesterol sunrise. Hello.

[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:57.200]
Sunrise. Hi. Yeah. How are you doing? Okay. I see that Martin's made the front page. Yes, sir.

[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:04.120]
What do you think about the eye ice-creamy man? The what? The ice-creamy man. Meaning what?

[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:09.220]
He's selling ice-creamy. Is he? Yeah. You know there's an old saying about saying

[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:14.520]
you scream ice-creamy. We all scream for ice-creamy. Yeah, they're sure as old. So how you been?

[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:21.080]
Pretty good. Okay. We have an open line and Broward. It was from sunrise. What do you want,

[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:28.460]
George? My God. The median age there is death. 5249463. That was a super sunrise all we had. He's

[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:32.720]
all worked up for the game. He's had his winies and probably getting ready for a moving experience

[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.580]
any second. Tampa. Holy cow. Exactly. Hey, I see you guys. They printed in the

[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:44.720]
trivia yesterday the name of the new Miami hockey team. The Florida Panthers. No, please. Can I

[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.540]
reach a headline here from future sports edition? That's not official, is it? I don't know. That's

[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:54.860]
what no. No, but I can just see the headline now. Lightning drop pants. Yeah, that's cute. Go

[01:02:54.860 --> 01:03:01.340]
pants, go. I want to say something about Bird. Is that include Rob Zaminer? Is he going to do that?

[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.240]
Either him or Domino because I want to be there with that game. By the way, all you flyer fans,

[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.000]
Gary Galley is God. I just thought I'd mention that. See, you only get my Keenan for a coach,

[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:16.980]
ain't you? No, we're not. Well, they were showing the game here Saturday and Bobby Clark and him

[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:20.680]
were sitting under press box together. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, the stories here say that it's

[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.720]
going to be somebody else, but that would be great. I like my Keenan, man. We have him. He'd be the

[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.640]
next best thing to Don Sherry. Everybody be spirit and knocking each other's heads off. That's

[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.460]
what they're doing. Yeah. For not doing nothing, he's well-meaning. Exactly. For a guy who had a

[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:37.820]
rather mediocre career, both as a player and a coach, he is sure parlored into a lot of money.

[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:45.340]
Really? About Bird. Bird? Yes. Deep Bird? Deep Bird. His taste is in his ass.

[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:58.620]
Well, we know that. Any guy who likes choking puke or chokers, running around, I mean, they're not

[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:02.800]
like they can do. Lightening round of Neil God, you did. What ever happened to it? Yeah, you said

[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.180]
you were going to car the whole bunch up and I'm been waiting for myself to come up on there.

[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.820]
He heard a bunch of what? He said you were going to do a whole bunch of those Neil God's. The only one I've

[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:17.060]
heard is lean dog. Oh, I have a whole bunch of them car it up. Oh, because I'm waiting to hear myself.

[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:22.780]
Where the hell are they? What the hell happened on my Neil God cards? You must be the guy that was

[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:28.500]
in here over the weekend and stole that card. No, sir. Gone? Oh, missing. Uh oh. I can't put my

[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:34.440]
finger on it right now, but it happens to be in the machine. Neil God. Is that it? No, it's the guy.

[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:44.460]
Neil God. No. I was the guy. Neil God. No. Neil God. No. Neil God. No. Neil God. No. Neil God.

[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:51.920]
Neil God. No. Neil God. Definitely not. I think that last one I recorded at the rectory.

[01:04:51.920 --> 01:05:03.340]
Neil God. No. Neil God. Shut up, Kurt. Neil God. No. No. Neil God. No.

[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.100]
Well, how many of them are on here, George? A lot. Neil God. That's sunny fuck.

[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.060]
Yeah, it's not a like it. He won't, you notice what a wimp he is. He won't call me anywhere after he

[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:18.700]
said bull shot on here on the station that we have fingered him for being the abuser of our

[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:23.640]
airwaves that he is. Wouldn't do it on magic one, oh, two point up your nose over there. But when

[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:32.980]
comes on this station, he says all kinds of crap. Neil God. No. Wow. Neil God. Are you sure it's on here?

[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:46.600]
Neil God. No. No. God. Neil. It's nothing for real. Neil. Just me. No. It was before that. It was

[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:52.600]
after the guy that said it is a question. You told me to clean up the phone. Neil God. No.

[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.220]
That's Scotty Mac. Yeah, you're right. Come on, cue up here. Is that the end of them?

[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.740]
Yeah, I think that was the last Scotty Mac. How well? How do you know which is the last? How do you

[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:05.540]
know what's on the card? Because I happen to tape it that day. I'm not being a year old. All right,

[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:14.520]
here we go. Neil. Neil. No. Neil God. No. No. Marvin got it.

[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:23.100]
Marvin. Marvin. Gardens. No. By the way, speaking of Marvin, he can be seen any hour morning,

[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.560]
noon and night, rollerblading like a maniac on Miami Beach. I saw on the other day this guy.

[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.880]
He's a good job in a bar. He's out of his mind. I mean, this guy's going to get killed. He thinks

[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:39.800]
he's in what the hell was that movie in LA? A roller, a rollerblade roller, Derby roller,

[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:45.400]
rollerboogie rollerboogie. Yeah. Neil, I don't know. Oh, that's for Paisa. That's the Hebrew version.

[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:52.060]
Jesus, how many of more honest damn thing? And now we got to get that Japanese Jewish on here too.

[01:06:52.240 --> 01:07:03.440]
Oh, Neil God. Not the O. See the O just. Neil. Yeah. No. Neil God. It's right after that.

[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:09.040]
Oh, here we go. Okay, big build up here. Here we go. Wait a minute. I may get so excited when I

[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:16.080]
hear this that I wet my pants. Neil God. That's the one. Oh, okay. Thanks. Thanks for killing two

[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:23.100]
minutes. Yeah. Venture, white, bureau driving, steroid taking douchebag. Okay. Wow. Man, if

[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:27.620]
every call could kill as much productive time as that did. We have an open line on the green line.

[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.960]
We're only like an hour and some minutes away. They're going to be throwing the per the

[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:37.440]
perst damn fits you out at 1-800-944-WI-WD. We got a pressure packed afternoon of Marlon's

[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.600]

[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:50.060]

[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:12.700]
days. SUDds Pet Sludg kills mom. Pet Sludg happened to be in a 38 caliber cage. Yeah.

[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:19.380]
Slined man is national darts champ. High school principal fired for spanking teacher.

[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:27.240]
Psychic rooster saves man from plane crash. Wrestling fans riot over snoozing bear.

[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:34.740]
Thomas Jefferson was an ace on the draftees. Doc saves man's life with liver he found on the highway.

[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:43.500]
I told Marvin about that. I win. I win. Finally entertaining AM radio, not the same old talk.

[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:46.220]
News Talk Radio 620, WSUN.

[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:58.180]
News Talk Radio 620, WSUN. It's the Neil Rogers show. You can talk to Neil live by calling

[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:02.100]
toll free 1-800-944-9463.

[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:11.460]
We've rattled sucked 40 years ago. Any still sucks.

[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:18.740]
Oh, okay 1251, a WIOD. We got the channel 33 on here just in case. I'm not listening. I want you to

[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:22.740]
understand right now. I'm not going to like that for any of my attention. The game doesn't start until after

[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:26.840]
the show is over. We got a night game tomorrow. Most of the other games will be night games. I

[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.240]
wouldn't want anybody to think that I'm going to divert my attention away from WIOD for one second today.

[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:35.020]
Here's the lady in Miami.

[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:44.040]
Neil Yeshua. Yeah. That's it. Cute. Very weak. Can't even hear it. Okay, Yeshua this.

[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:51.060]
Two open lines in date and one on the green line 1-800-944-WIOD. And let's do a Pembroke Pine.

[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:56.420]
Hello. Hey Neil. Oh, there's that anal herchizer who was starting against us today. How are you, Neil?

[01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:05.000]
Against old Charlie Huff. Can you believe Dale Murphy is a rocky? How about that? They sent him

[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.380]
out to Colorado if you paste your mole back on. They're making buses for an entire spring training

[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:14.360]
to win a position on the damn team and then they send him away. Right. You believe this? Yes, I do.

[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:20.740]
Well, happy salad and have a pissy for me. Okay. Open line in two of them in date. This is the

[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:24.920]
beginning of the end for us. Okay, they all got channel 33 on. They're all getting excited. Here's

[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:29.160]
a drive to deep right field, but it's going to be caught. Who the hell is playing out there? Oh,

[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.100]
that's that anal herchizer again. We don't want to see him. What an asshole. God, another one of

[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:38.320]
these goody twos. He was him and Gary Carter should go any lope somewhere. Those two. Oh, look

[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.840]
at that. Look at that. Herchizer and drizzed Dale there and playing a little grab bass in the locker

[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:47.300]
room. God. Man, it's would get off on that. Hi, Alia. Hi, Alia. How you doing, Neil? Pretty good.

[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:53.580]
Call it great. Hey, yeah, how is it that people can get into this country and become citizens without

[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:59.220]
even speaking the language? Call it Sandy Payton. She'll tell you all the lines in date wide open

[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:04.500]
here. It's a baseball Monday, man. We got the fever, but not the IOD audience. I can't play

[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:10.540]
male goldstein for this because that was an hour ago. Okay, 7519463. Let's do a Geensville. Hello.

[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.640]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Oh, I just look at the paper here. I thought that the model is

[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:21.480]
one ESPN. They're not? No, I mean, no, they're on channel 33. No, I'm up in Geensville. Yeah, I thought,

[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:26.400]
oh, man, this, this, this, this, this, all screwed up. Now I got a prop. What me out of the reds are on.

[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.000]
It's not best by team. Well, who that wants to see there? Oh, that's your team. Oh, yeah. Who are they

[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.520]
playing? Montreal. Oh, kick they ass out of somebody. Oh, they will. Don't worry. Yeah.

[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:40.580]
Even watching MTV at all. Then Arosmith are the last hour. Really? And I'm sitting here watching

[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:45.200]
that obnoxious Kurt Gibson. Oh, they're not going to show Kurt Gibson at that home run. Are they?

[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.860]
That to me is one of the worst moments in the history of sports. He's got the Kurt Gibson can barely,

[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:54.560]
remember? Yeah. He can barely stand. He can barely swing the bat. He's like crippled. He's

[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.860]
and he throws him a couple of fastballs and he's like, you know, he runs like his cups too big

[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:04.660]
for him. And then all of a sudden he throws him this lollipop there on the inside corner and he

[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:08.880]
hits it. Oh, man, look at this. Here's Ecclesiastly out there. They're going to do it again. I can't

[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:14.940]
look. I can't stand it. Who was it? That was Jack Buck. He said, I don't believe what I just saw.

[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:19.820]
Yeah, no one believes Jack Buck anyway. No, nobody believes that Jack Buck is still alive. Okay, I got

[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:25.560]
Marlon's Melrose lady on the phone. One more thing. Yeah, I'm up in Gainesville. When does draft cover

[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:31.900]
start? In about five minutes. Five minutes? Okay. Okay, here she is. Hey, Neil. Where are you?
