[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460]
I think we have cut it as close to the bone as we possibly can.

[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:04.660]
Oh!

Oh! If I would step my tongue down your throat,

[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.620]
would we read it on the front page?

[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.600]
Girls don't satisfy your eyes just like to try your waltz.

[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.600]
I know, it's only dated for a like him.

[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.880]
But I know, it's only dated for a like him.

[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.200]
Yes I do.

[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.640]
But only dated for a like him.

[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.480]
Only dated for a like him.

[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.320]
Only dated for a like him.

[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.360]
Yes I do.

[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.060]
But I can't say that this old boy has been a long day.

[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.740]
Yes I do.

[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.500]
But I know, he's got my show, but she's not like him.

[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.900]
Oh, no.

[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.180]
Oh, is that I know, which holy life can flow when a like him.

[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.900]
Only dated for a like him.

[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.580]
I know, it's worth dancing in the season and we like that.

[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.600]
Only dated for a like him.

[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.600]

[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.140]
It's almost 7 at WIOD and no holiday shows be complete without, of course, one of our very favorite people.

[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.020]
Here she is.

[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.020]
Here I am.

[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.900]
There you are.

[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.560]
Thanks for calling.

[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.080]
Happy grace your holidays.

[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.340]
Thanks for calling.

[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.200]
Yes.

[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.780]
Right.

[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.980]
How are you?

[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.120]
I want to tell you that the lady said like he's a ham too.

[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.580]
Right.

[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.560]
Are they still alive?

[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.640]
That's good.

[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.860]
She wishes you happy holiday.

[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.920]
Well the same tour.

[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.960]
She has two children and they ate a sandwich for lunch.

[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.260]
Beautiful.

[00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.720]
They ate dinner at night.

[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.740]
They finished it in the week and it was delicious.

[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.660]
Well that's great.

[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.700]
There's nothing better that we could do than share our meat with those who need it.

[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.060]
Right.

[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.320]
It was cooked and sliced and ready to eat.

[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.080]
You don't have to cook it or anything.

[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.340]
Right.

[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.300]
If I had known I would have kept it.

[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.080]
There you go.

[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.800]
Yeah.

[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.120]
That's why we kept you in the dark.

[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.820]
Right.

[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.600]
Well the next time you have it I'll order it.

[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.940]
Okay.

[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.580]
Yeah.

[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.760]
So how are you feeling?

[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.140]
I'll send you a kosher one next time.

[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.760]
We'll put a little circle you on the bottom of it.

[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.400]
I'm doing okay.

[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.440]
I'm a little plugged up yet but I'll get over this thing.

[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.060]
I know it took me three weeks.

[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.820]
Did it really?

[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.260]
Yeah.

[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.160]
Oh beautiful.

[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.820]
Yeah.

[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.360]
But it was worth it.

[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.800]
You know it was worth my trip out there and I got to see the concert and got to see the MGM grand.

[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.680]
And just had a good time all the way around.

[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.900]
Yeah.

[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.860]
It makes me feel good.

[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.640]
Made a few dollars at the track last night.

[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.780]
Huh?

[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.460]
I said I made a few bucks at Poppano Park last night.

[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.920]
Oh, that was nice.

[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.000]
That rich made a few bucks at the track last night.

[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.500]
There's a young guy from the York.

[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.760]
A real gambler type who sit at the table next to us.

[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.940]
One three thousand dollars last night.

[00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.900]
Oh, mine.

[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.280]
At the lucky table next to us.

[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.440]
I guess that's the lucky table.

[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.040]
We're going to have to start moving and change our luck.

[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.560]
Right.

[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.160]
Yeah.

[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:16.040]
Well, I was busy listening to the concert at Carnegie Hall of the Christmas hall.

[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.760]
Whatever it is, yeah.

[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.600]
The symphony.

[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.100]
Uh-huh.

[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.980]
And from the Vienna symphony concert.

[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.960]
Vienna boys choir.

[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.000]
Right.

[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.260]
They're all stopping by at the rectory to check in with the archbishop when they're done.

[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.960]
Well, I'll be fine.

[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.580]
When they get done.

[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.000]
Yeah.

[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.040]
I was in that church, I think it's called St. Dancer.

[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.280]
Something like that.

[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.260]
Yeah, something like that.

[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.440]
Yeah.

[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.760]
Well, I want to wish you good health and the same to you.

[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.400]
And thank you for everything.

[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.420]
And don't forget.

[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.700]
Happy poem and talk among them.

[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.000]
Never too early for a homeontage.

[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.320]
Have a great day.

[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.060]
Thank you.

[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.280]
Bye.

[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.640]
Bye.

[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.680]
Open line on a blue line.

[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.700]
5249463.

[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.580]
And the star line.

[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.400]
If you got Bell's alphabet only because we lie a lot.

[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.940]
We said we're going to have a line for cell one.

[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.680]
And maybe we will someday if you live long enough.

[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.160]
But don't hold your breath.

[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.700]
10 afternoons at WIOD and WSUN.

[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.160]
Tonight after Randy Rhodes, it's Don and Mike.

[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.800]
New star, Radio 610.

[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.180]
WIOD.

[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.980]
This is the Neil Roger show.

[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.800]
This is your brain.

[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.760]
Any questions?

[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.760]
Please.

[00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.950]
Who they curse my name?

[00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.110]
If I farted in heaven?

[00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.430]
Would I stand the shame?

[00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.410]
If I farted in heaven?

[00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.450]
Would the launch smell?

[00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.570]
Send me straight to hell?

[00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.150]
Yes.

[00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:28.170]
Or can anybody smell?

[00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.470]
Up in heaven?

[00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.950]
Does gas act the same?

[00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.430]
Does it linger in heaven?

[00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:09.390]
Would you be ashamed to pull my finger in heaven?

[00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:17.710]
I know these things.

[00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.590]
When the flat lady sings.

[00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.650]
Hey, great.

[00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:33.670]
Cause I'll be the one who brings tears to heaven.

[00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:46.750]
Cause I know I'll be the one who brings tears to heaven.

[00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.030]
1216 to WIdeas.

[00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:54.090]
We looked back over the last year, which is one of the things that we're famous for doing at the end of the year, because there's not much else to do.

[00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.270]
One of the great things that they did to us not was destroying a tarman.

[00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.810]
We had a real good thing going there.

[00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.190]
We had a guy who was including that, which is on the best stuff, by the way, along with some of his other stuff.

[00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.390]
Did some of the best song parodies and creative stuff ever.

[00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:16.570]
And then of course they tried to make him into like a part-time superstar, put him on a weekend, make him into a talk show host, and all of a sudden he stopped doing vits for us.

[00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.190]
And that's kind of a sad thing, because he's the best.

[00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:28.250]
I mean the very best, he's better than any comedy service.

[00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.570]
And I like to do just about everything else, at least they're consistent.

[00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.490]
Here's St. Petersburg on a Broward line.

[00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:33.870]
Hello.

[00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.990]
And the same to you.

[00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:41.690]
I want to read something to you that was in the St. Petersburg Times today that's pretty operative about blob.

[00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.370]
Yeah.

[00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.130]
I mean I did that.

[00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:43.890]
Go right ahead.

[00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:51.530]
Last year's afternoon show will supplant WSUN's current live Simon Kass to the Rick and Fed show for my own WIOD.

[00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.670]
He's also a Cox property.

[00:08:54.170 --> 00:09:02.050]
He's been wanting to do afternoon station manager Todd Lizer said of Lacer who could not be reached for a comment on Thursday.

[00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.610]
Here comes the operative part.

[00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:12.990]
I'm ecstatic that Bob and Al will be competing with Lizer said, with Lionel Garn there will be a wonderful opportunity to take over his old audience.

[00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.090]
Right, the old FLA audience.

[00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.830]
I'm going to turn the radio off now.

[00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.290]
I listen to you and then Rick and Fed to now there's nothing to listen to.

[00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:21.650]

[00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.090]
You blob.

[00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.590]
Yeah, he, see basically what he's going to be able to do is go back to FLA without going back there.

[00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.150]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.570]
He's going to be able to do the FLA show and get all his old Yentos back and do it on SUN.

[00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:44.530]
But luckily it'll be after me and not before me, which believe me, inheriting an audience from Ron and Ron will be a hell of a lot bigger pleasure over there than inheriting all the disgruntled masses of old farts from the Blobster.

[00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.390]
So it's a good move for me.

[00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.030]
See ya.

[00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.450]
Okay, see ya.

[00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.450]
Open line of dates, 751, one on the blue line, 5249463.

[00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.670]
We ought to play the best guitar man, you know what?

[00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.150]
So many greats from this past year, but not anymore.

[00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:09.310]
How about that, just great raise that under just, you know, some of these things that are in here in the computer, which should be like this one for example.

[00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.590]
It just feels like a prick.

[00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:16.610]
I mean, why is that under just, what's that just great waiting? What is under great?

[00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:22.430]
There's no way to figure out what, there's no rhyme or reason what all these things are under it. The goddamn computer anymore.

[00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:34.710]
Sally fits when her battery's quip, Rick and Suts, when they're pulling their cuts, Joey blows.

[00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.010]
Oh, that most everyone knows.

[00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.110]
That's just great radio.

[00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.670]
Larry King with that bald spot thing and there's Jim.

[00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.210]
We know what Neil thinks of him, Randy Rolves.

[00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:56.970]
When she speaks of her nose, that's just great radio.

[00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.250]
Management, they're all bent on just running the show.

[00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.190]
But they're just a bag of rants and douchebags I know.

[00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.110]
They don't even know when to go.

[00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.390]
So Neil gets the vision.

[00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.770]
It's just what we're missing for and so.

[00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.530]
As we all hear a show, make a call.

[00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.810]
And if you have the call, talk to me.

[00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:31.890]
And I'm sure you will feel and feel as a God.

[00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:38.510]
I'll make tripping one of just great radio.

[00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.190]
Okay, that was recorded back in the days when everything was in great shape with guitar man.

[00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.650]
And he was good friend of all of ours and he was still doing stuff in our, that's history.

[00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.290]
One is it like about three, four months since he's done a bid for us.

[00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.530]
11, 12, 20, not that I'm complaining mind you, but never happened again.

[00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.070]
They just, they destroyed it. They killed him.

[00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.570]
West Palm Beach. Hello.

[00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:01.670]
Hello, Neil.

[00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.210]
Yes, sir.

[00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.090]
I just want to say Merry Christmas.

[00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.270]
And the same to you, sir.

[00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.090]
I have my missile tow belt buckle on.

[00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.570]
Beauty.

[00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.270]
And we're listening to a pair of less Palm Beach.

[00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.650]
Okay.

[00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.290]
I was wondering if you could play that Metallica does Barney thing.

[00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.150]
Metallica does Barney.

[00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.930]
Yeah, listen, he wants to talk to you all in a second.

[00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.290]
Okay.

[00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.270]
Yeah, what were you?

[00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.530]
Old ice cream.

[00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.730]
Did you get that?

[00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.610]
I got it.

[00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.990]
Okay.

[00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.130]
I'm trying to get rid of it.

[00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.650]
I'll dig it out for you, pal.

[00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:27.050]
Thank you.

[00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.550]
See ya.

[00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.510]
Where the hell am I going to find that?

[00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:31.710]
It's on one of those in there somewhere.

[00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.050]
Well, it can be something to do during these long breaks.

[00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.150]
1221 at WIOD and WSUN.

[00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.290]
Tonight at eight, following sports talks 610.

[00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.310]
It's Randy Rose.

[00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.470]
New stock radio 610.

[00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.590]
Come with you on your team.

[00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.050]
Don't surre my.

[00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.910]
Why is no one?

[00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:56.650]
Listen to that.

[00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.190]
How do you like that?

[00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.910]
It's my name too.

[00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.830]
Somebody munged on the Arkansas State song.

[00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:04.290]
Look at that.

[00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.250]
You don't think you'd had to do with any with Bill and Hillary, do you?

[00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.230]
Let me see if I can wipe that off and the CD too.

[00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.010]
That's disgusting.

[00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.470]
That's one of our most important bits.

[00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.010]
I'm scouring to find that guy, his stupid Barney Metallica thing.

[00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.010]
No, it still isn't here.

[00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.690]
You know?

[00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.890]
I'm better at wiping it.

[00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.710]
All right.

[00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.390]
We'll have to work on wiping it and the CD too.

[00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.030]
See, that's the thing.

[00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.970]
What's going to happen with these new DAT things?

[00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.270]
What is that going to finally happen?

[00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.110]
So we don't have to...

[00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.110]
First it was with tapes and they used to stretch and they used to snap and they would break.

[00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:36.950]
Then we got CDs.

[00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.110]
And then it turns out they scratch it like if you get mung on them,

[00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.410]
then they like hop around or if you're in your car and you hit the railroad tracks,

[00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.350]
they like bounce all over the goddamn place.

[00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.550]
And I get very, very upset about that.

[00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.570]
Boy, somebody really, I didn't number on this.

[00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.230]
They must have got really excited on that number.

[00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.170]
Is it 121? Is that where the thing is?

[00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.850]
Probably the one that's missing, 127 is the one that he's looking for.

[00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.830]
Huh? There's one that keeps missing.

[00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.690]
There must be something that we're playing that is not marked, do not play it.

[00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.310]
That's a really funny thing. I 127.

[00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.830]
And it keeps disappearing out of there.

[00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.070]
It's about the third eye. Here it is.

[00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.070]
Damn it, I found it.

[00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.290]
See, if I could be honest and say,

[00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.090]
I really worked like crazy to find it for a pound, I couldn't find it,

[00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.210]
then I wouldn't feel bad.

[00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.530]
But I worked like crazy to find it for you and I found it.

[00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.350]
Damn it.

[00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.910]
I love you.

[00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.350]
You're the reason.

[00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.910]
Where I'm always traveling with a great thing

[00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.490]
of anarchist from me to you

[00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.690]
what you see is how things go.

[00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.430]
I love you.

[00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.630]
You love me.

[00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:55.270]
We are friends, I'm friends, you see,

[00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:59.490]
we're the great things of anarchist from me to you.

[00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.190]
What you see is how things go.

[00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:12.750]
I'm your friend and I'm your friend and I'm your friend.

[00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:13.190]
Oh!

[00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.350]
So let me ask you, was it worth all the effort?

[00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.910]
CAUSE 26 and WID.

[00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.550]
I want to play this screw that thing.

[00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.590]
I want to play this thing one more time and see if I was able to smear the thing off it.

[00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.830]
Because that's one of our...

[00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.410]
See, it's about time since we still have two hours left in the computer

[00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.370]
that we started putting some of this and loading it in there.

[00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:34.790]
Which I think maybe like next weekend one day, if there's time I'll come in and put some stuff on a reel.

[00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.490]
And remember that was another one of the highlights of 93.

[00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.270]
The big frothing at the mouth here about the computer project,

[00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.870]
which was a brilliant idea and works out very nicely for us.

[00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.810]
Like right at the touch of a fingertip, we got all that stuff, we got rid of two or three cart racks in here.

[00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.250]
We got a little bit better organized.

[00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.970]
But oh my god, do it our way and take control yourself

[00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.750]
because don't expect anybody in programming or middle-level management

[00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.110]
to take control of this massive project because we can't be bothered with it.

[00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.550]
And then when we did work our ass and just put all kinds of stuff in there,

[00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.490]
oh no, the stuff is too long, you got too many long bits in there,

[00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.130]
take it all out, take it all out.

[00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.710]
Because there are people who desperately and frantically need that time.

[00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.510]
We've only got limited number of hours in the computer,

[00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.250]
we've only got so much hard drive if I can say that.

[00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.810]
And here it is like the end of the year and there's like two hours,

[00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.590]
one minute and six seconds to left in there.

[00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:24.970]
Just dying in there.

[00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.930]
Oh, I think I got it.

[00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.230]
Well, I know my sister all my life.

[00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.050]
That is why she's now my wife.

[00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.910]
And I think my son may know it's true.

[00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:47.870]
He's my nephew too.

[00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.790]
Well, my daddy is my uncle.

[00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.110]
Joe, my mother is my dear grandfather.

[00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.370]
It is very plain to see my first cousin is me.

[00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.390]
Oh!

[00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.750]
Oh!

[00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.750]

[00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:06.570]
Hey!

[00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.370]
Hey!

[00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.190]
Hey!

[00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:10.210]

[00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:11.670]

[00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:11.990]
Hey!

[00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:11.990]

[00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.110]

[00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:12.790]

[00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:12.950]
Hey!

[00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:13.050]
Hey!

[00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:13.050]

[00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:13.070]
Hey!

[00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:14.830]

[00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:15.450]

[00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.110]
Uh huh.

[00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.650]
Okay, 12 for 28 at WID.

[00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:23.330]
That was worth it.

[00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.730]
I just kept wiping that thing and wiping it and the CD too and look what came out.

[00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.430]
Here's an orthomime beach.

[00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:28.750]
Hello.

[00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.390]
Yeah, an alchoneel.

[00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:30.870]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.950]
Yeah, happy holidays.

[00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.090]
And the same to you, my good close personal friend, whoever you might be.

[00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.410]
And I'd like to say for the record.

[00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:37.870]
Yes.

[00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.030]
That the Panthers are a great hockey club.

[00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:41.370]
Oh!

[00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:41.990]
You bet.

[00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:48.230]
And Bobby Clark and Roger Nielsen have done a great job with them.

[00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:48.650]
Yup.

[00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.470]
And I'd like to...

[00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.590]
And don't forget our great goalie coach, Billy Smith.

[00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.030]
Well, you know, much hated by Ranger fans from coast to coast.

[00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.330]
Well, being breezy is a great goal.

[00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.170]
Being breezy, yep.

[00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:03.730]
But anyways, I'd like to report a little holiday misfortune to you.

[00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:04.110]
Yes.

[00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.150]
And I'd like to send it out over the airwaves.

[00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:08.130]
And...

[00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.450]
To cheer up the rest of us, okay?

[00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:09.670]
Yes.

[00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:18.750]
And that I'd like to call whoever stole my minivan with the few presents I had in it last night.

[00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.150]
That he is a major douchebag.

[00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.350]
I would go a little bit beyond that, I would say.

[00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.150]
That's all!

[00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:26.990]
It would be more like it.

[00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.430]
Thank you.

[00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.850]
Okay.

[00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:29.670]
Well, good luck to you, my friend.

[00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.530]
Obviously you needed, but don't let it get you down.

[00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.510]
No, it's gonna be a good present.

[00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.190]
There you go.

[00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.730]
All right.

[00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:35.190]
Thank you.

[00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.230]
Have a great holiday.

[00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.290]
Bye-bye.

[00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.830]
Open line of dates, 751-1 and Broward, 524.

[00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:58.530]
Oh, no!

[00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.410]
Okay.

[00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.850]
Oh, sadamee.

[00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.190]
Peter Puff, 4, Caboose Ride.

[00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:26.290]
Arch back, 4, unbending knee.

[00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.990]
Oh, sadamee.

[00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.450]
The front door's the back side.

[00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:39.570]
Just go and ask to do a deal.

[00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.090]
He's long as my face is in the Senate, you'll have a seat.

[00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:48.590]
People without health care, folks lacking livelihood.

[00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:55.590]
The way they act is really what is looong.

[00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:03.190]
Well, there's Helms, the model specter, and Hornet Bob Pack would.

[00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.330]
Oh!

[00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:10.470]
No matter where you stick it, we get screwed.

[00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:17.950]
Look at me, the Senate's lost its mind.

[00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:23.330]
There's longer drugs than crime, God knows.

[00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:32.050]
Look at me, they're saving all mankind.

[00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.870]
With hearings on Felicia.

[00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.270]
No review of 1993 would be complete without a little sadamee.

[00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.250]
No question about that.

[00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.670]
Make all those right-wingers nervous and excited.

[00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:57.170]
I've already gone through two things of these halls-mental liptus, by the way.

[00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.890]
These are outstanding.

[00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.390]
My whole life revolves around fix and halls-mental liptus.

[00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.110]
We have an open line indeed, and Chris, 751.

[00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.390]
Oh, now forget about Chris.

[00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.370]
Chris is like a nice guy, but definitely jailbait.

[00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.590]
What the hell was he doing here yesterday?

[00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.890]
Open line and Broward, 5249463.

[00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:17.630]
Let's go to Tampa.

[00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.270]
Hello.

[00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:19.870]
Hello, Neil.

[00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:20.450]
Yes.

[00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.790]
Can you tell me what these guys are thinking about this run and run?

[00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:24.950]
What does that mean?

[00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.390]
A negative call about run and run on SUN.

[00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.130]
Are you crazy?

[00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.950]
They are an FM show.

[00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:32.490]
What does that mean?

[00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:33.570]
They aren't...

[00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.390]
What difference does it make if they're on FM or PM?

[00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.230]
It's the same show.

[00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.190]
I can't even believe I'm going to say this, but it's almost an ingenious move,

[00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:45.870]
a way to get people in that market who are definitely locked into FM to turn over to AM.

[00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.990]
Why do they have to have two flush stations that could make you guys on FM?

[00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.850]
Well, that's never going to happen.

[00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:56.070]
And don't you understand their philosophy about FM is that it's got to be a jukebox.

[00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.210]
Don't you understand that?

[00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.270]
They want FM to crank out big bucks at the lowest possible overhead,

[00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.570]
and that's their whole philosophy about FM.

[00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.270]
If you walk down the hall over here, we got right next door is the coast,

[00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.050]
and a little few feet further down the hall is hot 105.

[00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.770]
They got people sitting in their readings, three by five cards, pumping out the slush,

[00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.990]
and that's the right and pouring money through there like a monkey grinder,

[00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.490]
and that's the idea of FM.

[00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.050]
Don't you understand this company?

[00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:21.830]
I don't understand.

[00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:25.350]
If they would have left us on Y&F, and if then then they would have done this thing

[00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:29.070]
and put while Ron and Ron on the morning back on Y&F, we could have had a 10 share,

[00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.770]
we could own the market over there.

[00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.570]
If they're trying to be so much like Howard, Howard's on FM.

[00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:38.390]
Yeah. Well, if they really had, if they really had balls, they put Howard on both on F.

[00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.130]
You went in the morning, and over here on IUD in the morning, but they don't have any.

[00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.810]
They don't have any.

[00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:42.270]
No, none.

[00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.330]
And like I said before, they could get Howard on both stations for I'm sure less

[00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.350]
than what they're going to pay these two bozos, but they'll get good numbers.

[00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.730]
They'll get big numbers over there.

[00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.530]
And why they have to get rid of Rick and Suds, why couldn't they just put blob

[00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.690]
reading three by five cards somewhere if they had to keep his contract?

[00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.410]
Beats a hell out of me.

[00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.910]
They feel that blob is the, he is the Tampa Bay.

[00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.270]
He's what Tampa Bay is all about.

[00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:05.750]
Which is a hell of a prize.

[00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.870]
Are they any Christ?

[00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.750]
Okay. Good luck to you, sir.

[00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:09.130]
Have a.

[00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.230]
666 to you.

[00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.910]
We have an open line on the green line.

[00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:12.430]
Nice day.

[00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.470]
He was going to save a great holiday.

[00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.350]
And back to you, sir.

[00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.690]
1-800-944-9463.

[00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.330]
1235-WIOD, WSUN.

[00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.830]
It's the latest news from the 610-WIOD News Center each hour.

[00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.730]
Plus an update on traffic and the current weather forecast.

[00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:40.350]
But if I am guilty of anything, it is of giving all that I have to give.

[00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:46.270]
My penis, my buttocks, my lower torso, thighs, and any other error.

[00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.230]
That they wanted to help shoot in all over the world.

[00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:54.310]
Young men, running up and down courts, I love young men.

[00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:54.750]
Oh!

[00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:57.910]
Wearing really tight shorts, they're so sweaty.

[00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:04.430]
When they jump through the air and they don't have an underwear.

[00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:06.090]
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

[00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:06.350]
Okay.

[00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.490]
It's time again for some great NBA.

[00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:14.190]
Can't wait to watch a mock play NBA.

[00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.070]
They think it's at all going to watch a playball.

[00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.830]
I'm so happy that it's at full.

[00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.290]
It's time again for some great NBA.

[00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.430]
Can't wait to watch a mock play NBA.

[00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:32.370]
They think it's at full.

[00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.010]
Going to watch a playball.

[00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.670]
I'm so happy that it's at full.

[00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.270]
It's time again for some great NBA.

[00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.550]
So let me ask you, that was MOLO who used to do the morning show a really bad one.

[00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.110]
He was the most aptly named guy in radio.

[00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.730]
He walked right here with a 10 gallon hat and everybody who listened to that station thought he was a black dude.

[00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.110]
He had a 10.

[00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:51.750]
But what happened to him?

[00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.650]
He got canned with a 10.

[00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:54.570]
He went to New Mexico.

[00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:56.450]
He went to New Mexico, a perfect place for him.

[00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.650]
Maybe he came a priest.

[00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.070]
So he can watch those young men dribble all over the court.

[00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.770]
Here's a lady in Hollywood.

[00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.210]
Hello.

[00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.830]
Hello.

[00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.090]
It's my phone.

[00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.650]
It's screwed up.

[00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:08.170]
How are you?

[00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.050]
How are you?

[00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:09.610]
Great.

[00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.750]
We were going to get a little of a clump about how ill you were.

[00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:13.750]
I'm alright.

[00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.250]
Just a little plugged up.

[00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:16.770]
I'm calling about guiding light.

[00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:17.390]
Okay.

[00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.090]
The reason I'm calling, my husband and I were, I tape it every day and we were watching it.

[00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:21.610]
Right.

[00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:22.050]
Good morning.

[00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:27.410]
And my husband asked me, he said, is there anyone Jewish on the soap opera?

[00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.250]
And I said, no.

[00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:32.530]
I don't think so.

[00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.050]
And he said, I think you ought to call me, oh.

[00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.390]
And ask him if there's anybody Jewish on any soap opera.

[00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.610]
And what is your opinion?

[00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:41.830]
That's a good question.

[00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.450]
Because I have never seen anyone with a Yamakal on.

[00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.570]
Maybe Blacky back when he was on guiding light, John Stamos, but I think he's Greek.

[00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:50.370]
Yeah.

[00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.890]
But I do believe he's sick of size.

[00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:55.950]
I've never said they've got every sort of nationality, including Jews on guiding light.

[00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.730]
They even had a gay character on one life to live or one of those soap operas.

[00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:03.770]
They had a kid who was accused of doing it with a priest, which I know is very unusual.

[00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.430]
But so they've had everything except Jews on soap operas.

[00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.970]
That's correct.

[00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.170]
You didn't see anybody celebrating Hanukkah, didn't you?

[00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:11.090]
Isn't that interesting?

[00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.150]
We just thought that we would ask your opinions.

[00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:14.290]
Never thought about that before.

[00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:15.210]
We got Black people.

[00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:17.850]
Do we have any Mexicans?

[00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.230]
Well, we had Rafe on that show that went off the year.

[00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.170]
What was the name of that show, George?

[00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.550]
And we liked so much that went off?

[00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.470]
Santa Barbara?

[00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:24.130]
Santa Barbara.

[00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:24.670]
There you go.

[00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.690]
Did you watch that?

[00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.590]
No, I didn't.

[00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:27.710]
Oh, like I said.

[00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.050]
There was some interesting people on Santa Barbara.

[00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:30.850]
That's why it went off.

[00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.430]
But I don't know if any Jews on any soap opera.

[00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.410]
My husband's actually wondering about that.

[00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:38.730]
Yeah.

[00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.590]
Because the only ones he sees are the ones that I tape.

[00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:47.010]
Well, since those days in Germany Jews get very nervous when they get too close to bars, certain types of bars of soap.

[00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.270]
That could be.

[00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.370]
They may have something to do with it.

[00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:50.570]
Stay away from those soaps.

[00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.830]
I don't know if you get on satellite, but no guiding light today.

[00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:53.490]
No.

[00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:54.610]
No, it's not.

[00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:55.330]
It's not on period.

[00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:55.870]
Right.

[00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:56.970]
It's preempted by what?

[00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.110]
What kind of crap have they got on?

[00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.050]
College football.

[00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.330]
Yeah, they got football on.

[00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.010]
And see, this is the deal now.

[00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.210]
We got all this the college football and bull game.

[00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.730]
So it's going to be very sparse.

[00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:10.930]
And that's why it's going to take a real loyal and dedicated fan like you and I to find out where the hell it is.

[00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.110]
That's why yesterday they gave us yesterday was like a Friday show.

[00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.090]
Yes, exactly.

[00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.370]
Because at the end of the show, she walks in the apartment.

[00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.850]
And there's Roger in the dark.

[00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.810]
And there's, oh, my God, her eyes come bulging out of her forehead.

[00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.630]
And he's all disheveled and unshaven.

[00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.170]
And it's enough to make you pee in your pantaloonies.

[00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.710]
A little bit of grime on his teeth.

[00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:29.110]
Yeah.

[00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:30.050]
Slimey.

[00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:33.650]
And don't you wonder with his arm is fling how he decorated the whole tree?

[00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:34.950]
Yeah, he decorated the tree.

[00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.230]
He wrapped the Christmas gift.

[00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.190]
He put it under the tree.

[00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:38.730]
He's eating cookies and milk.

[00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.970]
I mean, what probably called out for a couple of pizzas and dominoes?

[00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.210]
And he also called the fire.

[00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.170]
He built the fire.

[00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.570]
Beautiful.

[00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.610]
I mean, boy, he just thinks of everything.

[00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.270]
Only on that show can they do it.

[00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.450]
Well, Neil, we want to wish you Zygazone and the same to you.

[00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:50.550]

[00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.690]
And take care.

[00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:53.390]
And you too.

[00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:53.750]
All right.

[00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:54.430]
Bye-bye.

[00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.430]
As a matter of fact, speaking of yesterday being like a Friday show on Guiding Light,

[00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.810]
I'm at the track last night at Pompa No Park, which I had finally a pretty decent night.

[00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:02.230]
Thank you.

[00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.210]
And just missed by a nose of having a very big night.

[00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.770]
But anyway, I'm thinking to myself, this is Friday.

[00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:14.050]
I mean, yesterday I was positive that yesterday, in fact, I'm convinced today is Saturday.

[00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.710]
I'm sitting here right now and I'm thinking about like, what day is it?

[00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:17.590]
It's got to be Saturday.

[00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.830]
I was so sure I was confident that it was Friday.

[00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.630]
I never go to the track on Thursday night.

[00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:23.870]
I'm always there on Friday night.

[00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.150]
It felt like a Friday.

[00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.270]
It looked like a Friday.

[00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.330]
It had to be a Friday.

[00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.390]
And then this morning, the alarm went off and I said, crap, it's Friday.

[00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:39.610]
By the way, within about next 10, 12 minutes, Mike Netalsha be showing up here with my buska Unimo Head CD from Luis Miguel, allegedly.

[00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.770]
And if he doesn't, George is in for a real big surprise, like I'm driving the Toyota home today.

[00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.350]
Anyway, here's Carl Springs on the Star Line.

[00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:46.690]
Hello.

[00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:48.270]
Neil.

[00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:48.930]
Yes, sir.

[00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.350]
Nora on one life for live.

[00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.770]
Nora is Jewish?

[00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.650]
Yes, she did.

[00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:54.150]
Hey, shut up.

[00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:54.470]
I'm Nora.

[00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.110]
I'm last week and everything like that.

[00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.470]
Nora with a menorah.

[00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:57.550]

[00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.190]
Kena Hora.

[00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:58.930]
Exactly.

[00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.730]
And she used to be married to this black guy on there and they have a daughter.

[00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:04.270]
The Jewish and black.

[00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:04.930]
Oh, hey, V.

[00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.790]
So there's your right.

[00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:10.070]
Not that they're pandering or there's any tokenism on that show, right?

[00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.770]
No, not at all.

[00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.350]
Outstanding.

[00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.370]
Thank you so much.

[00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:13.110]
Happy holidays, sir.

[00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.370]
And same to you, Zagazone.

[00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:14.890]
Thank you.

[00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:15.330]
Okay.

[00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.350]
Open line on the Star Line.

[00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:18.830]
That's what we always say in Christmas, isn't it?

[00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:19.270]
Zagazone?

[00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.170]
Something like that.

[00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:21.330]
Orgazone height.

[00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.190]
Here's the Lady in Tamarack.

[00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.450]
No, there's no Lady in Tamarack.

[00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.030]
She's long gone.

[00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:25.910]
She just crapped out.

[00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:27.590]
Maybe she was going to tell me the same thing.

[00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:28.010]
Probably.

[00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:29.630]
One of our soap ladies.

[00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.990]
Open line and Broward.

[00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.030]
524 soap.

[00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.310]
Let's do a Sarasota.

[00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:33.810]
Hello.

[00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.590]
Hi.

[00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:35.010]
Hi.

[00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:41.190]
I'm wondering if you can play the song parody, the Christmas song parody that goes to God Resty Mary

[00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.610]
gentlemen.

[00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:46.550]
And it's about the guy that wants to catch a little creep who had the nerve to switch the sign

[00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.370]
on the restroom door.

[00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.010]
What is that?

[00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.230]
Is that a Rick and Suds thing, maybe?

[00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.930]
I don't know who thinks it, but it's really funny and it's really good.

[00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:55.970]
Where did you hear it?

[00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:57.930]
Oh, unfortunately I heard it on a campus station.

[00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.730]
I heard it last year.

[00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.690]
Last year?

[00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.370]
Yes, so I haven't heard it this year.

[00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:04.730]
But I know it exists.

[00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:05.470]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:10.090]
Well, if I can figure out what you're talking about, I'll see if we got it.

[00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:11.310]
Okay?

[00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.530]
Have a happy.

[00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:13.290]
Great, thank you.

[00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:13.670]
Bye-bye.

[00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.930]
Bye.

[00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.750]
Why?

[00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.370]
We have an open line at Dave, one on the star line and one on the green line.

[00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.810]
This is good.

[00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.410]
It's going to start thinning out just a little bit.

[00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.010]
It's got to.

[00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.670]
It just has to.

[00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.410]
It can't maintain like this all the way through to two.

[00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.770]
Save your calls for jazz.

[00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.910]
McKay, he's going to be here from two to six to Sanfordone.

[00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.010]
He's going to do something.

[00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:28.770]
I'm confident.

[00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.630]
I know he's just been kind of laying back.

[00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.490]
I know he's coming in right now on his Harley and he's getting ready to do something a little

[00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.550]
bit more than Titty bars and drugs and bikers.

[00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:38.950]
Okay, the man has got a tremendous amount of experience in the business.

[00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.690]
He's had a vast and varied life and I know that we're going to hear a lot of it today.

[00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.930]
Right?

[00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.390]
We hope.

[00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:44.430]
I'm sure of it.

[00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:49.230]
Anyway, did she have that thing in the computer by the way?

[00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:50.170]
Wait a minute.

[00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.330]
Is jazz in the computer?

[00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.970]
I would sure hate to steal anything from Randy because she gets very upset about that by the way.

[00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:01.310]
I mean, stuff has been stolen for me so much I couldn't even begin to document it at this point and who could care less.

[00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:07.710]
But boy, she is uptight and possessive and hostile about people stealing her crap in a computer or anywhere else.

[00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:12.750]
I don't think she must have it on a cart so I can't steal that thing.

[00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:14.030]
Hello.

[00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:15.770]
Who is this?

[00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.550]
Who's this?

[00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.490]
This is DFO.

[00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:18.410]
DFO.

[00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:19.010]
Yeah.

[00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.950]
This is Jeff DeForest who called to wish everybody Merry Christmas ladies and gentlemen.

[00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:23.870]
Hey.

[00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.230]
How you doing, Jeff?

[00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:28.150]
I'm doing okay Neil.

[00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:29.170]
How did you make out of the track last night?

[00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.550]
How did what?

[00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.010]
How did you make out of the track last night?

[00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:32.610]
Not too bad.

[00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.350]
Had a wedding night last night for a change.

[00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.230]
Hey, you know what?

[00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.770]
I've got a Bosoic move.

[00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.090]
I've got a turn down my radio.

[00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:39.890]
Oh, turn that radio down.

[00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.330]
What do you say?

[00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:40.750]
I'm not doing that too.

[00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:41.350]
You don't agree.

[00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.670]
Please turn that radio down, sir.

[00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:44.350]
What are you giving away to get all these calls?

[00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:45.270]
Dead meat.

[00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:47.570]
Called middle-level management.

[00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.350]
That was the sixth horse that you gave me last night.

[00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.590]
Right.

[00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:51.450]
That was dead meat.

[00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.030]
It's been a good night last night.

[00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:53.490]
Did you?

[00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:53.930]
Yeah.

[00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.490]
Rich is hitting the computer, huh?

[00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.070]
Rich is doing okay.

[00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:02.350]
He had a bad night till the last race and he pulled it right out of his butt which is quite an accomplishment in his case and they had a decent night.

[00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:03.830]
That's kind of a cavernous area.

[00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.410]
It is.

[00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.350]
A lot of winners in there believe me.

[00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.630]
So what are you doing to celebrate Christmas?

[00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.450]
Working right here.

[00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:10.310]
It's on him again.

[00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.030]
I'll be here tonight.

[00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.290]
What did you call for, Jeff?

[00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.270]
I actually called to get a phone number but you got to pick up the line.

[00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.830]
From George?

[00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:17.190]
Next thing you know I'm on here.

[00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.970]
From George?

[00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:18.590]
From George?

[00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.590]
Well, hang on a second.

[00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.050]
All right.

[00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:21.510]
And happy grace your holidays, Jeff.

[00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:22.150]
Thank you very much.

[00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:22.550]
Hang on.

[00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.530]
Okay, he'll be on tonight by the way.

[00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:24.830]
D-fo.

[00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.690]
We have an open line in date and one on the star line at star I-o-d.

[00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:29.510]
I'm just picking up all the lines today.

[00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.970]
When I see something hot flash and I'm just grabbing it.

[00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:33.810]
Here's Kendall.

[00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.190]
Hello.

[00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:35.170]
Oh, I'm not really me.

[00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:36.050]
Okay, hang on.

[00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:37.090]
He's working on it.

[00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.550]
He's getting working up to a crescendo.

[00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:39.750]
Lauderdale.

[00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.390]
Hey.

[00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.910]
Yeah.

[00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.710]
And happy Christmas to you, sir.

[00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:44.950]
Well, Merry Christmas to you.

[00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:45.650]
And Merry New Year.

[00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.830]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:49.450]
I'm not going to be able to make it to my home this Christmas.

[00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:54.350]
So I'm going to spend it here listening to you and asking I got one request.

[00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.390]
Okay, where's your home?

[00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.870]
Well, my home is, well, I live in Nashville.

[00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:58.970]
I called you before.

[00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.790]
Oh, you live in Nashville.

[00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:00.850]
You're not going to be able to get there.

[00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.850]
What a good break for you.

[00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:03.050]
Why?

[00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.790]
This must be your lucky year, pal.

[00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.430]
No, my parents live up in Philly and that's where I go every year.

[00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:08.850]
Uh-huh.

[00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.150]
But my request is the Allen Sherman deal from the guitar man.

[00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:18.170]
And I want to ask you to not to go into detail, but what happened?

[00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:21.690]
What exactly happened with the guitar man that he's not doing anything?

[00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.710]
Well, what happened is that boy Gary decided since we were desperate for somebody on the weekend.

[00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.790]
And Joey had driven away the entire weekend audience.

[00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.930]
And he was going to start taking listeners and making them into talks, your host.

[00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.770]
And he put guitar man on a few weekends and kind of like, you know,

[00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:36.450]
I just, uh, it was sad.

[00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.030]
It was desperate.

[00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.010]
And of course, once you put a guy on the ear who's been doing creative stuff for everybody else,

[00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.110]
he's going to start doing all this stuff for himself.

[00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.570]
And so it was like shutting off our water.

[00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.770]
And since that time, we haven't had one other piece of material.

[00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.170]
Which one is it, the Allen Sherman one?

[00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.810]
What's the name of that?

[00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:55.150]
Uh, I can't remember, but it's one that, uh,

[00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:58.290]
da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

[00:33:58.290 --> 00:33:59.570]
You know, which one I'm talking about now?

[00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.390]
I can't remember the name of that.

[00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.350]
What is the name of that, George?

[00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.730]
That Allen Sherman one that he does?

[00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.030]
Your Uncle, uh, Uncle Max.

[00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:05.970]
Oh, yeah, that's it.

[00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.030]
I thought of it myself.

[00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:07.890]
Yeah.

[00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:08.370]
Beautiful.

[00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:09.250]
I'm proud of myself.

[00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.310]
I must be making a comeback.

[00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:11.190]
How about that?

[00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.710]
Okay.

[00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.110]
Listen, have a great holiday, pal.

[00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:14.850]
Well, you're going to be here Monday, right?

[00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.430]
Yes, sir.

[00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:16.290]
Oh, great.

[00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.650]
Good.

[00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.190]
At least I have something to listen to.

[00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:20.670]
And by the way, too, I wanted to, uh,

[00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.790]
I was going to say the same thing that, uh,

[00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:26.530]
Starline caller said about the Jewish, uh, they, uh,

[00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.590]
they are again in it, Jewish, on one life, deliver.

[00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.170]
All right.

[00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.010]
Um, you know, also, uh,

[00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.570]
let's see how it is on AM in some places.

[00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:35.510]
Right, absolutely.

[00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:38.550]
Hey, listen, whether it's on AM or FM or PM or Sherway,

[00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:39.610]
if it's good, it's good.

[00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:40.190]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.270]
That's very true.

[00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.750]
It's like Halifah, whether it's on a plate or a platter

[00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.570]
or on the palm of your hand, it's delicious.

[00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:46.310]
There you go.

[00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:46.990]
Have a good one, pal.

[00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:47.470]
Thank you.

[00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:47.890]
See ya.

[00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.170]
Bye.

[00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.510]
I sell a line of jingles.

[00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.510]
And I travel on the road.

[00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.970]
Oh!

[00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.230]
And I have a lot of instruments.

[00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:58.550]
Just like Sally.

[00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.070]
What a load.

[00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:03.390]
Every day, a new routine.

[00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:05.550]
Another song in that.

[00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:08.990]
Early in the morning,

[00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.410]
I mail Neil a bit again.

[00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.330]
But when I get that writer's block,

[00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:18.250]
the words refuse to flow.

[00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.230]
I take a trip to Halendale,

[00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.610]
where life is really slow.

[00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:28.030]
I drive into the publics,

[00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:31.510]
and I find some parking rooms.

[00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.070]
And they entrance,

[00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.150]
and the crutches turn and holler.

[00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.030]
Kakamon.

[00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.250]
Shake hands with your uncle,

[00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:48.130]

[00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.090]

[00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:49.630]

[00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:51.210]
And you remember,

[00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:52.110]

[00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:52.570]
that's her,

[00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:53.570]
things old as girl.

[00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:54.970]
And you remember,

[00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:56.170]
the Tashmintons,

[00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.410]
Gerald and Jerome.

[00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:59.830]
We've all come here to greet you,

[00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.610]
and to wish you welcome home.

[00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:02.590]
Meet Mara,

[00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.650]

[00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:04.050]
it's Shalman,

[00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.790]
it's Perver and Gerber and Steiner and Stone.

[00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.850]
Mosque, it's Louvre,

[00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.490]

[00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.970]

[00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.850]

[00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:09.690]
and Freeman and Hope.

[00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:10.650]
Swallow, swallow,

[00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:11.770]
it's Tyna, my 11,

[00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:12.290]
my 11,

[00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:13.210]
Lovensky, Lovina,

[00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:13.670]
Levine,

[00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:14.910]
Rumberger, Schlumberger,

[00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:15.850]
Mekes and Piggas,

[00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:16.750]
it's Dine with the E.

[00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:17.810]
I just dine with the Y.

[00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.850]
Now, here's your uncle,

[00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:21.710]
souled my boy,

[00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:23.130]
with all the family poop.

[00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:24.150]
And his,

[00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:25.270]
it's cousin Randy,

[00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.130]
with her goddamn chicken soup.

[00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:27.290]
Oh!

[00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.250]
Whenever you're on the road,

[00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:30.170]
my boy,

[00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:34.030]
come back and see us soon.

[00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.430]
For I'll be here,

[00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.250]
when you come back,

[00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.570]
to wish you,

[00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.150]
come home.

[00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.390]
Beauty, let's do a mobile real quick in Miami.

[00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:51.790]
Hello?

[00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:52.870]
Hello?

[00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:53.470]
Dale?

[00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:54.050]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.870]
Yeah, I want to give you a heavily ham update.

[00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:56.410]
Okay.

[00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.090]
I was online for a half hours,

[00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.530]
they're doing a booming business.

[00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:01.670]
And I want to thank you.

[00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.970]
Are you there?

[00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.470]
I'm here.

[00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.290]
Okay, I want to thank you for the ham.

[00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:05.870]
Okay.

[00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.430]
But they're doing a heck of a business,

[00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.170]
if you're going to get a ham for the holiday,

[00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.390]
you better get online now.

[00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:10.930]
Okay.

[00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:11.830]
All right, have a nice day.

[00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:12.190]
See ya.

[00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.310]
Okay, there's little heavily ham reports.

[00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.190]
You only show in America where you get like a meat report

[00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.970]
in the middle of the show.

[00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.010]
We have an open line in date and one in Broward.

[00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.010]
It's 12.51 at WIOD and WS.

[00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:22.310]
You went.

[00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.950]
This afternoon at two, it's Rick and Suds.

[00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.730]
Then it's six.

[00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.250]
It's sports talk, six ten.

[00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.310]
New stock radio, six ten.

[00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:33.450]
WIOD.

[00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:36.050]
1253 at WIOD.

[00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.390]
Here's our good friend Lee Ryan in Prescott, Arizona,

[00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.370]
who must be desperate on the day before Christmas.

[00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:40.770]
Hello?

[00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:42.650]
Hey, Mary Christmas, Uncle Lee.

[00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.790]
Yeah, the same to you, Lee.

[00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:44.710]
Guess what?

[00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.230]
What?

[00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.410]
I'm going to San Diego Monday night.

[00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.290]
To see us kick some ass, we hope.

[00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.050]
Absolutely.

[00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:50.810]
Yeah.

[00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:51.590]
I am.

[00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.530]
You don't sound real excited about that anymore.

[00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:56.090]
Well, confidence is a little bit diminished lately.

[00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.930]
You know, we've had three brutal games in a row

[00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.670]
and we're just not going to get overly optimistic.

[00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.610]
Okay.

[00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.670]
Well, I'm going there so they've got, they've better win.

[00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:05.830]
Or else.

[00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.350]
They better win or else they better win.

[00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.410]
We're hoping for the best.

[00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:10.150]
We're not going to build up our hopes and then we hope

[00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.810]
to be pleasantly surprised.

[00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.270]
There we go.

[00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:12.710]
Right.

[00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.390]
And else, they won't be going to the Super Bowl.

[00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.810]
Or much of anyplace else.

[00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:16.470]
There you go.

[00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.050]
How's the hockey team doing?

[00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:20.150]
The hockey team is kicking some serious ass.

[00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.550]
We beat the Red Hot New York Rangers on Wednesday night

[00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.530]
and broke Mike Richter's goalie streak.

[00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.510]
That is unbeaten streak.

[00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.870]
We beat him three to two, the hottest team in the league.

[00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.970]
And we're writing the thick of the fight for the playoffs

[00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:30.910]
and we're doing great.

[00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:31.990]
Fantastic.

[00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.950]
Well, that sounds very exciting.

[00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:34.810]
We're going to be the best expansion team in the history

[00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.070]
of sports by the end of the season.

[00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.710]
I do believe.

[00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:38.910]
So how are the tickets sales going?

[00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.610]
Everybody buying tickets?

[00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:42.030]
Three sellouts in a row.

[00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:43.090]
Wow.

[00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.590]
And we've broken the season.

[00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:47.670]
The tenants record each one of those three games.

[00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.750]
That's fantastic.

[00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:49.530]
Packing them in.

[00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.150]
That's all the knee sails out there.

[00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:53.490]
Remember family last summer?

[00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:54.550]
Well, they're awful to crap.

[00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.630]
You know how this town is.

[00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:56.710]
I tell you what.

[00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:59.230]
Well, I'm enjoying living in Arizona, Uncle Neil.

[00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.830]
My kids are flourishing out here.

[00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:02.770]
We've got just a little bit of snow in the ground

[00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.810]
to make it Christmassy.

[00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.830]
Don't have any snow yet, but I'll tell you.

[00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:07.970]
She's as cold as hell here.

[00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.150]
Well, it's really, really cold.

[00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.370]
It's gray and it's cold.

[00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.230]
And it's going to be in the 40s over the weekend.

[00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.890]
So those people are always screaming about,

[00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:16.930]
well, I missed the north.

[00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.170]
They won't get the snow, but they'll get plenty cold.

[00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.090]
I'll freeze the rest off.

[00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:21.090]
Well, there you go.

[00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:22.050]
There you go.

[00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:25.390]
Well, I just wanted to share that I will be in road 22

[00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:26.210]
in the end zone.

[00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.150]
So look for our signs.

[00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:29.830]
And I wasn't that far from you last weekend.

[00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.050]
I was out there in Vegas for my Luis Miguel concert in Caesars.

[00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.070]
And I got to see the grand opening of the MGM Grand,

[00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.870]
which is the most amazing place I've ever seen.

[00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:38.730]
Oh, I bet.

[00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:42.390]
I'm dying to go to Vegas now because it looks like it's changed so much.

[00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:43.890]
Oh, you wouldn't even recognize it.

[00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:44.850]
I was the last time you were there.

[00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:45.430]
Never.

[00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:46.750]
You've never been there?

[00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:47.150]
I've never.

[00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.610]
Well, I guess you wouldn't recognize it.

[00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:50.450]
You could drop me down the level.

[00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:51.890]
How could you be in Prescott, Arizona?

[00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:53.430]
You've never been to Vegas, Lee.

[00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:57.310]
Well, after the holidays, we're going at, I want to go to Tahoe, too.

[00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:58.530]
Forget about Tahoe.

[00:39:58.610 --> 00:39:59.910]
Just go to Vegas for the time being.

[00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:00.430]
Believe me.

[00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:01.010]
Okay.

[00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.170]
Be the highlight of your life.

[00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:03.690]
I'll take your word for it.

[00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:04.590]
What do you have a great holiday?

[00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:05.730]
Okay, and hey, thanks.

[00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:06.830]
Great CD.

[00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.410]
And kick some ass for us Monday.

[00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:09.290]
Oh, we will.

[00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:11.290]
We'll be root for him.

[00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:11.590]
Okay.

[00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.750]
Bye, my Christmas.

[00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:13.390]
Same to you.

[00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.530]
She sounds like she really misses it here, you know?

[00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:17.650]
I can't imagine why.

[00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.390]
But if I were in Prescott, Arizona, I might miss almost any place.

[00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:23.550]
We have an open line in Broward to, indeed, starting to slow down a little bit.

[00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.510]
How's Mike doing with my CD, by the way?

[00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.450]
Here it's 12.56.

[00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:31.190]
And 12.35, George says, in 20 minutes, he's going to be here with your CD.

[00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:34.650]
And here it's 12.56, which looks like 19 minutes.

[00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.430]
Huh?

[00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:36.090]
20.

[00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.290]
It looks like 29 minutes.

[00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:38.830]
It looks like hours.

[00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:40.410]
He'll be here any second, right?

[00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.170]
Here is maybe got intercepted by jazz.

[00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:44.570]
Maybe he picked him up on his Honda.

[00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.530]
Here's Kendall.

[00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:45.870]
Hello.

[00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.050]
Not ready yet, Neil.

[00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:48.370]
Nah, still working on it.

[00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:52.370]
Two open lines are both in Dade County, 751-9463.

[00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.090]
Here's a lady mobile in Davy.

[00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:54.970]
Hi, Neil.

[00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.430]
Hello.

[00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:56.810]
And back to you.

[00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.710]
Hi, how are you?

[00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.290]
Great.

[00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.190]
I'm glad you had a great time in Vegas.

[00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.790]
The best.

[00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.930]
We're going to Vegas, right?

[00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.370]
Only good health would have improved it.

[00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:04.430]
Yeah, too bad.

[00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:08.430]
Well, I want to say Merry Christmas to you and happy New Year.

[00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:10.870]
And maybe you'll have a healthy 94.

[00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.130]
I sure hope so.

[00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.770]
Love you.

[00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:13.150]
Bye.

[00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.210]
Bye, bye.

[00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:15.070]
Bye now.

[00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:17.170]
Open line of day one and Broward.

[00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.290]
Oh, that'll help.

[00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:22.010]
Tomorrow, by the way, we got like Christmas programs all the way till noon.

[00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:24.230]
Huh?

[00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:25.450]
Oh, I see.

[00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.190]
I don't get it.

[00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:27.650]
I just don't understand this whole thing.

[00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.830]
Oh, special Christmas programming to noon.

[00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:33.830]
And then from, I don't understand the whole thing.

[00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.450]
Till one o'clock in the afternoon, then jazz will be here from 1 to 6.

[00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.790]
Sports talk with Kim Bo Campo, Ritzix.

[00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.590]
Special.

[00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:40.130]
Oh, that's right.

[00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:40.610]
Tomorrow night.

[00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.470]
How could I forget is the Adam and Marvin show?

[00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.970]
I knew there was something on here that I was scouring for.

[00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.230]
It's Adam and Marvin.

[00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.730]
It's called the Luzier License Show from 8 to midnight tomorrow night.

[00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:50.490]
And then the best of it.

[00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.290]
Is it from, yeah, till midnight, then the best of Randy for still on the year.

[00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:55.550]
Here's a date city.

[00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:55.870]
Hello.

[00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.930]
Hello, Neil.

[00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:57.490]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:58.350 --> 00:41:59.570]
Merry depressing Christmas.

[00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:00.610]
Are you depressed?

[00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.650]
Oh, man.

[00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:02.470]
About one.

[00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:05.510]
Uh, this S.U.N.

[00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:08.890]
Which is, uh, how much of crap?

[00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:10.630]
Coming this bunch of crap.

[00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:11.910]
Sound like your doctor's dying.

[00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:12.150]
Oh, man.

[00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.810]
This sound really depressed.

[00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.670]
This is terrible.

[00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:17.210]
Sound like he just got through listening to the lobby or so depressed.

[00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:19.770]
Well, Bob was on today.

[00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.370]
Yeah.

[00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:21.090]
He was not taped.

[00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:21.990]
Yeah, what the hell was that?

[00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:23.450]
There was another Ojón for Vodka tour.

[00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:24.650]
We get more of that crap from him.

[00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:28.590]
Well, well, for starters, he was, uh, he had something on there for like three hours.

[00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:29.410]
I don't know what it was.

[00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:31.190]
Some type of poem type.

[00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:32.390]
I don't know.

[00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:33.410]
What on a tape?

[00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:35.450]
Uh, I didn't hear that.

[00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.010]
But he had a poem for three hours?

[00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.030]
The last hour of the show he took calls.

[00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.650]
Yeah.

[00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.650]
And, uh, that's when I heard the poem.

[00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:45.250]
Well, what do you mean some sort of a poem?

[00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:45.850]
What does that mean?

[00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.530]
I don't know.

[00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.370]
It was something about his like Christmas.

[00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:54.010]
Something about his, uh, some Christmas deal that he had or something.

[00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:54.950]
I don't know what it was about.

[00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:56.030]
Everybody was calling him.

[00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:57.170]
Oh, it was great.

[00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:58.730]
I want to copy and on and on.

[00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:59.590]
Oh, it was terrible.

[00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:00.310]
It was something else.

[00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.690]
It was something else.

[00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:01.190]
I don't know what it was.

[00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:02.890]
Uh, little Hollywood.

[00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:03.590]
What do you depressed about?

[00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:04.250]
I don't understand.

[00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.890]
You depressed it.

[00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.010]
Ron and Ron are going to be on.

[00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:06.970]
No, that's okay.

[00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.530]
Yeah.

[00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.170]
The recon suds part is the depressing part.

[00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.710]
Yeah.

[00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.570]
And I mean, like drop blob, you know, and like,

[00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:17.310]
get rid of him.

[00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:17.730]
Yeah.

[00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:18.870]
Now they love a man.

[00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:20.370]
He fits in there like a glove they figure.

[00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:20.850]
We'll see.

[00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:22.370]
A little bit of hockey talk.

[00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:22.870]
Okay.

[00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.370]
You all have a guy that you'll just brought in.

[00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:31.810]
I guess to help on some injured list or something like that.

[00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:32.770]
His name's Aikens.

[00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:33.990]
Aikens.

[00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:34.290]
Yeah.

[00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:36.190]
You will Aikens?

[00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:36.790]
No, I think it's...

[00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:37.310]
Birds in the bees?

[00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.290]
I think his name is, his first name is Dallas.

[00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:41.870]
Dallas Aikens?

[00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:42.710]
Yeah.

[00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:43.870]
Oh, that's from Cincinnati.

[00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:44.790]
From the minor leagues.

[00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:45.850]
I don't think he hasn't played though.

[00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.710]
He hasn't played.

[00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:47.110]
No.

[00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:48.590]
He's from Dave City.

[00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:49.290]
Is he?

[00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:49.650]
Yeah.

[00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:50.470]
Well, I'll be down.

[00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.530]
He's the only NHL hockey player from Florida.

[00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:54.210]
Right.

[00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:55.070]
And...

[00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.550]
Well, we'll keep our eye peeled for him.

[00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:57.050]
Yeah.

[00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:58.770]
We'll keep your eye peeled for Chris.

[00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:02.010]
My mom knows his mother and she doesn't like Matt Hill.

[00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:03.830]
Well, I'll say hi to him for it.

[00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:04.210]
I got to run.

[00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.190]
Have a great holiday, pal.

[00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:06.930]
Well, I'll see you in Orlando now.

[00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:07.370]
Okay.

I, Luis Miguel.

[00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:05.050]
See.

Squared, Squared.

[00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:16.530]
I remember you, your beautiful freedom.

[00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:22.910]
And the wind differently to the sea.

[00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:32.290]
I remember you, leaving you looking at you.

[00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:40.230]
And the day you were born, you were born and you were born and you were born.

[00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:45.830]
And the wind, the wind, you were born and you were born.

[00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.690]
I don't know how I felt.

[00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:52.470]
I don't know how I felt.

[00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:53.910]
I don't know if I was born.

[00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.050]
I don't know if I was born.

[00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:00.550]
I don't know if I was born.

[00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:11.690]
You were born and you were born and you were born and you were born.

[00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:25.490]
I remember you, playing in love.

[00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:40.910]
I remember you, playing in love.

[00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:42.990]
I remember you, playing in love.

[00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.890]
I don't know if I was born.

[00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:45.810]
I don't know if I was born.

[00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:51.570]
I don't know if I was born.

[00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.670]
I don't know how I felt.

[00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.970]
I don't know how I felt.

[00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:01.750]
I don't know how I felt.

[00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:08.650]
I don't know if I was born.

[00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.830]
You were born and you were born.

[00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:34.810]
I remember you, playing in love.

[00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:40.350]
I remember you, playing in love.

[00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:42.710]
I don't know how I felt.

[00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:45.610]
I don't know how I felt.

[00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.770]
I don't know if I was born.

[00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:17.450]
You were born and you were born.

[00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:18.290]
I don't know if I was born.

[00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:24.130]
I don't know if I was born.

[00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:29.410]
Just unbelievable.

[00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.810]
Thank you, Mike, that made my whole Christmas, my New Year, my Hanukkah.

[00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.410]
Here it is in my hand untouched by human flesh.

[00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:43.170]
What an album that is and what a picture on the front of the back, by the way.

[00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:45.610]
If there's any horny people out there of any persuasion,

[00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:49.290]
just imagine with a haircut on the front of the back pictures and you'll know what he looks like.

[00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:50.550]
And what he smells like.

[00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:53.950]
Anyway, we have an open line on the blue line, 5249463.

[00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:57.570]
It's our mammoth one and two hours we paved the way for jazz, the jazz master.

[00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:58.570]
Isn't he here yet?

[00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:00.270]
Where the hell is he?

[00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:02.370]
Probably at some titty bar.

[00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:04.010]
Anyway, you ready and candle yet?

[00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:04.870]
No.

[00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.010]
Okay, hang on. He's hanging onto it.

[00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.090]
Let's do a lady in clear water on a date line.

[00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.490]
Hello.

[00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:11.630]
Hi.

[00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:12.110]
Hi.

[00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.670]
Hi, Neil.

[00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.410]
How are you doing?

[00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:14.610]
Good. How about yourself?

[00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:15.070]
Great.

[00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:18.350]
Good. I just wanted to thank you for reviving a childhood memory.

[00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:19.210]
And what is that?

[00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:21.870]
The um... am I allowed to say fart?

[00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:23.130]
The fart?

[00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:24.370]
The farting contest.

[00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:25.850]
Oh, the Crapitation contest.

[00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:26.950]
I haven't heard that.

[00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:30.230]
I was in second grade back in Terry Hill, New Jersey.

[00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:30.570]
Right.

[00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:32.130]
A friend used to play that.

[00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:34.750]
And every time we saw a post, we'd go grab it and say,

[00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:36.310]
ooh, he shot.

[00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:38.670]
So, the jump being has been disqualified.

[00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:39.350]
Right.

[00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:40.330]
And I don't know.

[00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:41.730]
It was just funnier to paint my pants.

[00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:43.970]
That thing's been around for over 50 years now.

[00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:44.530]
Has it?

[00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.790]
Yeah.

[00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:47.350]
Because, you know, since then, I've told people about it.

[00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:48.710]
I mean, great conversation.

[00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.310]
But, um... just because it was so funny.

[00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.110]
And I have wandered where you could find something like that.

[00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:56.110]
Uh, last time we were able to get it.

[00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:58.530]
The first time I ever had it, I got a bootleg copy of it.

[00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.170]
In 1963, I was working in Batavia, New York.

[00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.650]
Uh-huh.

[00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:02.750]
So that's 30 years ago.

[00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:03.210]
Uh-huh.

[00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.430]
And then I lost track of it.

[00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:07.070]
And then when I was at WINZ about seven-eight years ago,

[00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:08.830]
somebody sent us a copy of it.

[00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:12.170]
And we found out that Betty's rare records in Louisville, of all places,

[00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:13.970]
had a whole bunch of copies of it.

[00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.810]
And we got it... we sold it out for them.

[00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:17.090]
And then she went out of business, I guess.

[00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:17.690]
Uh-huh.

[00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:19.610]
And that was the last place I knew where you could get it.

[00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:20.190]
Geez.

[00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:21.450]
Well, that thing is really funny.

[00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:21.790]
Yeah.

[00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:24.410]
We played every year on the holidays when we have time to get it in.

[00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.730]
Do you?

[00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:25.150]
All right.

[00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:29.650]
Um, also, what's going on with, um, as you win?

[00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:32.930]
Because they have promotions of running run in the morning

[00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:34.050]
and last year in the afternoon.

[00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:35.530]
They're not acts in you.

[00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:35.950]
Are they?

[00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.330]
No.

[00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:37.630]
No, I'll be on.

[00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:39.790]
Oh, in other words, they're not promoting that I'm going to be on in between?

[00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.210]
No.

[00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:41.370]
Well, that's very nice.

[00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:42.630]
Yeah, and here I'm wondering.

[00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:43.910]
What am I, Chop River now?

[00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:44.150]
Yes.

[00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.690]
For what they're paying me to be on over there,

[00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:48.790]
at least they can do is at least promote it a little bit.

[00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.170]
Yeah.

[00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:50.230]
What about your assholes?

[00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.990]
Yeah, they are.

[00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.370]
Yeah.

[00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:52.030]
Yeah.

[00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.670]
Well, um, just glad to know that you're still going to be on.

[00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:55.490]
Yeah, I'll be on.

[00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.930]
All right.

[00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:56.190]
Good.

[00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:58.410]
Because I don't know what would do it work without you.

[00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:59.690]
Okay, you have a great holiday.

[00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:00.330]
Okay, you do.

[00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.670]
Bye.

[00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.890]

[00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:02.710]
We have an open line.

[00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:03.210]
It's in date.

[00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.750]

With your hands full.

[00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:37.330]
You know Larry King was on C-SPAN a couple days ago, I saw.

[00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:37.750]
Yeah.

[00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:40.170]
And he was on the press club.

[00:51:40.850 --> 00:51:42.330]
And he was given a little, and he goes in.

[00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:43.810]
And he sucks around and answers.

[00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:44.310]

[00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:48.590]
And he says, you know, he got one quoting ad was, I could interview myself.

[00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:50.130]
And what that was pretty insightful.

[00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:50.970]
Yeah, that's cute.

[00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:52.970]
And he was the greatest interviewer.

[00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:53.250]
And he was the greatest interviewer.

[00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:53.970]
And he was the greatest interviewer.

[00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:54.590]
And he was the greatest interviewer.

[00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:55.110]
And he was the greatest interviewer.

[00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:55.110]

[00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:55.270]
And he was the greatest interviewer.

[00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.490]
And he was the greatest interviewer.

[00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:57.150]
And he was the greatest interviewer.

[00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.450]
And he was the greatest interviewer.

[00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.970]

[00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.250]
And he was said, he was the greatest interviewer.

[00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:11.430]
And so William starts playing the game.

[00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.130]

And so William starts to play such a big game.

[00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:33.310]
but uh... he's not a morning guy

[00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:36.970]
oh my god this morning what he was doing was like going on he does he goes into

[00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:38.230]
this big story about his

[00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:39.750]
childhood or some one he met

[00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:40.030]
and

[00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:43.310]
it's all that out he tells it's like reading a book on air

[00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.130]
pretty good jury which there is a me a terminal

[00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:49.190]
like i said he's not a morning guy unless you're in the sleep and late

[00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:52.770]
so ron and ron will probably do about a ten share on s u n maybe some of

[00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:54.050]
that'll slap over on to me

[00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:56.690]
and uh... that'll be beautiful i love it

[00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.770]
yet a whole bunch of those f m people the people that we were going to get

[00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:01.290]
if we stay down why an efflong enough

[00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:04.090]
now they'll start discovering a rest of the stuff and will be great

[00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:04.930]
exactly

[00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:06.910]
uh... michael jackson's nose

[00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:09.950]
yeah it looks like it's going wild

[00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:13.650]
i mean i don't think he can even but without like switching it around i mean i

[00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:16.210]
think it move it or is no seahorse or is no either

[00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:17.610]
okay predictions yep

[00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:20.610]

[00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.150]
what do you think i agree and letter i mean

[00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:26.290]
all those guys ice all the little bit like him over the track last night

[00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:28.410]
turn on the tv and i watched about twenty minutes of day

[00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:32.050]
and i don't mind letterman and he's okay but there's not that much there you

[00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:33.790]
know and he had andy williams on

[00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:37.150]
i mean let's face it david if you want to appeal to the younger demographics

[00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:41.470]
andy williams is not the answer okay exactly i mean let's get cereal

[00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:43.830]
i'll blow them both away trust me yeah

[00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:46.230]
does uh... lewis mcgold reward you properly

[00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:47.370]
for playing his music

[00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:48.670]
i hope so

[00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:50.470]
okay i'm waiting have a great holiday pal

[00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:51.050]
okay see

[00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:56.330]
we have an open line just a little kiss okay read on the cheek all those broads

[00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:57.950]
were kissing them on the cheek many had more lipstick

[00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:00.910]
and then they would give him like a uh... clean x you know he would wipe it off

[00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:01.790]
and it's cheap to

[00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:06.390]
i had a mcclean x any wiped it off

[00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:10.950]
anyway it's one fifteen at w i o d or was it the other way around and w

[00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:11.990]
s u n

[00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:15.230]
have more fun but albino's have the most fun of all

[00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:16.670]
listening for your chance to win

[00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:20.670]
anyway one eighteen at w i d so yesterday i caused me about friend q

[00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:23.630]
sick the guy from boston and uh... was asking if i had a friend q

[00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:25.650]
sick tape to play along with all my other hockey highlights

[00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:28.490]
and even though it's painful i should probably destroy it after i played this

[00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:29.950]
one last time because it was our worst

[00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:33.830]
uh... blowjob of a game of the whole year for the opanthers up in boston

[00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:37.030]
what we blew the game we should have won it and then we let him not only tie it

[00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:40.750]
but then win it in the last few seconds but it was a great call thirty seconds left

[00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:42.450]
in regulation

[00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:46.090]
as far as you know

[00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:49.050]
that kind of global and i think you know

[00:54:59.350 --> 00:54:59.790]
uh...

[00:54:59.790 --> 00:54:59.950]
but

[00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.950]

[00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.950]

[00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:01.710]
very depressing for it but uh... nice call

[00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.490]

[01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:27.070]
when you can see it like crystal three-dimensional clear on g-48 on your satellite

[01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:31.770]

body let's go to venez hello venez

[01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:50.450]
is there a menace in venez

[01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:56.730]
hello there he is sorry i'm working over here that's okay you're working on what

[01:01:56.730 --> 01:02:01.550]
uh... some douchebags tile okay i'm calling about this run and run deal

[01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:05.130]
yes sir i don't really care about them being on in the morning because i don't

[01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:07.630]
turn radio on to about nine forty five okay

[01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:11.490]
but what i'm p-o-d about is i'm taking rick and suds off well there you go see

[01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:13.530]
there's uh... that's a little problem there

[01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:17.070]
i can listen to blob in the after there gonna be a lot of the whole switch over all

[01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:20.350]
the living and breathing people probably bail out at two o'clock and in the uh... old

[01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:24.610]
f-l-a-crowdle coming so the demographic may take a turn for the a worst of two

[01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:29.130]
yeah the numbers and run runs numbers weren't that good before they left they weren't

[01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:32.130]
now they were on their way down i thought they were kicking ass over there and

[01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:35.150]
well they were dropping well wouldn't that be a shame if they came over there and

[01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:38.150]
only did like a marginal number in view of all of the gillians the dollars they're

[01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:40.970]
getting paid that would be too good yeah i don't think they're gonna do any good

[01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:43.630]
because i'm counting on them for at least a ten share lead in here

[01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:47.850]
don't hold your breath okay you know you arrive when you said they were up there in

[01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:51.170]
lana a couple weeks ago getting ready to screw everything up yeah well they're

[01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:53.650]
working on a real hard they still haven't figured out what they're screwing up

[01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:57.470]
here yet that goes to show you how decisive they are well we'll keep our

[01:02:57.470 --> 01:03:01.270]
fingers crossed that they don't miss things up too much there and monday morning i'm

[01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:04.750]
gonna call tom del vito and give him a piece of my mind good give him a piece

[01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:07.550]
i have good i'll tell you to thanks for all your work see you

[01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:12.250]
how do you like that so some people are happy i'd be honest with you i'd of course like i

[01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:15.930]
said the people who are running run listeners for the most part and i don't think they're all

[01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:18.990]
that great i'm not gonna sit here and say oh geez they're coming on out there the greatest

[01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:22.350]
thing in the world i'm happy that they're gonna be on over there because i think they will bring

[01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:26.830]
a lot of the fm crowd in the morning and that'll help me honest you when because it'll help get

[01:03:26.830 --> 01:03:30.510]
a lot of people tuning in that station you otherwise never would turn on a him under penalty

[01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:35.770]
adept that can only help but like i said this company is does not have the balls to put on

[01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:40.930]
Howard stern and uh... that's the answer a lot of money yes but i don't think as much money is

[01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:44.250]
what it's gonna cost for them and we'll see in the long run what's what's gonna what fly

[01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:48.830]
and what's not gonna fly i know i'm a sure ain't flying over there i'll tell you that this last

[01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:55.470]
trend qyk a m with i'mus and g Gordon litty and uh... don and mike didn't show at all i mean nothing

[01:03:55.470 --> 01:04:00.450]
zero zippity doodah like less than a hundred people average quarter hour like why even

[01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:06.130]
wasted use to turn on the transmitter that kind of thing here's hi alia boyness to you good afternoon

[01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:11.190]
you yes sir listen that guy that call for the blob you should probably be related or off the blob

[01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:16.850]
is given them something for him to call probably give them some free meat listen your trip went

[01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:20.610]
pretty good over there in Vegas huh yeah other than the fact that i was sick but you know if you

[01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:24.110]
kind of scrape that aside and ignore that and the fact that i almost got screwed out of my tickets

[01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:28.910]
but you know that it's only the end result accounts you know i wonder if you had if you had come

[01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:33.170]
through somebody was supposed to get your backstage passes or something nothing no tickets no passes

[01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:39.070]
no nothing nada all right now if i wouldn't have made that phone call uh... right around midday

[01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:43.350]
on saturday and reserved a couple of seats which turned out to be sensational if i wouldn't have

[01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:47.510]
made that call i had gotten nothing you'd have been screwed i'd come back with nothing in my hands

[01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:51.410]
so you know maybe somebody out there trying to set you up uh...

[01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:55.530]
and uh... giving you all these false hopes and stuff like that was that was an inside job here that

[01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:58.730]
was a case of too many of people with their finger in the thing making too many promises

[01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:02.530]
and uh... people in the between who were doing what they were supposed to that's all

[01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:06.890]
listen uh... i don't know if you're aware of it but uh... mister stern support to have a special

[01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:12.010]
show on request right i knew you're the right and i think you're talking about another station that

[01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:17.170]
it'll be the first time that he'll be uh... uncensored and nobody can really tell them what to do

[01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:20.670]
and what not to do so that should be a little interesting so i i don't know what is it forty bucks i

[01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:26.050]
think eighty bucks i don't know i get it for free oh i see okay uh... uh... uh...

[01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:30.350]
uh... mister geiger yes sir had a very good game last night when i'm surprised we haven't called you back

[01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:34.910]

escort him over there when he came to fit pick up his final paycheck

[01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:17.790]

little hostility near right like you are going to be the crap out of the

[01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:23.830]

[01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:42.490]
lady you know she called and stuff maybe if she could find it maybe go to small

[01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:46.350]
for all shops i've seen it's truck stop fifty seven and gene tracy

[01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:49.810]

[01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:53.230]
of nose picking stuff on here but it's got some good bits on there too well you

[01:20:53.230 --> 01:20:56.410]
know you got to pick your nose first before you get to uh... that part all right

[01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:59.010]
now i love you show me on have a good holiday you too thanks bye

[01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:02.670]
here's the four-letter on the starline hello

[01:21:03.190 --> 01:21:07.610]
hey nil and howl at a two-year back to you and uh... thanks for uh...

[01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:09.990]
and use my year and uh...

[01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:13.850]
get the good inside of what's going on in the local radio as well it's uh...

[01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:17.090]
right to listen to you i got one question for you i uh...

[01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:19.110]
uh... nameless but i mean i had a

[01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:21.310]
satellite my house i got my body

[01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:24.150]
really low-end operation i know you got

[01:21:24.150 --> 01:21:26.290]
satellite you tell me who i might call

[01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:31.550]
well i got i got mine from rice international i don't know who you did

[01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:33.030]
business with i hope it wasn't them

[01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:34.910]
but uh...

[01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:38.110]
all right you know i'm a little nervous because i've also dealt with a couple

[01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:41.410]
of companies that i wouldn't wish on my dogs you know they were really uh...

[01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:44.650]
see that's the thing that bothers me no satellite dishes are so great and the

[01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:46.010]
technology now so tremendous

[01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:50.970]
why do so many of the companies that deal with satellite seem to be so sleazy and

[01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:55.630]
so you know i'm talking about i can't rip your off yeah but rice seem to be

[01:21:55.630 --> 01:21:58.990]
pretty uh... you know pretty straightforward and they uh... deal with like uh...

[01:21:58.990 --> 01:22:01.450]
getting your permits if you need one and all the other stuff they seem to know

[01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:04.370]
their stuff rice internationally do you like all of us out florida

[01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:05.990]
i'm gonna get my call one of the thought

[01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.770]
uh...

[01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:11.290]
uh... you know i had my body photographs getting back to that

[01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:13.930]
don't you think it may be uh...

[01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:16.590]
uh... he might have been ordered to uh...

[01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:20.330]
full of them stop the white spots might have uh... use the little shine all right

[01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:20.890]
liquid

[01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:21.990]
yeah there you go

[01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:23.130]

[01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:28.250]

tarpon springs hello

[01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:34.990]
hey neil yeah

[01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:36.490]
how's it going but pretty good

[01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:39.190]
all right i think i'm job on his phone line can you hear it

[01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:41.110]
uh... no not all while amazing

[01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:43.450]
uh... dude we're gonna miss rick and sudsman

[01:22:43.450 --> 01:22:46.250]
but you know who's gonna benefit the most run on yes

[01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:47.810]
you buddy i think so

[01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:50.850]
because i know about ninety percent of their audience from listening to

[01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:53.850]
that run around here for many years right are gonna be turned on to you

[01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:56.470]
because you just blow bob away about i think about

[01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:59.330]
ninety percent are gonna drop off when bob comes on

[01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:03.550]
because you know bob this morning he did a two hour monologue on some

[01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:04.790]
christmas thing man

[01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:06.790]
and all these old people call out

[01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:07.710]
two hours

[01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:09.370]
oh boy

[01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:10.290]
yeah

[01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:14.230]
that's what he really wants he wants to go back in there like i said before do

[01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:17.710]
the fla thing line was gone now fla seems to be throwing in the towel

[01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:21.210]
and he's gonna go any afternoon and pretend he's on fla even though he's on six

[01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:24.950]
twenty and he's gonna get all those old people and i have all the chronic's on

[01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:27.670]
there and kind of like rekindle that thing which you'll probably have a big

[01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:29.550]
number but the meeting demographic will be death

[01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:30.630]
absolutely

[01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:34.390]
hey i got your shirt man excellent you look like Larry King buddy

[01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:37.610]
exactly hey i got one more question yeah without the ball spot

[01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:41.610]
hey do you remember my childhood do i remember one much your childhood

[01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:44.370]
no oh you don't do you remember blowing bubbles in your little

[01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:45.690]
see ya

[01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:49.990]
ask michael jaxson see ya cute

[01:23:51.450 --> 01:23:54.290]
anyway now i do have a big ball spot but it's like you have to look over the top

[01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:56.710]
to see it that's the good part if you sit with your head back a little bit

[01:23:56.710 --> 01:23:58.630]
always got a little hair that's nice not too much

[01:23:59.370 --> 01:24:02.370]
but anyway so that's the deal starting a week from monday we got

[01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:06.050]
at s u when we go see i wish i could tell a Miami audience which is most of our

[01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:08.810]
audience here in south florida what the hell's going on here but i don't know

[01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:13.330]
and i'm not holding any information back and uh... if i had it i might have to

[01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:16.630]
hold it back but i don't have it all i know is that something's going on

[01:24:16.630 --> 01:24:19.850]
something's in the air something's gonna happen and god only knows if even the

[01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:22.430]
if even the powers that be know what the hell is gonna happen

[01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:26.870]
i do know can i say for one good thing that we know that Chuck Meyer will continue

[01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:29.590]
to be here no matter what it's gonna be no matter what he's gonna be doing he

[01:24:29.590 --> 01:24:33.410]
definitely will continue to be here i can say that line oh it's true

[01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:37.270]
so that even though maybe there'll be a change in the show and maybe there won't uh...

[01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:40.550]
who knows but chuckle be here and we love chucking is a great guy in a real pro and we're happy

[01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:44.970]
about that but i don't know is the best i can say which sounds awfully stupid but in

[01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:48.230]
Tampa we do know that starting a week from monday run and run in the morning six to ten

[01:24:48.230 --> 01:24:53.130]

[01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:57.150]
and after that to be honest with you i don't think they've got the fog is clue i don't

[01:24:57.150 --> 01:25:02.210]
