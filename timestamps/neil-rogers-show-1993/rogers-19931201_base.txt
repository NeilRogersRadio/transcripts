[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:43.660]
Now, the Neil Rogers show on Youth Talk Radio 610, WIOD This is the real Ralph Renek When I drive around

[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.560]
South Farder, I always listen to the Nick Reneri show on WIOD Well Ralph is dead and so is

[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.920]
most of Reneri's audience, but at least he's got an audience which is something, you know,

[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.860]
that's what I said to Bob Green this morning when I came in and everybody the buzz of the

[00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.200]
place of course did you hear Reneri on 790 WMRZ this morning with Henry Barrow and unfortunately

[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.000]
Ed Berliner Get rid of him, Mike, get rid of Berliner man, everybody hates him like

[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.560]
poison Although I'll be honest with you, his fastest two minutes sport report in the

[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.960]
world wasn't too bad, as long as he doesn't say anything else just gives the scores he's

[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.640]
alright So anyway, that's the buzz of the joint as you would expect and Bob Green says

[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.140]
to me this morning, wow boy, did you hear that? I said yes, sure did, I said that's the

[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.360]
first time in three months I've listened to the radio on a way to work instead of just

[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.200]
listening to my tapes in a car Well they're all old, all old, now I know why we fired

[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.420]
them I said yeah, but at least they're out there, this somebody I mean even dead people

[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.280]
I represent a quium, you know what I'm saying even we got like 300,000 dead people at least

[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.540]
to represent something like a lot of dead people as opposed to having nobody but hey they

[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.020]
know it all here man and now after they admit they've screwed up the whole deal what are they

[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.880]
doing? They're doing more research! Yeah I heard you call Gilbert you suck ass, I heard you call

[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.680]
in there this morning, let's see who else called Mikey we had Harold Song to all the

[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.960]
old plant guy we had Yolanda Parapark, God that was touching, I was there shaving, I was

[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.960]
shaving I had to radio on in the house which I never do and here was Yolanda on the phone

[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.640]
and there's Henry and Mikey and I thought God this is all we needed was Phil Costin in

[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.160]
there and we'd have like a whole conglomeration there of all the people about, a few of the

[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.680]
people who have been screwed over in the last two, three years by this company I mean it was

[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.400]
just a, tears came to my eyes. So anyway the deal is now of course we have this thing in the

[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.060]
morning this abortion here that nobody wants to listen to and certainly nobody even defends

[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.960]
because now and by the way all you old farts that called up for an area this morning and

[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.900]
oh boy don't even mention that other one over there that's disgusting what he's doing on it

[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.920]
you're all listening right now you're not fooling me for a second you could quote chapter

[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.000]
and verse, air be God damn thing I say on here so don't call and suck around over there

[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.380]
and pretend you're not listening now because I know you're listening good morning to you happy

[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.520]
Wednesday you old farts oh I still miss you left we turned it off and that other one he's

[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.100]
so disgusting I love the one guy to call to say that he so relieved he can listen to Mike

[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.180]
Knight doesn't have to hear those disgusting filthy promos for the guy used to follow him

[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.360]
over here the ones we had a bleep even if I said hey how you doing I had to bleep that

[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.600]
out because just the sound of my voice would get some of those people would get the crap

[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.400]
in their class to be bag just regurgitating just puking around in there like a whirlwind

[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.160]
like a male strum in a bag so anyway renery is on 790 by the way on AM WMRZ 610 in the morning

[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.840]
and I was thinking this is like after World War 2 remember we beat the crap out of the Germans

[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.520]
and the Japs and then all of a sudden we started building them up again and all of a sudden

[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.580]
they're just they got their thumb down on us and we're like doing NAFTA and this and that

[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.520]
we're trying everything in the world to get somebody to buy American products

[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.940]
because the Germans and the Japanese we have like handed it right back to them and in fact

[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.440]
how my Birkenstocks doing and my new German pen but anyway and that's what it reminds me of

[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.080]
I was talking about that yesterday we got the snooze cruise tombstone sitting out there

[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.480]
in front of our building after we put WNW West out of business off the year cup put finished

[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.940]
and all of a sudden like hey here's another chance although Sandy ain't going to help much

[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.320]
and the reason I know I always liked renery is because I heard from the grape fund

[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.760]
that he wasn't very nice yet some not too nice things to say about Sandy this morning

[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.520]
you know what I mean yeah I had a boy Mike he's not sucking around like Henry is over there

[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.300]
you know I like Henry but one of the things talk about I could go on the whole four hour monologue

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.980]
today about this I really could it just like here you know we have all the psychosis

[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.020]
about Jazz McKay and about this because there are certain people without mentioning

[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.560]
any other names like Valtteri's again it's the Valtteri's Roost at IOD once again

[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.940]
it just never seems to end certain people just waiting in the wings just hovering over

[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.740]
waiting for the death of the morning show which I think is imminent regardless of anything

[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.400]
and just looking to see if they put recon suds in the morning that opens up the afternoon

[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.360]
well let's get Jazz McKay out of here before they stick him on there

[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.340]
so now the new then all of a sudden there's another great turnaround here

[00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.220]
I mean I don't know whether the scream or either banana I don't know if this is a good guy

[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.440]
a bad guy all I know is he represents a threat to certain other people

[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.000]
I don't want to mention Jim who again is in here manipulating and trying to you know

[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.520]
I mean get him out of the building take away his card or whatever it is he gets in his building

[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.420]
with and just ban him from the building and Randy will be better off and so will

[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.440]
everybody else then oh she gets very upset when I say that I don't care it happens to be true

[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.060]
he's a professional meddler God he's in here yesterday manipulating Adam

[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.080]
like a puppet on a string really it looked like Edgar Bergen and that must be why

[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.040]
Adam was sitting on his knee can't be any other reason huh he was pulling and pulling on the strings

[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.400]
that is he ain't get on him like crazy on the strings but anyway we'll get into all of this

[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.180]
because I'm sure a nice job Mike okay not too much of a show we'll get some spots in here

[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.600]
I'm sure we'll get that thing going first day a lot of calls a lot of response

[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.860]
everybody I listened like I said for the first time to radio AMFM or anything in the morning

[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.100]
for months this morning not that it was all that entertaining or compelling but hey

[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.260]
at least it was something besides hey here's the same crappy news over and over and over again

[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.240]
and the same stuff he just heard three minutes ago and here's another 80 second

[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.140]
interview with somebody we don't want to hear in the first place so anyway big

[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.180]
article by Tom jicke picture of a renery from about 20 years ago I'm one thing about

[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.260]
Mike he always looked the same you know I bet you when he was 15 he still

[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.920]
looked like pretty much the same had that same red jacket and then it was the

[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.080]
blue one and kind of like that gigantic bald spot like I got only more toward the front

[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.100]
and had like a flask in his pocket and he just basically the same guy I like

[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.120]
renery you know I always said that I never said that I didn't like renery always in

[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.860]
this show wasn't that exciting but I got news for it it was like a comfort zone

[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.060]
and the demographics were old yes we had a lot of old people but they mostly

[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.920]
disappeared just like when I talked about him last few days you notice most of

[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.420]
the audience course on a west coast look at the phone lines there because they don't know anything about him

[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.460]
well it's too bad okay it's too bad there's nothing I can do about that if I had

[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.560]
a lightning hockey tickets to give away to you then maybe we do something then we get some calls over there

[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.580]
this is something for us today all right so you'll have to excuse us this is a man

[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.580]
who was on the year here on this station in the mornings for 17 long

[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.980]
excruciating years and is just to got paid off for a year as he said by very dumb people

[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.060]
he got paid for a year and it says in jicke's column over 200 grand and I'm sure

[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.360]
that's about right I don't know what it was maybe 250 to 40 whatever was

[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.800]
guy was making a few bucks and got paid for a year to sit around play some golf drink

[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.500]
a little booze and have a good time and watch late night TV

[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.280]
now he's over there with Henry Burrow Edberlitter unfortunately and the

[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.700]
gods and Mishbacher so my green calls in this morning suck it around Gilbert

[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.380]
calls in suck it around which I thought was unconscionable and better than

[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:44.660]
us Harold Songdall I mentioned and the sopper and of course what's the guy

[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.920]
captain the bouncer and anybody else we know I mean there was just like I like

[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.860]
old home week and like I said people in the morning in this market other than

[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.380]
those who are FM people looking for Ron and Ron because they can't find much of

[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.600]
anything else that's entertaining and are tuning they're like switching around

[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.360]
man and I'm going to tell you if they don't do something pretty quick but I'll

[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.700]
also say as far as jazz mk I'm not going to pay any attention to the audience

[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.500]
because quite frankly we saw in the last two days just exactly like a little

[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.640]
clinic a mini clinic of what I've always said about the audience and that is

[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.840]
they'll call in a green for the most part with whatever you say they want to

[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.740]
get free as well if they if you might find something to give them so that's

[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.980]
basically on Monday when I said well I thought it was pretty good then all

[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.600]
of the yeah he's great he's wonderful then yesterday when I said I heard

[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.380]
that got when Adam and Jim just happened to come in here with that cart to try to

[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.560]
get me all stirred up and I succeeded very well by the way I came in on Sunday

[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.240]
morning at about 10 to noon I guess right after that episode it happened and then

[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.320]
drew called in sucking around trying to save his life and now after yesterday

[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.480]
and all this other stuff we find out that Adam had a phone conversation with jazz

[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.480]
mk and Adam says oh he's the nicest guy ever want to know he's a great guy so

[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.340]
Adam is either a real pussy like I said yesterday and just scared for his life and

[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.300]
scared that all those bikers are going to come down here and beat the crap out of

[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.900]
him or he just is convinced he's a nice guy and maybe Jim isn't going to manipulate

[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.540]
Adam as much as he did before and trying to suck around for that afternoon

[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.740]
slot or one of the above so I don't know whether the screen read a banana I think

[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.620]
the guy deserves a little bit more of a chance because he's only been on a couple

[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.420]
of days and let's find out if he kills somebody or not I say huh because I can

[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.060]
think of plenty of good candidates bring those bikers down here jazz I got a good

[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:26.580]
list for you pal okay and some of those guys got a real small penis too by the way

[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.240]
the ones that are on my list I don't want to mention anybody in particular down

[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.100]
stairs but he's near the head of the list he's right near the top baby and rising

[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:41.080]
fast yeah so also I do want to mention where I'm doing when we come back I got to

[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.000]
talk about those calendars I had an afternoon yesterday I'm I wait a good show

[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.760]
yesterday amazing everything went just fine and everything was hunky

[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.400]
dori as they say I go home I'm watching guiding light which is getting very very

[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.840]
neurotic and I'm wondering what happened with best low if she's turning into a

[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.920]
turn coat I wonder what that's all about and I'm just minding my own business

[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.280]
the phone rings and it's Cheryl and it seems that we have a big

[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.640]
contortops about this thing with the these t-shirts and Kurt's all upset about it

[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.160]
and everybody else is all upset about it be screened and they're just screaming

[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.740]
and yelling and then of course about these 25,000 calendars which this is another

[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.980]

song in advance and boy Kurt had an nervous breakdown about this but he can

[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.140]

working on finding out where it's going to be so we can do a real nice job well we

[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.420]
don't advocate that anybody would do it but just in case any of the dolphins are

[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.020]
pissed off by it that they might just do a real good job of defacing it which would

[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.880]
be illegal I'm sure but you know nice so anyway B screen's number is five nine

talking about the size yeah laugh now cry later so anyway we got these eight

[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.640]
billion calendars all right comes to find out that the original guess who was

[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.040]
involved in the calendars and our Kamala's house total by the way is fifty three

[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.540]
thousand one seventy one center one is still fifteen thousand four eighty

[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.020]
because we don't have an update from peaches which will have tomorrow the next

[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.740]
day but they're both doing very very nicely the Kamala's house hotline is one eight

[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:56.580]
hundred eight five two oh oh six come on Mikey give us a few plugs on it okay one

[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:04.020]
eight hundred eight five two oh oh oh six come on call tit for tat and what

[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.320]
else on Kamala's house peaches of course has got all the good stuff and so we got

[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.880]
all these calendars now turns out this was and I will give full credit they work

[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.560]
with Joe Andrews and peaches they got our stuff and peaches are the t-shirts at

[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.680]
peaches to by the way I don't know about that see the problem is this year as I've

[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.600]
told you before there is just too much stuff it's unwieldy we got Chuck who's

[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.940]
had to take the week off this week to run around delivering those coffee mugs

[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.640]
because it's the only way to get people to buy him and he raised about twelve

[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.380]
hundred bucks for us on Saturday I guess but we just have too many things and one

[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.580]
of the things is this w i d artsy crafty calendar which on each month on the

[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:47.320]
calendar is got a like a m a gothic picture with our pictures of the various

[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.360]
uh... goofballs here at the station superimposed like the first one with me sitting

[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.040]
on the throne like the queen with my pus with a cigar and whatever else and

[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.120]
rickensuds with the american gothic is the name of that picture with a farmer and his wife

[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.280]
with the pitch fork and all that and their pusses are and it's it's really a neat

[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:07.580]
thing I don't think we probably needed twenty five thousand of them but it's really a

[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.820]
thing now this this now I'm really a psychotic I almost had a stroke about this

[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.180]
yesterday because comes to find out that the sales department originally was

[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.420]
involved in this and they were going to sell to a client they were going to like

[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.420]
put their own add on there or coupon or something and they were going to put them

[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:29.200]
in all their stores but then of course for whatever reason and bob green tells me

[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.100]
one thing this morning and I was told another thing yesterday the sales department

[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.460]
dropped the ball which wouldn't surprise me so anyway we got these billions of

[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.300]
these things they're only two ninety nine which most calendars cost and ice

[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:43.480]
calendars about ten bucks right yeah eight or ten bucks these are like two

[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.480]
ninety nine and of that like two bucks goes to Camille Sous and the other buck

[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.640]
goes for the cost of printing so to make a long story short boy crew it spent

[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.060]
twenty five thousand dollars on these calendars most of which are collecting

[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.360]
dust there at peaches there at Camille Sous there were any of the places where

[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.280]
we got our stuff including the tailgate party the Sunday before the Giants

[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.000]
game we are going to bring tons of these out there and I want to make sure of

[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.580]
anything I want to make sure that these are sold because otherwise if we don't

[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.920]
get rid of most of them Camille Sous is going to lose money on this deal and that

[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.800]
really is what pissed me off yesterday I mean why should twenty five thousand we

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.580]
only printed up seven hundred and fifty Randy videos and a few thousand of

[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.820]
everybody else's CD and stuff but twenty five thousand of these calendars I told

[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.000]

for him real serious an answer comes on and says you're listening to the

[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.060]
micrineries show brought to you in part by the fact that he had candid i.o.d.

[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.240]
a cost broadcasting network now he did not hear that but the voice I'm sure was

[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.020]
Scott Chapin that was who used to be overheard he used to be over here at gtr

[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.280]
he used to be our production ace and he used to crank up the audio so loud

[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.840]
in production that the whole building was rocking and rolling he did used

[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.920]
to have the walls just tumbling down here that's true that's not

[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.160]
happened I wanted to I'm trying to get a hold of you the whole week why you're

[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.960]
on vacation I didn't get to hear all of it because it was just ponderous

[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.660]
getting all the tapes but there was this one part where you were talking to

[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.700]
uh-ronpa appeal I didn't get to hear the first time yeah the whole thing but

[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.980]
the second time was better that was just a great bit what do you mean the second

[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.920]
time was better well if you didn't get to get to a lot of times the second time

[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.800]
is better the first time you was on I didn't get I only got the last part of it yeah

[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.860]
I was talking about the miracle this also in other words if you didn't hear

[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.440]
something the first time when the tape is on it's better let me tell you something

[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.800]
sir tapes blow tape broadcasts below in this station a major market

[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.980]
station should be embarrassed I hope when he gets a 10 share in the morning

[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.820]
okay I hope our morning show goes down to a point one and it's not personal

[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.500]
with Chuck it's business Chuck knows I like him even though he now hates me like

[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.440]
poison I don't care this is a business this isn't a playground and the point of it

[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.720]
is Bob Green can sit in there and rationalize all he wants if they didn't like

[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.920]
Reneerie show there was no emergency he had a year to go on the contract if

[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.800]
you're going to get rid of somebody at least have something in the wings to

[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.760]
replace it that's going to be better that's going to do better not something

[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.840]
that's going to die on the vine and bring everybody else down scratching and

[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.860]
crack screaming and just dying over here to try to get a phone call to buy a

[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.940]
phone call because most of the audience is gone that isn't the way to do it

[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.400]
and these people are they are the biggest rationalizers because they've never

[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.140]
made a mistake including that little Torpy Bob Neal that little walking

[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.600]
people up there in Atlanta wouldn't know a radio show if it bit him on he is

[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.640]
he is the biggest torque I have ever met in my life and when they when they

[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.300]
gave Bob Neal the keys to the kingdom in this company that was the kiss of death

[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.240]
for all of us we'll one that's right within six months I predict will all be

[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.520]
over there on Reneerie show reminiscing about old times with the Orlando and Phil

[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.000]
Coston will all be over there about the t-shirts and Harold Songdall what is it

[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.320]
would get the t-shirts what did I say where do you get them I gave you the

[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.620]
number that's the old place you can get them you can't go like a peaches or

[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:07.380]
two no we didn't say there were some I said when we're there on the sixteenth

[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.420]
will have them there December 16 that's two weeks from tomorrow cool catch you

[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.900]
there then okay I'll go see you two open lines and date 751 one and two on the

[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.840]
green line where they're of course totally out of the mix today and that's the way it

[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.380]
goes too bad we're busy talking about stuff that's going on here and you just sit

[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.360]
back and be passive for once until we have stuff to go away to you later which

[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.340]
would be in just a few minutes yeah actually we're going to give some stuff away

[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.940]
to those people today because they've been very very well are used to getting

[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.560]
crap free from Bob and he's got him trained and they can't get the hands because

[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.360]
the hands you got to pick up over here and they're not going to drive I mean they may be

[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.860]
free loaders but they're not going to get drive 250 miles each way to get her

[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:48.860]
free ham maybe 1037 a W I O D and W S U N don't miss the weekend magazine

Bords of a feather flock together that's why she's also defensive of sandy

Chuck how's he going to feel about what's this is business this is not

[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.180]
personal okay Chuck's a great guy is a great talent I've always said tremendous

[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.100]
things about Chuck that show blows the whole concept blows were dying over

[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.880]
here because we got the new regime here that came in here and decided they were

[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.740]
smarter than everybody else they were going to pick the whole station apart and they've

[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.900]
succeeded very very well and we've got almost everybody in the building running

[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.520]

on instantly on whichever channel you like you don't have to like like back in the

[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.660]
old days when you had to turn the TV on a wait for the tubes to warm up for a couple

[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.760]
of minutes don't work like that radio it's like instant well I guess I don't know

[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.420]
I got to listen to him sometimes like a it's like a guy that called jazz the other day

[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.040]
on Sunday about drew it about how awfully wasn't how drew went on for two and a

[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.720]
half hours ripping jazz and about oh yeah he'd much rather listen to even WLR

[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.300]
and etc etc but the fact is he was listening to the two and a half hours of it

[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.580]
because he was quoting chapter in verse as though somebody was holding him at

[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.280]
gunpoint forcing him to listen but anyway what's the story with blob today well

[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:03.160]
if I can see this whole show nale consists of ragging on you yeah and ragging on

[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.420]
randy today he was saying that if he was Chuck Meyer that he would shoot you dead

[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:13.500]
and that no jury in the country would convict them because all you do is rag him

[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:19.340]
and talt micrinerian this that hey if if micrineries great you say I never said he was

[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.420]
great but he ever said he was great but he said that he's better than

[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:28.300]
than Chuck show wait a minute it's got nothing Chuck doesn't have a show Chuck is

[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.700]
here on the more they don't even call it to Chuck Meyer show they call it son

[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.420]
Florida's morning news it's an all news format and Chuck unfortunately is caught

[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.640]
in the middle of that it's got nothing to do with Chuck personally Chuck is the best

[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.080]
news person in this state and one of the best in the country as far as I'm concerned

[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.940]
but I'm not going to sit here and pretend that it's a great show because it blows

[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.740]
and last year and last year again because he's got nothing else to talk about

[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.400]
he's either ripping randy or ripping me all he talks about is over here that's all

[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.320]
he that's the only thing I ever hear him talking about is over here isn't there

[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.700]
something going on over there there is nothing because the the South Florida

[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.180]
audience isn't here in a moment here so what's the benefit of the audience over

[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.600]
there hearing him talk about here it doesn't make any sense we have those red

[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.340]
next nose pickers just eating out of his hands they come up and just talk

[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.580]
a line of crap I can imagine what they're eating yeah they just don't know

[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.480]
what they got with you Neil huh they just don't know what they've got with you

[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.380]
you're the greatest they just don't know they have what do you mean they don't

[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.400]
talk about I don't I don't care what they say see this is this yenta thing again

[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.580]
I don't give a crap what they say I'm not interested in Bob Lasseter he's a

[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.700]
sour fat fart that's all he is he's just a sour puss and a real corn ball

[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.960]
yokele and he fits in over there perfect he's great for over there well I guess

[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.340]
I just like to hear you say well then forget about him already find something

[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.500]
else to listen to over there if there's anything I just want to just keep

[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.620]
twisting it around I thought it'd be of help now yeah I can tell see you

[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:55.980]
by agitator ojan provacotrus we have an open line indeed 7519463 and I'm going to

[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.860]
say it again Jim and Adam and a lot of other people in this building better

[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.360]
calm to hell down because they get me highly agitated and especially that

[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:06.380]
Jim he is the biggest the worst manipulator I've ever seen in my life he wants to

[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.520]
keep standing getting everybody whipped up and oh they spent all this money on

[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.460]
the calendars they were about just give it a rest already big is chronic

[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.660]
complainer man he makes me seem like the happy man like the ice cream man I mean

[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.040]
this guy is he ever happy about anything is there anything in the world I could

[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.280]
ever please that this man he would stop belly it get in bitching and yelling no I

[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:32.720]

[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.880]

[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:55.580]
good morning yes are we close tonight are we closed close close to what close

[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.480]
on our selection no we're not well let me take a peek again I know that

[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.700]
whoever you picked I did not pick as usual which makes me feel very secure

[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.800]
very well I know that let's see you picked seven rate Lord Zinath prestige

[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.340]
is there well we're like flip flopped okay I like the rail you like the rail I

[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.280]
don't I'm Mickey Peterson I mean it's a nice guy never stole a freight train but it's just

[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.360]
not that horse every now and then goes up in the air like he did last week and Mickey

[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.100]
occasionally gets lost in there on the rail and I just figure we got a major driver

[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.980]
change even though Brian Allen's had a very tough meeting here he was monster

[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.580]
it Vernon this summer and if he gets a live horse to drive he might just be there

[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:33.020]
because this horse one this is scary thing about Brian I mean Brian is one

[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.100]
150 race of the year to last four years at Vernon yep just can't seem you know

[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.740]
that's how deep this driving colony is just can't seem to get the drive it's

[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.400]
getting really deep but this horse went a gigantic mile from the nine hole last

[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.560]
week parked the whole mile and I'm just I'm not making a definite commitment

[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.420]
but I think I may just go with the one tonight you're leaning that I'm leaning

[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:56.560]
toward it well that's it that just like Andre just like Andre Brisson is just like

[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.400]
Andre Brisson is leaning out there toward the middle of the track with that horse the other night

[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.840]
but I don't want to talk about that and not my horse you did not have a good night

[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.580]
I am oh my god Terry Baker is going to win the race for fun there with Frenchman

[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.580]
Bay and Andre Brisson what's he doing off the rail anyway makes a break comes

[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.940]
out in the middle of the field knocks everybody down and that's it I got up and

[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.920]
said okay let's go good weekend coming up got a big weekend coming up go ahead

[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.560]

pack will go over 20,000 beauty well this horse is going to get a big chunk I

[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.520]

[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.180]
nothing wrong with the phone it's what's coming out of it that doesn't make too much sense

[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:18.960]
you're like speaking in a little disconnected the things oh maybe I've been on a

[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.880]
reneary long weekend that might be it hey it was fun Neil see ya I wish I

[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.960]
could say the same there's another one of Mike's people told you maybe Bob

[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.260]
Greene had a point you know it we have two open lines in both and broad see I'm

[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.940]
not defending that the reneary had a great show I'm just saying if you're gonna

[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.320]
blow somebody off has been on here 17 years and especially do it in a pretty

[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.540]
vulgar and vile way and not even let the guy say goodbye then you better damn well

[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.900]
have something really dynamite to bring on afterward and Cheryl's busy running

[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:48.560]
around here oh geez I'm worried about our people and now it's chucking a feel it

[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.260]
well what do you want me to do what would you like me to do would you like us all

[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.320]
just to go down the drain with a little bit of tidy bullman just to make

[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.940]
everybody feel good to make Andy Calve feel good our little Napoleonic morning

[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.220]
dictator who's running around here setting up all those insipid little interviews

[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.200]
it's just ain't flying man it ain't flying and then of course if something

[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.420]
should happen and that show should disappear oh it's Neil's fault I need

[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:14.960]
you've got nothing to do with it Neil told him stay keep reneary on man don't

[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.940]
make a big mistake and they did just the opposite so the more I say do

[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.680]
something in the morning they'll leave chuck on for 10 years because I'm saying

[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.080]
they're busy doing research again they're not gonna listen to me they're not

[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.960]
gonna listen to their own judgment because they don't have any they're busy doing

[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.440]
research which is how they got into this mess in the first place which is what

[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.520]
they already admit they even admit that they made a big mistake and how do they

[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.480]
do it because they did research so now they're doing more research to see how bad

[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.440]
they can screw it up again that's our company that's this incredible multi

[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.980]
billion dollar company why don't they just open up a research company that's

[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.420]
what they ought to do instead of paying all the maggot and all these other

[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.620]
assholes why don't they just open up a research company get out of broadcasting

[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.760]
because if they're enough fools in this business that keep spending big bucks on

[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.360]
research they could be like a multi trillion dollar company in a couple of years

[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:08.840]
here's Jensen Beach hello hi I was going to question about the football down here

[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.100]
yes now just for an example about the Jacksonville of Gremlins or whatever they are

[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.480]
no no about the coverage yeah okay first of all I'm from up to New York and

[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.820]
believe me people up there hate Buffalo too so you can feel good about that I do feel

[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.480]
very good about it yeah okay that shot happens everybody's got shot intensive

[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.900]
here today man they're all doing the S word today okay shot happens that's the

[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:34.060]
motto on W.I.O.D today shot happens a lot in upstate New York and there's a lot of

[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.400]
shot right around Syracuse you just have to dig through the snow piles to find

[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:42.720]
it just dig through the drifts manual be needy and shot which is what I feel like I

[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.960]
am right now now I'm looking at this thing I see this weekend on a scheduled

[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:54.340]
Jasmine case Saturday from 10 to 2 and at 2 o'clock till 6 we got Chris Baker is back

[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.840]
I didn't hear that much of my thought he was okay I thought he had like post

[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:04.140]
abilities and then next week of course Rick and SUDs around vacation and Jasmine

[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:07.900]
K gets to fill in for an entire week and I think we give the guy a chance instead

[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.760]
of like sitting here and getting all psychotic because Adam brought in some tape

[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.540]
that Jim whipped him up to a frenzy and they're high-fiving each other in a

[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.300]
control room because I'm playing it on here and getting all whipped up as they

[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.180]
would like to program me I think we'd be better off sitting in given a chance if

[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:24.520]
he's got anything to talk about except the faggots and bull dikes and bikes and

[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:30.140]
the dikes and whatever else that as he was talking about South Florida's news talk

[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:35.820]
and entertainment station news talk radios 610 W I O D Miami Fort Laugher

[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.660]
because I'm sitting here and just the smoke is coming out of my ears because

[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.440]
even though I don't really give a crap about what he says but when you stop and

[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.980]
think about the the implications of what he just said I mean if that's the case

[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.080]
then Randy ought to go over there with a shotgun and blow the living crap out

[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:57.360]
of them yeah because he's done nothing practically since the day she came on

[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.800]
ear or at least since we were over there but absolutely trash and do everything

[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.180]
that has power to decimate her along with that at psychotic bitch Kara over there

[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:09.900]
and it's like their whole crusade because they basically have no show so because

[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.500]
I'm talking about not about a person or a personality and certainly would never

[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.480]
attack Chuck on a personal level because he's a great guy and I love him he's a

[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.980]
super guy and a great talent but I'm talking about a show that's failing and

[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.360]
that's blowing and we're all going down with it but that therefore Chuck should

[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.220]
show me and no court and blah blah blah blah but how about Randy and not only the

[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.140]
attack but on the show but on a personal the most disgusting the lowest

[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:36.540]
form of slime in the history of the human race and this man is talking about

[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.520]
anybody else you are a real loser man and what do they kick this ass out of

[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:46.780]

have been the worst call in the history of the human race right there it's her

[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:10.220]

[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:02.000]
the old Batman and Robin show on TV because I liked Robin basically with

[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.580]
those real those nice tights on I loved Robin Bert Ward was one of my favorites

[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.540]
I mean with those little tight green shorts on and there was always like

[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:15.040]
something there well it was one of his secret weapons but that's the only

[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.820]
reason I enjoyed that now is kind of a good show was camp it was fun but I'm not

[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:19.580]
into comic books
