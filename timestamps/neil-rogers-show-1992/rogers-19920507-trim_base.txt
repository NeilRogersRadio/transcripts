[00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.220]
Hello Tommy here's a couple like country and western

[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.260]
and he just was going nuts you couldn't control himself.

[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.180]
We have an open line in Broward 524 WIOD

[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.640]
and what in Palm Beach that's ringing as we speak WIOD the Palm Beach line.

[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.000]
Yeah yeah. What's going on? How you doing?

[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.100]
Man, you either. I just saw it ringing and George was in there checking out

[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.120]
Manny's butt. I cannot believe that.

[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.680]
What's up? What are you doing?

[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.940]
Nothing I was just calling to get out. What's going on?

[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.860]
Now listen for a while.

[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.640]
Come to get on hold.

[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.680]
Well I want to check out if I want to listen to you for a few minutes

[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.220]
before I go on the air you kind of start with me.

[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.940]
Why is that?

[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.620]
Have you want to go back on hold?

[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.980]
I have nothing to say I have no material.

[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.300]
Well thanks up to that I'm holding on.

[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.360]
Okay we have an open line in Broward.

[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.320]
Now that's interesting as we continue delving into the psychology of

[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.320]
goofballs that call talk shows on the radio.

[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.780]
I bet you there are a lot of people like that they just call it any get on hold

[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.060]
and try desperately to think of something.

[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.460]
Most of them obviously fail as you hear every day.

[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.020]
Am I right sir?

[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.320]
Pretty much.

[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.160]
Okay hold on.

[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.700]
Here's a mobile in Miami on our star line.

[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.860]
Line lurking in a watch out for Graveline Alex. Look out.

[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.380]
Okay your time is up sir.

[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.260]
My time is up.

[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.740]
It's time for you to stop thinking and start talking.

[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.580]
Okay last year I saw the braves in the cup twice in Atlanta.

[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.200]
Yes sir.

[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.520]
Hold the count of the house on the school up there.

[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.800]
And the first time it was the first time I ever went to a professional game

[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.280]
and I'm sitting in line with my girlfriend to get tickets.

[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.940]
Wait a minute.

[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.780]
Wait what is that?

[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.340]
What is this?

[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.400]
For who?

[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.680]
Who is that?

[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.800]
I got to sign a picture here for Dave Graveline while I'm trying to do a show.

[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.400]
And the hell with Dave Graveline.

[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.200]
Exactly.

[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.640]
Oh Manny and the Dave are doing something in the studio now.

[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.800]
Okay go ahead sir.

[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.620]
Anyway we are.

[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.320]
All right listen keep your pants on Manny.

[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.720]
Go ahead.

[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.900]
What's going on over there?

[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.540]
Yeah that's what I'm beginning to wonder.

[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.260]
Anyway we got great seats.

[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.140]
Some guy had an extra set of tickets and there's wife.

[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.620]
No guns allowed in a studio.

[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.320]
Put that six shooter away Manny.

[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.260]
Doug out seats now.

[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.500]
A bravesie cubs dug out.

[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.440]
First time ever.

[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.560]
Yeah the hawk hits two home runs.

[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.600]
Rhino hits one.

[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.300]
Yeah they beat a 15 to two.

[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.140]
Oh I remember that game very vividly.

[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.680]
It was classic.

[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.700]
It was my first game ever.

[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.760]
Yes sir I loved it.

[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.760]
Okay.

[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.380]
Yup.

[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.580]
Is that it?

[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.720]
Basically.

[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.820]
Okay.

[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.800]
All right now.

[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.740]
It was not too good.

[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.440]
Not too bad.

[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.780]
Yeah.

[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.240]
Yup.

[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.980]
I love you.

[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.580]
See you.

[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.120]
1242 at WIOD.

[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.680]
Palm Beach we have an open line.

[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.060]
655 9463 655 WIOD.

[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.200]
Graveline just pulled up his pant leg and during the break

[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.900]
for Manny to tell you what he has in there.

[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.360]
Let's go to a poppinow.

[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.660]
Hello.

[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.600]
Hill.

[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.260]
Yes sir.

[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.260]
I love you too.

[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.780]
Yeah.

[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.720]
I'm booked.

[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.560]
Is that it?

[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.840]
That's it.

[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.780]
Boy it's really something to have this many dates lined up.

[00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.960]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.700]
Hi.

[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.260]
Hi.

[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.860]
Hi.

[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.180]
How are you?

[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.960]
I'm okay.

[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.440]
Okay.

[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.500]
I have a question.

[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.320]
Mm-hmm.

[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.200]
I'm from Detroit and I'm a major tiger fan.

[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.980]
And my boss unfortunately is a major red-sex fan.

[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.580]
And we have this running argument over which stadium is better.

[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.420]
And so we figured you can out the doubt.

[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.580]
You know there's no such thing as which stadium is better

[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.900]
both stadiums are great.

[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.480]
They're both a fairly smaller and it's um

[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.520]
you know got the green monster all that.

[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.720]
What's that echo coming from?

[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.320]
Hold on a second.

[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.660]

[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.940]
Okay.

[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.560]
Let's see when you're rid of that echo.

[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.120]
Is that better?

[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.280]
Yeah that's better.

[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.020]
No it's back.

[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.440]
Must be on your phone.

[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.260]
Must be.

[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.020]
Well anyway and the tiger stadium is great

[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.640]
because there's not a bad seat in the house.

[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.320]
It's uh the foul lines are very close to the field

[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.220]
and uh I used to go there a lot.

[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.380]
So they're both great.

[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.300]
Okay.

[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.020]
But they're both that's a lot of help.

[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.960]
But the mom knows.

[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.120]
There's no winning the argument.

[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.920]
There's not one of those arguments you can win.

[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.140]
It's like saying which color is better red or green.

[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.740]
I mean it's you know matter of taste.

[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.840]
It's addictive.

[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.940]
Well you know business always take on this right

[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.500]
and I always have to stand up for them you know.

[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.360]
Well tiger stadium if I was going to pick a ballpark

[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.020]
that's better in terms of being fair

[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.280]
the dimensions are better.

[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.080]
I mean the green monster in Fenway

[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.780]
makes it kind of a freaky ballpark.

[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.040]
So if you want to win the argument that way.

[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.740]
That was great.

[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.420]
Yeah.

[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.040]
He just puts you off in the radio.

[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.440]
Good.

[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.480]
Screw him.

[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.160]
Let's go back to bean town.

[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.100]
Well great.

[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.840]
Thanks a lot Neil.

[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.020]
Tell him he's a mass hole.

[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.560]
I definitely do that.

[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.980]
Okay.

[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.240]
And by the way I love you too.

[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.760]
See you.

[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.000]
Bye.

[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.140]
Okay.

[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.760]
Boy.

[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.660]
1244 George only wishes he had this many adoring people

[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.120]
out there just falling at his shoes.

[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.300]
Unfortunately they're not on.

[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.260]
Two open lines are both inbrowered 524 WIOD.

[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.140]
Got a thank you going on in the building here today.

[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.140]
Here's a mobile and four-letter.

[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.540]
Telegram from wherever.

[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.640]
In fact the telegram comes from New York but he's here.

[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.880]
So evidently a secretary sent the telegram.

[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.740]
Dear Neil I'm in Florida listening to your show as usual

[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.780]
and love it lost 59 pounds 50 more to go.

[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.620]
Would love to show off at the studio.

[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.260]
Give me a buzz et cetera and so on.

[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.880]
Whether it is Florida number.

[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.480]
Al we love you.

[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.060]
But don't hold your breath.

[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.640]
It's 11 past 10 at WIOD.

[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.240]
Also got a little more information yesterday.

[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.360]
The guy called I felt bad about yesterday because he was serious

[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.440]
wanting to know when we're going to do our trip in Chicago.

[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.160]
That we do every summer.

[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.800]
I don't know.

[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.580]
I really don't.

[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.040]
I'm not trying to give the guy a hard time.

[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.860]
I know nothing.

[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.040]
Because I work at 610 WIOD where a lot of energy is put

[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.740]
generally into the wrong areas.

[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.700]
So Cheryl I'm on the all I talk to Hank yesterday by the way.

[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.560]
Hank tells me that the scoop is out from the national

[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.500]
and others the Denver and Miami are going to get to major league baseball teams.

[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.560]
And if we don't by the way we can pick up Houston for 100 million no problem at all.

[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.720]
The sisters can buy the team then we can carry the games right.

[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.320]
And get off these horrible awful talk shows where we have to sit here and beg for people to call.

[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.040]
Hank and I can go out and he can buy the beer and I can do the baseball games.

[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.640]
But anyway Cheryl trapped me in the hallway out there yesterday at about 215

[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.800]
to tell me that the trip from to Chicago is on.

[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.900]
It will happen but it's still in the works.

[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.580]
And that a lot of us are praying that we can go and we want to.

[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.160]
Now I hope Mike DeCello from Midway Airlines is in town.

[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.200]
I was driving out here one day a couple of weeks ago.

[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.760]
I'm my way home and he was out there also just happened to be passing me on the 79th

[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.760]
Street Causeway waving and doing his usual little mousey thing he was doing.

[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.560]
You're a good guy Mike but we want to go to Chicago when it's convenient for us

[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.400]
and when we when we would like to go now when you would like to be there in shoes around us.

[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.720]
Okay.

[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.660]
We like seeing you once in a great while but basically we don't go to Chicago to see Mike DeCello.

[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.280]
Is that is that a bad way to put it without hurt his feelings?

[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.220]
We don't really care.

[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.580]
Because we want to go when it's convenient for us.

[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.980]
You know what I'm saying Mike?

[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.360]
So let's hurry up and get the thing put together and cut the crap.

[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.460]
Anyway it's 12 minutes past 10 at WIOD.

[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.680]
We've already got some calls on the board there this morning.

[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.400]
It'll be interesting to see if it's going to be like a regular Tuesday.

[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.160]
And what the hell is this obsession with Tanya Cruz man?

[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.860]
Did you hear that?

[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.760]
Somebody left me in my box the tape from yesterday's a Rick and Sud show.

[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.360]
Who is that?

[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.980]
Who is that?

[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.120]
Why don't you Cruz?

[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.560]
Wow.

[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.520]
Tanya Cruz is here.

[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.020]
Wow.

[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.480]
Tanya Cruz.

[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.540]
Go ahead, say that.

[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.760]
Tanya Cruz.

[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.980]
You popped the RR right there.

[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.180]
What I'm making long story short turned out it wasn't Tanya Cruz because Tanya Cruz

[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.520]
happens to be black and this is some white chick that wandered in the door

[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.100]
putting on some kind of an imposter thing.

[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.800]
Well she's supposed to be one of those babes that they sent for your birthday.

[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.920]
You know one of those things they do because evidently she kept her clothes on

[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.680]
and they kicked her ass out when she found out it wasn't Tanya Cruz or Sky 3 or Sky King.

[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.460]
There's trouble in Japan.

[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:57.380]
Toyota motor corporation has to sell off its surplus inventory of brand new 91 Toyota's.

[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.680]
Who do they turn to?

[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.180]
Of course.

[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.280]
Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.520]

[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.820]

I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.220]
The story that struck the thumb beach in the world.

[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:14.000]
Uncle Ted did throw on some boxer shorts, let's cruise a bark and rage with some babes.

[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.040]
Excellent.

[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.680]
Our money, women, and clothing.

[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:26.180]
Uncle Ted did let's use our infamous last name to impress these babes and do the wild thing

[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.340]
in the compound.

[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080]
No way Bill.

[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.640]
Just wait, Ted.

[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.000]
Excellent.

[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.520]
They're rich, they're powerful.

[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.520]
They like to swim naked.

[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.880]
William gonna be smitten.

[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:44.980]
Then Ted Kennedy and Bill and Ted's ex-foot adventure are two the next genitilias.

[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.320]
Excellent.

[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.560]
Coming soon to appear to be you.

[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.600]
Bring your ex for an ex-align.

[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.520]
1017.

[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.740]
At W.I.D. Mr. George tells me that Rick Sanchez was on with Bill Tanner this morning on mixed-up power 96.

[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.960]
Is he doing a radio show now?

[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.280]
Music show or a talk show?

[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.900]
He is definitely beyond a shadow without a frustrated talk host.

[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.360]
Maybe Bill Tanner is going to wind up like on right after B-Dell over there on the light bulb.

[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.160]
We found the losers because he desperately wants to do a talk show.

[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.380]
He don't want to do music.

[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.460]
He doesn't want to play all that filthy punky stuff.

[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.640]
Well you know what we didn't do yesterday at all?

[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.220]
Because I put it away and I can't find it.

[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.300]
Oh geez.

[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.160]
It's a good thing I started thinking about power 96 because that's what always makes you think about

[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.520]
dirty music immediately.

[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.540]
Okay, we'll just keep that handy.

[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.020]
Okay, let's give those numbers out and see what goes on.

[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.340]
Little TV history will be made at Rigglyfield Monday night next Monday the 13th when three generations

[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:55.020]
of carries Harry skip and chip settle into call a game between a Cubs and the Braves at Riggly.

[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.960]
Is that incredible or what?

[00:10:59.480 --> 00:10:59.960]
Incredible.

[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:08.940]
751 WIOD in Dade 524 in Broward and the Starline is cooking at Star IOD in Openline in Palm Beach 655 WIOD

[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.420]
Miami.

[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.060]
Good morning Neil.

[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:11.600]
Yes sir.

[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.200]
Do you know Harry is very personally?

[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.640]
Do I know him personally?

[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:14.980]
Yes.

[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:15.820]
Does he know you?

[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:16.300]
Yes.

[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.360]
So does he know that you do these bits and all that huh?

[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:19.600]
Yeah.

[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.380]
Has he ever heard them?

[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.040]
I don't know.

[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.200]
Okay, last night on the news channel 70.

[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.860]
Well, is there some significance to that?

[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.640]
Well, you know, the guys about ready to croak.

[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.660]
I didn't know whether you had to pay.

[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.220]
Not about ready to croak.

[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.500]
He's 170 years old, sir.

[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.180]
Well, you know, doesn't look a day over 90.

[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.720]
Uh, last night Jim Barry spoke to Jerry A's.

[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.580]
Are you heard about that right?

[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.020]
No, sir.

[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:40.740]
Uh, you know what?

[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.620]
Well, I can't watch channel 7 news unless I'm really depressed.

[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.680]
Well, listen to this Neil.

[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.640]
Let me give you a news update update.

[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.740]
Jim Barry is going to be calling all five cities

[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.620]
for the next five days to speak with the local sportscaster

[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.440]
about, you know, the possibility of getting the team.

[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.860]
Last night he spoke to A's are at Pambufflo.

[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.180]
A's are comes on the news right away.

[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.760]
He says Miami's a lock in.

[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.820]
Don't even call anybody else.

[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.340]
Miami's got the team.

[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.040]
Well, he has a nose for sports.

[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.420]
I beg your pardon?

[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.020]
I said he has a nose for sports.

[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.340]
He has a nose for sports.

[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:12.700]
Yeah.

[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.960]
You got a lane at the late age drive.

[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.840]
There you go.

[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.040]
Neil, how much was your air trip to uh, your affair to Las Vegas?

[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:20.640]
Too much.

[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.160]
Because I just called an airline to find out what the round trip was to uh,

[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.380]
Atlanta from Miami.

[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:26.840]
Yeah.

[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.340]
You know, I could go to Brussels for what they're charging now to go to.

[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.240]
It was outrageous.

[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.100]
It was a scene.

[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.460]
It cost me more for the airfare than I lost in Vegas.

[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.460]
We did get Eastern back on back online.

[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.160]
There you go.

[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.460]
Yeah.

[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:39.900]
Okay.

[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.660]
We'd like to have you there.

[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:40.940]
Okay.

[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.040]
20 after 10 at WYOD.

[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.140]
All three deadlines are wide open and one just dropped off in

[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.760]
Broward, which means we got two calls on the board.

[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.640]
This is going to be just like yesterday, isn't it?

[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:50.820]
Well, I don't care.

[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.040]
It didn't make a bit of difference to me.

[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.620]
Did yesterday because I was really depressed about being back in town after Vegas.

[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.800]
Today, I'm like back online as he would say.

[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.200]
Then make a bit of difference to us.

[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:00.560]
Okay.

[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.120]
If you call fine, if you don't call, that's okay too.

[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.100]
If you're that vapid,

[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.040]
if you're that burrish,

[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.580]
if you're that boring,

[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.720]
if you're that anti-social,

[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.240]
let's talk about tanya cruise for four hours.

[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.240]
That seems to do it.

[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.540]
I think that's where we're missing out.

[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:18.920]
Don't you?

[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:19.920]
That's where we're missing out.

[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.240]
Yeah, you were.

[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:20.400]

[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:20.680]

[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.080]
It's a better fact.

[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.820]
We're going to be going probably for a long time.

[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:24.520]
Okay.

[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.920]
We'll give this one on tanya cruise.

[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.620]
On tanya cruise.

[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.120]
On tanya cruise.

[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:29.840]
Yeah.

[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.700]
That was a good one.

[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.000]
Oh, he's got the guy.

[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:32.620]
What?

[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.640]
This is not tanya cruise.

[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.280]
Who is this?

[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.720]
He's not tanya cruise.

[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:40.720]

[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:41.880]
Who is this?

[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.960]
So what's the deal here, Marvin?

[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.940]
Marvin, our producer, who's supposed to thoroughly clean everybody.

[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.500]
Oh, this is tanya cruise.

[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.700]
This is tanya cruise.

[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.360]
Well, it's tanya, Marvin, your our producer.

[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.360]
You have to have been an Iranian carrying a bomb.

[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:57.880]

[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.520]
How did you get that?

[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.320]
What's happening in town tanya cruise?

[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.800]
I have no idea what that's all about.

[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.860]
I've never seen her.

[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.560]
I bet you nobody in this audience has ever seen her either.

[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.440]
Okay.

[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.440]
I'm going to give the numbers one more time before the break.

[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.000]
751 WIOD.

[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.540]
All the data lines are wide open.

[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.580]
And one in brown is open.

[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.900]
524 WIOD.

[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.780]
Then during the break,

[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.760]
we'll decide whether to play the rack or come back.

[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.200]
Because today would be a good day to do it.

[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.120]
Be kind of like a little reward to our listing audience.

[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.960]
So they don't have to put up with these idiotic collars.

[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.440]
And when you're right, then you always second guess me.

[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.000]
Oh, what a mess down.

[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.420]
You call my hand before I even get my back down.

[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.580]
And when I always on the main,

[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.120]
you seem to get a bad way.

[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.780]
Oh, and you know the press me.

[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.600]

[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.780]
when there's trouble,

[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:40.700]
I can count on you to leave me on the side of the road.

[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:46.240]
Because when I see you,

[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.680]
I fall in love with you.

[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.380]
So why am I in love?

[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.740]
Come with with us,

[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.660]
oh, and you to press me.

[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.740]

Oatbrain Eater.

[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.320]
First, it took a little girl.

[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.380]
Your mother serves lots of milk.

[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.640]
Then, it possessed the priest, bless you my child.

[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.560]
Now, it's taken over the refrigerator.

[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.620]
Honey, would you like a little parking margin on your muffin?

[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.580]
What was that, honey?

[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.320]
I said you want some parking.

[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:29.880]
Fire!

[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.680]
Honey, I think the tub on its table just talked.

[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.960]
You better believe it.

[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.480]
Okay.

[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.100]
Metro Golden Margarine presents

Honey, would you like a bottle please?

[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.720]
Grace will never be the same.

[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.260]
You will believe it's not butter and it doesn't stop there.

[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.480]
Hey, it's me, Donald.

[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.660]
You're close, I'm sorry.

[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.140]
As this is for, now melting at the cineplex too, plenty of free parking.

[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:12.640]
Fire!

[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.320]
Sometimes I feel myself

[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.520]
You know when it's white

[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.120]
You know you can feel it baby

[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.580]
You know it, you hear it, it's timing so white.

[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.400]
He's a honky, honky, honky, honky.

[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.460]
You pick a white one baby

[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:47.520]
He's a honky, and it's totally white, red, a bowl.

[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.520]
And you're occasionally dread a bowl.

[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.340]
And they got no butter bowl.

[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.460]
You pick the white one baby.

[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:05.660]
You know when it's white, you just got to face them.

[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.420]

[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.140]

[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.660]
You got no white one baby.

[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.140]
It's completely pet-bull-a-bow.

[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.180]
Very uncomfortable and lavably full of balls.

[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.580]
You pick the white one baby.

[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.520]

[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.680]
We've already played like what?

[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.020]
4 or 5? We got like 3000.

[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.680]
No problem at all.

[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.800]
Okay, we might even play the asshole song through that in there too.

[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.080]
That kills about 3 and a half minutes.

[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.420]
Hey, that's the way it is folks.

[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.680]
This is the week that was.

[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.340]
Started last week like after a Monday.

[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.740]
Like noon on Monday.

[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.240]
And now it's working into this week.

[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:54.980]
This is the month, the month of May, that the South Florida audience killed it.

[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.780]
Buried it for the big shovel.

[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:57.660]
That's okay.

[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.680]

Here's Andrew Dice Clay for Dice Aroni.

[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.520]
All right, let's say you're eaten.

[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.420]
You're sick and f**king tired of f**king potatoes.

[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.220]
And that's stovetop.

[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.340]
S**t. Do like me, honey.

[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:23.660]
Eat this.

Dice Aroni.

[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.180]
Come on, it's almost as simple as you.

[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.240]
Put the f**king bag in the f**king pot.

[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.460]
And you turn on the f**king stove.

[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.620]
You think you can manage that, honey?

[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.400]
Hey, butt up being the f**king thing's done.

[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.500]

And the f**king thing's done.

[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:43.300]
And the f**king thing's cudden,

[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.440]
I don't touch any money else and my true damn friend

[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:03.680]
So even touch my self, oh I don't touch with anybody else

[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.620]
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.740]
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.980]
I don't touch anybody else and my true damn friend

[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.100]
So even touch my self, oh no

[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:19.320]
I know one who keeps the fool coming

[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:28.360]
I know one who piled in high, so wanna stop until I'm unconscious

[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.780]
What time of these old bad eyes?

[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.000]
And can you make it in peace, thanks for being so kind to me

[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.560]
Oh you were saying?

[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.160]
He's talking to me, this thing is ending

[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.840]
And George is hacking me a Chinese about how Brian McGarry was just on a hotline looking for a job

[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.140]
Get outta here, will you give me a break?

[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.780]
Lock the doors, nail everything down

[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.060]
Okay, 1041 at W.I.W., did that interrupted the flow of the whole goddamn thing here?

[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.000]
I'm sitting here having a good time, what a painless Tuesday

[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.460]
And this yacht's in here is talking to me, I can't even hear the car ending

[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.940]
Oh man, brutal, brutal

[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.360]
Fort Lauderdale, you there?

[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.760]
Yeah, you're still there?

[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.360]
Go here

[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.500]
Boy that's incredible

[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.500]
Yeah, only homo's go to Vegas

[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.720]
Yeah, okay, that's why he waited all that time

[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.380]
He's probably been there about six times this year

[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.780]
Palm Beach is gone, Lady in Fort Lauderdale's gotta be gone, right?

[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.540]
No, I'm not

[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.340]
You're still there?

[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.020]
Yeah

[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:34.800]
Okay

[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.200]
Okay, Neil, I heard that you went to Las Vegas

[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.160]
And we spent all day on that yesterday, we don't wanna talk about it again today

[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.420]
Oh, I'm coming from Las Vegas

[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:45.880]
Yeah

[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.220]
And I love it

[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.740]
I'm cause somebody else says they don't like it, well I'm sorry, I do

[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.320]
I don't know why I wasted so much time

[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.460]
That was Ted Erison on the phone just now that previous call and don't worry about him

[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.120]
No, he's upset cause it hurts his cruise ship business

[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:05.760]
Oh, well I don't know why I waited so long to move out to Las Vegas, I'll tell you

[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.820]
It's a great place

[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.340]
Yeah

[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.900]
That's all I wanted to say

[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.360]
Okay

[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.240]
Okay, thanks so much

[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:13.640]
Hi

[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.500]
See what I mean, the town is dried up folks, it's history

[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.120]
They got nothing left to say they've said that's the problem

[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.960]
But you got people like Tanner on Power Do and Talk shows in the morning

[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.040]
There's only so much that people are got to say and they've said it

[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.660]
In fact, they've said it many, many times

[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.480]
Have you noticed that?

[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.560]
Many, many times over and over

[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.360]
Ponderous

[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.100]
Really Ponderous

[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.600]
This is the clicking line, listen, hello

[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.080]
Hello

[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.380]
There's a voice on here

[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.060]
Fort Lauderdale

[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.100]
Oh my God

[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.780]
You could knock me over with a feather duster

[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.740]
Yes sir

[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:51.280]
Okay, I wanted to set things straight here day in, let's hear the executive bathroom

[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:53.720]
What?

[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.880]
The executive bathroom card

[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.260]
What the hell is that?

[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.660]
What is, what the hell is that?

[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.440]
The executive bathroom card

[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.680]
Yeah, that's the one but

[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.340]
Now that card's not in here anymore, you know that

[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.360]
Oh, I didn't know that

[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.280]
Long gone

[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.680]
Come on now, somebody erased it?

[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.520]
It's in the dumpers

[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.320]
Oh well

[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.700]
Can't win them all

[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:12.960]
Yeah

[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.600]
Ciao

[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.680]
Okay but

[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.560]
See what I mean?

[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.220]
Absolutely

[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.220]
Now I was noticing and this is not a shot of Rick and Suds

[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.820]
Because like I said, the twang are in the middle of the space shuttle landing

[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.480]
Was the greatest moment in the history of radio

[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.300]
Although the tiny cruise thing is getting a little ponderous

[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.440]
But I've noticed that they're kind of reverting the collars on Rick and Suds

[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.120]
Also to a butt like remember a year ago June were you here then?

[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.900]
No, you weren't here were you?

[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.300]
You were

[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.760]
When airvie call was like butt load back at you remember that?

[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.440]
And I said hey wait a minute this is you know a little fun

[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.260]
But it's there's got to be a little something more than that with these collars

[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.600]
And now it's like a double back flip up your nose butt loads

[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.960]
And it seems like it's basically that am I right?

[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.240]
Isn't that what like most of the collars got to say and that's about it?

[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:09.620]
Triple cherry fudge Hawaiian pancake butt load back at you

[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.180]
See ya

[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:15.120]
And that's what our audience is kind of like degenerated I mean it's just nothing left

[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.640]
They have nothing left to say

[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.620]
It's like anything else I mean it's like in a restaurant if they don't keep resupplying

[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.100]
Sooner or later they run out of food

[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:27.420]
Underwear

[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.640]
Sooner or later they all get like crusty you don't go out and get new ones

[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:37.560]
They all run out of you can't use them anymore unless you want to start slipping those mal-oderous musty

[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.700]
Flatiss events like the one on the plane I talked about yesterday

[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.800]
But seriously the audience in this town of course there's nobody here anyway

[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.000]
Even coming on 79th Street again today I noticed very did you have any encounter much traffic?

[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.680]
Nothing you could just fly through there about 90

[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:58.020]
So let's go out to sky one now at Miami International and check out United flight number 402

[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.320]
I think is landing right now

[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.980]
Let's go to Chuck Myard Miami International see if we get a safe landing or

[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.020]
What everybody in the media is waiting for good crash

[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.920]
1045 at WIO D-Boy you could like I said knock me over with a feather

[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.800]
Lady mobile in North Miami she's not there

[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.040]
Is she?

[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.360]
Now she's gone

[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.640]
She said she might be out of the car for a second

[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:30.920]
She's a career

[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:36.400]
Oh she's a career well let's put her back on hold okay likely story mobile in bokeh

[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]
Hey now yeah

[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.780]
Hey do you ever think like Rick and Sucks could bring your show down

[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.700]
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.500]
What the hell do you think it means?

[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.000]
I know who this is too you know who that was that's your buddy

[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.220]
That's what we got left we got Mr. G

[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:56.420]
We got the homo from Vegas and that's about all we got left in the Sonya you know i'm coming to work this morning

[00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.520]
And it was incredible it's amazing what kind of a town this is i'm coming to work

[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:06.360]
There were more people honking and waving and recognize me in the car this more coming to work and i felt really great about that

[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.900]
They were like all alive you know i'm the age of 500 even a count it a car had a manatee county license plate

[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:18.860]
Full of people i don't know who the hell they were and they are waving and just the pukin and chordling and back on you

[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.240]
Triple banana cheesecake butt loads

And then i come in here and it's just like the whole town is dried up

[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.740]
