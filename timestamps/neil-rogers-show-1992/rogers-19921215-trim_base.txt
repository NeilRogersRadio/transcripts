[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]
I am an imbecile.

[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.020]
And now, a holiday tradition.

[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.020]
It's a wonderful life.

[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.800]
You know it's great to be alive, brothers.

[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.100]
There's so much I didn't realize.

[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.640]
So much to do, yeah.

[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.640]
I think I'll go listen to my Judas Priest albums.

[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.200]
Yeah.

[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200]
Oh!

[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.360]
I am a dog foot number one.

[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.920]
Yes, brother.

[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.940]
I am a dog foot.

[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.100]
I am a dog foot.

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.820]
I am a dog foot number one.

[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.060]
Okay, that's enough.

[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.420]
Let's not get carried away.

[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.900]
Okay, let's not overdo it.

[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.500]
10-07 at WIOD.

[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.540]
Happy Victory Day to you, man.

[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.700]
It's a little bit better last week.

[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.900]
Oh, jeez, look at that!

[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.360]
Oh, man, I just dropped my thing all over the damn mouth.

[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.060]
That's an omen.

[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.380]
I think it's time to go home right now.

[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.640]
Okay.

[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.080]
Let's put on some more tapes.

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.640]
Let's talk about that operation again, shall we?

[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.260]
I'm going to tell you, this is the schlockest radio market.

[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.200]
Even you people in Fort Myers are like major league compared to this town.

[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.820]
Plan the best of again, the best of the best of tapes that you've heard.

[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:41.000]
Like, the audience has gone to a point now that can recite the shows verbatim by rote, as Kyle would say.

[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.760]
It's amazing.

[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.720]
How many times have we heard that tape about the post-gall bladder operation already?

[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.420]
About 110?

[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.920]
Hi, this is Mory Fovitch, wishing you a happy Hanukkah.

[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.980]
Yeah, 10-18 at WIOD.

[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.260]
It's the Kakamon lady.

[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.240]
That is.

[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.540]
Why?

[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.980]
Thanks for calling, Kakamon.

[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.280]
I want to tell you, my nephew was in from New York and Naples for a couple of days.

[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.760]
Yes.

[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.920]
And he called me.

[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.580]
He's listening to the program.

[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.400]
Are you serial on 770 No Doubt?

[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.500]
Right, right.

[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.780]
Out of beautiful estero, Florida.

[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.660]
Isn't that at Naples, yeah?

[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.060]
Yeah.

[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.060]
Listen, I want to know, where did you buy the, uh, uh, uh, uh, trade-all?

[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.020]
I've never seen one.

[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.360]
I didn't buy that, Dreadel.

[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.020]
Oh.

[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.400]
One of our sales a whole, it gave it to me as kind of like a little gift.

[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.500]
It's just a little plastic chachki.

[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.620]
I don't know where she is.

[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.080]
Uh-uh.

[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.780]
Tina.

[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.420]
And I want to tell you, I watched that landing, uh, Thursday.

[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.140]
Yeah.

[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.620]
It was awful.

[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.680]
Was it?

[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.100]
Did you see it?

[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.800]
No, I'm not, I'm giving it up.

[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.040]
I'm giving it up too.

[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.420]
And the interesting thing, now that I've given it up, all of a sudden they're going to put it on Friday and it's beating L.A. law and all of a sudden it's making a big comeback.

[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.200]
So I guess now that we gave it up on this show, maybe it'll put it over the top again.

[00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.860]
But I can't, uh, it's just not interesting anymore.

[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.560]
Yeah, right, right.

[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.740]
They've killed everybody off.

[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.680]
Yeah.

[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.360]
Everybody's either killed off or they went on a bus to Florida to wait to die or something.

[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.360]
Right?

[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.780]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.520]
So my comment to, uh, to that show is...

[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.000]
Cock-a-mo.

[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.740]
Right, you got it.

[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.700]
And, uh, you got to Mommy's?

[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.260]
Oh, I'm going to Mommy's, all right?

[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.660]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.200]
Yep, I'll get another lecture on how I'm losing all my money at the track, get about how I'm drinking too much soda, and, uh, how I keep buying too many new cars.

[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.740]
And this one looks just like the other one.

[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.220]
Yeah.

[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.420]
All that out of good, uh, Cock-a-rye, right?

[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.500]
Not how Mommy's, uh.

[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.620]
Yes, that's how they are.

[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.380]
But you're not in the car anyway.

[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.660]
Oh, I'll listen anyway.

[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.100]
And you know what Mory says, don't you?

[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.580]
No.

[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.000]
Hi, this is Mory Fovitch, wishing you a happy Hanukkah.

[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.600]
Cock-a-mo.

[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.020]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.960]
Happy Hanukkah to you.

[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.580]
Happy Hanukkah.

[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.640]
Hanukkah.

[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.020]
Have a great day.

[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.200]
Yes, you too.

[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.800]
Take care.

[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.220]
See ya.

[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.760]
Bye-bye.

[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.340]
Here's a mobile in South Miami.

[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.760]
Hello.

[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.500]
Stand by for one moment.

[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.940]
I'm standing.

[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.160]
Wait, one moment?

[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.120]
One moment, please.

[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.520]
Oh.

[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.080]
Okay.

[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.440]
Here's the volume here.

[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.120]
We're listening.

[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.800]
No.

[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.340]
You don't even make sense when you speak.

[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.600]
You contradict yourself every other sentence.

[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.400]
And you should be ashamed of yourself as a broadcaster.

[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.340]
Well, it's good to know that you are...

[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.260]
Well, what was that?

[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.180]
What was it?

[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.620]
That made a lot of sense.

[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.800]
We waited, not only one, we waited two moments.

[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.980]
And you played that crap.

[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.200]
I have no idea who that was or what it was, but I have a nice day.

[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.080]
Oh, and I got a letter.

[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.300]
This is the epitome of this entire state.

[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.820]
Here's a letter with handwriting that looks like it was written by somebody a hundred and said,

[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.740]
like by Mathusla's grandfather.

[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.180]
And on the envelope it says,

[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.380]
W-I-O-D's radio personality outstanding and honest Mr. Neal Rogers,

[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.280]
care of W-I-O-D Miami, Florida.

[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.340]
I open it up.

[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.300]
Here's a craggy.

[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.360]
I mean, the writing, it looks like it's been scrawled by a man in his death clutches.

[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.960]
Dear Mr. Diana.

[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.440]
Dear Mr. Diana, is that as an, I'll get back to you, Diana?

[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.280]
I don't get that.

[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.980]
I'm not calling you because my voice is not pleasant to your listener.

[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.240]
I hear you complaint about old driver.

[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.740]
I witnessed a gorgeous blonde very young with a baby besides her smoking

[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.700]
and looking in the mirror and combing her golden locks

[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.600]
and suddenly the car circle around.

[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.380]
This happened on military trail in Okachoby in West Palm Beach.

[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.200]
Yours truly, Joe Kakamon, whatever came and read the name.

[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.280]
Then, PS, luckily, no one was around when she came to a halt.

[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.160]
She put on lipstick, so lay off the old, lousy, slow drivers with big bank account.

[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.160]
At a boy, Joe, thank you so much for your outstanding letter

[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.340]
and you're right about one thing.

[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.560]
Your voice probably is far too old and too irritating, even for our listeners and fort Myers.

[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.400]
Let's do a Palm Beach Gardens on a starline.

[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.700]
Hello?

[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.460]
Hey Neal.

[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.400]
How you doing?

[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.180]
Tremendous.

[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.600]
I said the game last night.

[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.000]
I usually don't go to the game.

[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.460]
Why not?

[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.240]
I'm just not that interested in football, but I did go last night.

[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.520]
Okay.

[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.940]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.640]
If you're not that interested, we had a good crowd there by the way.

[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.940]
I don't know.

[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.280]
I thought it was televised.

[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.680]
We had a tremendous crowd.

[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.360]
They were like emotional.

[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.660]
It was great.

[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.160]
I enjoyed it.

[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.240]
The question I have for you is, hello?

[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.540]
I'm here.

[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.860]
Okay.

[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.100]
What are you so afraid of?

[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.460]
I'm afraid of some mental about.

[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.980]
Deal, how come there's some of my batteries along my portable?

[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.900]
How come there's so much Tuchy Tuchy touching there?

[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.500]
I had my binoculars.

[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.480]
I can't believe it.

[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.780]
Is that in a stanza around the field?

[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.580]
On the field.

[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.560]
Because that's what it's all about.

[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.540]
Where I am at, the maze to that.

[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.140]
The other thing is, how come there's no male cheerleaders?

[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.440]
I think that's sexist.

[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.060]
It is.

[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.460]
Now, let me ask you something.

[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.860]
Don't you find it bizarre?

[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.260]
I've asked this question before.

[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.800]
None of these macho people out there.

[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:42.920]
They don't want to hear this.

[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:51.260]
But in professional sports is the only place where all these allegedly very macho guys run out and pat each other on the butt.

[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.220]
And then play grab ass.

[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.040]
I see that.

[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.160]
Now, for example, listen to me.

[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.380]
When you go into court, for example, here's a law firm.

[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.320]
And they win a very tough case.

[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.620]
They get the verdict from the jury.

[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.860]
And they're like high five.

[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.980]
They're shaking hands.

[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.600]
They're high five.

[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.980]
They're not patting each other on the Tush.

[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.180]
But in sports, guy goes out there.

[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.820]
And he gets like a bunch single.

[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.800]
And he goes out of first base.

[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.700]
And the coach pats him on the Tush and grabs him and is rubbing his back.

[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.320]
I know.

[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:16.820]
Yeah.

[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.060]
One other quick thing.

[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.000]
That's the bad reason why a same was suggested.

[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.160]
Fast, quickly.

[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.580]
Could I hear Kurt Waltheim, Chanaka?

[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.320]
See ya.

[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.480]
Boy, oh boy.

[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.940]
Talk about a need to butcher up.

[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.600]
10.53.

[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.080]
We got our real automation tones now, man.

[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.280]
There we go.

[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.720]
I want the people in four Myers to feel at home.

[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.440]
Because they hear that headline news all day.

[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.060]
That abortion.

[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.320]
I can't believe the radio stations actually pipe that visual crap up.

[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.180]
And he put it on here just to kill time.

[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.040]
Here's CNN headline news, man.

[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.800]
Yeah, yeah, all day on and on and on.

[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.500]
Here's a mobile and four-letter deal.

[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:51.880]
Hello.

[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.240]
Big report.

[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:53.760]
Yes.

[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.400]
595, just east of Pine Island Road.

[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.980]
Six of the Ornkers sitting there.

[00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.760]
Now, listen to this.

[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.760]
Right in the left and there's a damsel in district on the other side with a hood on her car up.

[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.120]
And nobody around it helped her.

[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.760]
What do you think of that?

[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.680]
Hey, they're busy, man.

[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.360]
They're busy doing important stuff.

[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:11.900]
That's right.

[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:12.720]
That's right.

[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.820]
Boy, oh boy.

[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.560]
Fight to know.

[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.660]
Thanks for the alert.

[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.100]
Gotcha.

[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.620]
See ya.

[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.160]
See, that's another thing that really disturbs me.

[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.220]
So often you'll see people broken down and they're just desperate out there.

[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.120]
And of course you're terrified to stop because you don't know if they're an ax murderer or a drag or what.

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.380]
And the porkers just very rarely seem to be there to help them out.

[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.240]
In fact, I've seen them drive right on by.

[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.480]
In hot pursuit of a very dangerous guy who was going like eight miles over the speed limit or something like that.

[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.980]
But boy, if you are going eight miles over the speed limit, more often than not, there they are.

[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.360]
Hey, guess what? Surprise.

[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.980]
We're here and we're ready for you, man.

[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.200]
We're doing it.

[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.120]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:48.520]
Hello.

[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.480]
Hello, Neil.

[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.520]
How you doing?

[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.360]
I'd like to know why you're so negative towards police officers.

[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.300]
Sir, do you want me to rehash the history of this show all over again?

[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.880]
No, I just like to...

[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.360]
I hear you so negative all the time.

[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.020]
I'd like to know why.

[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.680]
What do you hear me saying?

[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.640]
Do you hear the words?

[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.520]
Of course I hear the words.

[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.780]
Then what is it you don't understand?

[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:07.760]
Why?

[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.600]
Just I see you have a lot of resentment.

[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.180]
Is it something in your past or what?

[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.000]
No, it's something in everybody's present, not in their past.

[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.380]
People don't pay folks to go and work for them, which are the public dull.

[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.120]
So they can sit under bushes and overpasses, harassing the hell out of the public.

[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.540]
While people can't feel safe in their house or in their business or any other guy.

[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.500]
They're walking the streets.

[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.000]
That's not most of our idea of police work.

[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.380]
Don't you judge people by individuals or just by...

[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.840]
See, I'm not going to go through this whole thing again.

[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.400]
I'm not...

[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.500]
Every time you say anything, we have to do a disclaimer.

[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.080]
I haven't said that all cops are bad or that all cops enjoy writing tickets.

[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.600]
I've been through this a million times already, okay, pal?

[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.880]
But in generally speaking, this is the contact that people have with polies.

[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.340]
Is sitting out there looking over their shoulder, waiting to get a ticket for going nine miles over the speed limit.

[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.760]
Okay, it just sounds like you're on negative.

[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.920]
I mean, I know something happened.

[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.700]
Did you hear what I just said?

[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.460]
I didn't.

[00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.640]
Did you hear what I just said?

[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.880]
What word didn't you understand?

[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:01.820]
I didn't.

[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.600]
Don't be so rude.

[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.460]
I mean, we're talking.

[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.900]
You don't be so rude yourself, you jackball.

[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.740]
Okay, he's telling me how to talk on the air and how to what my attitude ought to be and what I should say and what I should think.

[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.720]
Up your espal.

[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.400]
Go write some tickets and leave us the hell alone.

[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:14.940]
God.

[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:21.720]
We have an open line in day, 751 and two on the Tampa, on Tampa for Myers on our big out of state link.

[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.600]
That's dead, man. Dead is a door nail.

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.680]
Here's Tampa.

[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.360]
Yeah, Neil, good morning, too.

[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.460]
This is all over today, pal.

[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.160]
At the end of our new exciting experiment.

[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.640]
Second day and it's all over Myers.

[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.240]
It's nice for you all down there.

[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.280]
I know to have a professional football team in the metropolitan areas.

[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.740]
Since we don't have one here in Tampa Bay.

[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.420]
That is correct.

[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:47.820]
Neil, I just wanted to stay on the line here and tell you that we've been listening to you here at work and for the longest time I've been hearing you bust the chops of this Joey guy.

[00:10:47.960 --> 00:11:00.000]
And I didn't know who the hell you were talking about, but unfortunately while driving down Dale Maybury, as a matter of fact, on Saturday, I turned your station on and I heard this guy with his high yes stuff.

[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.940]
You weren't in your crystal worry by the time?

[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.860]
I mean, Neil, I apologize.

[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.080]
I thought maybe you were being a little bit rough on this guy and I give him a chance to tell you he was the most nauseating.

[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.260]
Nobody called him.

[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.440]
He was, I think he was just entertaining himself.

[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.160]
In other words, he sucked his what you're trying to do.

[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.060]
Yeah, I mean, the oldie was not funny.

[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.940]
He was not entertaining.

[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.040]
He was not amusing and probably did not belong on to your any more.

[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.860]
Why is he on there?

[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.120]
You'd have to ask Boy Gary about that, our illustrious program, Mangler.

[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.620]
Well, it seemed that no one was calling to me.

[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.640]
He said, hey, you think he took a poll if people thought he should stay on the air.

[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.780]
They had just asked tonight.

[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.760]
He took a poll to see if people thought he should stay on the air?

[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.480]
Yeah, he did a poll.

[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.600]
He said, now we're getting, because no one was calling him.

[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.160]
No, no, no, no, no, no, take.

[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.720]
I listened to him for five minutes of the vote while driving from point A to point B and I probably turned him off.

[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.080]
But he took one of people to call in to see if he should stay on the air and some lady called and said,

[00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.660]
I guess you have a new person on a night, a female, said, this woman wants your job.

[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.300]
I mean, he was just a bit weird.

[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.520]
I just had to tell you that.

[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:03.940]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.220]
What do you mean she wants his job?

[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.680]
She's got a full-time job here.

[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.500]
He's just a filling on the weekend because we can't find any other salon.

[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:19.360]
This woman at the night time wants to really, did she knew from other sources that she really wanted his job on the weekends and all kinds of...

[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.120]
He was just terrible.

[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.660]
What the hell is that mean?

[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.940]
She wants his job on the weekend.

[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.800]
She works six days a week as it is.

[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.860]
I don't understand it, Neil.

[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.160]
I just want to tell you that I agree with you.

[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:28.980]
That's Joey's crowd.

[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.940]
I apologize for doubting you and he sucks.

[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:31.940]
Have a great day.

[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.280]
You too.

[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.740]
Okay, overstating the obvious.

[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.160]
Open line on the estate line, seeing again, it goes back to what we heard yesterday.

[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.480]
Joey thinks that everybody who gets hired on this radio station is taking a job that he would have had.

[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.200]
Rick and SUDD took his job.

[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.780]
Hank took his job.

[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.260]
Randy took his job.

[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.260]
Everybody gets hired.

[00:12:50.260 --> 00:13:00.180]
And what he doesn't understand is that there is no chance, even with a more online boy, Gary, in programming, there is less than no chance that he'd ever get hired to do like more than like a weekend job.

[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:08.500]
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Tyson's knockout chicken.

[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.680]
Hi, this is Ion Mike.

[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.140]
And if you're hungry, like a heavyweight, just look for a big gold teeth.

[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.080]
Tyson's knockout chicken.

[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.100]
You've never seen fresh like this.

[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.220]
Oh, nice to meet you.

[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.400]
Cry a hot, juicy big mic.

[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.920]
Do all mean patties on a sesame street brain.

[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.580]
You're better stay away from Don Burger King.

[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.340]
Or if he's got his chicken out.

[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.420]
Yeah, I'd like a...

[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.600]
Hey, aren't you the guy on trial?

[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.580]
How'd you like a knuckle thing with that?

[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.120]
Sure.

[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.080]
Come in up.

[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:40.540]
Oh!

[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.760]
Nick, and don't forget our world champion, chicken.

[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.640]
We got wings.

[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.000]
We got size.

[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.200]
We got...

[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.460]
Oh, check out the rings.

[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.980]
I can't control myself.

[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.560]
So do the wild thing.

[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.220]
And come to Tyson's knockout chicken tonight.

[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.060]
If you're hungry as a raging bull, come to Tyson.

[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.200]
And grab a handful.

[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.420]
1118 at WIOD.

[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.320]
Here's Dearfield.

[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:08.660]
Hello.

[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.420]
Well, I'm in for a lottery now.

[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.100]
Okay.

[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.900]
We're making good time.

[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.060]
I'll tell you that.

[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.080]
How's your blessings, pal?

[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.080]
Hey, I just want to say, in all the years I've been listening to you,

[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.720]
at least once or twice a week, you get one of these cop callers coming calling.

[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.400]
Oh, listen, I get so tired of that crap.

[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.820]
You know, like I have to justify, I have to defend every statement that I make

[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.440]
and I have to recut the history of the whole thing.

[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.960]
I'm not just speaking for myself.

[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.420]
I think I'm speaking for the majority of the public who are sick and tired

[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.940]
of paying people salary so they can be hassled and harassed

[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.840]
while people who are out there murdering and robbing and doing all kinds of crap

[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.260]
just, you know, go scot free.

[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.760]
People are sick of that crap.

[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.860]
Maybe they're afraid they're going to get a hang nail or something.

[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.100]

[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.620]
The great intimidation factor, man.

[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.520]
If we go and give tickets to people with his bumper stickers on,

[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.560]
if we call them up and make threatening calls, we know where you're liable,

[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.780]
we're going to get you that kind of stuff that we can shut them up

[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.120]
and we won't be saying that crap anymore, even if it's true.

[00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.800]
Got them, I sick of that crap.

[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.960]
Well, like I always say, they have more rights in Russia now than we do here.

[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.660]
So everything got turned upside down.

[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.380]
Well, they're just trying to get out of their system in the next 35 days

[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.500]
before it's all over.

[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.580]
And speak about comedy.

[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.260]
Let's talk about Joey for a second.

[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:11.720]
Yes.

[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.300]
He has showed the other day, which was my wife and I.

[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.860]
It was absolutely bar stuff.

[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.900]
Man, it was horrible.

[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.960]
He has no right being on the earth.

[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.520]
And if there's anybody out there that wants to become a radio personality,

[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.540]
this should show them that there is an ample opportunity.

[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.260]
Well, you know what really bothers me?

[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.640]
Because I've been, like I said, in a business a long time.

[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.960]
And I know that there are some young people out there who've got some talent.

[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.400]
But you have to cultivate it.

[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.040]
You have to go out.

[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.680]
I mean, it takes a little effort instead of recycling the same old tired crap,

[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.000]
like Joey and Ed Till and all these other washed up board never was people.

[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.520]
You know, cool out and find something.

[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.480]
I mean, just for a weekend, you can call it like Randy, for example.

[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.820]
I mean, she had never done this kind of thing before.

[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.180]
There's a classic example.

[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:59.360]
Caldivates some new talent instead of rehashing the same old tired crap that the public wants to puke from.

[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.160]
Anyone would be good.

[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.380]
Anyone he is the worst.

[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.420]
He thinks he's any young man and he really sucks.

[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.160]
Yeah, he's doing sit-down comedy.

[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.720]
And somebody else is too and it wasn't funny the first time.

[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.000]
And he doesn't talk to anyone.

[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.300]
He doesn't talk to the audience.

[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.460]
He just talks to the air.

[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:12.860]
Yeah.

[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.540]
And it was but in his buddy Lou Yeager and Bill Marshall.

[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.300]
And it's like a little coffee clatch with a bunch of guys saying,

[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.860]
boy, won't we grade 50 years ago when Vaudeville was in?

[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.420]
It's a real quick, you know what I mean?

[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:22.760]
Yeah.

[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.460]
Have a great day.

[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.200]
One more thing.

[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.920]
Yeah, you can close it.

[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.360]
But he took the poll.

[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:25.860]
Yeah.

[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.240]
He took it the last 15 minutes of the show.

[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.720]
Now you can imagine now who the hell was listening to in the last 15 minutes of the show.

[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.120]
Yeah.

[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.340]
And two other things.

[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.000]
He let us two words.

[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.320]
He shouldn't have let on the air.

[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.940]
He let shot with an eye.

[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:39.780]
No.

[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:40.320]
Yes.

[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.480]
If you listen to the tape, you'll hear it.

[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:42.700]
Yeah.

[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.520]
And he also let smuckstucker on the air.

[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.240]
That's great.

[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:47.960]
Isn't that great?

[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:48.460]
Beautiful.

[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.580]
Okay.

[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.600]
See ya.

[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.140]
I am that hemorrhoid.

[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:52.940]
Nice going, Joe.

[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:53.700]
Hi.

[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.680]
This is Jim.

[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.060]
Love your show, Neil.

[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:57.760]
Love you.

[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:58.940]
Love you.

[00:16:59.440 --> 00:16:59.880]
1128.

[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.780]
So Tampa, WSU, and his on night pattern again now.

[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.300]
This company, man, they could screw up the Pope.

[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.440]
This is just the most amazing company.

[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.260]
Technically, it starts right at the top with the chief engineers on all these radio stations.

[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.360]
And works its way right down to their toes.

[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.560]
Just absolute total incompetence and incontinence.

[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:21.820]
God.

[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.180]
There are no wonder we're not getting any calls from like anywhere.

[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.940]
And of course, probably what you call it, WWCN.

[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.800]
They're probably off the air.

[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.940]
Is there anybody on the air over there, sir?

[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:30.600]
Hello.

[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.120]
Yes.

[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.000]
Yeah, Orlando.

[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:32.880]
Yeah, you're in Orlando.

[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.320]
Yeah, listen and enjoy.

[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.240]
What the hell is that mean?

[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.100]
You're in Orlando.

[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.760]
You're like 87 miles away from Tampa and you're like a million miles away from Fort Myers.

[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.880]
I'm picking you up here.

[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.700]
You kind of like, like, Casper was trying to jam you something, but you coming in pretty good.

[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.380]
Yes, especially since they're on like seven Watts night pattern right now that lets you win.

[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.640]
Every time I come on the air, they stick it on night pattern.

[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.000]
See, I guess we did a little too well on the trend there.

[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.160]
We broke it too on Friday.

[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.780]
So let's give my handicap again.

[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.180]
Hey, the local guy here was a trashing you.

[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.600]
So I figured I'd listen to you and search your scared.

[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:04.440]
Listen.

[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.680]
Yeah, we're terrified since we're not in the same market.

[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.900]
We're really terrified of him.

[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.360]
Yeah, Phillips.

[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.080]
Listen, I got a quick question.

[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.360]
Does that all...

[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.480]
I don't understand that.

[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.500]
I was talking to a friend of mine who works at Cool Gold the other day.

[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.300]
He called me the other day.

[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.320]
And I said to him, I said, why in the world would you be on the air in Orlando?

[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.300]
Talking about Neil Rogers is not even on the same market.

[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.900]
What is the logic in that?

[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.000]
What is the sense?

[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:27.620]
I don't know.

[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.460]
What does it mean?

[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.840]
He said you got a great contract down there so he might as you.

[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:32.820]
Yeah, let's go ahead.

[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.680]
Another one to be.

[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.300]
Two quick questions.

[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.300]
Political, do you think political questions?

[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:39.840]
No.

[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.960]
No, what's the next one?

[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:49.520]
Okay, I was down to South Florida and I was wondering how y'all felt about bush sending all that money to Somalia when you guys needed down there.

[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.400]
And the other question was, what was your opinion of how popular Lumbol is?

[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.960]
Call up Jim Phillips.

[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.520]
He'll tell you.

[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.120]
Okay, now that was the one call we had on the scene.

[00:18:59.200 --> 00:18:59.600]
Look at that.

[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.440]
Look at that.

[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.980]
That is a testimony to this whole concept, man.

[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.160]
That is a testament to it right there.

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.180]
All the other six lines are smoking.

[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:16.700]
And the three, we just got through spending big, big fat, goosey, expensive dollars to put that system in.

[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.800]
The out of town to Florida Watts, they're dead as a door nail.

[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.520]
1-800.

[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:27.540]
I'm going to give this number one last time seriously because I'm not going to sit here fooling myself the rest of my life.

[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:33.540]
I think we're sacrificing what was used to be a really hot show for a bunch of nose pickers.

[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.200]
That's what I think.

[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.400]
I don't want to start in now.

[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.220]
But I got roped.

[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:44.660]
I got a lawsuit into this whole concept by a bunch of management type idiots who want to squeeze the last drop.

[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.880]
Let's put on the best of from 9 to 10.

[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.000]
The warm up hour.

[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.000]
Repeat the tapes.

[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.260]
Let's put them on in Tampa.

[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.780]
Let's squeeze every drop because we're paying them like more than 375 an hour.

[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.100]
Let's see if we can squeeze anything out while he's still alive.

[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.120]
That's the concept of this goddamn heartless cold obnoxious company man.

[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.080]
Now where are these people?

[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.580]
Because I'm getting really porked off.

[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:06.640]
You're in Tampa?

[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.300]
Yep.

[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.700]
Well that's pretty exciting.

[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.660]
Interesting huh?

[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.700]
So are they on like six Watts today or what?

[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.600]
What's going on over there with that SUN?

[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.000]
It's not that on the nighttime up here.

[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.180]
I mean are they ever going to get their goddamn act together there or what?

[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.720]
They just can't get their finger out of their orifice.

[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.120]
You know Tom Belvita, what's as I do?

[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.240]
Yeah, I sure do.

[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.300]
That answers it all man.

[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.260]
Yeah really.

[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.200]
So how do you think the dolphins played last night?

[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.040]
I thought they played a hell of a lot better.

[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.660]
Not great.

[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:39.640]
The defense was great but the offense still had its sporadic moments keeping in mind that they scored one grand touchdown.

[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.160]
I couldn't believe how pathetic Jay Schrader was playing.

[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.060]
He's terrible.

[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.340]
I mean he is the worst and top of a renovate isn't much better.

[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.580]
No well he was busy in fact.

[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.220]
Did you notice that every time they started eroding the chalk lines on the like on the 40 and 50 yard line

[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.360]
that Todd was down there and like you had a reason why the chalk was disappearing?

[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.860]
He couldn't score on a panty rate.

[00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.760]
Mirror one of it.

[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.240]
Yeah I'm believable.

[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:01.560]
Yeah.

[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.260]
Take it on Mark Larson's spy report for you.

[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:03.640]
Yes sir.

[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.920]
He's trying to imitate you now.

[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:06.600]
Oh geez.

[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.100]
I mean they're all trying all of them you are pulling trying to imitate you now.

[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:10.880]
Doing what?

[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:19.640]
Well that will start to get a little less topical and they're starting to quote you the quote for what are words a lot more like now.

[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.400]
And it's such as what are they saying dooth bag?

[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.060]
Dooth bag?

[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.960]
They haven't quite hit that level yet.

[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:28.780]
That will be next week.

[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:29.660]
You mark my words.

[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.680]
Mark Larson will be a do-and-doosh bag next week or do you think?

[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.800]
One point one guy did say shot.

[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:35.760]
No.

[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.780]
I'm serious.

[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.140]
No.

[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.580]
One thing I love about this business is the originality of it.

[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.060]
That's my favorite part of the whole business.

[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.120]
Yeah.

[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.480]
It's one of the best.

[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.060]
Yeah.

[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.600]
Well thanks for the good news.

[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.480]
And speaking of shot go see Mark.

[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:52.540]
Okay.

[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.020]
What the hell just happened there?

[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.800]
Did I put him on hold?

[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.560]
Are you still there?

[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:57.820]
He's gone.

[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.400]
Thank God.

[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.800]
Even the competition agrees.

[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.120]
The Neil Rogers show on WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beach is.

[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.800]
Is the best morning show in South Florida.

[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.360]
I don't think I was just a nice here on an AM station as a hero in Miami.

[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.980]
If you're like St. Thomas the Quiett, you got no problem with me.

[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:20.620]
Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Rogers show on theta 4.

[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.840]
I hope you beat me in the readings.

[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.780]
You better than I am.

[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.520]
I have my nose up kneels.

[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.020]
Ask 20 till noon at WIOD.

[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.720]
Joie Flyaway, baby.

[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.020]
America has spoken.

[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.300]
They are dying for you to start flying.

[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.040]
We have an open line on the out of town thing at 1-800.

[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:36.180]
I'm a veteran.

[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.220]
God, I've lost it today.

[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.560]
I've officially lost it.

[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.800]
I'm thrown in the towel, man.

[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.160]
I can't take this anymore.

[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.020]
Like doing a show in a goddamn funeral parlor.

[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.500]
Is there anybody alive out there?

[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.280]
I feel like Lloyd Lindsay Young only not doing the weather.

[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.020]
I never smoke hot.

[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.320]
You know, I don't have the answer.

[00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.040]
I used to know it.

[00:22:59.160 --> 00:22:59.620]
I don't know.

[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.860]
There is a phone over on the order.

[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.960]
News talk radio.

[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.080]
610 WIOD presents the Neil Rogers show.

[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.120]
They get in touch and talk with Neil.

[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.920]
Dial 751 WIOD from day.

[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.860]
Inbrouwer, it's 524 WIOD.

[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.220]
Outside the 305 area code.

[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.860]
toll free 1-800-944-WIOD.

[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.500]
And Bell South mobility customers make a free call by dialing star IOD.

[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.480]
The opinions expressed by the guest's host or callers are not necessarily those of this station.

[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.640]
Now here's Neil Rogers on News talk radio.

[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.840]
610 WIOD.

[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.660]
Hi, this is Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.180]
Huh?

[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.280]
Ah, Martha, I can't get up.

[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.300]
What do you mean?

[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.340]
Well, the older I'm getting the tougher it is to climb out of bed and start today.

[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.640]
George doesn't know it, but this morning he's getting prune tang.

[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.500]
A brand new breakfast drink that will get him up and active before he knows it.

[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.420]
Here, honey, drink this.

[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.740]
Mmm, not bad.

[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.640]
Taste like Grandbury, Juicentuna.

[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.860]
I'm feeling good.

[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.720]
I feel like I could move a mountain.

[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.740]
Come here, you little muffin.

[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.340]
Oh, George.

[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.860]
Don't let age get you down.

[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.600]
Try the new breakfast drink sweeping the rest homes of America.

[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:21.660]
New prune tang.

[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.660]
Prune tang.

[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.620]
It stores everywhere.

[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:30.100]
Fowl06 and WIOD and we got an open line in Broward at 524 and we're like a kid with a new play toy.

[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.180]
It's like having a new dreidel at Hanukkah time and we're just seeing if it works.

[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.460]
Like Lake Boinevista.

[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.540]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.840]
Oh, man, I'm really disappointed I wanted to check back in with you before the break at noon

[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.120]
because then I could hear myself driving home tonight.

[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.540]
I'll check this.

[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.460]
Well, you got new rejoins on S.U.N. now.

[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:49.940]
Do we?

[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.100]
Yeah, they're not saying check back in with us anymore.

[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:52.900]
And who's doing them?

[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.340]
I don't know.

[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.100]
It's it's a new voice.

[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.000]
Probably, Mitch Lewis.

[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.000]
Does it sound like somebody who belongs on the air?

[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.660]
It could be because he used to do this hair replacement on it.

[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.100]
That's him.

[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:02.860]
That's Mitch Lewis.

[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.220]
In other words, they finally got that stuff on the air so it doesn't sound like nose picking heaven over there.

[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:07.560]
Yeah.

[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.460]
The one of the audiences is mesmerized.

[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:09.820]
Yeah.

[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.460]
And are they operating more than six watts now or what?

[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.080]
Well, I'm picking them up here in Lake Boinevista.

[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.140]
So yeah, it's coming in just kind of crappy.

[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.900]
If it's coming in in Lake Boinevista, I guarantee you that the mouse is pretty unhappy about that.

[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.220]
Well, because if we say asshole on here, then the mouse might actually hear it.

[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.220]
And you know they got psychotic when Randy was there and they'll get crazy again.

[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.400]
Well, you were getting psychotic earlier today about nobody calling in, so I just wanted to call it.

[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:40.320]
Well, no, I just like having some fun with these and those pickers over there and trying to get them into habit of getting off their ass.

[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.820]
They don't know what the hell it's all about. They haven't figured it out yet.

[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.560]
Well, I want to get some of those crotchety old farts from four Myers on the phone.

[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.360]
Some of the ones who hate me like poison already, but pretend they don't listen.

[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.600]
And we'll never turn it off.

[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.080]
Well, they just haven't fully caught on to the concept of the IOD network.

[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:57.680]
Right.

[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.400]
And neither of we.

[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.880]
Well, listen, have a great day.

[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:01.580]
And you too.

[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.280]
And see ya. He sounded like Super Dave almost, didn't he?

[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.620]
Oh, that sounded like Super Dave. Just a little tiny one, yeah.

[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.580]
Open line in day, 751. And look at that. W-I-O-D.

[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.920]
Yeah, I've talked to you a lot.

[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.160]
And where are you calling from, sir?

[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:15.960]
Four Myers.

[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.080]
Are you, sirial?

[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:17.520]
Yep.

[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.920]
You are in Fort Myers, the great home and bastion of sanity?

[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:22.880]
Yep.

[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.160]
And old farts?

[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.880]
Yeah, you could say that.

[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:31.260]
And nose picking and slow driving and quiet, basically a placid.

[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.000]
Well, I put you on cold because I just knew you were from Fort Myers.

[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:34.460]
Uh-huh.

[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.980]
I can tell by the way the phone was ringing.

[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:36.600]
Okay.

[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.660]
So how is it?

[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:38.680]
How is it?

[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.200]
Yeah.

[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.040]
I love living here.

[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:40.660]
Do you?

[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:41.080]
Yeah.

[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.200]
What do you like most about living there?

[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:43.900]
The area.

[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.780]
The waterways.

[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:50.260]
The water, the ambiance, the trees, the climate, the beauty, the old people with their

[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.060]
in-a-ma bags.

[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.780]
I'm not worried about the in-a-ma bags.

[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.200]
I'm not that old, so.

[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.640]
When in doubt, squeeze it out.

[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.420]
Excuse me?

[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.440]
I said so you're having a great life over there.

[00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:58.800]
Yeah?

[00:26:59.080 --> 00:26:59.360]
Great.

[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.740]
I moved over from Fort Lauderdale.

[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.340]
I lived I grew up before Lauderdale.

[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.740]
And how long ago was that?

[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.980]
Uh, I lived there for 22 years.

[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.000]
I lived over here for four years now.

[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.540]
And you like it better over there?

[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.040]
Sure do.

[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.220]
Well, I don't blame you, sir.

[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.220]
I love Fort Myers.

[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.760]
And I don't even know what the hell it's all about.

[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.100]
I've just driven through there a couple of times real fast.

[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:16.540]
Mm-hmm.

[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.240]
Like I floor my vet and go through there real fast.

[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.260]
Real fast, huh?

[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.620]
Yeah, like about 140.

[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.280]
Mm-hmm.

[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:23.860]
Why is that?

[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.020]
Just in case they know who it is.

[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:31.200]
So anyway, you discovered 770, you're doing it over there with us, huh?

[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.820]
Well, I'm listening to you, but I gotta tell you the reason you're failing over here.

[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:35.480]
I'm failing.

[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.560]
What do you mean I'm failing over there?

[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.060]
We only been on for a day and a half.

[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:38.660]
Yeah, no.

[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.320]
But you're calling it quips already?

[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.100]
No, I'm not.

[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.080]
Well, you're failing over there, you are.

[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.200]
I'm thinking about it.

[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.000]
How about another figure, Mitch Lewis?

[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:46.900]
I'll tell you what.

[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:47.540]
Why is that?

[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.680]
You're in Ditto Land.

[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.580]
I'm in what?

[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.440]
You're in Ditto Land.

[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:52.540]
Ditto Land?

[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.620]
Got Limbo Land.

[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.780]
Oh, give me a break, will you?

[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.280]
Larnas Land.

[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.380]
Larnas Land.

[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.080]
Right wing, Larnas?

[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:00.620]
That's right.

[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.780]
That's why there's number one talk show radio in there.

[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.380]
How come you're listening to this show then?

[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.880]
I'm switching right now.

[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.240]
You're so okay, do I fast?

[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.740]
He's swishing.

[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.940]
He sounded like he was swishing.

[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.400]
I got news for you, pal.

[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.620]
You wouldn't switch that dial if your life depended on.

[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.520]
He's probably Steve Gilbert's a grandchild, illegitimate.

[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.280]
Is that the kid that he called on the air many years ago?

[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.100]
Did the mommy and I get divorced because I was in radio?

[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.380]
That was the greatest call of all time, Steve.

[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.980]
Man, you suck so bad that there are no words in the English vocabulary to describe it.

[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.000]
The absolute pits.

[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.300]
He makes Joey sound like Westbrook Van Voorhees on a good day.

[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.840]
That's how bad Steve Gilbert is.

[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.060]
You got a dental floss.

[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.060]
You're at a party.

[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.540]
Talking to friends, dancing, mainly.

[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.940]
And then it happens.

[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:49.260]
Now when I leave my beer in these stressful times, the last thing you need is to misplace

[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:49.900]
your brew.

[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.640]
Hey, yo, is this my beer?

[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.600]
You wouldn't have this problem if you used the junk home beer beaper.

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.860]
Simply attach it to your beer.

[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.620]
Clap once in.

[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.020]
Clap once, drink up.

[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.020]
Beer beaper.

[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.140]
To order, call 1-800-FAT-DRAWD.

[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:03.740]
Get yours now.

[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.640]
Say for everyone else's time.

[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.680]
Hey, yo, is this my beer?

[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.040]
So anyway, 12-18 at WIOD.

[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.980]
We have an open line at Broughtts, so we're failing over there.

[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:14.400]
Is that it?

[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.440]
We've been on for like six hours and 18 minutes.

[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.000]
And it's been declared official.

[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.780]
We are failing in Ford Myers.

[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:21.560]
We're very sorry.

[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.480]
It's been nice to try it though.

[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.360]
March shot is a piece of crap.

[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.100]
Ow!

[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.600]
It just does something for me.

[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.500]
Let me tell you something, pal.

[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.820]
The New York Jets suck.

[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:33.560]
Ow!

[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.220]
Is this ever happened to you?

[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.460]
Oh, I love you, baby.

[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:37.740]
Oh, baby.

[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.760]
Oh, oh, baby.

[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.260]
Ow!

[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.220]
Another ruined evening.

[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.180]
All because of plastic love doll blowout.

[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.180]
Now you're just a lonely guy with nothing to look forward to,

[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.680]
but the McNeil air report.

[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.420]
Who you could call AAA, but that's so embarrassing.

[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.820]
Well, now you can be up and running fast

[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.960]
with a new love doll patch kit.

[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.440]
These durable steel-belted patches

[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.340]
resist tearing, splitting, and ruptures.

[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.620]
And they're medically safe.

[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.440]
Eliminating skin rash, skid marks, and ruptures.

[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.160]
You will be ready for hours of action in just minutes.

[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:09.860]
Oh, baby.

[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:11.540]
Ow!

[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.240]
Keep plenty on hand for the safest sex yet,

[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.080]
from Trojan Tire and Rubber Company.

[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.620]
1241 at WIOD.

[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.300]
That's for Ford Myers.

[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.720]
Hi, this is Jim.

[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.160]
Love your show, Neil.

[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:24.800]
Love you.

[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.000]
Love you.

[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.280]
1251, Randy returns after a night at the ballgame last night.

[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.780]
Didn't see her, but she was at the tailgate party

[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.980]
with Chuck, evidently doing it.

[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.660]
So anyway, we put Sandy James up there now

[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.240]
at the top of the list for the sales hole of the week.

[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.520]
I got to tell you something.

[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.860]
These people back there, they just drive me nuts.

[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.320]
They drive me apes bit.

[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:48.760]
Sandy James.

[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.020]
She is just, she makes Steve Perissim

[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.600]
like he has some clue as to what he's doing.

[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.520]
She comes to me this morning,

[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.460]
a, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap,

[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.480]
bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap,

[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.640]
bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap,

[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.720]
but I'm supposed to have it here.

[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.480]
I mean, God, if brains were dangerous,

[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.880]
she'd be the safest human on the face of the earth.

[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.260]
Pravital records presents the Beach Boys

[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.740]
as never heard before.

[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.560]
The endless binge is now available for a limited time.

[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.700]
Wouldn't it be nice if we were sober?

[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.700]
Maybe then we could write something songs.

[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.160]
We apologize for a good mom.

[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.780]
We have been around for far too long.

[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.300]
The Beach Boys, singing their way to the top

[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.600]
and belching their way back down.

[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.420]
The Beach Boys, endless binge.

[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.100]
Too much old granddad in me

[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.560]
My blood is about to explode

[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.820]
Then I'm holding my own

[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.500]
Losing the fight

[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.180]
No bathroom in sight

[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.940]
Yeah, yeah

[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.720]
Well, I'm so cold-tubed

[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.900]
Can't find the commos

[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.820]
The Beach Boys' head was this

[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.640]
Yes!

[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.280]
Available at rehab is everywhere

[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.500]
That was getting more

[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.300]
126, you know I was just thinking about something

[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.560]
Suppose the people at WWCN

[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.720]
In Ford Myers, since they do run at

[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.340]
A God-awful CNN headline news crap all day

[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.560]
Suppose they have an automation thing set up

[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.860]
So they must have, huh?

[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.000]
So that the spots run, so every time we play

[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.680]
Wouldn't that be something if it fired off a bunch of carts?

[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:51.900]
Yeah

[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.880]
So let's just keep going

[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.800]
All day, and screw those bastards up, huh?

[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:57.740]
That would be great

[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.900]
God, they must be turning their hairs out at the roots

[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.800]
Here's, um...

[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.680]
Oh, excuse me, here's Stuart, hello

[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:04.840]
Hello?

[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:05.480]
Yes, sir

[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.260]
Neil, hi

[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.380]
First time caller

[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.320]
Well, that's great

[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.040]
Did you happen to watch the NBC News last night at 6?

[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:13.980]
No, I did not

[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.940]
Okay, they had a list of the $10 people in America

[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.400]
Yes?

[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.960]
I don't know what magazine, National Magazine, put it out

[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.280]
I bet your Lord-ass limbo was in there

[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.120]
Number nine

[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:23.440]
Yeah

[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.380]
Oh, you knew it

[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.000]
With a bullet

[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.700]
Yes, it was number nine and Madonna was number 10

[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.080]
Great

[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.440]
That's what I want to let you know

[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.200]
I didn't know you knew it

[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.060]
No, I did not know it, it was just a lucky guess

[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:32.700]
How could you...

[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.160]
Oh, he was didn't know it, okay?

[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.620]
No, I figured you might have been at the party at the game

[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.940]
And didn't see it or hear about it

[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.860]
Great news, pal

[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.960]
Okay, have a great day

[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.600]
Have a good day, bye

[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.500]
Did always this

[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.860]
Coming up tonight and eight, following sports dog 6Gat

[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.280]
It's the Rambi Road Show right here

[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.660]
Rambi Y-O-T

[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.440]
Sometimes I feel myself

[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.920]
The most controversial movie of our time

[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.660]
Martin Scorsese is the last temptation of price

[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.520]
Recently became available for home viewing on cassette

[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.560]
Religious groups, mifted the release of the film theatrically

[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.120]
Became outraged on the event of its home distribution

[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.560]
And so, for your spiritual edification

[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.400]
And for those who don't have VCRs on a price of a movie ticket

[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.440]
We are proud to present live

[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.920]
Part one, the radio version of Martin Scorsese's

[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.780]
The last temptation of Christ

[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.180]
Buddy, buddy

[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.420]
Wanna buy a hot stereo?

[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.800]
Ah, ah, gee, I better not

[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.620]
Okay

[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.140]
So the controversy continues

[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.920]
Cune in tomorrow for block two

[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.960]
Martin Scorsese is the second last temptation of Christ

[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.900]
Good day

[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.020]
Well, gee, I'm busy here

[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.840]
Okay, I'm busy closing shop up

[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.140]
I wanna hear what this is

[00:34:55.660 --> 00:35:00.400]
Am I losing it?

[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.320]
Or I just forgot

[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.020]
Bus is on in Miami

[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.760]
Walking downstairs

[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.140]
It didn't see hangs like a stick and out

[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.260]
Probably grab the handrail

[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.040]
But Gary greased it good

[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.540]
You won't be signing anybody out

[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.120]
Oh, feeling pain is typical

[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.320]
And working in this place

[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.280]
Nothing, it ain't worth nothing

[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.980]
Unless you're working for free

[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.360]
Oh, bust your ass

[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.880]
Or bust your arm

[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.200]
It's all the same to me

[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.720]
Busting it is good enough for me

[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.040]
It's good enough for me

[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.060]
And Bob and Green

[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.160]
Heart-bel-A-Pole

[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.700]
Wow, that's great

[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.500]
I think we only played that once before, didn't we?

[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.880]
Well, it's about time we dug out some crap

[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.620]
That we've only played like once before

[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.220]
Too bad that somebody

[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.240]
with such a talent of mix Lewis has to be

[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.980]
wasting it on that night rhythm shot

[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.440]
142, well that's true

[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.820]
That show is an abortion man

[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:15.880]
It's the worst thing in the history

[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.760]
It makes even Joey sound almost good

[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.760]
I don't wanna get carried away

[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.620]
Here's Miami, hello

[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.120]
A nail

[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:21.820]
Yes sir

[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.600]
I went to Fort Myers Beach last year

[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.260]
And I went through Estero and Estero Island

[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.280]
What a lucky guy

[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.860]
You don't want me at any closer than you are right now, my friend

[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.700]
I believe it

[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.100]
I think they probably got you tuned in at the beach shop

[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.260]
And the dairy queen over there

[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.760]
So that's two people at least

[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.580]
All right

[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.440]
Hey, one more thing in clothing

[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.960]
That's what the dairy queen

[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.580]
What is it?

[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.460]
Browning Nagle

[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.800]
And there's New York Jets

[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.880]
So wait a minute, straighten me out

[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.560]
Ken O'Brien is out for the year right?

[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.260]
He's on the DL

[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.040]
So apparently so yeah

[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:56.220]
And Browning, who last time he looked like a lost puppy last time I looked at him

[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.120]
Browning Bagel?

[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.880]
Yeah, yeah, Browning Bagel

[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.720]
He's gotta bring a real big lunch basket with him here

[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.820]
Because Brian Cox is gonna eat his lunch

[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.240]
Great

[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.840]
And maybe Alfred Al can sell him at a discount at the Bagel Shop

[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.860]
In closing Nagle, Jim Manditch is God

[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.060]
Fat Hank, it's great that he's gone to the other station

[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:15.420]
I wish him well, but boy the football sounds a hell of a lot better now than it did before

[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:15.980]
Okay

[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.240]
Thanks Nagle, see ya

[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:17.460]
Bye

[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.440]
And Mr. Weaver agrees I'm sure because he's just an agreeable sort

[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:21.980]
Not

[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.720]
144, here's a Miami, hello

[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:26.640]
Nagle

[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.040]
Yeah

[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.620]
Hey, I went to this game yesterday

[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.220]
And I was sitting right next to the front zone

[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.740]
And the only time that a raider fan got a dolphin fan

[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.960]
When he jumped three rows and started kicking the crap out of him

[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.240]
Yeah

[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.160]
And then the dolphin fan grabbed him and threw him down three rows

[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:43.620]
Yeah

[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.380]
Up against the rails

[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.760]
And there was no extra charge to watch all of this, right?

[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:48.240]
Nope

[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.360]
What a deal, man

[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.740]
But I got this ice hole there

[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.900]
This is in front of me, his name is Ramirez

[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:54.480]
Yeah

[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.420]
And he stands up every place

[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.180]
What a game

[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.980]
I have time to see the old fart down there

[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.280]
Yeah

[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.360]
Every day

[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.160]
What a geek

[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:02.760]
Yep

[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.540]
Well, tell him, sit down and shot head

[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.820]
I'd say that, buddy

[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.560]
He's deaf

[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:07.800]
He's deaf?

[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:08.320]
Yep

[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:09.960]
He got those

[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.540]
How about if you punch in the ribs, you see if he's got any feeling, okay?

[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:14.200]
Okay

[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.620]
And you'll see how quick he is, too

[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.380]
Yeah, then he'll bring his friend out his nose

[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.340]
Amen, okay

[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.220]
Have a great life pal, get out of here

[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:21.920]
Okay, 145

[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.560]
So evidently the fun zone, there's a lot more fun going on than we realized, huh?

[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.280]
There's a little something there that don't meet the fly at the eye

[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.400]
In that fun zone

[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.160]
Kendall

[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.400]
Oh, Neil

[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.240]
Yes, sir

[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.240]
Neil, I just wanted to tell you I was watching TV on Sunday

[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.660]
And I was watching the new WKRP instance, right?

[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.300]
The new WCrap, yes

[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.260]
Yeah, exactly

[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.740]
Well, I was just, once I wasn't really watching, I was looking around

[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.460]
And they had a guy on Rush Limbaugh look alike

[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.300]
His name was Lush Rambo

[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.380]
Yeah, we already heard about this

[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.260]
We heard it was a great put down, yeah

[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.000]
It was pretty disgusting

[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.960]
He was riding an exercise bike and eating three cheeseburgers

[00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.320]
Great

[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.860]
That's all I wanted to tell you

[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.020]
If ever there was a loud ass man, that's the one

[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.360]
It was a rush look like he was disgusting

[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:05.960]
Okay

[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.700]
All right, thank you

[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.220]
Have a great life

[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.120]
145

[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.180]
So we got the, I guess today we like covered the estero story, huh?

[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.440]
Maybe tomorrow we'll work on someplace else big like Port Charlotte

[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.340]
Remember that movie Hush Hush Port Charlotte?

[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.440]
Something really good

[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.280]
And Johnny Druck was just telling me

[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.120]
They're running like a little reverb in the back

[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.320]
On WWCN on 770 out your dial

[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.940]
And four Myers baby, yeah, we're doing it man

[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.600]
Kick it ass, our own

[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.440]
So wouldn't that be something if every time I played that automation tone

[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.360]
A kickoff is set a spot because they have it

[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:41.020]
I'm sure they got the thing set up for CNN headline news like almost all day long, man

[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.840]
Oh, excuse me, there we go again

[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.680]
Just see that board op over there flying to stop the carts

[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.160]
And then the thing you do is you then you take the break like right away

[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.320]
Like it's 146 on the IOD network

[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.320]
So anyway, well that's the human, that's the break we're doing it

[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:02.060]
George got all panicky over here so you can imagine what they're doing over there

[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.020]
And as you went

[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.320]
Now for Myers, they got their crap together, man

[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.560]
They really got their shot together

[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.000]
Okay, here's Hollywood, hello

[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.940]
Hollywood is long gone, I can tell

[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:18.060]
I thought I just saw Dan Stewart marching down the hall with a very serally look on its face

[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:25.120]
God, you talk about a just absolutely psychotic, just angry young man

[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.480]
Boka, now, yes sir

[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.280]
Whatever happened to red shots

[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:33.660]
The blue shots

[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.100]
Yeah, I think they got the shots

[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.300]
Let's go to Coca-Cola Creek, hello

[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:40.740]
Hey, great show, Neil

[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.580]
Yes it is

[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.060]
Listen, I got a medical medical medical question

[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.320]
Wonderful

[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.720]
If Karen Carpenter had eaten mama cast a sandwich, would they both be alive today?

[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:58.600]
We've been asking that question in fact, every time I get together with my friends in the anorexia business

[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.220]
We sit around and discuss that for hours on time

[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:06.100]
When he better was asking me that in the hallway the other day, she was eyeing that Vila Deli Cornbeer sandwich

[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.900]
That's good, do you know David Paul?

[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.220]
Do I know him?

[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:09.460]
Yeah

[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.540]
Do I know of him?

[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.600]
Or of him or whatever?

[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:12.020]
Yeah

[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.580]
I hear the tape, do you like him or not like him?

[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.800]
Do I like him?

[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.200]
Or not unbelabeled

[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.280]
He is the biggest piece of swill that ever came down the pike

[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.860]
I used to live in Atlanta and...

[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:27.100]
How could anybody have ever put that little pipsqueak swill head on the air?

[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.660]
Well, the thing got that hard head till

[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.440]
Right, that's right

[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.860]
Hey listen, I got a new turn for it

[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.420]
It's true they're asked both out the door

[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.560]
Neil, instead of saying shot, say spit

[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.020]
Like jack spit

[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.640]
You don't know jack spit?

[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.860]
You don't know jack spit, man

[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.280]
Well maybe they could be interchangeable

[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.820]
You know, just sped it around, you know

[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.460]
It's like in hockey you've got a slap shot, how about a spit shot?

[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.500]
Yeah, I didn't mean jack spit to me, okay?

[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.280]
Okay, see ya

[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:52.440]
What?

[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.320]
See ya spit head

[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:59.800]
152, you see we're just creating a whole new vocabulary and the reason we do that is because we live in a very juvenile country

[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:06.260]
with a bunch of dictatorial, censoring in-mind type assholes who are sitting up there for another 35 days or so at the FCC

[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.340]
Like L-Sykes

[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.200]
By-al, see ya

[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.160]
Well, I want that to be a sorry day for us

[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.180]
Mark that day on the calendar baby

[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:19.180]
January the 20th, the first day when we say goodbye to all those assholes on the FCC

[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.140]
The Federal Censorship Commission

[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:27.500]
Who have just arbitrarily, thanks to Jesse Helms and people like Lord-ass Limbaugh and all these other goody tussues

[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.860]
Who just take and rape the Constitution and the Bill of Rights to their own convenience or how they want

[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.960]
Just arbitrarily made it up as they went along, man

[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.680]
All sexual organs and expatory activity

[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.280]
But where the hell did that come from?

[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.820]
What were they like Alexander Graham Bell call him on a phone and tell him that?

[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.740]
Did George Washington just drop down the cherry tree and say oh by the way I forgot to tell ya

[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.520]
Boy, what a pile of shot that is huh?

[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:56.380]
And spit

[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.700]
Let's get cereal, man

[00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.480]
Let's cut the crap

[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.880]
Let's stop being like, talk about repression

[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.680]
See that's what bothers me about people in this country

[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:11.060]
They accept every kind of unacceptable repression as if this is the way it's supposed to be, man

[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.460]
Like that poker that called the alleged poker that called earlier in the show

[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.680]
Well what's the problem? What do you got a problem with?

[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.460]
Because we don't like being hassled and harassed by people whose salaries were paying

[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.720]
That's not what we're paying you for, geekhead

[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.220]
You moron?

[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.260]
Oh I'm sorry, it's busy right now probably

[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.040]
Busy under the overpass

[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.480]
Let's do a bokeh, hello

[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.260]
What's up, bro?

[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.160]
How you doing, sir?

[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.080]
I'm okay, I was wondering, was that rich eating ice cream last night?

[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.040]
I don't think so unless he ate it downstairs, I don't think he brought any up by me

[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.320]
Because he kept waiting for me to go to Carvelle to get my hot butt Sunday which I did not get

[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.300]
I was a good boy

[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:48.940]
Would not?

[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:49.560]
No nuts

[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.720]
No nuts? No, it's the Rick Riley Sunday, no nuts

[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.000]
And I didn't get it at all

[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.440]
And so he may have slinked down there because I know he flew down there at halftime

[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.280]
Whitefall is extremely fat guy eating ice cream

[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.400]
Down in the thing

[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.000]
Oh yeah, down in my thing

[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.260]
Yeah, that was him

[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.880]
Oh, I figured so

[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:11.060]
But I just want to say, uh, Raider's suck and uh, wha

[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.920]
Okay, good to Quinnella there, 157

[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.660]
And yeah, he didn't come back up and dare eat any ice cream in front of my face

[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.960]
Of course he is on a diet so we probably had the yogurt

[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.480]
Like about 20-30 gallons of it

[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.020]
Before the game, we went in there, we decided, uh, we were not going to have the Italian sausage

[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.340]
So we had one of those smoked jalapeno things

[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.440]
And a diet soda

[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.060]
And we finished that in about 30 seconds and we both looked at the sausage and said, okay, what are we going to eat now?

[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:41.260]
So then we, he went and got us both the Italian sausage, smothered in onions

[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.760]
And I must say this, it's not bad, the sausage ain't that great but the onions are good

[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.100]
In fact, the best thing to do is take the weenie out of the bun

[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.080]
And just stick all the onions in there and eat that, I think that's what we'll do Sunday night

[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:58.340]
And then Orlando stopped by speaking of taking the weenie out of the bun, Orlando stopped by right after that

[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.040]
And boy, he was just, uh, ready for that game last night

[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.720]
He was ready, looked like he was ready for anything

[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:04.620]
God

[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.880]
Here's, uh, and he said he'd be calling soon by the way

[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.980]
He just, to kind of left with like a threatening, a parting message, I will be calling soon

[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.880]
So, uh, be prepared, govern yourselves accordingly

[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.180]
And what are we going to do about Dan Stewart?

[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.860]
Well, that's it, man, we're done, we're finished, we're through, we've had it, we're history

[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:27.820]
We're audio, we're out of here, we're, uh, 1-800-852-006, you know what that is

[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.780]
This is South Florida's news, traffic and weather station

[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:37.280]
Yeah, we just saw a radio 610-W-Y-O-D by any Fort Lauderdale and the Palm Beaches

[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.380]
That's great, I'm impressed

[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.920]
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Hopkins in the 610-W-Y-O-D News Center

[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:50.300]
The temperature at 2 o'clock 78 degrees in the 610-W-Y-O-D Weather Center

[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.480]
Here's meteorologist Bob Soepert, fairly typical for this time of year

[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:56.760]
Hey, Steve Gilbert on the air, they got no talent on the air

[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.020]
God, I can't believe he's in Fort Myers one day

[00:45:59.020 --> 00:45:59.980]
Absolutely zero

[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:06.520]
And so, again, nice to hear you on here, but, um, one thing you talk a lot about football

[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.940]
I'm not really much of a football fan, but I do like baseball

[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.420]
Right, anything, you into that at all?

[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:16.300]
In my into that, I'm a maniac Cubs fan and I, of course, a Marlins fan to be since we got our team

[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.140]
But I'm a...
