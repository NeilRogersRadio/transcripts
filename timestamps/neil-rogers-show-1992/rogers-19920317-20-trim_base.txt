[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020]
This is just to find your fate

[00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.920]
It's a lie, I am not a Nazi

[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.720]
I just want my fate for slightly ill

[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.760]
And I hope it doesn't matter

[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.620]
My new girlfriend, her standards will be

[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.440]
With the head under her eyes

[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.940]
I thought of all the faiths that we've been through

[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.240]
And how I had guessed and she did too

[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.440]
I just tried her achievements

[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.780]
She could have the eye to know

[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.920]
And create a space between us

[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.280]
That could spend it and do

[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.860]
Maybe they'd been trying to decide

[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.180]
Because she farch doesn't matter

[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.780]
And my knees can't leave me

[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.640]
And my eyes start to wander

[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.540]
And I think it's about forgiveness

[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.340]
forgiveness

[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.900]
forgiveness

[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.460]
With every will

[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.860]
She keeps going and going

[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.900]
They're all waiting your life

[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.580]
Who will deny that they ever are farch?

[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.300]
You know they've got so much time

[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.260]
Well, then look you in the eye

[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.580]
Maybe I'll say you're wrong

[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.900]
Then the front of those bad sheets

[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.340]
I'll drop you a phone

[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.560]
Baby, I'm trying to decide

[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.000]
If she farch doesn't matter

[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.260]
When her back side comes

[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.980]
And the front stock is going to make you bad

[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.260]
forgiveness

[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.160]
forgiveness

[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.820]
Even if she gets bloody

[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.980]
Come on, baby

[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.440]
She's calling

[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.160]
Welcome to Space the Nation

[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.780]
153 at WIWD

[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.460]
We're having a little pseudo intellectual conversation

[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.740]
Over some rice and crap

[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.140]
Rice and bean

[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.960]
So how do you get your thing?

[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.060]
Don't talk because they get upset

[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.720]
When you're on the show

[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.660]
But did you get your thing straight

[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.280]
Not with your tent?

[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.420]
Okay, let's go to A

[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.640]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.780]
Pick me port in Hollywood wrong question

[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.160]
Hello

[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.560]
Hi there, how are you doing?

[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.060]
Okay

[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.180]
Glad to listen to you there

[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.180]
Today you make my day

[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.920]
Well, thank you so much sir

[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.780]
Pick report on the turnpike

[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.340]
Northbound

[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.380]
Your plane is up

[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.360]
Are you cereal?

[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.040]
Oh yeah

[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.920]
Well, that's good for me

[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.240]
Because I'm on my way right now

[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.160]
Okay, they're on the air

[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.660]
Right there

[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.180]
Just before the Hollywood exit

[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.600]
They're right in 64 miles an hour now

[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.100]
I'm going to put on my governor right on my thing

[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.560]
You need to go to their pumpkin

[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.960]
I'm going to stick him right on my hood

[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.840]
And go up to about 180

[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.060]
Of course, they're on the highway patrol cars

[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.940]
Anywhere else in the turnpike in front of our county

[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.480]
So if you break down you wait

[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.740]
But they were getting their feeding friends

[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.500]
Well, they're busy

[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.520]
Now they've got to get it all in

[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.100]
Before that thing goes into effect

[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.960]
It's not the truth

[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.760]
Thank you sir

[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.480]
They don't have a good day

[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.100]
Thank very much

[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.300]
See, that's the thing that Bill did

[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.380]
You hear that the other day

[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.320]
That he signed it in law

[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.300]
But all the stuff that passes now

[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.540]
Doesn't go in until he used to be October 1st

[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.680]
But I think now it's July 1st or sometime in July

[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.060]
So now they've got to make up for what time they're going to lose in the future

[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.080]
So they're going crazy

[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.580]
A homestead

[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.840]
Hey Neil, how you doing buddy?

[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.480]
Okay, Pally

[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.020]
I have one question, Neil

[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.300]
Yeah

[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.720]
Please tell me is it too early to say Sammy Smith sucks

[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.480]
Um, oh geez

[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.820]
Not always yet too early

[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.260]
But where the hell is that one where it says the Sammy still sucks

[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.160]
Where is that thing?

[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.460]
I'll find it for you sir

[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.200]
Just to make sure

[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.600]
Okay

[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.580]
And we know it without the instant replay

[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.340]
I appreciate it

[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.160]
Okay, have a great day

[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.020]
No, I was thinking about that this morning

[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.200]
I get this frightening feeling that I'm psychic

[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.860]
Because I had a dream this morning that I went to Vegas

[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.780]
And I didn't win two million dollars

[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.160]
And I think that's probably the right one

[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.060]
Um, where is the thing?

[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.160]
I can't find anything

[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.880]
Roger probably screws with all my cards

[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.580]
And he comes in

[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.360]
Oh, you got a crappy filing system

[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.400]
Uh, don't we have one?

[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.100]
That's a Sammy still sucks

[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.420]
Huh?

[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.260]
Well, we have this

[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.460]
Which uh,

[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.020]
Sammy sucks

[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.540]
Oh, yeah

[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.280]
But then we have the uh,

[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.820]
Sequel to that which I'll find eventually

[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.600]
Okay, here's Cooper City

[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.640]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.080]
Pretty good

[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.460]
Listen, you hear about the Mu uh,

[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.540]
Cubs ticket thing

[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.640]
The ticket thing

[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.540]
Yeah, they got two programs

[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.780]
You buy one, you get one free

[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.340]
And if you buy two, you get the pitch that day

[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.720]
Yeah

[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.420]
Exactly, you're right

[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.420]
Listen, I found a new founder's spec for you

[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.000]
I got news for it's not a laughing matter

[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.700]
So there's a lot of truth in what you say

[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.880]
Oh, it's true, but listen, I found new founder's spec for you

[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.160]
Okay

[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.280]
Yes, when you actually went on the air and said that

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.660]
98% of your people don't care about the harness track

[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.060]
And I think it took a lot of guts to admit that

[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.700]
Why is that?

[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.540]
Because you're always talking about it

[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.560]
No, see one thing I learned a long time ago

[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.880]
Is that if you go on the air

[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.400]
Like certain people in this business

[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.280]
I'm not going to mention names

[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.760]
Only care about like baseball cards

[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.100]
Okay

[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.220]
Including one who's a good friend of mine in my attorney

[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.740]
The audience out there

[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.580]
Can you imagine

[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.920]
Stop and think about this

[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.200]
Can you imagine what percentage of the public

[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.520]
Is interested in baseball cards

[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.980]
And then of that percent

[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.980]
Can you imagine how many might be listening to you at a given time

[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.800]
So you're talking about like a room at the holiday in

[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.980]
Like 50 people, okay

[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.040]
Out of potentially millions of people out there

[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.120]
You can't just draw on and on and on

[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.900]
About the things that only your interest is in

[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.160]
Or you're you're dead meat

[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.800]
And so if I just said here in time

[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.560]
I mean I could talk about racing all day

[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.920]
Because I love it, I love the track

[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.700]
But I try to keep it to a minimum

[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.820]
Because most people out there don't care about it

[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.160]
Listen, this morning you hit on something

[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.060]
When you put those two people together on the phone

[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.540]
Yeah

[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.040]
Next time and drag that a little bit

[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.840]
Just stick all the lines on one at one time

[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.980]
And let them all talk to each other

[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.080]
Exactly, the servant

[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.700]
There you go

[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.400]
Have a great life

[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.860]
Have a good ride

[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.640]
Oh, okay

[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.900]
Bye

[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.280]
Have a good ride home

[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.240]
Well, that sounded ominous

[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.420]
157 at WIOD

[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.920]
In fact, I have to take my vet into the up to Ed Morris

[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.940]
Not because there's any problem

[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.760]
I love my vet

[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.860]
God, I love the car is so phenomenal

[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.200]
But GM called me a few days ago

[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.340]
And they have like a little recall thing

[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.180]
Where they're like about a half

[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.580]
It doesn't

[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.100]
Little minor teeny things that they're changing

[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.040]
And so he's got all the parts

[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.780]
And they do it

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.640]
And then they give you a car to drive for a day

[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.540]
And all that other stuff

[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.800]
Um, like the engine and uh

[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.560]
No, no, sir

[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.860]
I don't know what they are

[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.820]
Little minor

[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.940]
Don't go knocking my

[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.040]
And you know the interesting

[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.600]
phenomenon that I've noticed

[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.620]
Uh, no, seriously

[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.220]
The thing I noticed that's happens on your show now

[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.400]
All these punks that call in about the new Mazda

[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.400]
And it's

[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.960]
It's always comparing to the vet

[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.660]
So we're actually

[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.360]
Forgetting about the porses now

[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.460]
And all these other crappy cars

[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.740]
Finally, at least they're coming into the real world

[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.620]
And they're starting to compare

[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.900]
The new standard is

[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.820]
Has compared to the 92 vet

[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.020]
And you're finally getting it right

[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.980]
Because the 92 vet is the best damn

[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.660]
Car it's been made in a long time

[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.460]
Okay, and I'm sure that new Mazda

[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.220]
You're talking about is going to be a beautiful car

[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.860]
And but 31 grand

[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.280]
35 you can get a vet

[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.260]
And I got news for you

[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.980]
A vet is a much more stylish car

[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.520]
I don't care what anybody says

[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.200]
I know I don't agree with you at all

[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.060]
I didn't get that vet

[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.660]
Because I wanted to be the only one on the road

[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.820]
I got it because I liked it

[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.140]
But I did see two others that color I'm painting it

[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.600]
I still like I don't care what any of you say

[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.540]
I still like that pimple be over the yellow

[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.560]
And the uh pink it

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.620]
I like it man, I love it

[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.880]
And I'm going to tell you he was

[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.660]
For about how much 10 grand

[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.100]
No for about 45 hundred

[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.580]
Really?

[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.820]
That like that?

[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.700]
Woo!

[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.160]
45 hundred big ones man

[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.300]
Let's see if my check will cover that

[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.640]
Huh?

[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.420]
Oh yeah, that covers it in then some

[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.640]
What?

[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.380]
You don't want to know how much I make that

[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.180]
That's

[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.580]
That's tacky as hell

[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.340]
I've worked long hard years to suck this kind of money out of these ass

[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.660]
All out of these nice people here

[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.800]
And I'm going to uh drain air and especially for this extra half hour

[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.780]
That I'm doing public service on the micro-neurysure

[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.460]
See I didn't realize that was also part of the deal in court

[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.280]
You don't know that

[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.340]
Not only do I do

[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.240]
No, I do fundraisers for the Camilla's house

[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.500]
I also do 30 minutes a day for the inframed radio broadcasters

[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.940]
Who can't handle it anymore, okay?

[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.240]
So I do like 30 minutes a day for the aged micro-neurieal

[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.140]
All right, because he can't keep it up from 9 to 10

[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.620]
He's having enough trouble from 9 15 to 9 30 with the mystery record in there man

[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.500]
Oh god and the show too

[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.900]
Well, listen have a great day and that's oh god

[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.740]

I wish you and your lovely bride the best

[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.500]
I hope your tent gets straightened out. I hope you get your political

[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:31.780]
I hope I hope she works on your politics because she seems like a really hip with it and not too much like a bra

[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.560]
I'm sorry

[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.260]

the

[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.520]
okay I was wrong I lied the

[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.960]
book of Brian Colts that the

[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.560]
song was based on a sign what

[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.980]
year 60 something 68 68 the

[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.260]
Tam's called what the young

[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.360]
the young behind the foolish be

[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.300]
happy and be still my sweet to

[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.900]
think and the Tam's also had a

[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.120]
hit what kind of fool do you think

[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.800]
I am I ABC Paramount 1964 but it

[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.900]
seems to me it seems to me that

[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.740]
Bill Deel and the Randells had

[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.100]
the big hit on what kind of fool

[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.240]
do you think I am that amazing

[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.800]
that just happens to be in a

[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.840]
wrap that's the one thing this

[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.220]
is under the Tam's in the book

[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.600]
but that's enough 1027 at W.I.O.D.

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.800]
Miramar Hey Neil I got a problem

[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.420]
with your reporting on the

[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.860]
traffic ticket recordings there

[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.540]
by reporting on the traffic

[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.200]
as you do it the ticket clinic

[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.980]
whatever it is yeah I had two

[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.060]
speed tickets one in the 87188 and

[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.840]
I'll my certified copy of the state

[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.120]
of my driving record last seven

[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.120]
years I have no entries within the

[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.620]
past seven years now I checked on

[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.240]
this and they said the only ones

[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.540]
that we stay on your driving record

[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.740]
we rather than whether points are

[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.960]
accessed or not are DUI charge of

[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.220]
actions and attentional reckless

[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.720]
driving other than those three

[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.900]
anything else can be erased by

[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.420]
going traffic school I don't

[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.120]
believe it I'm telling I'm holding

[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.580]
my record right in my hand while

[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.740]
you may it may be on your right

[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.060]
you may have it in your hand in your

[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.320]
record too but I'm telling you that

[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.580]
I've talked to a lot of people

[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.020]
they all tell me the same thing

[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.960]
well then why would everybody

[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.680]
in the hot it must have just changed

[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.820]
and because I'm looking at the

[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.820]
copy of my ticket I got two

[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.560]

couple wants to meet you know what

[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.180]
that reminds me of it's like the

[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.500]
sixties when they all said that we

[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.140]
want to be individualist man we

[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.400]
want to think for ourselves and they

[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.660]
all looked and they smelled the same

[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.720]
you know they didn't shave they

[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.680]
didn't bathe they walked around

[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.180]
life slot and they were all the same

[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.860]
they're all we're hippies man we're

[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.280]
individuals anyway they all look

[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.440]
the same because they wanted to be

[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.600]

[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.460]

and I'm glad you brought me the message

[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.700]

else from continental cable how about that

[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.940]
pretty interesting let's do Miami on a

[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.100]
starline hello Miami's gone on the

[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.680]
starline well that's their problem like

[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.080]
worth hey Neil how you doing okay

[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.140]
listen this uh MCC chairman L psychs

[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.100]
be stroking up by whatever private parts

[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.300]
you may have well don't say that especially

[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.040]
if they're turgent man don't even get into

[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.720]
that I don't think they could be turgent

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.800]
I doubt it that in the Netherlands I think

[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.920]
that's the problem huh I just it's it's

[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.020]
driving me nuts the most ass and I the most

[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.560]
ridiculous the most outrageous bunch of

[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.020]
crap in other words instead of just

[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.600]
weeding out a lot of these licenses

[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.760]
of these marginal stations right and

[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.640]
just like closing them down and making

[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.740]
go darker to and something and because

[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.220]
they've just overdone it uh we're just

[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.160]
gonna let everybody else buy them up and

[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.700]
just have little monopolies everywhere

[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.360]
and the whole reason that pretty soon Ted

[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.960]
Turner's gonna own everything on cable

[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.280]
I'll guarantee you that you have like

[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.640]
700 stations on your cable and Ted

[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.880]
Turner all like 600 native exactly

[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.000]
and the justification for and the other

[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.880]
20 will be home shopping network the

[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.440]
justification for all this if you ask

[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.380]
them is because the the business is in

[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.260]
the dumper and it was this kind of

[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.700]
policy that put them in the dumper in

[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.360]
the first place right all this

[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.060]
deregulation during the 80s when they

[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.620]
right well the only thing you want to

[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.420]
regulate is if you say crap on here

[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.800]
that's all they want to regulate that's

[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.060]
right they don't have time to regulate

[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.400]
the business and because they're too

[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.780]
busy sitting listening to tapes

[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.640]
worrying if somebody said douchebag one

[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.500]
time too many on a year or if Howard

[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.120]
Stern said dickhead in New York they're

[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.520]
all bent out of shape about that

[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.260]
because they got to protect the morality

[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.880]
of the public and of little children

[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.140]
and everybody else the word police up

[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.380]
there are sitting worrying about what

[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.200]
the hell you said and I can't believe it

[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.660]
but I just saw ponytail walk

[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.200]
strut through the hallway there I can't

[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.040]
believe it well string his butt up to

[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.100]
guy at the same time and make a hell of

[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.080]
a quenella that's right from power number

[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.640]
three another priorities are completely

[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.780]
asked backwards and I have the capers

[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.520]
don't worry I think a business going to

[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.720]
like this though he would like he'd like

[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.340]
the in general manager of six radio

[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.420]

could be the Epcot center of radio just

[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.820]
stick him on space mountain man and

[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.920]
the give him a spin right yeah goofy's

[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.660]
the consumer already got goofy he's the

[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.400]
PD yeah there you go

[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.940]

[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.580]
going to make you Apple plastic at the

[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.520]

talked a lot about that movie monday night

[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.140]
and wouldn't you know that finally i hit on

[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.000]
something foxes doing time on maple drive

[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.940]

that's all together coast to coast and for foxes show that's pretty damn

[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.340]
impressive great movie somehow we got to get a hold of copies of that from our

[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.380]
good friends in channel seven who may not be good friends anymore because i

[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.240]
noticed that on my windshield yesterday i leave the station and there's a

[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.520]
thing on the wsv and stationery one of their little note pads

[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.820]
please help us save bob thanks

[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.800]
there is nothing more than i would like to do that help save bob soper because

[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.400]
he's a great guy and i can repeat all the stuff i said yesterday

[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.320]
the only problem i think is that uh... it's a little bit too late

[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.100]
because the rumors have it that the canadian bim bet

[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.740]
a who's gonna replace bob is already here is that true

[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.380]
it is true she's already here and not only is he's have to suffer the

[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:39.200]
ignomia ignominius the the crap but uh... he's got a trainer

[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.920]
so he's gonna be uh... for however long he sticks it out over there these

[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.380]
next seven months he's got left on his deal uh... he's got a like break her

[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.960]
in so to speak or break her leg one of the other i think breaking both legs big

[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.580]
good idea so i still encourage everybody to write to channel seven wsv

[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.760]

[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:24.280]
unrealistic standards just crazy it's not the way it is in the real world so much truth in that

[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.920]
movie but so much on target it rang a lot of bills for a lot of people i agree i thought it was

[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:34.220]
outstanding yeah why did that i call him say hello this morning well thank you so much for hanging

[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:41.460]
in there you're welcome yeah have a great day you too bye bye chilly peppers heat up a cure for runny

[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:48.680]
noses it says since it's going around everybody's got it oh and a quest to stop running noses

[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:55.280]
researchers have turned away spicy source red hot chili peppers the ingredient that

[00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:02.460]
causes the peppers burning sensation a chemical called capsacin can desensitize nasal nerves

[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:09.580]
that cause running sneezing and congestion but just eating chili peppers won't do the trick

[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:15.540]
says alcus taagayas of Johns Hopkins as my analogy center the problem as he says you have to put

[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:21.640]
in the nose i'm playing with my nose exactly so that's a deal if you've got the crud like i do

[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.960]
and like everybody else seems to have it you're like all stuffed up and your nose is running and you

[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.320]
got the sinus crap get some of those red hot chili peppers man and stick them right up your nose

[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:38.820]
giving new meaning that old expression taken up the 945 and also by the way mic caters to one

[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:43.680]
the a thing on a micrity re show this morning mic hates you like poison and says you're a snore and

[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.980]
you keep winning all these prizes and you show up everywhere he goes and you're kind of like a

[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:58.860]
lizard bob and they just go away he can't stand you also a joe well mic don't have the balls to say

[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:04.580]
it so i'll do it for them dammit he can't stand that guy can't stand these freeloaders these snores

[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:10.380]
let's spread the goods around a little bit we got the driver showed on at pop it out tonight

[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:16.280]
kevin walice and Bruce ranger and the jord says the cuban guys are ugly and the cuban women are

[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.440]
mostly become fat and the grotesque but not the women in my family but not except for the women

[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.900]
in his family and he's just sucking around when he says that since the most cuban guys are ugly

[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:30.700]
i couldn't disagree more and if or landa were here he'd probably punch your ass out homestead

[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:39.680]
jaro's in here yeah what's up how you doing all right you still sick yeah i got the flu now

[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.500]
really well try some of those chili peppers up your nose can't hurt yeah it's just burn you up

[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:50.080]
wouldn't it yeah or maybe someplace else my you know just the burn that baby right out i just

[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.360]
call the cause somebody a douchebag yes sir my wife will hate you like poison does she really yeah what a

[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:04.580]
slut so money car you think douchebag okay all right thank you feel better feel something 947

[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:09.600]
a w i d so what do you think most cuban guys are ugly and jorge is there ugly and a hairy and they

[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:14.400]
have like one big eyebrow that goes like across the top of their forehead i think jorge quite

[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:20.280]
frankly is probably an ozhaan provocateur he's probably from uh peru or somewhere and putting on his

[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:25.600]
fake cuban act to get sympathy we have two open lions and dates 7 5 1 them all another thing i

[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.100]
wanted to talk about yesterday i forgot because we were so intensive and ripping rick riley

[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.760]
justifiably so by the way see how yesterday he got back into something he knows about

[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.820]
the here the first caller well there's 42 inches of pack powder out there in color righto that's

[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:44.460]
more like it rick stick with that skiing man it's right up your alley sally but the thing on 60

[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:51.500]
minutes on sunday about j leno i was so depressed after i saw that i mean i come in here and i'm not

[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.920]
tooting my own horn because there are a lot of guys rick and suds come in they do four hours every

[00:32:54.920 --> 00:33:00.040]
day five days a week extemporaneous i mean it's all strictly off the top of your head and their

[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.660]
callers a lot of times come up with some funny stuff even by accident but i mean here's a guy

[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:09.140]
who's got all these writers like three four guys they sit around a table before clock in a morning

[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.940]
with all these three by five cards and he's recording all these one liners and listening to it back

[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:20.740]
and listening to the inflection and and i got news for you it ain't paying off j or jani or any

[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:25.100]
amie it's paying off in the paycheck in a wallet but in terms of being funny if that's the best

[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:30.200]
those guys can do with all those writers and spending all of that time and there's something damn

[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:36.800]
wrong going on today i'll tell you that maybe it's just that the comics today suck most of them

[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:42.420]
because back in the days of the uh sit-seasers show and he used to have Carl Reiner and uh

[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.200]
meld Brooks goes like that and he were funny i mean it was really funny stuff

[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:54.620]
oh you uh well i'm getting choked up about it 949 at wio d it's honor the ugly Cubans day

[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.820]
and i see i shouldn't start that because that's going to be perceived as an ethnic thing and Jorge

[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.740]
Mosque can also will come on and call Georgia redneck and we'll start a whole big deal here today

[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:13.900]

[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:01.520]
the Cuban guys are ugly maybe he's ugly huh well yeah he's probably just talking about him so

[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.640]
he also said the Cuban women they're like a whole bunch and sleazy and look like uh Egyptians and

[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:14.440]
drag yeah well and jorge is married to a wasp a very tall attractive wasp so i think he's got

[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:18.280]
his own prejudices there that we're gonna have to work on people will find him like a real fat

[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.680]
Cuban babe on a side or something exactly teach him what it's all about okay have a great day

[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:27.980]
take care of your adios he just need the little change of pace George that's what i keep telling

[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:35.900]
Orlando 954 at wiod we have an open line in date where is my god damn soup man if you see this thing

[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.700]

[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.600]
you know what i'm saying i'm not not just a soup either but when you really are desperate for it

[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:57.540]
it's just uh it just ain't gonna be there you know what i'm telling you here's a lady in the

[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:07.540]

[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.540]
you go with Cuban guys no i think you were men what they have worked in

[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:34.380]
oh no i like Jewish men you like Jewish men because they're circumcised and they got the

[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:39.660]
Cuban man that are circumcised only the only the only the wealthy Cuban men

[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:47.400]
yeah that's the problem right that's the problem only the only Cuban man that were um

[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:54.140]
wealthy were circumcised why did it cost a lot for the bris i don't have no idea

[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:58.940]
man it seems like a gold plated knife or something i don't get it you know but i thought that the

[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:04.000]
Cuban guys who were born how old are you 32 32 well Cuban guys who were born in this country

[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.440]

So what's the story our Rickins had doing that thing tomorrow

[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.520]
We still own a

[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.360]
Oh God, is that embarrassing?

[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.140]
Are we doing that thing?

[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.740]
You know Tim from the stadium tomorrow?

[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.120]
We are doing it, do they know about it?

[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.440]
Oh, ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:27.320]
Well at least somebody knows about it, that's a good start

[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.320]
Rickins had live from Joe Robbie Stadium tomorrow

[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.520]
We got a big weekend exhibition baseball at the stadium

[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:37.340]
Now we are sucking around heavy duty to try to get those Marlon games back

[00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.940]
Here's a lady in Boca

[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.000]
A lady in Boca is gone?

[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:43.080]
No, she's here

[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:46.540]
Oh, geez, don't do that, God, I almost like flew off the chair

[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.440]
I was first time caller Ann, the first time listener

[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.760]
No, it's the first time listener?

[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:53.860]
Yes, I am

[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.160]
Where have you been all my life?

[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.360]
I don't know, I just hear Boca

[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.420]
Probably hanging out with Mr. Microphone and Sunrise

[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:00.040]
Exactly

[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.040]
But my friends have been telling me and I want to hear Clint Eastwood as the beaver

[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:05.740]
Really?

[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:06.320]
Yes

[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.600]
In other words, you want to see a little beaver intensive for you today?

[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.280]
Exactly

[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.760]
Well, you know, it's kind of a little tacky to call on a show that you never heard before

[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.940]
The very first day and make a request and stuff like that

[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.260]
But since you sound so charming

[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.760]
And how long have you been listening this morning or this afternoon or today or whatever?

[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:21.680]
About three hours

[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.620]
Three hours?

[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.940]
And what's the verdict?

[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:28.120]
You better say something really nice and suck around then I might play this stuff

[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.680]
I think this is incredible, I love it

[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.060]
Great!

[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:31.660]
In the show too, right?

[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:31.980]
Yeah

[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:35.040]
Okay, well go back to your radio and whip that baby up, okay?

[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:35.780]
Okay, thanks

[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:38.260]
Have a great day and by the way, happy forum

[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.500]
Thank you

[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.000]
Bye-bye

[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.080]
It's the all new, lead-to-beaver

[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.660]
Starring Bond Rebellion's lead

[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.400]
Hugh Beaumont

[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:50.100]
Tony Don

[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.760]
And Clint Eastwood as the beaver

[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.020]
You wanted to see me, Dad?

[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.000]
Yes, Beaver, sit down

[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.240]
I am, Dad

[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.760]
Keep in mind I'm six foot four

[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.400]
So what's the problem, Dad?

[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:14.280]
Beaver, I have never been more disappointed in you than I was today when you walked in the principal's office

[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.000]
Wearing that horrible sweatshirt

[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.020]
Oh, you mean my Beastie boy sweatshirt?

[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:19.600]
Right

[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.740]
And I just got...

[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.860]
This morning your mother and I both told you to take that sweatshirt off before you went to school

[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.140]
Now why did you deliberately disobey us?

[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.760]
Come on, Dad, it's the biggest concert of the year

[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:35.060]
Run DMC in the Beasties

[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.160]
And I already got my tickets

[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.820]
Oh, no, Beaver

[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:40.760]
Oh, yeah, Dad

[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:42.900]
All right, you can go

[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:48.360]
I thought I'd try to bring you home with DMC T-shirts

[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.960]
Club 27 at WI-D

[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.880]
Welcome to our little party, ma'am, whoever you are

[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:57.540]
It's so nice to have you with us and see how agreeable we are sometimes unless somebody calls up an axlachus psychotic bitch

[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:00.740]
By the way, the Dr. Susan Bloch show I want to mention this again

[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.880]
I don't know who left this but I'm pretty excited

[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.080]
Can we look into this, George?

[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:05.720]
Can we take our show on the road?

[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:12.240]
It says, a makes Dr. Susan Bloch makes love to Orlando on WQBQ Radio

[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.300]
Can we at least get some tapes of that? Some audio effects? Something

[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:23.440]
And she's doing her series of four safe sex shows with Orlando, I believe, or in Orlando

[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.220]
Well, that's bad

[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:32.680]
On the subjects of masturbation, phone sex, making out and heavy petting and condoms, not necessarily in that order

[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.800]
Okay, 1228, let's go to Hollywood on the Star Line

[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.120]
Hi, how you doing, Neil?

[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.100]
I'm doing it, man

[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:41.360]
Want to wish you a heartfelt, happy Purrums, to you in your part?

[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:41.860]
Yeah

[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:45.720]
I think you were talking about that, I think it might be Jerry Panacoli

[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.080]
The what? Jerry Panacoli and the Jerobo, yeah

[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.300]
It could be him, but anyway, I think it's a disgrace that's very...

[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:55.200]
It was kind of embarrassing when a Jerobo would run out on the field and get lost

[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.300]
and it would delay the game for hours at a time

[00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:01.740]
Anyway, I think it's terrible that they remove that the instant replay

[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.260]
Mark my words, sir, Mark my words, they're going to be real sorry, real fast

[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:10.560]
Like in the first week of the season next year, they're going to be real sorry

[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.740]
They're going to be grabbed really right, a lot of bad calls last year

[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.940]
Yeah, so, anybody...

[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:18.540]
Even with the replay, there were a lot of bad calls, can you imagine now it's going to be on Nightmare

[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.960]
Terrible, anyway, I want to suck around on my first time listener, first time caller and I...

[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.940]
No, you're a young Neil

[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.580]
No, you're not

[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.680]
Yeah, have a nice life, boy, who you can...

[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.180]
12... what a sense of humor he's got

[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.640]
1229 at WIOD, let's go home now because I got my check and we had a good lunch

[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.900]
and the calls had been not too bad

[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.880]
and we had Mr. Microphone and we had that first time young lady and not too bad today, huh?

[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.400]
For a Thursday in a crappy town

[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.680]
Starlines open, Star I-O-D

[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:46.780]
Fort Lauderdale

[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.620]
Good afternoon, sir

[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.020]
Good afternoon to you, sir

[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.640]
I saw the needed bumper sticker mail

[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.300]
That said

[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:57.380]
You've seen the insignia for the Japanese orange sun

[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.540]
White background

[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.120]
Yes, sir

[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.000]
That just made no across, and I love it

[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:02.740]
Just made no?

[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.680]
Was it like on a Toyota or something?

[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.640]
No, it's on American car

[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.220]
Oh, okay

[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.360]
Anyway, sorry Pat Murray, in the great sense of humor, folks

[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:10.960]
Anyway

[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.520]
Oh, by the way, there was a thing in the...

[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.400]
Pat Buchanan had one of his stupid press conferences yesterday

[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.160]
and his wife was up there on the podium and they said, are you going to get rid of the Mercedes?

[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:25.480]
And she got up there, she said it's for sale, anybody want to make an offer? Ha-ha-ha, not

[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.300]
You know?

[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:26.860]
Really?

[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:27.840]
Anyway

[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.040]
Listen, if you scraped the swastik off the windshield, I'd maybe look at Subaru

[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.060]
Fashes, pigs

[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.180]
No doubt about it

[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:41.140]
Anyway, the reason I call, I think that the instant replay I think they should give each coach two or three champs to use of it

[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:41.900]
Their own discretion

[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:42.180]
Right

[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:46.700]
And the story, but how much revenue they're advertising and everything they're going to lose

[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.560]
No doubt, and I shorten the game

[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.880]
Once they find that out, man

[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.700]
No doubt

[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:59.560]
Although I was reading the thing in the satellite TV week yesterday that the NFL, because they made such a greedy, disgusting deal with the owners that they're like

[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.580]
Extending it and it's like almost they're giving it to the networks for nothing for a couple of years, you know what I'm saying?

[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.680]
Where are they talking about pay-per-view now?

[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.560]
Never going to have to forget it, never going to happen

[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:13.820]
Never will fly, believe me, that'll be the death knell of the game if they try that crap

[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:14.340]
That's the fact

[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:18.680]
But about 80% of those games that are on Monday night, they couldn't pay us to watch them

[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.760]
Anyway, if you can give me a little chill on my bones, I'm homesick, let's hear some dick curtain or some CKLW or something

[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.320]
Well, I think I'm having a relapse

[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.320]
Well, what the hell ever happened to dick curtain by the way, Kathy, paying any ass livingston call to you today

[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:38.840]
And said that when dick was down in the west coast a couple of weeks ago he was trying to call on the 800 number

[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.140]
And of course couldn't get through, which I find hard to believe

[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:46.440]
Because anybody can get through on our 800 line, but he's back up in Detroit making a lot of bucks

[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.100]
Okay, sure, have a good day

[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:54.180]
And you said about some fun with WKNRZ for time

[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:55.920]
There you go

[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.320]
I'll never happen to my CKLW, jingle

[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.740]
Oh, do you remember CKLW, mister?

[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:01.780]
You're living it

[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:02.180]
What?

[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.100]
Oh yeah, I do

[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:03.640]
Believe me I do

[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:08.640]
Oh, I don't like that

[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.400]
But Davey's likes it, it's nice and slow

[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.900]
CKLW, there it is

[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.720]
Yeah, okay, now we're doing it

[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.960]
Right on the Edselford Expressway, sir

[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.300]
Okay, thank you, sir

[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.040]
Have a great day

[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.040]
Bye-bye

[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.880]
See it, lose finder, Deli

[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:25.480]
Not

[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.500]
See it, skipper's table for, that used to be great

[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.680]
There was a Deli, not a Deli, a smorgasbord place

[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.980]
There were two of them one in Plymouth

[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:39.340]
And the other one on, I think seven mile road in Detroit they were called skipper's table, smorgasbord

[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.460]
And most smorgasbord places are like for old people

[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:43.720]
I don't want to mention any down here

[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.520]
They're like mostly out of business where they go in and they put their teeth in a glass

[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.940]
And it fizzes while they eat

[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:51.760]
And the spaghetti tastes like the corn and the mashed potatoes taste like the meatloaf

[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.220]
And you know, it's up

[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.540]
No, this was great, skipper's table

[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.740]
And you could go back like a hundred times and I had a friend salesman as a matter of fact

[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:00.660]
I shouldn't say that

[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.260]
A radio salesperson from Alby and Michigan

[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:06.400]
And before we go to the track at Hazel Park or Wolf Arena tonight

[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.980]
We go over to skipper's table and eat about 400 pounds worth of food for like $3.99

[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:14.060]
That was the best skipper's table man, they don't make them like that anymore

[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:15.960]
Plantation

[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.940]
Hey Neil

[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.620]
Yes sir

[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.580]
Malalook is aren't in bloom now

[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:20.220]
Oh

[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.340]
And if the thing you got gets into your test, you're gonna think you have bronchitis and pneumonia

[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.520]
It's wrapped up into water

[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.440]
What does that mean?

[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.300]
It means that you'll be coughing your brains out

[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.060]
What do you mean the thing I got? I got a head cold

[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.680]
Well, don't let it drop down

[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.440]
Don't let it, how about my cold?

[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.360]
I've got that too

[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.100]
Oh, no, it's like almost gone

[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:37.760]
All right

[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.560]
I think

[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.760]
You're trying to talk me back into it, aren't you?

[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.020]
Yeah

[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:41.860]
Misery loves company

[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.340]
Why not?

[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.080]
Okay, I'll work on it

[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:44.660]
See you

[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.520]
It's so godfather intensive today

[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:46.980]
Yes

[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:52.080]
The only thing I've seen that's bigger than you I see is the day I walked up behind Hankelberg at the track

[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.300]
Take it easy

[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:54.880]
Okay

[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.360]
Smart ass man, I'll tell you

[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.420]
Which one have I got out?

[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:03.220]
I don't even know which one of these I got out, I'm so damn godfather intensive I got them all out

[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.220]
Oh, number two, number two

[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.680]
I tell you when you're having a stressful traumatic awful day

[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.400]
There's just something so soothing about this music, you know

[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.400]
I know about you, but it sure does it for me

[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.680]
It just kind of calms me down

[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.520]
Like somebody is making me a musical offer that I can't refuse

[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.660]
Let's do a Miami, hello

[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:26.420]
Miami?

[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:27.980]
Buenos tardes?

[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:29.780]
Ostelewego?

[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:30.960]
Ostelevista?

[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:31.780]
Osteeras?

[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.160]
Let's do a leisure city

[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.180]
Hey, how you doing Neil?

[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.040]
I'm doing it

[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:36.720]
That's good

[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:41.600]
Hey, I first off I want to clarify you on that replay for...

[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.720]
Hey, Kate, hold it

[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.440]
Oh, I love it, go ahead

[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:49.140]
Not only did the douchebag get boat again

[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.560]
The Giants also vote against it

[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.360]
Not only them, but also the counterfeit bill

[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.980]
All the New York state teams voted against it, what the hell do they know?

[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:57.060]
Well, let's see, did the Giants get it again?

[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.740]
Sounds like they're trying to pull a fast one, yeah

[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:02.200]
But the Giants also, because the Giants and the Jets were like back to back on the list, I'm pretty sure

[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.440]
Yeah, triple play there

[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.360]
Screw them

[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.360]
Did you, have you seen any of this baby lollipop trial?

[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:14.980]
Baby lollipops, first of all, the name of the trial just, I mean, what the media does here, I just, I have a headache from thinking about it

[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.360]
Yeah, well, okay

[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.080]
Have you seen that girl who's pet the fine for the state of Libya?

[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.440]
Well, a girl, I guess, whatever, Olivia Gonzalez?

[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.000]
Yeah

[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.020]
You've seen the sideburns on her mansion, it looks like Elvis

[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:30.720]
No, she looks like Luke Perry on Beverly Hills 902-164-38

[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.760]
Are those babies real or is that Charles Alphieri sideburned?

[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.100]
Right

[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:38.560]
I mean, I don't know, do you tell her to butcher up there?

[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.620]
Only her proctologist knows for sure, sir

[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.480]
Yeah, I want to ask you about the Buchanan thing

[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:43.780]
Who?

[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.040]
You know, not fuck Buchanan

[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.880]
Buchanan, the guy who's trying to run president, he can't be president

[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.620]
Yeah, I'm right, I'm right Buchanan

[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.560]
He can't be president, really, can't he?

[01:06:53.560 --> 01:07:01.420]
I mean, didn't they pass the law after Roosevelt was president, Franklin Roosevelt?

[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.300]
That no more president with the same last name?

[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:05.360]
Yeah

[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.440]
They had Teddy, and then, and we already had a president named Buchanan

[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:08.880]
Right

[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.580]
It's too bad because the Cubs were hoping to get Steve Wilson elected president

[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:14.840]
before they traded him the Dodgers and they just missed out

[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.580]
They just fully...

[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:16.480]
They're way to get rid of him, though

[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:16.800]
Yeah

[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.780]
Well, listen, have a great day, in fact, be a good way to get rid of Danny Jackson, too

[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.520]
But I guess that we got beat on that baby, too, have a great life, sir

[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:30.900]
Look at that, two open lines in day, that's a first in hours on this show, does that mean we're like coming screeching to a halt in the middle lunch hour?

[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:31.400]
We hope not

[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:35.160]
God, they just know how to stick it to you when you least expect to rate it

[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.700]
524, now what is it? I don't even know what the number is

[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.960]
751, I think it's setting into my lungs deep, George

[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:45.360]
Well, here I am again, your century village man, Chuck Zing

[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.360]
For I am again, this is Rick from Carpet and Tile X-Pope

[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.140]
Stay Master protects against most common food and beverage stains

[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.480]
Stay Master is certified and warrantied by DuPont

[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.760]
Paw 40, a WIOD, we got a mobile in Fort Lauderdale

[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.200]
Dale, how are you doing?

[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:03.620]
Okay

[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:09.360]
The longer I wait on this, the more I get mad at you, your cheap state management for not getting cellular one starline

[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.040]
Sir, what can I say?

[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:11.560]
What happened?

[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.980]
What you hear is what you get, what you see is what you get

[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:18.820]
I wish they are thrifty sir, they are like the Scottish, they are thrifty, like the frogs

[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:22.960]
Hey, we just want to note on that replay with stock, I can't believe they did that

[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.140]
Yes

[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:29.260]
All I got to say is, first one as well against the coach wise that complains on a call, got nothing to say

[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:33.660]
Exactly, in fact I think they ought to call it against them just out of spite, I mean like a real obvious one

[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:34.680]
Just to put some on

[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:42.480]
All they want is money, money, money, what the ought to do is have advertisers, sponsor like a replay minute

[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.380]
I don't like to put buy a Budweiser or something

[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.760]
Right, there you go

[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:47.500]
Fuck

[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:51.580]
Think I would have another Budbole and in between like 4500 times a game

[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.100]
That's right

[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.480]
Okay, I just want to throw that in

[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.920]
Okay, have a great life and a happy poem to you

[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.060]
Bye-bye, 1241 we have an open line at Broward 524

[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:02.080]
There's something I just have to hear one more time today

[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:07.800]
I gotta hear it, I have to confess because it's not even like from this show but it's gotta be in the top five in bubbling right now

[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.740]
So who would you vote for?

[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.320]
Why was any other guys bowling?

[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:11.740]
What other guy?

[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.120]
The Republican guy

[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:14.600]
Oh no, man

[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.560]
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry today, I didn't want to break it

[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.760]
Which one did you vote for?

[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.240]
I'm not gonna get into it, Chad

[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.300]
You'll freak out on me, okay?

[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.020]
Not...no way

[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:23.400]
Yeah

[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:26.160]
That uh...that hoody freak?

[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.880]
Which one be specific?

[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.520]
What's his name, man?

[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:32.900]
I'm not gonna argue, Paul

[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.420]
The guy from CNN?

[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:36.300]
Ted Turner, yes

[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:39.360]
Oh man, you voted for keep getting him?

[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:40.620]
I voted for Ted Turner

[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:42.000]
Dude, why?

[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:44.540]
You just send the police right into my pad

[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:49.140]
Why don't you give them my phone number and then it's red?

[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.600]
Ted, and let them come over and kill me

[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.180]
Man, you're gonna elect the thought police

[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:01.560]
Ted, this wasn't a presidential election, this is a primary, okay?

[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.040]
I didn't have a chance to vote for the other side

[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.700]
You mean the chance to vote for the other side, Rick?

[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:06.760]
What?

[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.280]
My pal Rick voted for a Nazi

[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.920]
I knew this would be...I didn't vote for a Nazi

[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.360]
Pro 42 at WIOD, I rest my case, here's a mobile and store it

[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:18.620]
Deal

[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.200]
Yeah

[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.220]
First time caller

[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.540]
Well, how I'll boot that, eh?

[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.400]
Come on

[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.180]
What? I know who this is

[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:24.420]
Huh?

[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.600]
I know who this is

[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.120]
I know, it's both been a while, I just...

[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.000]
Where were you last night up at Poppettopark when we needed your money?

[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.720]
I was at no shine to work last night

[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.360]
Yeah, I bet

[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:32.900]
I'm sorry

[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:33.940]
You were working it out

[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:38.400]
I'm afraid to go see you, man, since you went on that tirade on me the day after I saw you last time

[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.040]
You know, I'm kind of fearful of coming up and saying hello

[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.880]
You know, you are an asshole, is anybody ever told you that lately?

[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:48.580]
I didn't go on a tirade, all I said was how come it was that you and your very lovely girlfriend

[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:53.060]
Come over to the table after having your own very nice table, not too far away the entire evening

[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:54.660]
And seemingly perfectly happy there

[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.940]
And actually caching a few tickets through luck

[01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:01.040]
And come over and like squat halfway down into the chairs at my table

[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.700]
And say, oh is it okay if we sit down as your ass is hitting the seat?

[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.180]
What was wrong with the other chairs were they like on fire?

[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:09.500]
She wanted to meet you

[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.460]
Well, that's fine

[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:11.900]
That's fine

[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:13.260]
And you know, she wanted to meet you

[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.340]
After an evening with you, it's though she probably wanted to meet anybody I would imagine

[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:17.580]
God

[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.840]
What night is the fan's horse racing this week Friday night?

[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.440]
Friday night, Friday night, don't ask me anything about that, I don't want to discuss it ever again

[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.880]
I mean, I'll be there, it's, what can I say?

[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:28.900]
Well, we might get a good price

[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.220]
Yeah, right, you'll have a big price all right

[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.700]
Yeah, even Bob Barker will be there, the price will be right

[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:39.720]
I'm just, I am so overwhelmed and I noticed that porcupine is conspicuous by his fat absence here today

[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.800]
With that stupid rule about two dollars across the board

[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.980]
See, you want me to tell you the real story?

[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:46.480]
Yeah

[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:51.120]
See, this summer for the summer meet, you know, like most of the guys are leaving

[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.500]
Like, pay the goes to the metal ends and walley goes back up where he goes A

[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.700]
And Kevin and Peter go back and Donnie Harbin to Detroit

[01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.000]
I was going to ask you who our drivers are going to be by the way

[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.120]
Well, I think Hoagin is sticking around and Donnie Brainer will be like a top dog, you know

[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:10.180]
But anyway, Bruce Ranger is like right on the verge, you know, like one day he's going to stay the next day he's not

[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:14.160]
So they really just suck it up to Brucey to stick around because he's a real good driver

[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.680]
He's got, you know, he's a good horseman

[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.960]
And well, he's okay

[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:22.000]
And so this thing last night I think they must have, I just can't believe it, you know

[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.220]
I mean, like Bruce, hey, we love you and you won, he didn't win nothing, okay

[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:29.840]
Kevin is like God and he wins that 10th race like a champion

[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:36.760]
And you should have seen the photo for third, I'm telling you if Gary Lewis wouldn't have dropped his slip on the track

[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.120]
Just before I'm serious, he reached down to get it if he would have hit the worst one more time

[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.640]
Come on Gary, Wango your tango, maybe get your ass up there

[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.280]
And Brucey hangs on for third by like the slimmest of noses

[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.300]
And then, you know, it winds up with a stupid deal now

[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.820]
That porcupine came up with $2 across the board

[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.840]
What does that guy tend to do with driving his wheel?

[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.520]
I have nothing to do with anything

[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.220]
No, let's have a race off, let's do this right and stop sticking it to Kevin for crying out

[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:05.040]
I wonder what he ever do to us besides catch me a lot of tickets

[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:06.700]
Damn it

[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:08.800]
Feel like I got a dolphin question for you

[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.000]
I think they're prejudiced against our Michigan drivers at Pompoot O Park

[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.220]
And I'm going to take some serious damn action about it like Friday night

[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:16.380]
I am

[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:23.340]
I'm going to go out there and blow away all the other horses and let Kevin and Peter and Donnie win by 10 lights every race just out of spite

[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:24.460]
I'll be there Friday

[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:30.260]
And I'm going to get that Kelly Shepherd too for parking my horse 27 seconds the first quarter last night and then finishing 8

[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.680]
Oh 27 second first quarter

[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.540]
Kelly Shepherd man outside I don't even give me started

[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.680]
Okay, about good old Kelly the schlep

[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.240]
And he wonders why about half of those guys out there in a track were like to stick his ass in infield lake

[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.520]
Well Joe likes to do that too, Joe likes to park him out and got him in the first quarter

[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:49.580]
Joe is whipping him before they start the before the gate opens, Joe is whipping and slashing

[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:54.460]
Joe had a horse last night coque in the 12th race 2 to 5, okay

[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:59.340]
2 to 5 at the top of the stretch this horse stopped like he ran into a met truck, okay

[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.160]
Like he ran into a brick wall

[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.280]
Great one with China, go

[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:08.200]
Exactly that was Jolton Joe with coque I got your coque right over here

[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.740]
Yeah, the only round three quarters of a mile, Joe would win all the races

[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:15.420]
Yeah, he is whipping up Tonyo once Joe is through with a man they don't walk for a month

[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.120]
He loves to whip it and the horse is still

[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.080]
Yeah, that's what Dominic said

[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.500]
When you cut the crap out of love watching the full we've had a great day and the phones are dropping off here like flying

[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:28.380]
This is like Rick Riley talking about snow skiing, okay nobody cares

[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.720]
I've packed you a cabinet

[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:30.660]
Yeah, packed this

[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.440]
Neil I just remembered my dolphin season seconds

[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:39.360]
Yeah, and they sent me a notice saying that they're gonna put aside a day for season second holders to come out and upgrade their seats

[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.400]
Where you can actually go to the stadium and pick your seats if they're available

[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.940]
Yeah, have you been to that in the past as it worked going down there?

[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.300]
No, I don't pick my seat my nose a little bit. No, my seat

[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:55.500]
Have a great day, friend. Yeah, in honor of instant replay being killed. Yeah, can you play

[01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:58.180]
Referee by Tom Petty by Joel

[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.840]
1247 here's such a pain in the ass. We have an open line in date

[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.360]
Seven we got three open lines now

[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.980]
We've been killing killing them all day long and he comes on here and starts a whole damn thing about

[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:17.060]
The pop it up park which I love but the audience 98% of them couldn't give one crap about and like the whole show is dead now thanks a lot Joel

[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:22.600]
Wait until you sit down at the table next time we got a little surprise for you. We got like an electric seat

[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.880]
Sally supplying the juice

[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:31.880]
All your orifice manager I got a headache from his call. I really do all your orifice managers out there

[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:36.020]
It is your orifice use bottled water like ours used to here at WIO and D

[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:43.320]
Well, if you do you're probably wasting space in time by stirring and schlepping those big bulky heavy a hernia inducing bottles and

[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:48.100]
Probably your bills are tough to decipher in a fluctuator flatulate for month to month

[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:58.140]
This is Paul song is oh it's 1251 and that's for the one two hour and I punched it up bad mistake

[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:03.580]
Anyways, they say in my backyard to my dogs in the morning in plantation don't void where prohibited anyway

[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:24.500]
Both were right now I wasn't plantation when I called I'm now in North Dade wow on my own dime. What a step in a wrong direction. Anyway. Yeah. First this is not

[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:37.340]
a proper thing. It's real simple. Why does it do like Sally did and just suck up dead and so to speak and you'll have no problem. I don't think Susan will be too happy about that. Well, you know, it

[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:44.920]
worked for Sally. I mean, what's coming year she's been there right? Second hang Goldberg. You ever listen to Hank? I don't think Bob's got the right

[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:54.480]
connection so to speak. Do you ever listen to Hank? Yeah. If I'm in the car at night, I always listen to Hank. Yeah. Are you going to what's

[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:01.060]
that really? All I asked you is if you're going to I wasn't like threatening you or something. I mean, I want you to keep in mind. The

[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:07.560]
Hank's been under the weather. He's got like a heart problem. He's been he's been in I am too. Nobody cares about that. He's been

[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:15.040]
in and out of the hospital. He's got like a breathing problem and I mean, he's like overweight. He's a hippo problem.

[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:23.700]
Come on. Well, I was on the loser. He's got to he's got to cut the crap. Well, that's part of my thing. Whenever you listen to him, he's always talking about the

[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:32.660]
raider cheerleaders and these fabulous bass that's for Todd that place the advertises. Yeah, what the hell is he kidding? He couldn't get one of those

[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:38.580]
tricks. Like he paid for it. So what's wrong with that? What are they going to do with a fat guy? What's wrong with that? So what's wrong with that? He's got the big

[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:43.580]
bucks. Why do you think he works like 80 hours today? He's got serious, but that's probably why his heart's ready to stop. He's

[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:49.920]
out here and to you. I know, but he's acting like all these babes are all over. Give me a break. They are and that's because they work by the

[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.680]
hour. What's wrong with that? I think you just jealous or go out and get a boyfriend 12 54 at W. I. Would do we have an open line in

[01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:02.100]
Broward? Well, I'm telling you, I got the good stuff coming up now. That signals the end of this crud when a really good

[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:08.640]
stuff starts coming out from the bowels of your mucus glands. God. You're not going to believe this. Okay, nobody and you

[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:15.100]
won't care about it, but it's just ironic. Either I'm getting psychic or just I'm losing it. I'm watching my CBS

[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:22.600]
Morning Show this morning, CBS today or whatever to show it. And I'm sitting there. I know it's strange, but I'm

[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:28.400]
thinking about the mucus because I'm like almost over this cold. And I just for some reason I'm thinking about,

[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:33.200]
you know, that we used to talk on here about the really dark green is like it's been in the body the longest and then the

[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.700]
yellow, which is kind of gross. But that's the rumor. You know, that's the popular folklore that the darker the mucus, the

[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:44.320]
longer it's been in the body. And wouldn't you know, just as I'm thinking about this, they come out with a story about

[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:52.320]
not asthma. What's the thing they've got this new DNA ace this new stuff to break up the mucus

[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.820]
where people cough and choke and we had it on our news all morning.

[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.460]
Some kind of like a bronchial disorder and they're starting to talk about mucus.

[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:09.300]
And my mind was on mucus, which is really not something I think about too much. Here's a for Lauderdale.

[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:16.160]
Hi, Neil. Hi. How you doing? Okay. You're not. We were right. It's not on mucus is it? No, not at all. Excellent.

[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:27.940]
I want to wish you a happy poem. That's an organization. We're starting called mom, M-O-A, minds on mucus. Happy

[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:33.660]
home Natasha. Yeah. Do you like the real ones like I like with the poppy seeds in the outside that are big and fluffy and soft?

[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:40.180]
Or do you like those little hard triangular ones that are supposed to be for real? I like the ones the real ones.

[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:51.820]
The soft ones. Right. I only like certain things that are hard. Not home Natasha. Right. There you go. I want to talk to you about when you sponsor spicers.

[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:57.400]
Yeah. Did you ever try them? Yes. You like them? Yeah. I've got a whole bunch of them at home. What flavor?

[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:03.700]
Chocolate. I love the best. Yeah. I just tried the chocolate. I have to tell you this meal. They really sucks.

[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:12.220]
You don't like them? No. I like barbecue ones. It sucks the big weedy. Yeah. What about the other ones? I didn't try the other ones. Oh.

[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:24.680]
These are terrible. What do you like with one of those phony fake diet plans or something? No. You got to eat miracle berries first. Oh yeah. That can't hurt. Well, call a plant doctor. That'll work. Right. Okay. Have a good day, Neil.

[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:29.860]
In fact, maybe you can plant some in your home Natasha. Excuse me. I said have a great forum. You tell fine.

[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:39.360]
She's with one of those like teni crag or something. 1257 at WIOD. We have an open-line and broiled 524.

[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:47.720]
Out of town is quite a down considerably and quite frankly, I couldn't give a fly and crap less to be honest with you. Here's a cuntler edge. Hey, good afternoon, Neil. How you doing, sir?

[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:53.720]
I'm doing lousy. You say misery love. Love cuntler. Oh, it's going around, man. It's the crud. It's creeping.

[01:21:53.720 --> 01:22:06.580]
I woke up with it yesterday. Yep. So how long do I have? I got to look at the mucus. Yeah, what it starts to wonder real heavy duty like dark green. Oh, this is real clear. Oh, no, that's just the beginning. Oh, man. How long you had it?

[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:17.520]
Let's see Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Just about a week. That's why it takes about a week to get rid of the cold. That's just about at the end. That's the tail end. Well, at least some home here. Take care of yourself. Yeah.

[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:22.220]
And you got a good weekend to get destroyed. It's always good getting the cold before the weekend. You get your whole weekend ruined.

[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:31.200]
I'm not going to be one of these people jumping on the old bandwagon about the instant replay thing. I'm glad it's out of there. Well, there we go. Find me a guy even

[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:39.860]
who knows what he's full of crap. I don't have to go to say that's right. Good for you. Every time every call is a crucial call. I mean, how can they say this call?

[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:49.160]
Every call is not a crucial call. That's not. No, it's not. If you can't, can I wait a minute? Wait a minute. Can I explain something to you in baseball.

[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:58.960]
Balls and strikes, you know, and stuff that goes on. Okay. Every pitch. There's another call. You know what I'm saying?

[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:06.600]
The every ball that's hit the umpire has to make a call in football. The mid or even though there are a lot of calls to be made. Let's face it.

[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:14.200]
Most plays in football. A, there's not a penalty and B, there's not a controversy about whether it's complete or incomplete or a football or not.

[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:20.740]
So it's compared to baseball where there are like hundreds and hundreds of pitches. Football's a piece of cake. There aren't that many.

[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:26.560]
Yeah, but when you know when you when you you know, stop a play for this or this, you stop the momentum of the drive and how many teams,

[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.560]
especially Buffalo, they in Cincinnati when they first started, but the reason for that is they didn't do it right.

[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:35.860]
They were supposed to allow only so many seconds and were some of those deals and went on for like a half an hour.

[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:39.460]
I'm getting and I'm getting sick and tired of you know how fat I got going back to the fridge every time.

[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:44.260]
So why can't they just tighten it up a little bit? Well, every time you make a rule in sports, you got to have rules to

[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:49.920]
govern that rule, right? And they're not doing it. And what did they do back in the old days? They paid the rep's off.

[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.760]
So you know, keep doing it here. What's the difference?

[01:23:54.100 --> 01:24:00.260]
Oh, when it starts getting like purple, that's the time to call us again. Have a great day. Feel better.

[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:03.360]
Okay, well, he's under the weather that you know, answers his problem.

[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:09.240]
Not everybody's going to agree on this. We like one or two people who happen to be wrong. 751 WI would do.

[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.560]
We have an open line of day. We got Lisa Campbell. I'll bet Lisa here.

[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:18.000]
Okay, Lisa's she's misdependable and er, okay, she may not get it right. But Lisa's in there.

[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:25.300]
Lisa's got the one o'clock news. We got Rick and Suds today with what's her name is back again. Laura Corn with her corn ball crab.

That's true. That's all accounts. That's why you're still there.
