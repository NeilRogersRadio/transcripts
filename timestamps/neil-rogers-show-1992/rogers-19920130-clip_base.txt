[00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.240]
Council Norman Kent and we'll go over the details to a certain extent but

[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.280]
we wanted to begin the program today by having me alone just to well actually

[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.380]
just check it and see how you're doing because I'm a little concerned I hope

[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.500]
you're feeling all right today given the circumstance. Yeah I feel fine I just

[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.440]
the only reason I'm not there today is because I got a but it's an interesting

[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.200]
thing if you ever been in jail Jeff. I have never been in jail but many people

[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.220]
have but it's an interesting thing in the DCT I they were kind of a light

[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.960]
night so I didn't get home by 4 this morning after bonding out but after

[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.860]
only about two hours late there was really no way to come in and we showed

[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.340]
the day. Well that's understandable and I wanted to again point out because this

[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.300]
this is going to be a strange show you think President Bush has the toughest

[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.700]
job in America today I probably have the toughest job in America but beyond

[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.180]
that could do it better though I probably could but I think what we need to

[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.000]
say is that the reason you're not on the air today has nothing to do with

[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.440]
anything legal or anything like that it simply is that you didn't get out as

[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.480]
you just mentioned to for a minute wouldn't be proper to have you come in

[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.780]
given the circumstances and try to do a show. Right and I also want to thank you

[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.420]
know we stay in and day out I give them really rough time and they deserve it

[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.680]
in a lot of ways and the smaller stuff but in terms of the bigger picture use

[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.180]
accordingly Shay I mean the people at Cox are just incredible confident land

[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.940]
is the an even boy jury and I'm fighting my tongue with the leading when I say

[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.860]
that but they've been just tremendous in support even they understand what it's

[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.920]
all about very well I think and I'll be back tomorrow. Why?

[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.720]
After that and after that I don't want this to sound small see or or taken the

[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.800]
wrong way but you will always have my personal and professional support in

[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.860]
this matter and I think that I speak for lots of people and sound

[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.320]
important this month. Well I appreciate it Chuck but pirate still so.

[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.420]
Oh baby I know you're talking around Chuck it's just we're gonna be bad this

[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.380]
year but I'm not giving up I'm not throwing in the balcony. All right anything

[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.140]
else you have to say? No I just wish you good luck because obviously it's

[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.060]
gonna be an exciting four hours and I just want to send a message to all those

[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.940]
people in the media who feel compelled like our friends next door to come up here

[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.800]
they're certainly welcome the acres is beautiful there's a nice call to

[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.680]
the second the end of my street I will not be entering the door my dogs will be

[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.860]
barking ferociously and hysterically but I do have two nights for a

[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.240]
vet out there and they photograph very well. Great thanks Neil thanks for

[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.580]
calling see you tomorrow. All right Neil Rogers here's the statement that

[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.820]
Mike Disney has read to the press if you've been listening to WIOD news

[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.740]
through the morning you've heard this statement it's short but this is the

[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.740]
statement that's been released from Michael Disney last night Neil Rogers on

[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.940]
Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. talk show host on WIOD was arrested

[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.280]
charged with a first degree misdemeanor for in decent exposure. Neil Rogers has

[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.600]
denied all charges and is presently free on bond at this time the station has

[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.700]
no plans to suspend or terminate Neil however we will continue to monitor the

[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.500]
situation. Neil Rogers will not be on the air today but I might Disney hope that

[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.860]
he can return very soon. Neil Rogers has asked that we thank all of his loyal

[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.860]
listeners for their continued support as Neil just did. The further questions

[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.520]
ought to be directed to as attorney Norman Kim so that's the statement from

[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.020]
Michael Disney today. We do have a police report from the Miami Beach police

[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.580]
that I will be glad to read on the air today but I will do it slightly later in

[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.160]
the half hour because it's handwritten I have not read it verbatim yet and I

[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.960]
don't want to watch it up on the air so I will read it during a break and we will

[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.460]
read word for word our police report from Miami Beach over time. This will

[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.700]
be needless to say very interesting day at WIOD there are a lot of people there's

[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.100]
no question there's a lot of people in South Florida today who feel well. What

[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.600]
goes around comes around and for the guy who's always taken shots at other

[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.600]
people and their shortcomings and their poibles and their problems with the

[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.460]
police that it's only right and it's only justice that it happened to

[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.440]
Neil Rogers and that's I guess fine if you want to call today and talk about

[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.440]
that and say that we're gonna let you say I think that you know we all again

[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.960]
have to be within the bounds of the decor I'm here I don't want to be setting a new

[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.680]
record for the dump but it's right frankly but people will want to say that and

[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.160]
Neil's a public guy and he's used to that sort of thing and he's gotten more

[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.800]
heat calls and he mailed any one of us will ever have in our lifetime so I'm sure

[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.840]
he's some hip enough savvy enough and thick skinned enough to be able to

[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.760]
handle that sort of thing on the other hand and I don't say this simply

[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.400]
because I'm sitting here today I do not say this because I happen to work for

[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.120]
WIOD I'm not shilling for anybody today in saying that the last time I check

[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.040]
this was still is the United States of America and that you are innocent

[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.620]
until proven guilty that the crime that Neil has been accused of here is a

[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.880]
misdemeanor nothing polonious and Neil has again denied the charges and feels

[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.040]
that he will be fully vindicated this is one of those very touchy times when

[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.960]
you've got a situation where someone has been accused of something and it takes

[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.700]
a while for the process of courts and for the whole issue to be aired and Neil

[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.940]
will be under the gun and under the scope here for a while until he is allowed

[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.860]
to say what he has to say so let's remember that we're all innocent until proven guilty

[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.460]
I think that we try to practice that and let's try to remember today if you

[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.460]
would like to call with your support for Neil or your thoughts about this whole

[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.540]
larger issue that I think we can get into on this program today

[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.560]
Dr. Osar Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. talk show host on WIOD was arrested

[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.300]
and charged with a first degree misdemeanor for indecent exposure Neil Rogers

[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.980]
has denied all charges and is presently pre on bond at this time the station has

[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.100]
no plans to suspend or terminate Neil Rogers however we will continue to

[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.740]
monitor the situation Neil Rogers will not be on the air today but I hope he can

[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.100]
return very soon Neil has asked that we thank all his loyal listeners for their

[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.220]
continued support any further question should be directed to his attorney Norman

[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.540]
Kent

[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.660]
Morbule

[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.820]
WIOD personality Neil Rogers was arrested last night after allegedly

[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.360]
exposing himself and an adult movie theater of Miami Beach WIOD's Robert Pencal reports

[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.340]
Officials say that Neil Rogers was arrested at the GAD theater after two

[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.880]
detectives saw him sitting on a back row bench exposing himself while

[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.080]
watching a heterosexual movie Miami Beach police spokesman Tom Hula-Hans as

[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.520]
Rogers was arrested outside the theater as he attempted to leave

[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.140]
it will transpired very quickly as he left his sat down the subject then

[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.820]
recognized his predicament apparently I tried to cover himself up and he

[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.340]
got out of the theater the officers followed him and where it was most logical

[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.140]
to stop him is where they identified themselves Hula-Hans as the arrest was

[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.700]
part of a routine patrol effort in that area Robert Pencal Newstalk Radio 610

[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.920]
WIOD nails arrest as creative speculation whether he'll remain on the air

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.120]
WIOD general manager Mike Disney says he has no intention of suspending or

[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.880]
terminating Neil he adds that Neil Rogers commercial sponsors have been

[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.420]
calling showing their support for him we've had contact with many advertisers

[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.400]
so far this morning particularly advertisers that enjoy advertising in the

[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.780]
Neil Rogers program and we've had nothing but support in addition to numerous

[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.160]
phone calls from listeners that they're very upset about it and hoped at the

[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.420]
radio station and the company stand behind it and we do Disney says Neil will

[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.640]
return to his regular times lot tomorrow morning Chuck Meyer as you obviously

[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.160]
know is hosting Neil's program this morning and Chuck talk with Neil at the top

[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.660]
of the show yeah I feel I want to I want to say something I want to say

[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.140]
something and this is again a personal observation this morning I'm aware that

[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.140]
Norman Kent is off in Neil's attorney and I'm aware he does a talk show on

[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.820]
another station and I tuned in Norman thinking he might be on the air turns

[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.520]
out he's been ill for a few days and has been off well I'm circling the

[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.820]
Mr. Kane was on another station today is very first call as I'm driving is not

[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.820]
other than Rick Sanchez and I want to say something a public to publicly to

[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.400]
Rick and I've had him on this program recently and I purposely did not talk

[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.500]
about his drunk driving hassle because again I thought that had been hashed

[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.280]
over a million times I wanted to talk to him about other things but there I

[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.920]
must say and I don't think I'm being unfair to Rick Sanchez by paraphrasing what

[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.920]
he said in the way he said it was certainly in what he said today about

[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.080]
Neil because he felt that Neil had never given him a fair shake and that he had

[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.180]
insinuated in the community that somehow Neil never gave him a fair shake and

[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.860]
never gave him the benefit of innocence before guilt although I seem to

[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.720]
recall that Rick Sanchez copped the plea in his drunk driving case but beyond

[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.360]
that there was a certain sort of a self satisfaction that guys like Sanchez

[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.300]
and Kane are getting out of this today and I really wonder why well you know

[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.380]
what he caused what the bigger point is is if you're a public figure you could

[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.820]
be publicly targeted and and it's going to it could ruin a career and these guys

[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.940]
should know that more than anybody else so why rebel in the guy's current

[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:34.100]
problem for any other reason than what I know was which was ratings and

[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.080]
titillation and more talk because that particular station never has a

[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.180]
format unless they talk about Neil or this station which is pretty weak and

[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.240]
to have a guy like Sanchez on and Rick can come on over here and explain

[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.860]
himself the day if he wants to but Rick Sanchez getting on the air at another

[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:55.060]
radio station today going kiss, kiss, kiss about Neil Rogers was low and I felt

[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.300]
it I could feel it right through the radio it was low and it and I told Rick

[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.060]
Sanchez when he was on this program a few months ago that I really felt that

[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.760]
when he copped his plea it admitted what he did with his drunk driving case we

[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.640]
grew up a bit why take that back I don't think Rick's grown up at all well I

[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.360]
thought it was low one more point Chuck I'll let you go I think Neil be around a

[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:14.960]
lot longer this
