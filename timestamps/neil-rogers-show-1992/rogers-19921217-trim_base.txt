[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]
anyway i have two things before we talk about women struggling for a powerful

[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.420]
voice in radio

[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.440]
women are struggling rights of course pat kuri who just happens allegedly to be a

[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.680]
woman

[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.720]
but it's very very so i believe it

[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.500]
but before we get into that i got a little thing here another one of those

[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.480]
personal things that i bring to the table so to speak

[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.260]
i don't want to go through the whole story because it's a long pond restory

[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.700]
i bought my house back in february ok closed in the house in the middle of

[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.340]
february

[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.740]
there was an alarm a security system in the house when i got there it wasn't

[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.240]
hooked up nobody knew how to use it

[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.600]
after about a month i finally called a security company that had put it in

[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.740]
their name was on the box but by the come out they screwed up my phone system

[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.300]
they drove me nuts i got rid of

[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.560]
i come on a year i told that story

[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.640]
then i get another of people call me because they heard me talking about

[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.020]
on the road we'd love to come out with straight to the level to the board the

[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.940]
best but but but maybe

[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.160]
i've had two major incidents first my phones all went dead again because the

[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.900]
first guy that came out screwed up the phone system and there was a short and

[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.240]
there was this

[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.720]
and then uh... then all of a sudden after the second guy came out and got it

[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.600]
straightened out allegedly a day or two later

[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.880]
the alarm goes off screaming and blaring i'm just sitting there living and

[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.760]
watching tv and the thing goes crazy

[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.740]
and the phone guy and the alarm guy came out that following monday

[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.040]
and a phone guy says you wouldn't believe just how screwed up this whole thing is

[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.780]
they go in the phone box and they patchy around and they mess it up and it's

[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.840]
like a nightmare and his best advice to me was just disconnect the uh...

[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.720]
the jack the phone jack to the monitoring thing and just forget about the

[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.480]
service because it's just gonna have a nightmare and these things are going

[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.860]
off like every twenty five seconds

[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.240]
so i call up this alarm company i will not mention their name on the year yet

[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.320]
and i told them that the audio is just is not you can't make a work right i can't

[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.120]
afford to have the cops coming to the house every five minutes uh... you know

[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.920]
with this along going off and the phones are getting screwed up for good audio

[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.180]
i said be sure to pass the message along the so-and-so the lady who is never

[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480]
there the one originally called me okay no problem

[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360]
now i'm starting to get bills from these people

[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.260]
after the second bill comes i call up the a party in question

[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.740]
and i said to her i said i'm not using your service the thing isn't hooked up

[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.240]
you're not monitoring it's that i explained to her why there was no problem

[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.120]
based on what she told me based on that conversation there was no problem

[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.260]
yesterday i go home i get my mail here is a letter from a collection agency in

[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.900]
pompano beach demanding the balance to thirteen hundred and sixty five dollars

[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.260]
thirteen sixty five

[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.140]
a sign to our office for immediate collection

[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.060]
et cetera et cetera et cetera with a lot of cost to cram

[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.780]
so i immediately call these people and of course the a party there wrote the

[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.300]
letters not there in his lift the country and will never be back again i call up

[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.920]
the alarm company well tomorrow morning so and so will be in she'll call you

[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.220]
day to clock i'll leave a message eight o'clock this morning comes no phone call

[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.360]
so about eight twenty i call there and sure enough here's this so one person

[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.640]
and i explained where the situation and she said well how would you like uh

[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.980]
to arrange for the man to come out he still has to disconnect the chips in

[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.820]
this and i said fine haven't come out monday and take out whatever equipment

[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.880]
you got in there because i'm not using it and i said also you got to take

[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.560]
care of this thing with a collection thing because i don't own money for a

[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.340]
service service that isn't working and i'm not using i can not go to pay for

[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.860]
that so finally a song of dance about the woman i originally spoke to

[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.700]
isn't going to be there till tomorrow and the dog is sick and this and that

[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.280]
would you like to talk to the owner of the company i said fine

[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.120]
she puts me on hold for thirty seconds

[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.020]
he comes on the phone and i'm i i'm not screaming i'm not yelling i mean i'm

[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.380]
hard to get a word out of my mouth i said i talked to so and so i'd like to

[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.360]
explain to you what's it uh wow i've been turned over for collection

[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.760]
see you in court slam slam down goes the phone on a receiver now that is a

[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.840]
beautiful way to do business okay so in other words if these people really

[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.780]
believe that i should have kept paying for a system that's not working and that

[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.320]
i'm not using why didn't they tell me that why is it that when i call

[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.120]
there and explain to them what the deal was no problem okay we'll take we'll

[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.700]
see that it's taken care of was the last thing that i heard

[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.280]
and if they think i'm right now to check which i could very easily okay i could

[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.820]
just go ahead and pay it which i assume see you in court slam that's a

[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.120]
wonderful way to treat the public how about making it work right okay how

[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.300]
about not coming out there and poaching around with people's phone systems

[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.560]
i never forget the first company the original one that

[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.840]
it installed at box remember that and the guy came out there not only screwed up

[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.280]
the phones but he went outside and i'm watching him he's by the phone box and he

[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.580]
like put a couple of wires together and made a short and he like jump five feet

[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.360]
off the ground i thought he was gonna fry his ass

[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.280]
all of these service i wish i didn't say all okay because there are some there are

[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.140]
some that come out and they do a good job some but man where you find him i have

[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.800]
no idea and hey forget about whether you want to get it done right or it's

[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.080]
growing up your life or your phone system or anything else forget about that

[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.400]
you sign a contract man we want your god damn money that's all we care about

[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.220]
just give us the money and have a great life and screw off and we'll see you in

[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.160]
court very nice charming lovely beautiful way to do business

[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.780]
women and radio struggle for a powerful voice is pat curry

[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.100]
this really a wacko that allegedly writes on radio in the fort letter del

[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.060]
son sentinel and she talks about the patricia howard lost her job as a

[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.680]
disjockey and add saleswoman at w e g n and alabama because the station

[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.960]
managers wife didn't want women on the year and then she talked to randy and

[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.900]
randy said there's no log against people marrying their farm animals either but

[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.260]
that doesn't mean it's okay gender fire based firings in alabama the state

[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.940]
supreme court said it was okay and randy says nothing has changed not yet but

[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.340]
we're working on it still on every fm there's five guys in one female and then

[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.000]
they go and quote our former morning news lady Elaine at tour news director

[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.460]
at w i n z left w i o d last month it was easy to go at bar she said because of

[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.940]
the stations attitude toward women i firmly believe a man and a woman could

[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.340]
come up with the same idea and if it was a man they'd say great let's what

[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.560]
run with it and if it was a woman they'd say what a stupid idea

[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.500]
at tour said that when she was hired at w i o d she was told there was a good old

[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.740]
boy network in the morning you hear that a good old boy network in the

[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.140]
morning instead of management fixing the problems she said she was told to

[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.740]
break through it the problem goes far beyond one station though she said

[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.060]
broadcasting in general and news in particular as a man's world run by man

[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.460]
well they not want to say this to you okay you left here voluntarily to take

[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.500]
the news director job at w i n z the all-new station with their

[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.760]
minisqule ratings nobody kicked your ass out the door but you couldn't read

[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.720]
she used to stumble and fumble and bumble and uh most of us here i mean

[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.560]
personally she was fine okay even after the second nose job she was fine

[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.220]
i have no access to grind personally but this is business but on the year

[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.900]
marginal at best in addition to which what really cracks me up is that when i

[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.220]
came to this radio station the news director was dorthy mack entire

[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.520]
a lady a woman who you know was was so repressed that all she did was leave here

[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.720]
and go to abc in new york for all kinds of big money

[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.720]
and it seems to me last time i checked at least a camel is sitting there in the

[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.440]
newsroom which i saw early moments ago

[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.780]
and we've got jennifer ramon we had gild beach in here and we've got how many

[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.520]
other women we had in that newsroom we had uh what's her name that went to

[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.860]
channel four gild not so bright

[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.220]
so what the hell are you talking about in the re the main reason that there

[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.560]
aren't that many women on the year doing talk shows or anything else

[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.380]
is that most women sound like crap they have thin voices on the year and most

[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.060]
people don't want to hear women on the year

[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.620]
unless they are extremely bizarre unusual talented like randy who is just uh

[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:39.860]
wanted a billion but man is good old boy network what a crack of piles man

[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.460]
just unbelievable

[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.520]
if we're so sexist at w i o d how come the former news director was a woman

[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.120]
and how come we have so many women in that newsroom how about terry how about

[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.040]
i'm not even remembering all the people in the newsroom horror women

[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.460]
sometimes i feel myself it's the ultimate phone fantasy

[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.300]
we've combined the thrill of phone sex and the excitement of the eldest

[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:20.660]
talk line to bring you to sterney to have the king satisfy your every secret

[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:28.760]

[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.720]
very slobily dressed because he's on vacation for two weeks

limited talents would open up a big fat mouth like that and start a big song and to dance about well

[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.680]

[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.540]
the advertising and taking all the revenue and put CNN headline news on 24 hours a day on all the

[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.060]
stations because god we sure don't want to pay any high price talent to come into do anything do we

[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:17.040]
god forbid good old boy network my ass Elaine in fact it's a miracle you should have kissed the

[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:22.000]
ground that you were here as long as you were in fact that's one of the reasons they're afraid to

[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.020]
fire some of these people because they get a discrimination suit you get an incompetent guy

[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.920]
and help kick his ass out the door in two seconds except for Joey who i guess has got the pictures

[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.480]
of boy gerry but you get an incompetent male news person they'll kick his ass out in a second but

[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.940]
you get a woman in there who were very very terrified to blow them out because right away they want

[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:48.740]
to go to court don't miss the weekend magazine featuring the latest news info trends and what's

[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:54.280]
happening this Saturday and Sunday morning i brought his very very sore

[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.760]
yeah take this one and stick it where the mondo shine chuckster your taste is deep inside in fact

[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.300]
it's probably that spot that is so personal that it makes everybody want to jump over to counter

[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.580]
and buy this album too

[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.760]
i guess when you're a macho man you can't admit that you like to disco huh everybody loved

[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.660]
disco but it's just not into admit that you loved it i mean Donna's summer we do agree she blew

[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.700]
okay she really a bit the big one but uh huh you like Donna's summer

[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.980]

[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.460]
i just want to be agreeable here you're so full of crock

[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:49.120]
and then he has the audacity in our macho news i think it is the good old boy network in there

[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.580]
i think Elaine had a point as a matter of fact i'm going to read the whole article over again

[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.760]
and agree with everything she said it's a bunch of good old macho man in that newsroom

[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.260]
yeah right up your alley chuck with our feet all ten of us

[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:14.380]

i mean for him to go on there i have no problem they're in here for everybody in the station to use

[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.260]
but to play out in john's filadalfi or freedom that's the one all the other stuff i don't really

[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:28.020]
care about but to play filadalfi or freedom and say that it was a crock of crap and that he had the

[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.540]
audacity to name his tennis team after him well what the hell difference is that what does that have

[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:36.920]
to do with the price of peas man what does that got to do with anything who gives a crap about the

[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:43.780]
tennis team filadalfi or freedom one of the all time there even even Mitch Lewis likes it and

[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.800]
Mitch Lewis is one of the toughest of please people we have ever known in our lives

[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.700]
when the food comes in here he comes in here and he picks through all of it like and takes a

like that right and we'll just take them all off we'll score like 200 points great now we're

[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:33.100]
talking yeah the defense was dynamite Marco Coleman and Brian Cox were just outstanding they kicked

[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:39.540]
ass jb how do you like that interception by jb brown huh yeah incredible they just have to be a lot

[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.700]
intense play with a lot of intense they have to play the whole four quarters that's what bothers me

[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.080]
about the offense their periods of the game and it looks like they go they like going to a shell

[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.340]
like a little bit of a coma yeah i love Brian Cox he's a badass he doesn't take any crap from

cables on a star line hello hey Neil yes sir how you doing okay what is the lane net lane net or say

[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:58.820]
she said she said that when she worked here that she was told there was a good old boy network

[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:03.920]
in the morning and instead of management fixing the problem that she was told to break through it

[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.260]
that the station had a crappy attitude toward women and i'm going to say it again what she evidently

[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:13.060]
isn't aware of is that before she came here the news director was a woman Dorothy McIntyre

[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:18.660]
who was very very good and went to work for abc in new york when she left here well not to defend

[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:25.840]
what she said uh i've listened to w i o d in the morning before micrinerie gets on and it's ridiculous

[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:32.940]
to hear i was a Henry Barrow right what does that mean i mean let's tell you i just tune in i mean

[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:40.400]
i have my alarm clock set to it it was like uh i don't know 5 30 they say and coming up next he

[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.800]
keeps going on and on what what women so you don't like Henry Barrow okay i happen to do it

[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.160]
immediately but what does that what does that have to do with the station's attitude toward women

[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:55.000]
well what she's saying is it's a good old boy net work it's like her or not her but

[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:01.040]
micrinerie and roger and all those guys it sounds like a bunch of you know a bunch of clown

[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.460]
that you're you're talking about apples and we're talking about potato peels okay one has got

[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.740]
nothing to do with the other your attack and renery show which which is your privilege but it has

[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.520]
nothing to do with the attitude of the station toward women or what's going on in the newsroom

[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.100]
in addition to which she was on here in the morning and morning drive which is the most important

[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:25.140]
for any radio station morning drive news is like el primo that's prime time news man so what the

[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:29.680]
hell is she belly aching about or did she just feel that because she left here and went over

[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.460]
there she had to take some gratuitous shots over here where she go i and z right all right

[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.220]
she didn't go to light bulb huh well she's she's about to step away from it in the book i'll tell you

[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:46.260]
that the winds uh chuck gonna talk about movies something he knows about uh hopefully today

[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.220]

[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.580]
Yeah

[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:53.320]
I agree. So Jeff from Pizza Loft who is the al-Rajers of Italian food, chronic, I mean just a pest

[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:59.100]
You cannot chase this man away no matter what you say about his greasy hair or anything

[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:06.080]
He calls up after I do the pizza loft spot and says to George and this is verbatim

[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.320]
I'm not making this up. He says it makes my

[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.240]
Hard when I hear Neil do a great spot like that for the law

[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.440]
Can you believe that?

[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.520]
It makes his hard

[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:25.380]
Probably ponytail is what he meant 1232 at W I O D is that Jeff on the line again saying that he never really said that before I

[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:31.300]
Guarantea man that Jeff said that it makes his hard when I do such a great spot for the pizza loft

[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:37.380]
I am an imbecile when you're tired of all that fast food junk and you gave some dearer daughter

[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:42.660]
Sconquo

[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:50.220]
At the road kill cafe you get freshly run over motor meat with no additives no preservatives and just a little gravel

[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:56.760]
Try the pavement pizza chunks of rabbit smashed by a semi on top a whole wheat dough or a pull of hard burger

[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.140]
Two patties of pure mystery meat tenderized by traffic and served with a pickle

[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:06.940]
Hi, can I take your order? I'm so hungry. I can eat a horse one equestrian special Charleen

[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.420]
So come on by the road kill cafe

[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.260]
Suppers ready

[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.360]
Never smoke pot. You know, I don't have the answer. I used to know it and I don't know it

[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:24.380]
There is there is a formula, but I don't know what it is that is great radio 1241 a W I O D big story here

[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.780]
Howard Cohen in the Harold Kings moving today time

[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:31.220]
But W I O D is dropping him like a rock from the World Trade Center and boy

[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.260]
We're gonna have a party about that on February 1st

[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:38.840]

[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.100]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello

[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.820]
What the hell is going on with this thing? Yes? How you doing? I called you a couple weeks ago

[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.380]
I told you I had a brother lived in Portland, Maine. Yes, sir

[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.280]
He goes hunting a place called a Greenville, Maine

[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:57.060]
And they actually have a road kill cafe there. I believe it. It's no light. Uh-huh

[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.340]
That's one of the best places to be in there. I'll bet

[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:05.580]
I'm coming in a spy report from FTL. Yeah great phone pal. Well, I can't help him in the airport

[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.780]
Get a new phone. We have an open line in Broward 5249463 in addition

[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.360]
We don't give a flying crap about FTL. Here's Bokeh. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:19.060]
Did you know snap a one public? Yes, they did it's open to 20 bucks and it was up to 29 by the end of the first day

[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:23.200]
I didn't believe it was almost a 50% increase if I knew that I would have jumped on my buddy from the church

[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.000]
Just call me told me about it right? I

[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]
Mean that's kind of they could be double and then you're from that. What do you think? I would think

[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.060]
I mean, it's just the thing in town. Well, our nation wide now there are 50 states amazing. Yes, it is and you're the one

[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.880]
That was the Lorenzo's market. So you're the one that you know, what was the three or four years ago?

[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.280]
You're the first one that got everybody into it first one in this neck of the woods

[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.600]
You know now now they're even in the Bahamas thanks to me

[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:51.180]
Canada dry owes you now absolutely. I want to I want it in a big brown paper sack if they knew what you did

[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.800]
They would say give you like 10% or something. Okay. I'll take it real quickly back

[00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:00.100]
Yeah, you talked about a date you had with a girl that was wild. I don't remember

[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.800]
You know I'm talking about yeah, Michigan State was a Michigan state. I want to say high school

[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:11.040]
Maybe no, I was I didn't have any dates with girls in high school. This was at Michigan State. We went on a grasser

[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.100]
That's what it was. Yeah, that's what it was and I'll tell you she was a knockout too

[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:19.340]
It's too bad that I wasn't inclined that her name was Arlene. She was from Detroit and I rented a car

[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:24.380]
I rented a beautiful Chevy Malibu. This is back in about 1961, right?

[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.540]
And all my friends from the dorm. They all had dates. We went out in this place in the woods, right?

[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.600]
And we had never been there before and of course it's at night and it's dark and where I'm like driving through this

[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.540]
Path is trail

[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.540]
I'm like scraping up the sides of this poor Impala against

[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:42.240]
Bushes and trees. I mean the next morning this car looked like it had been through World War one and two

[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:42.600]
Right

[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.400]
And then we get out there and of course we're all drinking our brains out

[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:51.060]
And so my modus operandi was to keep just drinking until I was so bombed that I just passed out

[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:57.760]
Which I did and she did I the last thing I remember was her getting up to tinkle in the woods somewhere and that's about and then the next morning

[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.160]
I remember waking up in the dorm. That's the next I don't remember anything between then how we got back or whatever

[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.580]
I wake up in the dorm and I look I was in the bottom bunk, okay?

[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.880]
And I look up and the mattress for my roommates bunk is gone

[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:14.460]
And the reason being that I had puked all over the bed all over the room all night and that the

[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:19.740]
Aroma was so exciting that he took his mattress neck in the room next door and slept next door all night

[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.880]
Then I get up no glasses no watch

[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:31.100]
Seriously, we got a drive back out there scour the woods and miraculously my watch and my glasses were there in the woods

[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.480]
That's a wild story. Yeah, I remember it was like I remember until a few years ago

[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.560]
It was a great story well it goes to show you what great lengths some young closet queen will go to to prove his masculinity

[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.160]
Incredible. Yeah, I would get that in you too. Bye. I

[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:48.560]
Remember like it was only yesterday boy that Porsche what a beautiful car that was I mean was like brand new practically

[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.500]
Not what I got it back and you know then those days

[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.480]
I don't know how it is now

[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.160]
But in those days when you brought it back and it looked like it'd been through a war

[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.460]
They didn't care because their insurance covered it and then we thought they were gonna throw our ass in jail or something

[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.520]
And we just said well somebody sides wiped us in the park

[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.960]
No, no problem. Don't sweat it. Have a nice life. Go back to school and drink a lot

[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:14.080]
Let me tell you something the only thing bigger than the one to two hour is that Debbie Alice boy

[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:38.840]
Yeah, she a cow

[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.360]
Round

[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:52.960]
right now

[00:36:55.460 --> 00:37:01.080]
Maybe

[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:09.440]
I thought

[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.980]
I am an imbecile.

[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.240]
Please, wake up and just go away.

[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.060]
I think we need to put the cards on the floor.

[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.040]
How would that be, Mitch? We need you, idiot?

[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.300]
It was the hell were you leading me to?

[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:37.620]
Oh!

[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.320]
What?

[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.140]
You only station in America that has cart machines that are almost sitting on the floor.

[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.340]
Well, one thing about today, man, it may not have been great, but at least I've been consistent.

[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.480]
Total technical inequity.

[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.840]
Everything I've touched has turned a shot during this 4L.

[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.240]
Whatever it feels like I'm hungry.

[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.900]
What else would I want to play here?

[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.020]
Oh yeah, there were like 2 or 3 cuts left on his cart.

[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.800]
I'm behind the navios, Richard.

[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.780]
Go ahead and go.

[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.480]
Richard, there's an MSN.

[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:14.700]

[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.280]
There's a helicopter.

[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.580]
There's a helicopter coming out.

[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.460]
Look at the field.

[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.780]
One of those.

[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:27.700]
The field.

[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.120]
Oh, Katie.

[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.500]
What is this special hockey?

[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.240]
108 and WIOD are hockey intensive station for the 90s, man.

[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.640]
We are going to take that puck and just jam it in places that haven't been invented yet.

[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.060]
That man he is the biggest backstabber in the building.

[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.400]
We already knew that, Adam.

[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.860]
Have you ever had Billy Joel?

[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.460]
I never have had Billy Joel.

[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.740]
Had his wife, but never him.

[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.520]
Yeah, I had him a long time ago in Miami.

[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.180]
117 and WIOD, and we're smoking and choking it today.

[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.380]
We got the big tailgate party this Sunday night starting at 5 p.m.

[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.120]
because it's an 8 o'clock game, of course, against the jets.

[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.840]
There to be mediocre jets.

[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.060]
I know they beat the crap out of us up there.

[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.380]
I know that. That's ancient history.

[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.280]
Hi, this is Mari Fovitch, wishing you a happy Hanukkah.

[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.600]
I wonder if Connie Chung says Hanukkah.

[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:12.880]
You know, Connie Chung?

[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.900]
Boy, I can't stand her.

[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.760]
Miami Beach on a starline.

[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.620]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.540]
Pretty good. That's funny.

[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.720]
Hey, I took your advice.

[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.460]
I got the ticket to 15, the rubber.

[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.140]
Is that me on a ticket?

[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.740]
I got it here. I wanted to use a speed trap.

[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.220]
Yeah.

[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.860]
And we went up the courtyard as they had North Day Justice Center.

[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.480]
Yes. They took care of me. No point to...

[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.040]
What did I tell you?

[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.120]
And no suspended ascending.

[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.600]
They know how to do it over there. I am telling you.

[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.620]
They did it, all right.

[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.920]
And saw these other shepherds going to know nobody, you know,

[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.380]
helping them out or anything. They went out there.

[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.620]
And they got the same penalty as I did.

[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.960]
They didn't get any points either except I'm out of $100.

[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.620]
I didn't help you explain that.

[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.280]
That's cute.

[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.820]
What a jackass. What a moron.

[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.280]
Whoa!

[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.500]
I'll be Don Hill, Jack.

[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.800]
Here's Fort Myers. Hello.

[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:26.460]
Welcome, friends.

[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.840]
You're tuned to Pirate Radio, AM777.

[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.640]
I'm your host, John McEw.

[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.140]
And it's a Poke Saturday.

[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.960]
We invite you to come out and see us at Orange Row 54

[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.920]
at Fleet Masters Fleet Market, Martin Luther King Boulevard,

[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:41.980]
Fort Myers, Florida.

[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.380]
I am an imbecile. Good one.

[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:46.660]
How are you, Neil?

[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.260]
Is this John Jr.?

[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.060]
Yes, it is.

[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.500]
What a voice, John.

[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.880]
Do you, are you really a friend to him?

[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.800]
No, I wouldn't say that. He would say that, but I wouldn't.

[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:56.180]
Oh, he did.

[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.380]
John is one of the world's best.

[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.420]
He's the definitive radio drifter.

[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:03.120]
He is the stereotype of everything bad that, you know,

[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.080]
we think about in radio.

[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.560]
People who can't keep a job, people are always drunk

[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.400]
and down on the gutter.

[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.200]
And people who are just generally asleep bags, that's John.

[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.020]
But he's a good guy.

[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.200]
Yeah, but otherwise an ad.

[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.260]
And of course, he used to keep his wife in the trunk a lot.

[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.240]
Well, it was much discussion.

[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.880]
And claims to be divorced, but nobody did ever see her again.

[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.200]
But he said his wife never went to Miami.

[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:22.700]
Right.

[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.960]
Anyway, I'm glad your show is over here.

[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.980]
Yeah, you're glad it's over? So am I.

[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.100]
Yeah, over here.

[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:29.560]
Yeah.

[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.520]
Because we didn't get sun down here.

[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.980]
Not where we live anyway.

[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.420]
I know that. Why do you think we went on there?

[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.440]
You think we went on there for the honor of being on in Fort Myers, Florida?

[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:37.920]
Come on.

[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.560]
This is probably the second largest market in Florida, right?

[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:41.560]
Yeah, at least.

[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.060]
Right.

[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:42.760]
Okay.

[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.380]
Next to Okachobi.

[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:45.060]
All right.

[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.920]
Well, listen, have a great day and give John a big sloppy kiss for us, okay?

[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:48.960]
Oh, we can tell you.

[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:49.620]
Yes.

[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:54.740]
Starting in January, Fox presents a new show from Sheriff John McDougal.

[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.000]
It's deputies.

[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:56.920]
Okay.

[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.380]
Oh, God.

[00:41:58.740 --> 00:41:59.900]
See, see what we're dealing with?

[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.440]
I am delighted that we're getting those calls because that's the, that's it.

[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.280]
What you hear is what you get over there.

[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.480]
God almighty, it's frightening.

[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.980]
138, we have another light-fingered story to report here.

[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.300]
Another little contratomps here at the Isle of Dreams complex.

[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.860]
Halcyon was just showing something to me.

[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:17.840]
No, not that, Johnny.

[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.180]
And come to find out that our friend's next door at your honorable hometown station.

[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.780]
A lot of our mail since we're right next door to Channel 7.

[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:31.820]
A lot of the mail, if it doesn't say whatever on it, it goes to the wrong place.

[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.840]
A lot of our mail winds up to Channel 7.

[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:37.860]
And she was telling me that more often than not, if it's like a package of some kind,

[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.580]
it comes back to us, opened up, and with stuff missing.

[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:46.260]
And she just showed me a thing from like the Columbia Video Club that was for Marvin.

[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.680]
And they know who Marvin is, they know he works over here.

[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.600]
And it originally had two video cassettes in there, right?

[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.980]
Now it's been opened up with one cassette in there with one tape, and the other one is missing.

[00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:58.960]
And they bring it over.

[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.920]
I mean, why not just steal the whole thing?

[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.980]
To show you how smart they are next door.

[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:07.500]
If you're going to finger something of ours, Sally, or whoever the hell is fingering it over there,

[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.560]
then why not just take the whole damn thing?

[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.080]
And they say, oh, we don't know anything about it.

[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:11.800]
Never got delivered here.

[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.080]
Can I lost in the mail or something?

[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.120]
But no, they opened it up.

[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.000]
They steal the good stuff, and then bring like the crumblings over here.

[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:23.280]
That would be like opening up a box of candy that was sent to somebody here in the building.

[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.240]
And just eating like all of the candy and then leaving the wrappers in the bottom,

[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.300]
and then closing the box up again and bringing it over here.

[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:33.260]
Yeah, I have some more a Hershey Kisses, and Johnny, go ahead. You're free loading a slob.

[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.660]
I did that one time, about 15 years old.

[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.600]
151, and the search party never came back.

[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.900]
Let's go to Kendall. Hello.

[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.200]
Hello. Yes, sir.

[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:43.880]
Neil, how are you doing?

[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:45.280]
They're still looking for it. Pretty good.

[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.700]
All right. Listen, a long time season holder here at Dolphin Gate.

[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:49.680]
Yeah.

[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.620]
And I got a little complaint.

[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.140]
I never used to say it's a touch of Dolphin.

[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:58.740]
Danny, in a couple of weeks ago, when you started talking about him.

[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:01.200]
And I bet you probably started to get the heroin as a result.

[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.120]
And I can't keep my eyes off of this asshole.

[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.000]
Yes, he is.

[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.400]
What is he doing out on the field?

[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.720]
Good question. Can't we get something, something, anything, anything even close to alive?

[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:10.600]
Better than that crap.

[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.460]
He's got the stupid flag that says, go, go, go. He's the one that needs to go.

[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.660]
He's got two things. He's got the thing that says go, and the thing that says do the wave.

[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.160]
And we all ought to wave him. Goodbyes, what we ought to do.

[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:28.720]
He's going to be on 11 o'clock news.

[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:33.640]
No, as a matter of fact, they'd agreed to give her like extra diesel fuel so she can ride I-75 across the alley.

[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.300]
Well, here's the inside scoop on that.

[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.020]
I hear she's getting together with Sally Fitt because Sally Fitt gets off at 10 if you know what I'm saying.

[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.220]
All right, 11 if you know what I mean.

[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:41.840]
Yes, I do.

[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:43.040]
And I heard...

[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.700]
Is that the inside story?

[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.100]
Yes.

[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.200]
Okay, have a great day. Have a great day.

[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.640]
We have an open line in day, at 751 and 2 and Broward, 524.

[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.680]
You know, I'm thinking on this Elaine Nettor thing again.

[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:02.440]
What did she expect? Did she expect that she was going to be that we were going to fire Chuck and make her the news director?

[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.740]
I mean, Elaine Nettor, a quick little lick Chuck's ass.

[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.180]
Under any circumstances, she's not like not in the same league.

[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.640]
Chuck Myers is probably the best news person that's ever worked in the market even if he has crappy taste in music.

[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.140]
He is our news director.

[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.980]
And so what did she think? What did she think was in the works for her here that she opens up a big mouth?

[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.680]
Like I said, kiss the ground that you got a job because you can't read for a shot, honey.

[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.000]
Hi, Alia.

[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:29.980]
Hello, Neil.

[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:30.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.360]
How you doing, sir?

[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:32.220]
Pretty good, sir.

[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.300]
First time caller, long time listener.

[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.240]
By the way, thanks to a guy named George who sent me a t-shirt that says shot happens on it.

[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:39.940]
All right.

[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.500]
Not bad.

[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:44.720]
Okay, Neil, I took your advice last weekend, went to the pizza loft.

[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:45.260]
Yes?

[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:46.620]
Had a great time.

[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.220]
Yeah?

[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.520]
Was Jeff there putting on a little display for you?

[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.440]
Of course, he's always there, I guess.

[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:51.840]
Yeah.

[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.480]
And another thing I wanted to ask you about, whatever happened to that broad Bonnie from Kendall?

[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:57.740]
Good question.

[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.640]
Boy, I'm sorry you brought it up.

[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.560]
I don't know, it's been months and months, hasn't it?

[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.040]
Yeah.

[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.680]
Maybe she found a life or something.

[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.040]
She got blown away by the hurricane or something.

[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:06.820]
We can only pray.

[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:07.760]
Wow.

[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:09.220]
All right.

[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:09.880]
That was it.

[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:10.660]
I feel better.

[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.480]
See, I felt better and I didn't know why and now I know the reason.

[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:14.200]
Thanks a lot.

[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:14.820]
Okay.

[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.540]
Have a great day.

[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.600]
Yeah, you know what I mean?
