[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.140]
No car, edges, and paper in a toilet, focus at the top.

[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.300]
You dummy!

[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.720]
Use talk radio's 610 WIOD presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.100]
To talk with Neil, dial 751 WIOD from Dave in Broward 524 WIOD.

[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.880]
Outside the 305 area code, toll free 1-800-944 WIOD.

[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.860]
And Bell South mobility customers make it a free call by dialect star IOD.

[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.140]
Now, the Neil Rogers Show, a new start radio's 610 WIOD.

[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.320]
You know, fat rich reminds me of my mother.

[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.860]
I must factor it, would you like to start the discussion for you?

[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.540]
Well, I'm out of ammunition on this.

[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.420]
Let me talk, man.

[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.260]
Sometimes I feel, it lies in passing me back.

[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.980]
Sometimes I feel, that people know how to smile.

[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.140]
But when I listen to the old show, you make me look like a shot.

[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.800]
And when I listen to the old show, a new Rogers radio.

[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.560]
Pick that thing, baby. Pick it. We don't care if it ever heals.

[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.880]
1006 at WIOD, WSUN, WWCN. Happy New Year from all your Paisons, man.

[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.420]
We are doing it on a great Wednesday.

[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.260]
If you thought Monday was a little weak, if you thought yesterday was terminal, just wait till today.

[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.460]
You can tell. I mean, they are out there and they are shopping.

[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.600]
The economy is booming. You business people must be making millions.

[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.080]
Send a bag of money over here, okay? Just send us a big bag of money.

[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.440]
Because they are out there in a frenzy. This is great.

[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.440]
This is dynamite, huh? Outstanding at its wild.

[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.460]
By the way, our Camilla House total speaking is sent into money is $92,969.

[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.800]
Bucks in a mail hasn't even come in yet today.

[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.420]
So it will be over $93 for sure when we open up the first couple of envelopes.

[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.700]
And if you would like to help us out, you would like to help the Camilla House in a homeless.

[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.440]
And also pick up a really neat best of NELCD or cassette or T-shirt or best of rickened Spud.

[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.260]
All you have to do is call that AT&T Camilla House Hotline number.

[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.520]
It is toll free from Sanibel Island to Tala Huchi.

[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.380]
1-800-852-006.

[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.740]
1-800-852-006. Just whip out your visa master card.

[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.220]
And don't forget, fully tax deductible donations, of course.

[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.960]
So if you want to deduct it from your 92 income taxes today and tomorrow,

[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.500]
your last two days to sneak it in there, okay?

[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.760]
Like your couple of grand or $500 or $10 or whatever you want to give.

[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.420]
And we thank you in advance.

[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.880]
Mark Clayton is doing it again, opening up a big, big mouth.

[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.100]
I mean, Lisa Olson is in Australia.

[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.640]
Did you read Dave Hyde's column in the sunset this morning?

[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.540]
Probably not if you're in Tampa or for Myers-Betuff, but Anna's.

[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.980]
I mean, she's in Australia or someplace.

[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.020]
She's down under. Can we say that?

[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.680]
At least Olson's down under.

[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.720]
And she's probably peaking too.

[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.360]
But he keeps opening up a big mouth and just goes on and on and where it stops.

[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.100]
Nobody knows, but we can only.

[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.780]
And then Tom Jicca's got a big, big column today.

[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.560]
Did you see that?

[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.080]
In the Sunset and all arts and entertainment,

[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.400]
Stan Major is back almost non-stop.

[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.040]
How do you like that?

[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.520]
Almost non-stop.

[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.020]
Like about 600 hours a day.

[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.720]
Only he's live, not on tape.

[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.820]
Like we're going to be on SUN.

[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.800]
So he's going to be doing three to six in the afternoon on WNBM.

[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.360]
And Suts calls it radio mumbling.

[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.400]
And overnight from 11 to three,

[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.800]
that sounds like four and three is seven hours a day.

[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.500]
God, even at the rates, they got to be paying.

[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.180]
That means in about two, three years he ought to be able to pay me back that money, shouldn't he?

[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.520]
How come it is that guys who do that late night show starting 11 o'clock at night seem to owe a lot of people money?

[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.680]
Is there some reason for that?

[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.760]
Maybe it just kind of runs with the territory.

[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.260]
So nice going, Stan.

[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.580]
WNBM, one of America's real mumbling stations.

[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.460]
Big thing here by Tom Jicca.

[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.520]
A lot of rumors in a business by the way, but you don't want to hear that crap.

[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.060]
Okay, too much inside stuff.

[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.500]
Nobody cares about the business.

[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.000]
Nobody cares about rumors.

[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.520]
Nobody cares about anything.

[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.260]
And by the way, Boy Geary says Paul Castro Nova blows.

[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.260]
So he's not going to be doing anything on his station.

[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.400]
That's what he just said.

[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.500]
He said he sucks.

[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.500]
Now speaking of our commos house stuff, this Thursday night,

[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.360]
we want to remind you we got a big, we got big new ones coming up, man.

[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.360]
The big orange New Year's Eve celebration this Thursday night.

[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.940]
We'll have a booth next to the 610 WIOD stage at the Winter Wonderland area in Bayfront Park

[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.160]
at the south end of the park from 8 p.m. to midnight.

[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.220]
A randy's going to be doing her show there that night.

[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.940]
Rick and Sputter coming back after doing her show there in the afternoon.

[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.780]
They're coming back there again, again.

[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.380]
And doing like 11 to 1230 to help ring in the New Year and help all the drunks out.

[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:24.620]
But anyway, all commos house items will be available for purchase at our booth right next to the impressive 610 WIOD stage.

[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.380]
These and MasterCut will be accepted. All the goodies will be there.

[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.440]
So there'll be good opportunity to pick up some crap.

[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.040]
Okay? And it'll sound real good on New Year's Eve because you'll be so plashy that you won't know any better.

[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.980]
Look at all these calls here, man. Tamarack. Hello.

[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.520]
Tamarack with a phone up.

[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.580]
Hello, Neil.

[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.600]
Yes, sir. Turn that radio down.

[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.440]
Okay, I'll get on the phone there.

[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.420]
Ah, yeah. Get on the phone. Spend it around a couple of times and turn down that radio.

[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.740]
There we go.

[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.060]
Sorry about that, Neil.

[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.400]
That's okay. Don't panic.

[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.440]
Hey, I just wanted to call and say I'm going to be leaving soon. I'm the guy from Hershey.

[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.420]
Oh, really?

[00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.060]
Yeah.

[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.940]
You're heading back on up the Hershey highway, huh?

[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.140]
Yeah. Well, I'll be damned.

[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.740]
I just want to say you have a great show.

[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.460]
Yes, I do.

[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.400]
And yesterday I went down to a Sawgrass Mall.

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.100]
Oh!

[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.720]
Yeah.

[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.420]
And how was it besides crowded is a shot.

[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.020]
Yeah, very crowded.

[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.380]
Boy.

[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.000]
But the bad thing was I found an amazing. I couldn't even find me a pair of jeans and a whole entire mall.

[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.600]
Why not?

[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.060]
I don't know. I looked in every single store.

[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.260]
Because you know the answer to life is in your jeans. You don't know that, don't you?

[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.160]
Yeah, I do.

[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.640]
Yeah.

[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.040]
I just want to wish you a happy new year.

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.820]
And the same to you. You sound a little bit depressed about leaving.

[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.140]
I can't be because it's 80 below zero up there, can it?

[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.400]
Well, we looked on the weather report. It doesn't look too good.

[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.460]
Yeah. When a candy gets frozen, it's not too palatable anymore.

[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.140]
Yeah. I just want to make a request.

[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.280]
Sure. I want you to play everything disgusting, rude and ignorant.

[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.760]
So I can hear it one more time.

[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.580]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.620]
This could be the greatest call in the history of the human race.

[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.160]
Even Alexander Graham Schwartz is excited about it.

[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.320]
Have a great trip back and a great life and we'll see you maybe next year.

[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.980]
Yeah, can I call somebody a douchebag?

[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.280]
Sure. Get it out of your system.

[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.120]
It's all my people I hate and Hershey.

[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.420]
You chicken neck, dog smelling crap, licking douchebags.

[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.800]
And?

[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.420]
Oh!

[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.000]
See ya.

[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.340]
Well, so what's wrong with that?

[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.500]
You pop out on the scene, make the girls scream.

[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.920]
12 minutes after 10 on the famous exciting, thrilling, vibrating IOD network.

[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.260]
Here's Chuck Meyer, Joey Reynolds, Tom Hopkins,

[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.520]
Germanic Schwartz-Gorendy Roads, each weekend, right here.

[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.700]
Germany, IOD, transfer field.

[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.700]
Iped little island full of gay romance.

[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.960]
They wear gay sandals and they wear tight pants.

[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.240]
On drenched top to bottom every day.

[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.060]
Blessed with the miracle of being gay.

[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.640]
The very best of packets in the USA.

[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.100]
Giving baked, baked pleasure in a baked, baked way.

[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.760]
The very best of packets in the USA.

[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.240]
Giving baked, baked pleasure in a baked, baked way.

[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.880]
Kasterfield.

[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.340]
Join the big swish to Chesterfield Queen.

[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.500]
You choice of the bags of America.

[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.340]
If you're lucky, you're lucky.

[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.240]
If you're lucky, you're lucky.

[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.780]
If you're lucky, you're lucky.

[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.600]
If you're lucky, you're lucky.

[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:25.140]
10-16 at WIOD.

[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.560]
Bob Green's in the building of the day.

[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.340]
How do you like that?

[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:28.680]
Oh!

[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.620]
Little slow today.

[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.880]
Well, hey, I'm sorry.

[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.740]
I'll come too old to reach your way to hell over there for those buttons.

[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.560]
We may be getting that new triple deck car machine one of these days soon.

[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.340]
If Mitch Ween ever stops being such a jerk.

[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.260]
Should we do the whole show on Mitch Ween today?

[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:42.920]
God.

[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.200]
Just, we're not at, we don't care how the studio looks, okay?

[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.080]
I mean, the head hot shows are coming in here Tuesday for 10 minutes.

[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.200]
And they're looking here.

[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.420]
We'll have it all cleaned up.

[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.440]
And it'll be really beautiful and spickened span.

[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.460]
Oh, we can't say that.

[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.720]
George gets hysterical when we say spickened span.

[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.060]
I mean, if it was good enough for Rosemary DeCamp.

[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.180]
No, she was selling 20-mule team Barracks, so I think.

[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.240]
Rosemary DeCamp and Ronald Reagan was selling Barracks, so.

[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.900]
But anyway, the point is, we don't, this isn't, this is radio.

[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.360]
We don't care about how it looks in here.

[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.300]
I mean, yes, it's nice to have it looking reasonable.

[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.720]
So in case anybody important ever comes in, which rarely happens,

[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.920]
it looks really spiffy and neat and exciting.

[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.640]
And when they bring all those broadcasting school students in the control room

[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.560]
and they look through the window and here, it looks really impressive.

[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.020]
Oh, isn't that neat? Isn't that cool?

[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.660]
You know, right.

[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.200]
We'd like to have some crap in here that works.

[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.540]
So on the year, it sounds like we have our act together.

[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.860]
We don't have to like reach on the floor.

[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.700]
Right. Every time we do something like that.

[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.460]
The audience could only see that we have to like crawl on the floor

[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.940]
and reach around and it's like milking a cow.

[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.840]
Every time you go to play another damn carton here.

[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.320]
Oh, man, that one was good.

[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.840]
Ooh. Here's a deer field. Hello.

[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.620]
Hi, Neil. How you doing, sir?

[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.460]
Happy new beer.

[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.540]
And the same to you.

[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.200]
Hey, I'm kind of behind the times.

[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.120]
You're kind of behind?

[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.000]
Behind the time.

[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.320]
Yeah.

[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.100]
I just saw them at Downer Book for the first time yesterday.

[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.700]
Now, did the thing fall off of it?

[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.360]
Well, I don't know, but there's a guy in there

[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.920]
that looks a lot like Mark Clayton.

[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:12.680]
Yeah.

[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.340]
Except he's got something in his hand so it can't be him.

[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.000]
No, nothing that big.

[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:17.820]
Have you seen that?

[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:18.240]
No.

[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.400]
I have the book because Randy Rhodes of all people

[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.660]
bought me a copy of Great Ex-Personal Expense

[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.880]
and the cover falls off of it and you can't put it back on that binder

[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.640]
because it's a piece of crap for 50 bucks.

[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.400]
And I just leave through that thing and I just keep asking myself

[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.640]
why would anybody, unless the most desperate,

[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.720]
I mean, I mean, so desperate they might like rub up against a tree.

[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.020]
Why would they buy that piece of crap?

[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.500]
Especially for 50 bucks.

[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.660]
Well, trees are hard to find.

[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.440]
That is true.

[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.140]
Trees are hard.

[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.000]
There's a land south floor.

[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.680]
To find, yes.

[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.120]
I think she's in there somewhere, isn't she?

[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.380]
She's in there in the tree.

[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:51.500]
In the book?

[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.580]
Who?

[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.080]
Randy.

[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.620]
Randy is in the book, yes.

[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.820]
In fact, she's, it's a, it's a, it may come as a shock to you,

[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.400]
but the person you think looks like Mark Clayton holding that thing, that's Randy.

[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.540]
Oh, wow.

[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.100]
Yeah.

[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.060]
Is this the shaved head?

[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.100]
The shaved head, that's Randy, okay?

[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:06.800]
And I'm talking to you.

[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.900]
She goes out to those doffin things.

[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:09.380]
Yeah.

[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.500]
And tailgate party, she puts on makeup, it takes her like a day to put on that appearance.

[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.760]
And then she like comes in here and she looks just like that picture.

[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.700]
There's some naked girl walking down the street, some were hitchhiking.

[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:19.160]
Right.

[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.220]
I'm glad I wasn't on the street that day.

[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.000]
It was kind of a scary picture because it was Madonna.

[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.740]
Oh, that was, she looks like that.

[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.920]
That's exactly what she's saying.

[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.360]
And the smell's bad.

[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.660]
In fact, there was an aroma all the way across the MacArthur Causeway that day.

[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.540]
Well, listen, have a real happy, sir, and don't look at that thing too close.

[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.960]
Or the book either.

[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.280]
Okay.

[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.400]
We have an open line in day, 751, one and brown, five, two, four, one on our, a sterile line.

[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.260]
I heard Rick and Sudge yesterday doing something that was kind of interesting and killed some good time.

[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.460]
Well, I wasn't really that interesting.

[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.880]
They were like doing what we do once in a while.

[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.260]
That is like pick different cities.

[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.580]
Now what happened to the map I had in here?

[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.580]
I see a whole bunch of stuff I had in here like just disappeared.

[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.100]
What happened to the Florida map?

[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.380]
You know, this place is unbelievable.

[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.280]
Why the hell would anybody steal a road map of Florida?

[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.080]
Or a road map of anywhere for that matter?

[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.260]
Where the hell did that go?

[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.060]
Somebody's been like cleaning house.

[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.080]
I think they took one of Bob Green's memos a little bit too seriously.

[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.860]
And I mean, the guys from Atlanta are not going to be looking inside the file cabinet, Roger.

[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.020]
I mean, I don't think we had to go through here and throw all my crap out.

[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.760]
Where the hell's my goddamn road map?

[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.300]
And so they were picking like some really exciting places like Newport, Richie,

[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.980]
which I didn't think was too original because there was like risking that Bill might call in,

[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.220]
but thank God it was somebody else.

[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.320]
We actually had a call from a mobile in Immaculate yesterday.

[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.560]
I knew we had made it big time when we got a call from a mobile in Immaculate.

[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:51.540]
I spoke to Tom Velvito this morning by the way for our big, our growing Tampa St. Pete Clearwater alludes audience.

[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.180]
And he's just happier than the picking slop.

[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.160]
I mean, this man is just ecstatic.

[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.860]
Now, why are you putting him on the air?

[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.740]
And why are you calling?

[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.660]
What is it? Why are you calling us today again?

[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.020]
Clyde.

[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.220]
What is it?

[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.920]
He's not there.

[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.000]
Clyde.

[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:12.860]
Clyde.

[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.000]
Did you, what happened to him?

[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.140]
Did he expire?

[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.460]
We can only hope so.

[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.640]
Was he on there?

[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.480]
Clyde from Cape Coral was on there.

[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.140]
Don't ever call us again and don't tie up our goddamn lines.

[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.200]
We hate you like poison.

[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.680]
You're chronic.

[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.200]
You're rolled in.

[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:26.780]
You're demented.

[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.580]
And you smell bad.

[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:29.460]
Huh?

[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:31.800]
What?

[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.020]
Tell Adam to call him.

[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.500]
You know, you are just out of control in there.

[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.060]
I'm trying to do a radio show here and all you care about is food.

[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.080]
And I feel great.

[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.000]
I want to thank Ron Font and the Terry from the Unicorn again,

[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.180]
the champion juicer.

[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.680]
You want to go out and get a juicer.

[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.520]
You go to a health food store and buy the champion.

[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.380]
Don't monkey around with these pieces of plastic with this plastic wrap.

[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.780]
That thing is so strong and it's got a motor.

[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.920]
You could put like a tree in that thing and wind up with juice.

[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.420]
I mean, it is, I wouldn't stick my finger in there for too long though.

[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.400]
Unless, you know, you want to lose one or two.

[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.680]
Unless you want to make a little pita bread sandwich with a bird.

[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.640]
You, the bird called Rick and said yesterday to, by the way,

[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.220]
we heard you.

[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.720]
You're not full of us, birdie.

[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.200]
Boy, holiday time.

[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.500]
Everybody's busy doing stuff.

[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.180]
Not the bird.

[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.860]
He's on there like twice in two days.

[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.360]
He's on here.

[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.960]
Boy, he sure misses us.

[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.360]
You know what?

[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.200]
He misses this place.

[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.500]
He'd like to pretend that he does miss all those free meals.

[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.180]
Oh, speaking of free meals, George wants Adam to call in immediately.

[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.120]
If you're in the truck, if you're in the van, if you're like in a,

[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.120]
anywhere, just pull off the road immediately and call.

[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.300]
Doesn't he have a cellular phone?

[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.660]
He does.

[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.820]
So why does he got to pull off the road to do that?

[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.720]
He's in the van.

[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.240]
Why is that?

[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.680]
The van has a cellular.

[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.420]
I don't think his Honda Civic does.

[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:48.960]
Why not?

[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.360]
What is he?

[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.200]
Some kind of a schlepper.

[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.360]
Don't have a cellular phone?

[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.520]
Come on, Adam.

[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.100]
You're a Jewish.

[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.200]
Let's get with it, baby.

[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.880]
Kind of a moron, are you?

[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.220]
He wants you to call a bat line immediately because he wants you to be a flunky.

[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.360]
He wants you to go over and pick up our salads at Sunnies.

[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.820]
Because the Sunnies not there today and Robbie's all alone as usual.

[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.120]
And they're delighted to make us some nice lunch today.

[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.460]
But there's nobody to bring it over here.

[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.380]
Why can't we find somebody in the building?

[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.640]
Now that Mitch Lewis has gone, we're really, oh, geez,

[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.180]
I knew he liked him for some reason.

[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.420]
If we see the deal was, seriously, if we'd get him some free lunch, he'd go pick it up.

[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.220]
He didn't have anything else to do anyway.

[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.000]
So he'd go pick it up.

[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.680]
We're going to miss Mitch Lewis.

[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.200]
You marked my words.

[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.080]
I'm not taking any shots at anybody else in the building.

[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.720]
But we're going to miss Mitch Lewis.

[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.380]
Trust me.

[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.980]
1023 on the IOD Network.

[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.940]
Coming up tonight at 8th, following Sports Dogs 610.

[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.260]
It's the Rendy Roadshow right here.

[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.500]
Rendy Rhyotee.

[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.780]
Sports, Quirk.

[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.200]
Sometimes I feel myself.

[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.620]
Oh, this is the worst day of my life.

[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.280]
Well, you seem kind of upset.

[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.280]
Oh, it's you.

[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.740]
Well, watch the trouble, honey.

[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.560]
It broke up with Don and Monthaca.

[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.740]
Started eating Tom.

[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:10.740]
Now I'm pregnant.

[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.400]
I don't even know who the father is.

[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.560]
Well, well, it sounds to me like you could use a bowl of home cooking soup.

[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.140]
Soup.

[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.460]
Didn't you hear what I said?

[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.300]
I'm pregnant.

[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.980]
Soup is not going to help you.

[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.200]
Well, when I knocked up your grandmother, the first thing I did was cook up a nice hot bowl of home soup.

[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.600]
You didn't knock up my grandmother.

[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.920]
We're not even related.

[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.780]
Well, that guy asked mom and dad.

[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.200]
They don't even know who you are.

[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:32.780]
Well, now.

[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.400]
How are you?

[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.080]
Anyway, who let you in here?

[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:35.480]
The door.

[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.100]
Why were you always hanging around pushing that damn soap?

[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.520]
Well, it's pretty good, too.

[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.040]
No, if you don't ring all the phone, you're dead.

[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:42.560]
What?

[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:42.740]

[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.500]
Can I finish my soap?

[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.820]
Nothing keeps them coming back like the great taste of home cooking soup.

[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.220]
That is a lunches shot.

[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.060]
1027 at WIOD.

[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.860]
So Mona Lisa delivery is going to be bringing us our lunch today, huh?

[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.300]
Little Alex.

[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.000]
Are they going to let him in there?

[00:16:59.200 --> 00:16:59.880]
God, almighty.

[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.920]
I'm not going to get started.

[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.580]
Don't look a freby in the mouth.

[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.900]
We have an open line in Broward, 5249463.

[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.740]
Let's do Hollywood.

[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.240]
Hello.

[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.040]
Hello, Neil.

[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.140]
Happy New Year, sir.

[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.760]
Right, Neil.

[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.380]
Yes?

[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.620]
I want to make this short.

[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.940]
I said happy New Year.

[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.940]
Is this the same sour push that called yesterday?

[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:16.360]
No.

[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.600]
That wants to ruin our holidays.

[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.060]
It is.

[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.360]
It's that same old disgusting part that called yesterday.

[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.280]
No, no, no.

[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.440]
That hates me like poison.

[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.840]
And why are you listening to the show?

[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:24.200]
Neil.

[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.700]
Why are you listening again, sir?

[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.800]
Neil, this is the first time I ever called you.

[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.280]
Like I said, happy New Year.

[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.020]
Likewise.

[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:30.920]
Okay.

[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.020]
Can I tell you my story?

[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.160]
You sound like your same old part that called yesterday.

[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:34.880]
Short and sweet.

[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.800]
That's why we like it.

[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.020]
That's me, short and sweet.

[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.360]
Every day in my face, cool.

[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.780]
You regard to the same Cuban as who I picked up as face.

[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.620]
Get out of here.

[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.920]
Call the light, Paul Boca.

[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.740]
Go put a rock through Keynes' window or something.

[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.620]
Get out of our face.

[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.260]
See what I mean?

[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.940]
Why do these old people insist on trying to turn this into geriatric radio?

[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.460]
Call up FLA and tap them.

[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.840]
They'll talk to you for half an hour.

[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:55.640]
Give them the number.

[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.200]
Let them talk to Mark Larson.

[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.640]
And be sure to use a lot of right-wing lingo in there, like Feminazi.

[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.840]
Mention that several times.

[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.600]
God Almighty.

[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.480]
We don't want to talk to you, Sir.

[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.660]
It's not that we don't like you.

[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.420]
You may be a hell of a guy all the way down it.

[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.520]
You sound like a condo commando to me.

[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.980]
So the juicer is great.

[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.300]
I'm telling you, man, I feel so much better.

[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.440]
I'm full of piss and vinegar.

[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.080]
I am just got energy that hasn't been invented yet.

[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.040]
What's wrong with that?

[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.460]
There's nothing wrong with that.

[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.420]
It's just an old saying.

[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.200]
They were stating the pilgrim said that.

[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.260]
As they sat down for the first Thanksgiving feast,

[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.280]
they probably all said that.

[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.580]
Boy, I got so much energy from eating that bird.

[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.040]
I'm just full of...

[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.280]
Here's North Miami.

[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:36.680]
Hello.

[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.560]
Neil.

[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.540]
Good morning.

[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.180]
How you doing?

[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.060]
So I do like that old fart that wants to call and turn this into a ethnic...

[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.500]
I mean, it's the day before the last day of the year,

[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.020]
and two days before the new year, and everybody's happy and getting their party papers out.

[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:51.740]
Happy New Year to you, Sir.

[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.260]
Damn it.

[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.140]
You blew that guy off from where's that coral, something that corals his name?

[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.360]
Thank God.

[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.660]
No, what is his name?

[00:18:59.100 --> 00:18:59.460]
Calvin.

[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.120]
Clyde.

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.920]
Clyde.

[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.560]
Clyde.

[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.000]
Oh my God.

[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.080]
I heard him.

[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.680]
I thought I was going to fall into a corner.

[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.400]
It took me an hour to get the show going again after we hit him on there.

[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.180]
And now you only mean I kept him on it because I thought he was going to croak on the year,

[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.620]
and I think this time he may have.

[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.820]
You notice there was nothing there.

[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.100]
This guy, he just blew off.

[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.360]
I saw the thing with Steve Kane yesterday, didn't he?

[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.000]
I had to laugh.

[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.600]
I missed that.

[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.200]
Thank God.

[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.140]
No wonder I'm in a good mood, but I came in this morning,

[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.980]
and I'd ride your clip, the article out, and they three-pound rocket

[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.300]
to pass on your side of Radio Talk Show hostique Kane's borrowed Toyota Corolla.

[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:28.920]
Borrowed.

[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.500]
What does that mean?

[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.680]
Well, I got bad aim.

[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.240]
I'm sorry.

[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.940]
Shattered the wind shield and showered his three-year-old daughter's car seat with glass

[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:36.240]
splinters.

[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.200]
Of course, she wasn't in there.

[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.940]
What scary is we almost brought her along, he said.

[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.180]
She would have been blinded.

[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:41.780]
Oh, man.

[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.200]
Yeah, but of course, she wasn't in there.

[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.440]
And the reason she wasn't in there is probably because it happened in the parking lot next

[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.340]
to the station.

[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.280]
He just picked it up and put it in there and then, oh, let's call the press.

[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.820]
Let's get some press on his.

[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.820]
Listen, I got to call you and thank you.

[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.620]
I went out and rented Steve.

[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.920]
Anytime you mention a movie.

[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:04.220]
I have two things in life that I have the best taste in the world in.

[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.600]
One is movies and two is bodies.

[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.120]
Okay.

[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.040]
Male, female, and Rodgers and between.

[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.780]
When I see something that looks hot, believe me when I tell you it's universal.

[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.720]
And the same with movies, it's universal.

[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.320]
Like Dracula, that was universal.

[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.380]
These people that haven't seen Orlando, I don't think they know.

[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.320]
They don't know what life is all about if they haven't at least gone up and pated them

[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.400]
on the arm and said, hey, that's a nice jacket.

[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.180]
Can that be felt?

[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.180]
He's a good looking guy.

[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.700]
He's not a good looking guy.

[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.580]
He is God-like.

[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.340]
And listen, this guy that called you yesterday, state of grace.

[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.840]
Oh, and look at who's on, look at who's on Regis this morning.

[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.300]
That's what's her name from not slanting.

[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.200]
What is her name, George?

[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.820]
The blonde, oh, geez, what's her name?

[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:46.260]
No Phillips.

[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:46.680]
Who?

[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.700]
Michelle Phillips, right.

[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.540]
Boy, she looks bad.

[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.180]
This guy called it and told you to rent state of grace.

[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.220]
Don't waste your time.

[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.020]
It's stuck.

[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.240]
It really does.

[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.100]
It sounded like a sued kind of a man.

[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.260]
But I'm going to tell you a movie that you're poo-pooing, that you really should see.

[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.740]
It's got everything in it for everybody.

[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:01.540]
A few good men.

[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.520]
Basic instinct.

[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.440]
It really is a good movie.

[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.540]
Basic instinct.

[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.720]
It's got Michael Douglas.

[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.200]
Oh, you don't want to see Michael Douglas naked again.

[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:10.580]
I can't.

[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.880]
He looks like Ron Jirami.

[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.020]
Man, he's got too much hair.

[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.000]
I don't want to see him naked.

[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.920]
I don't want to see Harry Ugly guys naked and rolling around and riding in bed the whole movie.

[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.340]
No, no, no.

[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.580]
You won't see him rolling around.

[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.600]
He doesn't make the movie.

[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.820]
He doesn't make the movie.

[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.720]
The movie is great.

[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.380]
I want you to watch the Godfather 3 this weekend.

[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.080]
Yes.

[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.260]
And I had to watch Francis Ford Coppola's daughter and all these other people.

[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.220]
Don't tell me that that wasn't a good movie.

[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.200]
But it was a great movie.

[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:35.660]

[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.720]
So you got overlooker nose.

[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.020]
That's like overlooking Dave Games' body when he's blocking out the crime scene.

[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:42.800]
I'm saying it was sick.

[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.180]
So you don't look Michael Douglas's ass.

[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:44.820]
That's all.

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.140]
And just the movie is great.

[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:46.580]
Okay.

[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.680]
It's got something for everybody.

[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.080]
Well, I got to confess that the other one was really great.

[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.200]
Fatal attraction.

[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:51.960]
That was a great movie.

[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.320]
And then you mentioned a shattered.

[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.520]
I saw that a long time ago.

[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.080]
I'm a baringer.

[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.060]
That was a good movie.

[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.560]
But how come the voice was the same?

[00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.680]
Am I nitpicking now?

[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.500]
No, yeah.

[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.880]
I knew I knew I knew what I figured that movie out of when he wrecked the car.

[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:05.680]
I figured that movie out of the car.

[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.200]
I didn't.

[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.620]
I mean, when I pulled that body out from underneath that tank of mong and a ship.

[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.200]
Yeah, I knew what it was.

[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.200]
And it was his face.

[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:11.580]
I know.

[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.560]
It kind of shattered me for me.

[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.080]
And I thought, what the hell is this all about?

[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.220]
But I'm going to tell you if you.

[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.860]
The good actor in that movie though was the animal guy.

[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.900]
The former private detective.

[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:25.860]
That guy was funny.

[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.500]
He was a good actor.

[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.040]
You like Basic Instinct.

[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.840]
You go go rent it and then come back on.

[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.800]
And I don't care what birdie says over there in Lakeland.

[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.400]
A kiss before dying with Matt Dillon happens to be a pretty damn good movie.

[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:37.660]

[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.660]
Pretty bizarre.

[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.680]
And I hate Matt Dillon.

[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.840]
He makes me nauseous.

[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.820]
A kiss before dying?

[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.120]
Right.

[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:43.760]
I have to run out.

[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.260]
Which is a remake of an old Robert Wagner movie I'm told.

[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.540]
But it's a very good flick.

[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.320]
And listen, I want to thank you for one more.

[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:49.680]
Wait a minute.

[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.420]
It says, why does Gerardo grant women to take off their shoes?

[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.120]
Oh, God.

[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.960]
Can that be felt?

[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.500]
Now go ahead.

[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.460]
Thank you for getting rid of the bird and have a new year.

[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.440]
And have a great life.

[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:00.680]
Audio.

[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.640]
Is that how you pronounce it?

[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.500]
Or is it Harado?

[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.060]
Huh?

[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:06.720]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.380]
Huh?

[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:08.480]
Gerardo?

[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.540]
Is that it?

[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.720]
Well, I don't know how you people.

[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:14.860]
You people.

[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.060]
I feel like Ross Perona.

[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.740]
Now you people, I don't know how you people pronounce your name.

[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.680]
It's like the mayor that heartless, cool, obnoxious mayor.

[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.600]
One day it's Javier and one day it's Xavier.

[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.880]
What the hell is your name anyway?

[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.700]
Besides heartless and cruel and indifferent and obnoxious.

[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.740]
And so Bob Green tells me that Javier Xavier Suarez

[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.400]
spent like a half hour on the phone with him,

[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.780]
sucking around and trying to convince him

[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.500]
that he'd be ecstatic to come on.

[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.060]
He'll show any time that Neil wants.

[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.900]
We don't have any guests on this show.

[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.100]
Much less any heartless, cruel, obnoxious political horrors.

[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.340]
Like Javier Xavier, whatever his name is.

[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.520]
It cares, it cares, it's for girls.

[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.580]
Anyway, 1034 on the famous, on the growing rapidly

[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.260]
and their love in it, IOD Network.

[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.920]
Catch the latest news from the 610 WIOD News Center each hour.

[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.160]
Plus an update on traffic and the current weather forecast.

[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.320]
WIOD.

[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.260]
I am an imbasaur.

[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.000]
It was on a Saturday morning at exactly 904.

[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.280]
But nothing could prepare me with a knock on Riley's door.

[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:25.560]
He was rousing, he was grumpy, and in that need of a shave,

[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.700]
he was just about to put a cad into the microwave.

[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.340]
I asked him to step back through many cities.

[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.300]
He didn't care, he was reading the sunset,

[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.660]
no, he was underware.

[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.060]
I looked above the toilet where the towels used to be.

[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.460]
And there was fix to crucifix a fix for all to see.

[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.020]
I didn't seek salvation.

[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.040]
I had come to mold alone.

[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:03.880]
But I found Jesus in Rick Riley's jaw.

[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.820]
Yes, brother, Rick, he changed my life up on that big mold.

[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.420]
They just by the time I washed my hands, I'd washed my sins away.

[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.980]
Now I'll learn to be intolerant.

[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.400]
I'll wash padropper, and sun, and I'll go for a pad.

[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.360]
You can't even even visit a rug.

[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.040]
I'll pretend to be a hipster.

[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.560]
But my liberal days are gone.

[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:38.860]
Because I found Jesus in Rick Riley's jaw.

[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.200]
But...

[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.940]
Kind of like my my.

[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.940]
1039, kind of an ethnic version of my my.

[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:52.580]
Look out now.

[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.460]
Open line of dates, 751, and the star line.

[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.740]
If you got Bell's Authentic Mobility,

[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.800]
Michelle Phillips looks like she's 100 years old.

[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.020]
She looks like the mamas and the poppers.

[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.800]
Oh, God, does she look old.

[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.560]
But hey, she don't have to worry about it too much longer because we know

[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.640]
Nats is going off and LA law is going off.

[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.660]
You can only milk a good thing so long and then it runs dry.

[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.040]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:12.460]
Hello.

[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.420]
Hi, me.

[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.380]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:14.900]
Oh, good.

[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.700]
Happy New Year.

[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:15.840]
Happy New Year.

[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.000]
And the same.

[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:19.360]
Good.

[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.420]
I'm real excited to call you because I too bought my champion

[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.620]
juicer unicorn village a few weeks ago.

[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.660]
It was my, well, I guess my Hanukkah resolution.

[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.180]
Really?

[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.300]
Healthier, yeah.

[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.220]
And what I'm doing is in the morning, I stopped drinking coffee.

[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.600]
I gave up coffee and I of course needed to pick me up.

[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.880]
So I drink carrot juice in the morning and I put an apple in it.

[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.820]
So it's really sweet and I get so much energy from it.

[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.400]
It's incredible.

[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.100]
Really?

[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.460]
Sounds like you're about to burst right through the phone.

[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:47.920]
Me too.

[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.060]
I've been waiting so I'm getting energized.

[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.460]
I have, I feel so much better in a week and a half.

[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.580]
And I'm sure people think that it's a scam.

[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.380]
I have no reason to say that because I've had a crappy

[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.600]
year as far as health.

[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.220]
I mean, ordinarily, I'm not that all on mediocre health.

[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.220]
But I feel like I've just been born again if I can say that.

[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.860]
Well, I know what you mean because I went to a coffee with

[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.140]
Dorault and it was really hard giving up coffee.

[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.440]
And I needed that cup of coffee every, every single morning.

[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:14.720]
Yeah.

[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.480]
So I didn't know what to do for two weeks.

[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.400]
I lagged.

[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.980]
And then when I went to unicorn one day, they were making the

[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.120]
carrot juice and I was dragging.

[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.200]
And that's about two o'clock making it.

[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:23.880]
You were dragging it?

[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:24.500]
Yeah.

[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.260]
Dragged and drugged out.

[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.000]
So I had a little cup and on the sun, I had energy.

[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:30.700]
So I had more.

[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.660]
And then I was flying.

[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.620]
So I said, OK, let me try it.

[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.640]
So now every morning I have it.

[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.240]
So it's healthy.

[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.640]
I get my vitamin A, my name is Patrick.

[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.320]
Got mom, you up like a snare drum.

[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.220]
I mean, you're just like an alarm clock.

[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:41.480]
Right.

[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.480]
I mean, it's more than coffee.

[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.460]
It's almost too much.

[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.000]
Right.

[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.740]
Then I also, a friend of mine, turned me on to, and this is

[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.960]
what I really wanted to tell you.

[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.860]
I freeze my fruit.

[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.880]
And I slice up my fruit.

[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.580]
You freeze your fruit.

[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.480]
I freeze my fruit.

[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.400]
I take mango and I slice it.

[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.060]
You know, that's what they did at Disney World

[00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.060]
as a matter of fact.

[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.160]
They froze their fruit.

[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.780]
Oh, I'm sorry, Walt.

[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.000]
So I freeze mango.

[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.400]
I freeze strawberries.

[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.840]
First I wash them.

[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.480]
Then I cut them up, put them in a baggie.

[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:11.600]
Put in my freezer.

[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.500]
I freeze the bananas.

[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:12.980]
I have to go.

[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.360]
Wouldn't that be a great show at Miami arena

[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.260]
Disney on ice?

[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:16.900]
Frozen fruit?

[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:17.680]
Yeah.

[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.380]
Well, he's frozen.

[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.160]
I didn't think about that.

[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:21.900]
Every time.

[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.960]
And don't you know that that Walt Disney is like frozen?

[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.040]
Yeah, he, oh, right.

[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.780]
He did that cryogenic to whatever they call that.

[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.020]
And he's like frozen so that when they have the big

[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.560]
remedy in 7000, yes.

[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.200]
Wow.

[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.140]
When you got the big bucks, they freeze your ass.

[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.340]
And then he'll come out one day.

[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.200]
Just his ass, right?

[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.900]
He'll be walking.

[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.700]
Among us.

[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.940]
His ass will be walking around.

[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.180]
Not the rest of them just his ass and look kind of strange,

[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.040]
but we'll know who it is.

[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.380]
With all the other frozen fruit.

[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:47.800]
Right.

[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.060]
There's a lot of it up there in Orlando.

[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.520]
Yeah, I'm sure that's why I'm not there.

[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.820]
I guarantee that there's a lot of frozen fruit in Orlando.

[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:55.900]
No, good.

[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.240]
But anyway, I'm glad you're doing well.

[00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:58.920]
And I'm excited.

[00:28:59.220 --> 00:28:59.380]
Yes.

[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:03.120]
I like my frozen fruit in the champion juicer.

[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:03.540]
Yeah.

[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.560]
And you put a little thing.

[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.240]
There's a little thing that comes on bottom.

[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:06.660]

[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.460]
I don't think I'd want to put my little thing in the champion juicer.

[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.100]
I'll tell you that.

[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:10.420]
No.

[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:10.620]
No.

[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:11.360]
No.

[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:11.660]

[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.040]
No.

[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.100]

[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:12.760]
No.

[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:12.880]

[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.120]
No.

[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.760]
Oh, god.

[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.600]
That thing, when you turn that switch on, you better be prepared for the world of

[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:18.740]
COVID.

[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:19.960]
Oh, no.

[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.940]
Oh, it's great.

[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.760]
I don't think anything could ever happen to that machine.

[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.140]
No.

[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.300]
Like you said, you could put a tree in it.

[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.260]
But you know, I was just talking around front of a minute ago and he told me that you

[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.200]
have to put a drop of oil on that thing.

[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.980]
Oh, you better.

[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.640]
Because otherwise, I didn't one day and the next day I could hardly get it off.

[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.960]
You have to oil it so that it comes off and slides.

[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.620]
Otherwise, I had to get a plier and a screwdriver and pull it off.

[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.500]
So it's good.

[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.500]
And it works every time.

[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.200]
Okay.

[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:46.800]
Every time.

[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.820]
That's a good lesson for everybody in the audience.

[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.140]
Oil it every time.

[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.060]
Have a great new year.

[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.880]
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.260]
Yes.

[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:53.960]
I finished my recipe.

[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.860]
Oh, god.

[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.020]
I got 8,000 people waiting here and you're hacking a China with juice recipes.

[00:29:59.340 --> 00:29:59.600]
No fat.

[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:00.700]
No fat.

[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.260]
It's delicious.

[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.440]
I put all the fruit in.

[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.060]
It comes out like a French fruit sorbet with no sweet or no honey, nothing.

[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.320]
Right.

[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.100]
This is fruit.

[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:08.800]
Say goodbye.

[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.260]
Have a good new year.

[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:10.860]
Bye-bye.

[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.360]
I was right, George.

[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:13.720]
Two open lines.

[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.740]
They're both in Dade.

[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:16.640]
7519463.

[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.600]
I think we've gotten ourselves into a real delima.

[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:19.560]
Here's Tampa.

[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.020]
Hello.

[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.060]
Hello, Neil.

[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:21.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.860]
Neil, first of all, the first time caller.

[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.400]
Well, I appreciate that.

[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.100]
I hope you have a great new year and during the new year, one of the things you should

[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.440]
resolve to do is get a new phone.

[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:30.560]
Why?

[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.680]
It sounds too bad over the phone.

[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.480]
It sounds like you got a sock over it.

[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:38.220]
It sounds like you have two R-guile socks all rolled up and rolled over the phone over

[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.660]
your instrument.

[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.820]
Well, you know what I'm talking to you over a back machine.

[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.760]
But is that it?

[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.260]
Yeah.

[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.460]
Because it sounds like you have a real muffled apparatus.

[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.240]
All right.

[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.460]
Well, next time I call, I won't use this phone.

[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.160]
Please don't.

[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.760]
Hey, can I recommend a book to you to go along with your juicer?

[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:53.200]
Yes.

[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.020]
It's called Fit for Life.

[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:55.820]
Have you read that?

[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.640]
I have that book.

[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.260]
I used to have Harvey and Marilyn Diamond on my show all the time back in the days when

[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.540]
I had boring guests on, yes.

[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:01.980]
Okay.

[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.140]
I had the book.

[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.260]
In fact, I got it out again a couple of weeks ago.

[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.440]
It's when I got into this kick.

[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.120]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.100]
Because I'll tell you what.

[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.820]
I tried that at dieting after about two weeks once the kick's in.

[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:12.360]
Yeah.

[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.720]
It was scary how much weight you lose off that.

[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.140]
Really?

[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:15.860]
Yeah.

[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:16.300]
Yeah.

[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:17.880]
Let me tell you that.

[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.820]
Of course, you lose a lot of weight because you spent all your time on the throne all day.

[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.980]
That's why you lose a lot of weight.

[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.540]
There you go.

[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:22.900]
Yeah.

[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.800]
There you go.

[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.120]
Right.

[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.560]
Couldn't have said it better myself.

[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.240]
There you go.

[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.120]
Well, let me.

[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.540]
And go and go.

[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.360]
And never stop going.

[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.860]
Let me say this.

[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.600]
I was a long time FLA listener.

[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.100]
Yes.

[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:42.660]
And every now and then I get this urge of loyalty to them and I try to listen to them, but

[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.280]
I can't.

[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.220]
Pretty damn boring, is it?

[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.640]
It's pretty damn boring.

[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.520]
I don't know what.

[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:50.620]
Larsen's topic today is the best and worst of 90, 91.

[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.340]
Oh, that's original.

[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:51.940]
Yeah.

[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.660]
Let's have the year-end review, the best and the worst, the highlights, the low lights.

[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.400]
Oh, God.

[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.120]
That's a one thing about this time of the year.

[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.420]
You know, the year is gone.

[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.220]
Forget it already.

[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:00.920]
It's in the past.

[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.560]
Stop living in the past and let's move onward and upward and win a Super Bowl and hell

[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.240]
with everything else.

[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:05.800]
Right?

[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.500]
And I do all you a great big thanks because you did the program.

[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.080]
I was brainwashed by Russell Limbo.

[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.140]
I even bought his book.

[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:15.620]
Yeah.

[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:21.220]
That's why he does that ditto crap because he's like the Hermann Gehring of radio here.

[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:25.580]
He just wants to brainwash everybody and whatever he says, oh, ditto, ditto, you're so right.

[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.540]
He's full of crap.

[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:27.340]
He's obnoxious.

[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:27.900]
He's dangerous.

[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:32.260]
He's disgusting and he's fat and gross and have a happy new year and get a new phone.

[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:32.800]
Okay.

[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.400]
Thank you.

[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.500]
I have an open line in Broward 5242.

[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.020]
To invade, on-hurt of two open lines in date, air of New Year's Eve.

[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.600]
And we have two open lines in date.

[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.360]
I can't get over it.

[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.640]
751 and one in Estero and one in Corkscrew.

[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.720]
You know that we had a whole bunch of calls from people who got stranded in Corkscrew yesterday.

[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.380]
Not.

[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.400]
Corkscrew.

[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.460]
Come on, I guarantee you.

[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.400]
What we'd like to do is have somebody drive out with a cellular phone into the swap

[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.400]
land in Corkscrew and call.

[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.620]
Don't make it up.

[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.300]
Don't like call from Immaculate and say you're in Corkscrew.

[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.180]
Because we'll trace it.

[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.200]
Call from the swamps of Corkscrew.

[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.880]
That would be a great pay phone challenge for Marvin.

[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.800]
Send his ass out there in the swamp.

[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.680]
North Miami.

[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.060]
Hello.

[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:19.860]
Neil.

[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:20.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.560]
What's happening here?

[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.100]
How are you today?

[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.240]
I'm tremendous today.

[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:23.760]
Hey, Neil.

[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:24.460]
Question.

[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.760]
Anything about those keywords that still be earthquake?

[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:27.560]
Yeah.

[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.080]
What's your opinion on that?

[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.460]
We have all three lines open in date County.

[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.260]
751, 9463.

[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.440]
He must be related to the old guy in Hollywood that called.

[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:35.820]
You know what?

[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.040]
What's going on in date today?

[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.600]
They have a little grab ass festival out in the streets today.

[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:40.920]
A little havana or something?

[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.380]
There's something going on that we don't know about.

[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.660]
That never happens in date.

[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.060]
Ever.

[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.520]
I mean, never happens in date.

[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.540]
Maybe the guy over in Miami shores at the phone office is

[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.980]
poaching with those lines today, huh?

[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.260]
He's got his finger in it.

[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.260]
1047 on the IOD Network.

[00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:00.100]
Join us this afternoon beginning at two for those wild and crazy guys.

[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.000]
Rick and Suts.

[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.860]
And at six, it's sports dogs six ten.

[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.320]
Come on you IOT.

[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:06.920]
Hold on.

[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.220]
Where do you think the...

[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:09.560]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.400]
I just do something wrong.

[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:10.980]
Wait a second.

[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.520]
Oh, this phone is all screwed up.

[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.120]
Did I call off our only date call?

[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:14.880]
Hello?

[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:15.840]
You're still there?

[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.780]
I'm still here.

[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.620]
I tried like hell to cut you off there, but I couldn't do it.

[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.340]
Well, I'm still here, Neil.

[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:21.860]
Great.

[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:28.320]
I want to not try to convince you, but just give you my opinion respectfully in regards to

[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.200]
the tourists and the tourist industry here in South Florida.

[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.360]
What is going on with you people today?

[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.500]
Why are you also damn serious?

[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.860]
Why are you also morbid?

[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:38.220]
You get...

[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.360]
I felt great today.

[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:43.320]
I actually saw a little Bob Green today patting him on the head, had a great chat.

[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.520]
Everything is wonderful.

[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:49.680]
And you're like all I want to talk about the Cubans on the plane and about the depression

[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.940]
and the recession and the Russians and the H-bombs.

[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.040]
What's going on here today?

[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.160]
Well, I can't explain things for everybody else, but...

[00:34:59.160 --> 00:34:59.500]
Why not?

[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.780]
I'm doing the best I can just trying to understand and explain things for me.

[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.680]
Understand what?

[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:07.900]
Well, the...

[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.220]
What's to understand, pal?

[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.480]
Just forget about understanding.

[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.460]
See, you're getting into one of these pseudo-intellectual modes.

[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.920]
You can't understand because the world is a madhouse.

[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.320]
Man, forget about understanding.

[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.760]
Just go have a good time, have a happy new year and that's it.

[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.480]
Well, but...

[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.160]
And don't inhale.

[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.600]
I don't inhale.

[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.560]
But we're in a community of...

[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.480]
I'm not talking about smoke.

[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.620]
I'm talking about oxygen.

[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.660]
Yeah, well...

[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.800]
You're in a community of what?

[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:38.580]
We're in a community of intertwined relationships of people, associated with the election

[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.040]
of a community.

[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:40.980]
Yeah?

[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:41.620]
No.

[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.400]
So intertwined human relationships.

[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.200]
Excellent.

[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.480]
You sound like Ed Till.

[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.760]
I don't know who I'm talking about.

[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.160]
Let's talk about intertwined human relationships.

[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.840]
And by the way, do you have a syntax?

[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.620]
A syntax.

[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.480]
Is that a stock?

[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.580]
Come on, let's go.

[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:57.600]
So...

[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.240]
What's the bottom line to all this rattle rousing craper yours?

[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:01.800]
What is it?

[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.260]
Okay.

[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:08.120]
I believe that we're in a tourist town over here.

[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.520]
And a tourist.

[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:10.300]

[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.140]
A tourist.

[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:11.460]

[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.440]
Well, it's a tourist.

[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:12.700]
Yes.

[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.020]
But tourist.

[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.880]
And if we are the people, because I am...

[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.960]
We as the people.

[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:19.740]
We as the people.

[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.400]
Because I'm a fan of...

[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.380]
In order to form a...

[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.320]
Perfect onion.

[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.160]
Crying onion.

[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:25.680]
But...

[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.940]
I'm going to write a cry from this call.

[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:28.560]
I'll tell you that.

[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.240]
What is it you want to say?

[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:30.620]
Come on.

[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.060]
People are waiting on these phones.

[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.260]
They have a busy day.

[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.100]
It's New Year's time.

[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:34.880]
What is it?

[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.120]
If we would treat the tourists better.

[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.200]
Like what?

[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.720]
Well, I know what you're saying.

[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.080]
Send them back where they came from.

[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.660]
Screw these freeload and assholes.

[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.140]
Man, most of the people are coming down here.

[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.580]
A bunch of cheap skates anyway.

[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.860]
They rent like a little tiny Ugo.

[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:48.880]
And they go out there in the road.

[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.640]
Six miles an hour in the left hand lane.

[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.820]
And they go in a restaurant.

[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.520]
And they tip about one and a half percent.

[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.100]
And they stink and they smell bad in their ugly.

[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.140]
I'll never.

[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:57.720]
How much?

[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:57.980]
God.

[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.300]
I understand that.

[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.080]
And I believe that.

[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.060]
And I see that.

[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:03.940]
People that live here.

[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.820]
If the tourists that come down here are like young and hot-looking.

[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.260]
And they put out and want a good time.

[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.020]
And we'll leave big tips and restaurants.

[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.680]
And drive real, yuppie-type cars like a 325i.

[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.440]
Then we invite them to come back.

[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.320]
Otherwise, stay home.

[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.620]
I think I summed it up right there.

[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.060]
Oh, geez.

[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.280]
And I just screwed up big time.

[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.100]
Don't tell me we're going to have another day of technical incompetence here.

[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.360]
Today's show is brought to you by Sika.

[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.120]
Sika, how many of you guys are going?

[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.940]
And now back to our show.

[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.560]
I don't think anybody's going to hear this.

[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.080]
Her name is Sika, not Sika.

[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:38.640]
Huh?

[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.280]
Sika this.

[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.660]
Her name is not Sika.

[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.600]
I mean, here's the guy who's doing a bit on rock comedy.

[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.980]
You don't even know how to pronounce the name.

[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.800]
We have two open lines in date.

[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.380]
I told you this is going to be a bitch today.

[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.240]
And who's that guy that keeps calling you on 10?

[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.280]
And what happened to the guy who was calling from Alabama or wherever that was?

[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.700]
Did you, is that the guy?

[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.340]
Or Mississippi?

[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.520]
That same guy again called before.

[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.600]
That's the one I picked up.

[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.080]
Sir, let me say it again.

[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:04.960]
We love you.

[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.920]
We hope you have a great new year and a great life.

[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.580]
W-I-O-D, crankline.

[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:09.980]
Uh, yeah.

[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.340]
Who's this guy?

[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.000]
Which guy?

[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.180]
George is this guy?

[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.300]
No, this is not the guy.

[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.660]
Were you calling us from, sir?

[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.080]
Uh, Boca Raton.

[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.100]
Boca, well, that's not very exciting.

[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.460]
Who's this, Neil?

[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:22.920]
Yeah.

[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:30.080]
I mean, when we pick up these green lines, we expect here like El Joe Bean and uh, Riverview and Riverside and uh,

[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.300]
Estero Island and exciting places.

[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.820]
Well, what can I tell you?

[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.940]
Not much, but you can't help but that you're in Boca.

[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:37.720]
It's not your fault.

[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.400]
This is true.

[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.100]
Anyway, Neil, I'm a first-time caller.

[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:40.540]
Great.

[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:41.700]
And uh...

[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.660]
Happy New Year to you, sir.

[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:43.820]
Yeah, thanks to you.

[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:50.680]
I wanted to let you know that uh, the other day I was uh, taking a run down the beach and I was wearing some headphones that's listening to you.

[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.060]
Yeah?

[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.440]
You had the runs on the beach?

[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:58.040]
And uh, I was just laughing because you make me laugh.

[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:58.880]
Oh, that's you.

[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.440]
And people must have thought I was nuts.

[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:07.180]
I'm very wise because uh, here I have this big smile and I'm laughing run down the beach.

[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:07.460]
Yeah.

[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.240]
And uh, basically just want to give you a compliment.

[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:10.880]
Great show.

[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.100]
Well, hallelujah, man.

[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:12.800]
That's the idea.

[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.940]
Have a great new year and you're okay in our book.

[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:15.680]
Back out here.

[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.660]
And through those people.

[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:17.480]
See you later, man.

[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.040]
Have a great life.

[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.260]
See, that's the idea.

[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.320]
We're here to have a good time.

[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.020]
We're not here to solve the problems of the world.

[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.840]
We have to like, I guess since it's the 30th of December, it's almost the end of the year.

[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:31.180]
And we got to like a whole lot of new listeners like seven or eight of them in Fort Myers and three or four of them in Tampa, St. Pete.

[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.200]
Uh, we ought to explain that.

[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.540]
This show is radio talk shows do not solve problems.

[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.120]
They do not change the world.

[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.460]
They do not change human nature.

[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.180]
They are not going to change a save mankind from itself.

[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.280]
They're not going to make the world into a better place.

[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.780]
They're not going to save us from being a goddamn slaughterhouse.

[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.300]
They're not going to uh, prevent all the intolerance.

[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.540]
In fact, many of the shows promoted.

[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.880]
I don't want to mention large ass again.

[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.540]
It's just that it's just there.

[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.540]
They're just there.

[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.120]
They are just part of the money making apparatus.

[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.880]
If I can say that word called broadcasting, that's right.

[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:07.340]
They're just a vehicle through which we can suck you in to come on a year and talk and buy our stuff and to help us make some money.

[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.600]
And how give you a couple of laughs.

[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.100]
That's what I'm here for.

[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.080]
And we're not going to let them, I'm not going to permit a bunch of old crusty uh,

[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.260]
farts who are wearing underwear with three layers of crust in it.

[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.940]
We're not going to let you call in here and destroy our good time.

[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.420]
We want to have a good time.

[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.800]
Even if we're having a bad time, we're having a good time.

[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.560]
And because we're having a W-I-O-D, we're usually having, oh, it's speaking of Molo.

[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:31.800]
Mouimolo.

[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.000]
That should be the name of that show.

[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.240]
Mouimolo.

[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.480]
Uh, I turned on Hot 105, our new sister station this morning.

[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.960]
Oh, I love Stephanie Brownfield.

[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:41.620]
We love you Stephanie.

[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.740]
Don't take it personally.

[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:44.260]
My, my.

[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.980]
But uh, that Molo.

[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:50.020]
God, he is just, and uh, rumor has it that that show is going to be a history pretty soon.

[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.520]
That just made that up myself.

[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.760]
I don't know if that's true or not.

[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.340]
I don't want to get anybody insecure over there.

[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:01.480]
So he was talking about the thing they're doing, the campaign about bringing your gun to the police.

[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.020]
And we'll give you a certificate and redeem it at W-I-O-D and all this other crap.

[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.700]
And he goes into this thing about, when I, when you take it in the police station,

[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.580]
make sure you're presented in the right way because they may not be exactly sure what you're up to.

[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:19.300]
In other words, don't take your 45 and like wave it around and stick it in the cup on the desk space.

[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.220]
Like maybe you might be threatening, okay?

[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.260]
Like you might get a real back at your response.

[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.580]
At a boy, Molo, you're on top of it, baby.

[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.780]
See you on the unemployment line.

[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.320]
Because we're going to be there pretty soon.

[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.980]
But at Bob Greenman, he is just uh, something.

[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.560]
He is a little firebrand.

[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.940]
He hopped up and down on that desk in there today and jumped around, did like a little cartwheel and said, Happy New Year.

[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.480]
Look like a Rumpel Stiltskin in heat.

[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.780]
Here's a mobile and clear water.

[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.560]
Hey, Neil.

[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.120]
Yes sir. Happy New Year, pal.

[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.440]
Happy New Year to you too.

[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.520]
Thank you so much.

[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:53.380]
Um, I can get some of y'all we're talking about yesterday, but they're reading.

[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.540]
They're reading it there?

[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:55.000]
Yeah.

[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.100]
I can't have been there, but have you ever gone to a black arc game?

[00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:58.980]
No, I have not.

[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:00.860]
Uh, try and leave that place at night.

[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:06.440]
I've been in the old Olympia though and Detroit and I tell you try to leave that place in the daytime is not a pleasant proposition,

[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.720]
which is why they moved out of there.

[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.300]
Yeah, an oblivious.

[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:09.580]
Yeah.

[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:14.540]
But if you're a real fan, man, you'll put up with getting shot a couple of times and mugged and the raped and stuff.

[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.360]
I mean, that's just the part of the Yabal game.

[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.400]
Yeah, gotta do it.

[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:17.920]
You gotta do.

[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.620]
That's right.

[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.560]
Oh, I have a good one.

[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.280]
And you too.

[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:20.700]
Bye.

[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.240]
My buy.

[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.740]
There's a guy, a mobile guy in clear water.

[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:24.600]
How do you like that?

[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.560]
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.680]
If I was OPI, I'd be doing a green apple quick step all over my BVDs right now.

[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.500]
Have you seen speaking of underwear?

[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.380]
Have you seen those spots for fruit of the loom?

[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.720]
I mean, it's like, uh, oh, geez, I wish I could remember how that there's like a music.

[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.860]
There's a theme that goes.

[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.620]
It's like, uh, good things for your life.

[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.100]
And it's the guy, the one of the, uh, there's a series of them, of course.

[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.260]
They're all very, uh, very homie, Hamish.

[00:42:53.880 --> 00:43:00.540]
And the guy, uh, he's, uh, here's the father in the underwear and his fruit of the loom t-shirt and underwear, BVDs.

[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.180]
Oh, I'm sorry, not BVDs.

[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.200]
Uh, what would you call him?

[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:04.700]
Briefs.

[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.160]
Oh, sorry.

[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.340]
News and briefs.

[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.100]
Uh, he's walking down the hall with his little, uh, boy.

[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.060]
And he's also got his little baggy.

[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:15.720]
And the little boys going into the, uh, bathroom and he said, oh, you're going to do it yourself?

[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.000]
This time?

[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.020]
And so the father stands outside and he's very proud.

[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.380]
There are problems as the kids 15.

[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.140]
So we're not sure what he was doing in there to be honest with you.

[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:32.080]
We have an open line on the star line at star I.o.d. uh, Pompano.

[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:32.500]
Hello.

[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.080]
Neil.

[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:33.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.980]
Oh, man, I just got back from New England.

[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:36.780]
I missed you.

[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.060]
Yeah.

[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.260]
I was up there for, uh, two weeks in.

[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:39.760]
And.

[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:39.940]

[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.240]
How was it?

[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.700]
It was fine until eight minutes left in the fourth quarter when they arrested me.

[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:46.460]
For what?

[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.600]
They're for, uh, cheering for the dolphin.

[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:49.500]
Yeah, right.

[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.960]
I was, I, I swear to you, I was standing on my seat, swinging a towel, yelling, defense.

[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.760]
And they hollering away for being disorderly.

[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:57.820]
Yeah.

[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.320]
They threw me into patty wagon.

[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:00.760]
Really?

[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:03.380]
Hold, hold, hold, that everyone in it was dolphin-fated.

[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:04.180]
Great.

[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.460]
That, that's why they only have 20,000 for a game.

[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:07.940]
Right.

[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.420]
Because the rest are more all in jail.

[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.000]
Why, listen, I don't do it again.

[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:11.940]
And I'm sure he won't.

[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.160]
This is South Florida's news traffic.

[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.840]
And for our situation, he was talking about radio six 10.

[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.320]
Don't you, I.o.d. by any four-letter.

[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:21.680]
And the phone beat you.

[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.800]
I'll say audio is farewell.

[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.200]
Goodbye.

[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:24.460]
I'll follow it.

[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.680]
Sorry, Henry.

[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.380]
It was an accident.

[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.380]
I'll never do it again.

[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.760]
It was just an accident, Henry.

[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.360]
I'm sorry.

[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.200]
I'm sorry.

[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:34.920]
I'm sorry.

[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.180]
Use talk radio six 10.

[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.080]
W-I-O-D.

[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.000]
Get out of the locker room.

[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.240]
The Neil Roger Show.

[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.260]
To talk with Neil Dile 751 W-I-O-D from date.

[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.740]
In well, in 524 W-I-O-D.

[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.980]
Outside the 305 area code.

[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.520]
toll free 1-800-944 W-I-O-D.

[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.620]
And Bell South mobility customers make it a free call.

[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.520]
My dialect star I-O-D.

[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.220]
Now, the Neil Roger Show.

[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.320]
A new stock radio six 10.

[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.800]
W-I-O-D.

[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.380]
My butt is very, very sore.

[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.840]
Neil, good.

[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.020]
If you listen to W-I-O-D.

[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.980]
The shows in budget time are better.

[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.960]
You never know it's by the way they say I'm from only.

[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.200]
The sports and the news and all weather.

[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.280]
It's always like a furry sunny version.

[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.260]
Joseph, gaga, gaga, gaga, gaga, gaga.

[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.540]
Say, out of all by now.

[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.380]
No one gives a crap about any of that.

[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.740]
It's a talent that brings a lot of money.

[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.160]
And if that's all they're gonna tell.

[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.860]
The talent is losing out.

[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.820]
And the body is phased through it up and out.

[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.180]
Boy, tuning out.

[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.820]
Feeling Rick and Sutter, what we're listening for.

[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.720]
The lady have never been better here.

[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.660]
But all you'll ever see on the TV on the billboard.

[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.500]
It's a close-door, the sports or the weather.

[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.600]
It's always Hank O'Brien's sunny version.

[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.540]
Joseph, gaga, gaga, gaga, gaga, gaga.

[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.740]
Say, out of all by now.

[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.600]
No one ever listens to that other crap.

[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.860]
It's a talent that keeps the place running.

[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.120]
And if that's all they're gonna tell.

[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.920]
The talent is losing out.

[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.660]
And the body is phased through it up and out.

[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.980]
Oh, right out.

[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:07.940]
Thanks a lot, Alex.

[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.020]
Mona Lisa delivery went over to the sun.

[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.740]
He's got our great salads today.

[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.480]
This is beautiful. This is perfect.

[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.620]
I look forward to this now.

[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.020]
And Chuck Meyer, by the way, fat Chuck this morning was saying

[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.280]
that the morning line is in 18 and a half days.

[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:23.200]
The overs and under is I'm gonna be off of this kick.

[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.160]
No way, Chuck.

[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:25.840]
I love it.

[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:26.720]
And the food too.

[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.020]
I was just thinking, by the way, during that thing,

[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.820]
Mitch Lewis may be gone, but there are at least two things

[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.900]
that he left behind that will always have like.

[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.520]
That's one of them.

[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.420]
And then the other one is.

[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.380]
See, not a widely known fact.

[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.920]
No, seriously, but that is Mitch Lewis on that card.

[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.560]
That's a Mitch Lewis fart on the card.

[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.500]
Anyway, it's 11.08, so we'll always have that to remember him by.

[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.800]
One open line in Broward.

[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:50.820]
In fact, just the aroma.

[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.620]
It kind of makes you feel that he's in the room.

[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:55.100]
5249463.

[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.140]
And a starline for Bell Soff mobility people are out there.

[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.840]
This morning I'm coming to work and I look around and I noticed it's like everybody

[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.100]
had the phone to their ear this morning.

[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.020]
What is that all about?

[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.400]
Everybody was on the phone this morning.

[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.200]
I don't, I have no idea who they were calling.

[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.420]
Maybe the supply came in.

[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.460]
Oh, speaking of the supply came in.

[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.640]
Tonight's a big night at Pompedo Park, right, Rich?

[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.520]
Last night, I would have made millions of dollars.

[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.100]
God, it looked those results.

[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:25.320]
You see those results and you know you would have had all those gigantic payoffs.

[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:30.240]
And Kevin Wallace continues going crazy over there in John Philip Pelley and everybody.

[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.200]
And it just wasn't there.

[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.320]
Tonight's a big night though.

[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.160]
Bradenton.

[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.680]
Hey, Neil.

[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.660]
Hey, Neil, have you heard the new promo from WSUN?

[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:43.300]
About what?

[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.940]
About a 970 WSLA?

[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:46.620]
No.

[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.200]
Oh, Neil, it's hilarious.

[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.320]
Sing what?

[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.500]
Okay, first it starts off.

[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:53.860]
It goes on every day.

[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:59.760]
620 WSUN, news radio, approved that that 970 WSLA sucks.

[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:05.240]
And then they got a thing of you, you know, bad mouthed in WSLA.

[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:05.800]
Not me.

[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:06.820]
Yes, you.

[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.780]
I would never do that.

[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.540]
Oh, come on, Neil.

[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.120]
I love WSUN, Pelley, man.

[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:11.460]
Beautiful.

[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.440]
I have a little Lionel blow up down at the house.

[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.440]
Neil, you told the way it was.

[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:16.880]
Yeah.

[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.540]
Now, Neil, it was hilarious.

[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.380]
Was it?

[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.240]
Do I know?

[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:22.440]
It was good.

[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.740]
It was excellent.

[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:24.240]
Yeah.

[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:25.860]
Well, it's about time.

[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:26.560]
Happy New Year.

[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:27.540]
Fine, the same to you.

[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:28.460]
Have a great day, Pell.

[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.240]
All right, see ya.

[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.260]
Boy, was he, where did he have that oxygen thing pump it, huh?

[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.520]
WFL lace sucks.

[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:35.540]
Oh.

[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.540]
Boy, it can almost die from the back draft.

[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.340]
We have an open line in Broward, 524, man.

[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:40.760]
This is good.

[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:45.660]
There's like a little macaroni salad and some a spiral pasta in here and a little bit of fruit

[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.420]
and some other little tortellinis.

[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:50.040]
Nice job, Robbie.

[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.140]
How come it's always so much better when sunnies out of town?

[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:54.760]
Homestead.

[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:57.520]
Homestead?

[00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:58.420]
Oh, yes, sir.

[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.560]
Oh, is this homestead?

[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:00.900]
That's what I thought.

[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:01.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.600]
Happy New Year.

[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.420]
I understand, Neil.

[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.860]
I'd like to ask you if I could take a little opportunity to thank a group of people

[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:08.760]
that were here yesterday.

[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.500]
By all means.

[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.200]
Okay, Circus, USA.

[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.440]
We're kind enough to come down here to Homestead and put on a free performance

[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.560]
for the people of Homestead.

[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:17.240]
Outstanding.

[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.280]
I'm serious.

[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.780]
They were fantastic.

[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:20.620]
Great.

[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.140]
Thank you very much for the time.

[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:22.840]
How are you doing?

[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:23.620]
I'm doing fine.

[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.380]
Well, that's good.

[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.620]
And have a great New Year.

[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.580]
It's got to be better, right?

[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:27.300]
Oh, yes, sir.

[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.900]
But you know, you've got like, like, you always say you're going to take the good with the bad.

[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:31.460]
That's right.

[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.300]
And good luck on your diet.

[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.520]
Okay, thanks, Shalon.

[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:34.980]
You're welcome.

[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:35.420]
We'll see you.

[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.500]
Open line of day, it's 7519-463.

[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.400]
It's 11 after 11.

[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:40.220]
It's a Wednesday.

[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:41.720]
It's just before the New Year.

[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.480]
93 is going to be our year.

[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:47.120]
All of us, everybody who's listening right now, everybody who's connected with this station,

[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.040]
with this show, except, of course, the people who haven't gotten canned yet.

[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.240]
Well, there's still got to be some more, aren't there?

[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.740]
Oh, you know, there's some more people getting canned, Alex.

[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:56.340]
I'm sorry.

[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:57.420]
Right?

[00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:58.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.520]
Oh, your history, Alex, as he's gone.

[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.760]
That Mona Lisa look is out for 93.

[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:03.740]
Guaranteed.

[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.320]
Maybe if you get your hair, you know, if he'd get his hair cut, short, he'd be not too bad.

[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:09.080]
Huh?

[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.420]
No, I've been that nosewood protrude, I guess.

[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.880]
Is that what that all I hear is about to cover up that gigantic?

[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.160]
Are you sure he's not Jewish?

[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.320]
Maybe we'll check during the break.

[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.760]
It's 11 after 11 on the IOD Network.

[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:28.320]
Don't miss the weekend magazine featuring the latest news, information, trends, and what's happening this Saturday and Sunday morning right here.

[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:32.980]
Love your show, Neil.

[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.700]
Love you.

[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:34.940]
Love you.

[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.480]
And we love you too, Jim.

[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:37.800]
Butch up for the new year, baby.

[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:38.540]
11, 15.

[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:39.800]
Don't forget Randy tonight.

[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:40.940]
No ball game.

[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:41.600]
Yeah.

[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:43.720]
No ball game tonight.

[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.000]
We get Randy unencumbered by any meaningless, useless bunch of shot.

[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.040]
Let's do a mobile in Alabama.

[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:50.660]
Hello.

[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:51.240]
Hello.

[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:52.580]
Hey, Neil.

[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:53.220]
How you doing?

[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.100]
Oh, pretty good.

[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.200]
We're going to the Sugar Bowl.

[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:55.980]
All right.

[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.580]
I know you don't really give us.

[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.040]
I don't give a blind.

[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.100]
That's right.

[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:08.940]
I don't know if you're going to give us a blind.

[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.220]
I don't know if you're going to give us a blind.

[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:12.240]
I don't know if you're going to give us a blind.

[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:12.240]

[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:12.240]

[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:12.240]

[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:12.340]
I don't know if you're going to give us a blind.

[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.560]
I don't know if you're going to give us a blind.

[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.460]
I don't know if you're going to give us a blind.

[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.060]
I don't know if you're going to give us a blind.

[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:16.140]
I don't know if you're going to give us a blind.

[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:24.520]
I don't know if you're going to give us a blind.

[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:30.080]
I don't know if you're going to give us a blind.

[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.000]
I'm going to be dropping it to in the shower next time.

[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.140]
Lisa Olsen comes in.

[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.560]
Well, I mean, didn't they win the division?

[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.820]
I don't keep up much approach.

[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:38.640]
They won the division.

[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:39.880]
We are number one.

[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.000]
We are the champions.

[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.100]
We are the best.

[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.500]
We kicked some ass.

[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:44.480]
Mostly our own.

[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.820]
And all we need now is to look out to fake our way through three more games.

[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:49.280]
And we will be the champions.

[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.920]
Which has got to be one of the great jokes in history, but we'll take it.

[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:53.460]
We don't care.

[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:54.060]
That is amazing.

[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.240]
Well, I hope they have more class than the Miami Hurts.

[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.480]
Have you heard about what they've been doing down in New Orleans?

[00:52:59.480 --> 00:52:59.960]
No.

[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.380]
Oh, that's terrible.

[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.740]
You know Bob Marley's son plays from Miami.

[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:04.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.440]
He's just terrible.

[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.200]
They ran it.

[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.820]
They walked up to some Miami players.

[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:15.360]
I mean, Alabama players down in New Orleans and started talking trash and saying all this

[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:15.560]
stuff.

[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:19.980]
And they even quoted him in the paper saying we're going to kick their butts.

[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:20.700]
Yeah.

[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:23.300]
If they don't like it, they can go to hell on this stuff.

[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:23.580]
Right.

[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.060]
That's the Hurricanes, man.

[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:26.480]
So, oh well.

[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.560]
But oh, we beat them.

[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.100]
I'm a tied fan myself.

[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:31.180]
Yeah.

[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.560]
Now we're talking.

[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:33.280]
Go tied.

[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.240]
Go tied.

[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.780]
Maybe the Hurricanes will wash out with a tie.

[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:37.440]
Yeah.

[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.140]
Can I call?

[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.260]
Can I just tell you one thing?

[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:40.660]
Sure.

[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.440]
No chance.

[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:42.440]
You don't think so?

[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:47.360]
Miami is going as much as I despise everything about the University of Miami sports program,

[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.800]
except the baseball.

[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:52.020]
They are going to just mop up the end of golf, I guess.

[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.160]
Mop up the stadium over there with Alabama.

[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.680]
I hate to tell you that, but believe me, it's going to happen.

[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:58.420]
Well.

[00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:59.740]
So be prepared for it.

[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.300]
OK.

[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.820]
Well, at least we'll have a good time anyway.

[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:02.660]
Damn right.

[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.180]
Have a great time, pal.

[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:08.060]
And I just like to call Mike Hernandez a flaming dish bag.

[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:08.540]
OK.

[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:09.700]
See ya.

[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:10.140]
See ya.

[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:10.680]
Bye-bye.

[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.560]
Boy, little rowdy in the car there, huh?

[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:17.500]
Sounds like there's old grab-ass going on in front, seat in the back seat and underneath.

[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.040]
We have an open line in this sterile.

[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.440]
See, it's just amazing to me after looking at that map yesterday.

[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.940]
I think that's why they took it out.

[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:30.380]
I realized that they got that big signal on 770, but there's no population there.

[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.320]
It would be like taking WABC or KMOX.

[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:40.160]
One of those 50,000 watt used to be clear channel stations and putting it in North Dakota.

[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.280]
In mind it.

[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.260]
And it just, it wouldn't mean too much.

[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:49.640]
I mean, you'd cover it like a giant territory and you'd be talking like mostly the animals

[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.780]
to barnyard animals like we do all the time.

[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.520]
Palm Beach on the starline.

[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.520]
A nail.

[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.380]
First, I'd like to say Mitch Lewis is God and boy Gary sucks.

[00:54:59.100 --> 00:54:59.500]
Oi!

[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:00.880]
That's number one.

[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:01.240]
Yes.

[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.220]
Number two, I'd just like to make a comment about that.

[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:05.360]
Well, let me just clarify one thing.

[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:05.740]
Yeah.

[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:12.400]
The Mitch Lewis episode was basically more of his choosing because he don't want to do production anymore.

[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.360]
He wants to be a radio personality.

[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.800]
Mitch believes he does.

[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:22.660]
He wants to either do like an AOR morning show or do a talk show which he's deluded if he believes that's his calling.

[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.320]
That show.

[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:23.860]
Huh?

[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.400]
What that show we had.

[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:25.900]
Right.

[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:26.420]
Ooh.

[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:27.180]
Exactly.

[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.420]
Anyway, I just want to make an ahead till comment.

[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:31.160]
Yes.

[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.560]
Because, uh...

[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.980]
Oi, you really are full of it today.

[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:38.200]
Unbelievable, but in Chicago, you know what a joke at Tell Us in Chicago?

[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:38.920]
Was.

[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:39.860]
He got canned.

[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:44.020]
Even boy, Gary, I put it right to his ugly push this morning.

[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.600]
I said, did he get canned in Chicago or what?

[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:53.040]
And he said, not only did he get canned, but they replaced him with Jonathan Brandmeyer tapes on the loop.

[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:53.640]
TAPES!

[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.520]
He got replaced by a tape!

[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.060]
Jonathan Brandmeyer would start his morning by ripping that till...

[00:55:59.060 --> 00:55:59.320]
Great.

[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:01.480]
Then Steven Gary would rip his ass off that man.

[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.120]
Oh, I would imagine.

[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.480]
I mean, what the hell was he doing on that station?

[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:05.940]
But think about it this way.

[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.300]
As bad as he is, he was beating Gregory Benjamin there.

[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:10.680]
Well, I don't know who that is.

[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.700]
Greg, you know.

[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:12.480]
That was his job.

[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.960]
Oh, Gregory Benjamin, Budeau?

[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:15.920]
Oh, Gregory Benjamin.

[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.520]
So anyway, that...

[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:18.760]
Oh.

[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:23.060]
But if that's, uh, you know, what boy, Gary, incredible as guy.

[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:30.600]
Well, you should have heard Bob Green, you'd have been very proud talking this morning to boy, Gary, as I said in here and laughed all over my shoes about how bad it till is.

[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:34.000]
Well, maybe it's a good signal. Maybe boy, Gary's on the way out.

[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:34.540]
Really?

[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:37.340]
WLS

[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.160]
Dark Radio

[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:40.560]
Keith90

[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.680]
And here's Gregory Benjamin.

[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:43.460]
Unbelievable.

[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:44.280]
It is.

[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:45.040]
How great that.

[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:45.660]
And you too.

[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.540]
What's really unbelievable is we let Ed Till in the building here.

[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.180]
That's...

[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:55.780]
So the real story is the real scoop as opposed to the façade, the charade that he masqueraded.

[00:56:56.100 --> 00:57:00.140]
Why can't you just come down and be honest and say, I got cammed in Chicago?

[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.640]
Well, no, seriously, what's wrong with that?

[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:04.840]
Huh?

[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.140]
It's like Joey who pretends that he never...

[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:08.080]

[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.780]
It's like he never worked at QAM.

[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.600]
He never worked at any of the stations he got cammed at.

[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:14.960]
He's just been...

[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.200]
He's just been doing like 70 years of show prep.

[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.280]
It didn't pay off, but he's been doing a lot of show prep.

[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.240]
He never worked at all these stations he got fired at.

[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:23.880]
I don't understand that.

[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:27.020]
Guy comes down here and he acts like he's like Mr. Stewart.

[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:28.900]
Oh, I'm a big superstar in Chicago.

[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:30.420]
I have my TV show.

[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.840]
Of course it's on the cable.

[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.000]
What do they call it?

[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:35.640]
Local access.

[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.660]
Yeah, that's one of those make-believe channels.

[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.840]
Like that one he got in Tampa where they're naked at night.

[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:41.980]
That's what he's on.

[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.300]
I mean, how much money can you make for that?

[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.140]
Like, basically nothing or next to nothing.

[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.960]
Or maybe he pays for the time to be on the air.

[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:50.700]
And he got candid to loop.

[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:51.640]
So he's up there.

[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.380]
He's still living there.

[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:53.260]
He's got fire.

[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:54.240]
He doesn't have a job.

[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.320]
He's not a work again and again and again.

[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.780]
And he's uncharacter like he's Mr. Hot Shot up there.

[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.900]
And he's just honoring us with his presence for a few days

[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:03.940]
because it's warm in Florida.

[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.600]
No shot, Sherlock.

[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:07.540]
It's warm in Florida.

[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.660]
Great observation, Ed.

[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.440]
And I would say four might could be a lot better in your case

[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.960]
because it's lighter for the movers to schlep around than would.

[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.160]
1121 on the IOD Network.

[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:22.780]
Here's Chuck Meyer, Joey Reynolds, Tom Hopkins,

[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:27.040]
Jemanage and Rendy Rhodes, each weekend, right here.

[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.680]
Tell me why you're T.

[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:32.800]
If I had the ability to do, I'd take you out here right now.

[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.480]
I'm kick your goddamn teeth then.

[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:04.780]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.080]
No one's blinked in New York City.

[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.520]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.480]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:10.500]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:11.960]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:13.080]

[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:18.440]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:21.700]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:21.700]

[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:21.700]

[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:22.460]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:23.620]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.600]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:25.800]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:25.800]

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:25.800]

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:25.800]

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.040]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:26.160]

[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:26.860]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.220]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:28.740]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:29.080]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:29.080]

[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:29.080]

[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:29.360]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:29.840]
I'm a shit.

[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:32.940]
As we can see, so come on.

[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:36.020]
Every guy around the guy,

[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:37.700]
Everyone.

[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:41.140]
It means you'll buy an dancing.

[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.560]
Dancing in my sheets.

[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.460]
Dancing in my sheets.

[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.480]
It's every sense, let's go see A.

[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.140]
Dancing in my sheets.

[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.580]
Let's go ACGC now.

[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:53.900]
Dancing in my sheets.

[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:55.880]
Just forget that he's not ready.

[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.500]
Dancing in my sheets.

[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.460]
Hardest way of not killing, not sweat hitting a beat

[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:08.380]
We were ladies underwear, we go cruising and swing

[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:12.980]
We like sassy, and dancing in our seats

[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:16.800]
We're dancing in the seats, dancing in our seats

[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.460]
Dancing in the seats, dancing in our seats

[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.460]
We're dancing in the seats

[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:26.680]
1127 at WIOD, we have an open line in the Star Line

[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.580]
One in Brown and one in the Tampa

[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:29.580]
Tampa!

[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:37.620]
1-800-944-WID, not Fort Myers, not Naples, not Sarasota, not Brandon, Tampa

[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.660]
1-800-944, so what's the deal on those blockbuster he got three of them?

[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.540]
Or three pair?

[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:45.740]
Three tickets?

[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.640]
So what do you do with that?

[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:49.980]
Oh yeah?

[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.060]
No, seriously, what do you do with three tickets?

[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:57.920]
I mean I don't mind giving them away and it was very nice of whoever dropped by and left

[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.540]
them out front.

[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.080]
Can we see them?

[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.960]
Can we actually like get our hands on them and take a look at where they are, what they're

[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.260]
all about?

[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.800]
Blockbuster Bowl at Penn State and Vassar?

[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.700]
Some girl school.

[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.720]
See, I don't understand these bowl games where they picked the participants like before

[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.860]
the season even starts and Penn State had a marginal to disastrous season.

[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.760]
I mean mediocre at best and embarrassing at worst.

[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:20.840]
W-I-O-D.

[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:21.880]
Hello.

[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:22.680]
Yes sir.

[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:23.820]
Neil.

[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:24.360]
Yeah.

[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.080]
Well I picked up Colca's George went out to get the tickets.

[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.080]
Well I'm one of those disgusting snores that would like a pair of tickets.

[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.780]
Oh hold on a minute and I'll see what they're all about.

[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.040]
How do you like that?

[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.080]
All of a sudden I met you and we got three tickets.

[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.500]
I didn't even say what they're all there for and the phones are bringing off the hook.

[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.920]
Thank you so much George.

[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:42.460]
It's say.

[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.540]
Oh boy.

[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.820]
I think you know you ever see the guy on top of the tower in Texas.

[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.720]
George reminds me just very quiet, very calm but he's the kind of guy that one day is going

[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:01.640]
to blow and be on top of the Channel 7 tower in the back with a rifle pointed over there

[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.020]
I hope.

[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.220]
It says thought you might be able to get a few bucks for these for Camilla's house.

[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.520]
Now I appreciate that but that never works out.

[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.420]
Two sets or two seats are together and one alone.

[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.940]
This ought to be okay so if you're all alone for new years here's the answer for you.

[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.800]
So here's section 444 that's like in the nose bleed.

[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:28.000]
Way way up there bring your telescope bring them out Palomar telescope.

[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.760]
Now are you alone or with somebody?

[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:31.760]
I'm with somebody.

[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:32.780]
Hold on a minute.

[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.080]
Okay so there's like row one seats three and four that's pretty good deal.

[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.840]
At least you get that a lot of that's not bad.

[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:39.120]

[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:46.420]
Being in row one and then the other ones as row two seat 24 in the same section.

[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.200]
So actually they're not that far apart.

[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:50.720]
How are we going to do this?

[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.380]
Who is this from Craig the rocker fellows?

[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.560]
Do we know what that means?

[01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.780]
What is the rocker fellows?

[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:00.800]
I don't have no idea.

[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.020]
Thank you Craig whoever you are.

[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.520]
So how do we do this?

[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.620]
I don't I don't know a fair way to do it.

[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.640]
I want to give these to somebody who's going to use them.

[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.880]
What's the date?

[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.520]
Oh it's Friday today is the Wednesday so whoever I give them does going to have to pick

[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:13.880]
them up.

[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.440]
Is there somebody else on here that wanted these that wanted some that wanted one?

[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.480]
Well how about if I give you two?

[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.640]
That sounds real nice.

[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:28.600]
It does sound real nice to me and it's only you're only locked out because I picked up

[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.120]
Cole because George was walking up front to get the ticket so it's like this but I'd

[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.520]
go out to Calder right now.

[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:38.100]
Well you said this is going to be everybody's lucky years right and it started off for

[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:38.260]
you.

[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:38.740]
That's right.

[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:42.900]
Let me just just by chance just on a whim that you might be able to snore a couple of

[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:43.940]
tickets and here they are.

[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.500]
No I'm going to go to the lotto today.

[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.400]
Yeah I'd go down to the lotto I'd go over to Calder come up to Pompato Night bring

[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:55.300]
a couple of million dollars and so bring a tank of oxygen too because these are 444 they're

[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.540]
in the upper level but the price is right these are $28 tickets man.

[01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.980]
First row I can always jump.

[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.220]
Right exactly.

[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:05.000]
In fact some people from Plantation will be in the row down beneath you saying go ahead

[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:05.420]
do it.

[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:05.660]
Jump.

[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.920]
Well hold on a second and George will straighten your ass out and I enjoy it.

[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:10.620]
Okay.

[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.020]
So there's two of them there to make sure he gets these two.

[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:14.720]
Okay.

[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.580]
Now if we got somebody anti social that has no friends and nobody wants to be anywhere

[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.360]
near them I have one ticket.

[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.020]
What are we going to do with this?

[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.600]
And I don't think it'll fit.

[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.000]
It's kind of a way these are wide tickets.

[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.260]
These are like the dolphin tickets.

[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.040]
You could do that.

[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:36.720]
But these are extra wide fancy multi colored blockbuster bowl three Joe Robbie Stadium

[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:42.400]
and very impressive looking even for the nosebleed seats and a 28 bucks of a copy they ought

[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.220]
to be very impressive.

[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.660]
So I got one and I don't know what the hell I'm going to do with it but we'll figure

[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:46.940]
it out.

[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.020]
Somebody will call in and snore the one.

[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.180]
Here's a sunrise.

[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:51.600]
Hello.

[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.340]
Sunrise.

[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:54.740]
Gone.

[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:55.700]
Okay.

[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.360]
They probably wanted to free load.

[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.060]
Miami.

[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:58.440]
Hello.

[01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:58.960]
Yeah.

[01:04:59.140 --> 01:04:59.600]
Yes sir.

[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:00.620]
Can I snore that ticket?

[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:01.900]
You want one?

[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.020]
Yeah I'll take it.

[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.100]
What are you going to do with one?

[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.680]
Well I have to go up there.

[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.140]
I'll probably get one out front and have a seat with somebody somewhere.

[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:09.940]
Oh I see.

[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.660]
You know I saw you up at the I saw you up at the Raider game.

[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:15.220]
Yeah.

[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:18.040]
And I went up there and I was never more disappointed.

[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:20.320]
I felt like Dorothy going over to see the wizard.

[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.220]
Why is that?

[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:26.900]
Well I mean you know you're the great Neil Rogers and I went over there with the girl that

[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:27.440]
I was with.

[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:27.980]
Yeah.

[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.500]
And we were talking to you and you acted like a bump on a log.

[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.900]
I mean you acted like well.

[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:33.540]
No.

[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:34.660]
Just that.

[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.440]
I told you I had no life and you didn't react and I expected something.

[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:42.800]
I mean even Fat Rich was like more animated than you or he's the whole thing.

[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.720]
If I may say so I think Fat Rich is the driving force behind Neil Rogers.

[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.460]
I mean it was a.

[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.040]
So you didn't really want the ticket right?

[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:59.300]
We have an open line in date 751 and two and Broward 524 like I'm supposed to put on

[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:03.340]
a floor show for these people when they come over and say hello or I'll go like the thing

[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.400]
at the JG it happens everywhere I go.

[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:11.100]
Any appearance they come up and it's like oh jeez he's just like a real quiet ordinary

[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:11.660]
guy.

[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.300]
This is a radio show folks.

[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.620]
Radio show that's all.

[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.620]
So when you know come up to the ball game and I'm sitting there I'm there to see the

[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:25.020]
game okay and I'm more than happy to say hello I mean a lot of nice people there Orlando

[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.500]
comes over once in a while let's me touch his knee and that's about it.

[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:29.940]
It's a radio show.

[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.800]
So this guy talked his way out of that ticket I don't know you think I'm going to give

[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.000]
him that ticket after that crap no chance.

[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.140]
Hello.

[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.440]
Hey Neil.

[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:39.080]
Yes sir.

[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.560]
I'm why I've snored at ticket.

[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:41.500]
Just one.

[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:42.500]
Just one.

[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:45.920]
Now are you going to give me a bunch of shot and tell me that I'm a bump on the log

[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.800]
and I didn't I love you Neil.

[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.580]
Oh no I really do I listen to every kid.

[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:53.800]
You don't have to suck around but I mean at least don't take a shot.

[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.500]
Don't make like a nasty personal shot like this guy came over and thought I was going

[01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:03.000]
to like do a tat dance and a soft shoe routine for him and his damn ugly girlfriend which

[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.380]
I don't even remember them.

[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:09.560]
Now my wife doesn't care for you but she has to listen to you why I'm on the game.

[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.460]
Why what's her problem?

[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.760]
Those lackey sets the hours that is she a little uptight.

[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.260]
She's too pure to.

[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.940]
Oh a puritanical bitch huh.

[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.660]
Well then you know what you know what you're going to the game alone.

[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:19.820]
Yeah I'm not taking her.

[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:20.240]
Good.

[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.620]
Well you got it.

[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:23.320]
Alright and I hope you enjoy it.

[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.300]
So what are you going to do about getting another seat?

[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.140]
You're not going alone are you?

[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.120]
I'm going alone.

[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:28.780]
You are?

[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:29.180]
Yeah.

[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:30.940]
You're going to a football game alone?

[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.020]
I don't mind.

[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:34.700]
Oh I can't imagine going to I'm sorry.

[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:36.100]
It's worth money huh?

[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.120]
It's worth money.

[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:37.820]
You're right.

[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:38.440]
Hold on.

[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.280]
Enjoy it.

[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:39.680]
Okay.

[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:43.880]
Here's a guy who's going to be sitting alone in the 444 it wrote to seat 24.

[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.340]
So go over there and say hi.

[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.520]
You know do something nice to him because his wife's an old puritanical bitch.

[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:52.320]
So talk to that guy please and the straight and his ass out.

[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.400]
We're going to we're going to do this right.

[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.740]
How are we going to know which is which and who's who's and what's what.

[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:58.840]
We can't say what's what anymore.

[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:00.800]
Well Georgia will handle it.

[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.360]
George said just leave it in my capable hands.

[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.820]
I'll handle it okay.

[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.780]
Because one thing in 92 that happened where we got one more day to go.

[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:14.240]
George was about to say that Roger didn't get his job away from during 92 but we still

[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:14.920]
have tomorrow.

[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.740]
That's right and Bob Green said he will be in tomorrow and by the way look for some interesting

[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:20.620]
changes tomorrow.

[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.240]
George.

[01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.300]
Okay.

[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.400]
We have an open line and Broward on the snoring line.

[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:24.980]
It's amazing.

[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:28.420]
You know you people in Broward I got a sense of humor that is just rare.

[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.000]
It is really a treat to watch.

[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.580]
We can sit here on all of the shows on his station and do a number with Broward and make

[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:36.460]
a whole bit out of it.

[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:40.760]
They wouldn't call like if our life somebody was holding a gun to our head to say hey

[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.480]
happy life and hell.

[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:47.480]
But we got something to give away and they sniff that thing out and they're on there

[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:51.020]
faster than you can say Sunrise's douchebag.

[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.820]
What do we have now Roger?

[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.920]
It says about 50,000 tickets.

[01:08:58.920 --> 01:08:59.820]
Well that's good.

[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.760]
So maybe this guy will be able to buy one very close by him like maybe the whole row.

[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.580]
Twenty thousand two over there.

[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.240]
Twenty thousand seats.

[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.400]
Ha ha ha.

[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:09.600]
Wow.

[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:11.120]
What is it?

[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.320]
What?

[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.000]
It's going to have him bring the tickets.

[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.500]
Well just relax.

[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.060]
Don't start bossing Roger around.

[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:19.520]
Okay.

[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:24.480]
Lest he should start up another campaign to get your ass out of here.

[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:24.760]
Okay.

[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:25.920]
Don't start pushing him around.

[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.980]
About 50,000 tickets have been sold for Fridays 1 30 BM blockbuster bowl at your

[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:32.780]
Robbie Stadium.

[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.180]
Whoo.

[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.980]
Who he penned state and Stanford.

[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:44.600]
Last year 52,644 tickets were sold with 46,123 showing up that 6500 plus no shows.

[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:51.100]
6500 no shows and the attendance count included several hundred reporters, security personnel,

[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.740]
members of both teams, everybody in the stadium, the dog, the mascot, Dolphin, Danny showed

[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:56.720]
up, they counted.

[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:59.740]
Actually the real attendance was like 78 people who bought tickets.

[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.080]
But they had 46,000 people in the stadium.

[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.680]
That included the vendors, the guys that sell the sodas, everybody.

[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.840]
And by the way, speaking to the guys who sell the sodas at the Dolphin games, you're okay

[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.640]
in my book, guys.

[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.540]
Bring some over here.

[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:18.940]
So it's 20,000 empty seats yet.

[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.180]
So I don't think these people have any trouble buying like several rows right around where

[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:22.700]
they're going to be.

[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.200]
1137 on the IOD network.

[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:31.760]
Coming up tonight and eight, following sports dogs 610, it's the Randy Road show right

[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:36.420]
here.

[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:40.160]
I can have an orgasm just driving down I-95.

[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.920]
There comes a time in a young woman's life when she has to ask questions.

[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.700]
Mom, I have to ask you a personal question.

[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.460]
Do you do, Shurai Do.

[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.080]
I use vinegar and water.

[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.620]
Why vinegar and water?

[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.660]
Because, silly, I'm Italian.

[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:04.100]
Hidden Valley douche, in Italian, French ranch or new chunky blue cheese.

[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.860]
1142 at IOD.

[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:13.360]
We have an open line in Broward, 524 and 1 in St. Pete at 1-800-944 at IOD.

[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.000]
Here's a mobile on the, no, not a mobile on a turnpike.

[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:17.640]
Long gone.

[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.100]
Sorry.

[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.160]
Cape Coral.

[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:20.840]
Hello?

[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:21.460]
Yes, sir.

[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:22.780]
Good morning, sir.

[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:23.840]
Happy New Year to you.

[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.200]
And a very happy and prosperous and all the other trite clichés.

[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.860]
Yes, I'll put.

[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:35.380]
What I wanted to ask you is I heard you discussing movies earlier and I'd like your opinion on Edward

[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:35.960]
Siserhand.

[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.120]
I wouldn't watch as much as I love Johnny Depp and I had Johnny on my show when I was on

[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.940]
SATA 4 or 5 years ago.

[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.800]
I wouldn't watch Edward Siserhand if you paid me by the second.

[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.320]
Oh, I see.

[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:50.880]
Well, I watched it.

[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:51.580]
Loved it.

[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.220]
It was great.

[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.060]
You loved it?

[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:53.500]
Yes.

[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:54.940]
Wow, what's to love?

[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:56.700]
I'm been surprised.

[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.640]
I gave a great cameo performance.

[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.680]
It was a very good story.

[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.920]
And who was the guy that produced that Tim Burton?

[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.340]
Did an excellent overview satire on Suburbie and Hell?

[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:13.540]
All the houses in Suburbie and Hell, they're painted the same little pastel colors, same

[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.160]
lawn, same sidewalks.

[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:19.720]
Why is it that Johnny Depp is always in these silly movies where they have him disfigured?

[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.900]
Is there some reason for that?

[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.840]
What was that other movie where he had the tattoos and the slip back here?

[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.080]
What was that candy?

[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.060]
What was that movie?

[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:28.800]
OG's.

[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:29.980]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.880]
That 50's movie where they all had the slip back here and the tattoos all over the

[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.300]
end.

[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.680]
Oh, that Francis Ford Coppola thing?

[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:37.500]
Was that it?

[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:40.500]
Were the guys were reading poetry or something like that?

[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:41.200]
I don't know.

[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:41.820]
I don't know.

[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:43.020]
I'm just taking a stab at it.

[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:43.940]
Didn't watch enough of it.

[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.080]
Yes, true.

[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.580]
I don't think Francis Ford Coppola made this movie.

[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:48.320]
Hmm.

[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:49.300]
Could be.

[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.660]
I know this was weren't big enough.

[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.020]
That could be.

[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.400]
But I would like to ask a shameless request.

[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:55.860]
Yeah.

[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:01.660]
When you debuted over here, you ran a cute little story with Larry King reading some story

[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.120]
about a squirrel in a park.

[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.680]
Larry King or Larry Lujack?

[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.160]
Not Larry King.

[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.600]
I don't think Larry King's story is about squirrels and nuts.

[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.980]
Do you know the one I'm talking about?

[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:13.240]
Yes.

[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:14.340]
That is excellent.

[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.360]
Could you please do that?

[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.860]
Immediately if not sooner.

[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:17.840]
Thank you very much.

[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.040]
Have a great new year.

[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:19.680]
And you too.

[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:20.380]
Thank you.

[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:20.720]
Okay.

[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.360]
Watch out for those scissors, man.

[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.640]
Boy, I guess that's why Johnny Depp wasn't running around naked for a long time after that

[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:27.920]
movie.

[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:33.560]
We have an open line in the out of town line, 1-800-944-9463.

[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.100]
It did raise some interesting questions.

[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.680]
In other words, I guess what we're trying to say is that maybe Johnny needed a helping

[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.800]
hand in that movie, right?

[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.680]
Here's Kendall.

[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:42.060]
Hello.

[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:42.600]
Yeah.

[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.220]
Yes, sir.

[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:44.180]
Yeah.

[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.420]
How's it going now?

[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:45.980]
Pretty good.

[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.880]
You sounded like a coach off guard there.

[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:48.160]
Yeah.

[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:48.900]
I was like, ah.

[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:52.520]
Anyway, that pathetic movie with Johnny Depp was cry, baby.

[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.580]
Cry, baby.

[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.220]
Yeah, that was crazy.

[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:57.380]
I tried to watch that two or three times and it made me want to cry.

[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.340]
Yeah, I know.

[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.780]
What is wrong with the movies this kid gets into?

[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:01.840]
I mean, he's a good actor.

[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:05.040]
He's a good looking guy and or girl, whatever he wants to be on a given day.

[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:08.600]
He's kind of like, and he just gets into these real crappy movies.

[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:09.820]
Yeah, it meets the worst director.

[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:10.720]
That's it.

[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.820]
Anyway, I was wanting to call about that guy that called about the tourist along while

[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.120]
I was like, oh, yeah, how could we forget?

[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.740]
Oh, man, what the hell is his problem?

[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:21.180]
Life.

[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:24.560]
This is a Neil Rogers show, not the benefit plea for tourists.

[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:30.160]
Oh, listen, these people are so pseudo intellectual today, it's frightening.

[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:30.680]
I know.

[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.100]
You think that maybe just a little dose of ed tell me have gotten to him.

[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.060]
If he, look, if he cares about it, hey, you care about the tourists, make a New Year's

[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:39.400]
resolution.

[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.420]
We don't want to hear it.

[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.380]
We don't want to hear it at all.

[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:41.820]
Exactly.

[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:45.780]
In fact, I think the tourist ought to have to pay a sin tax, speaking of ed till.

[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.060]
The bunch of crap.

[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.220]
It's a bunch of shot is what it is, sir.

[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:52.620]
And that's one of the resolutions we're all making is we're not hearing any more shot

[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:53.660]
on the year in 93.

[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.720]
We're not taking any more shot from any of these pseudo intellectual callers who want to,

[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.560]
how about that old fart that called from Hollywood?

[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.080]
I want to start a big song of the dance about the Cubans out of playing the hook.

[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.880]
What does that got to do with our show?

[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.220]
Yeah, I know.

[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.980]
And what is there to say about that anyway?

[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:11.300]
I mean, you know, good luck to them and have a great life, right?

[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.060]
Put a little damper in our life, Jesus.

[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:13.580]
Right.

[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:16.440]
Put a little thing on it already for crying out loud.

[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.940]
Have a good laugh and relax.

[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:22.280]
And 6,000 years from now, who the hell's going to give a crap about any of this stuff,

[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:22.560]
right?

[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:22.980]
Right.

[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.000]
So you have a hell of a New Year, right?

[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.840]
In you too, pal.

[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:26.120]
All right.

[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:26.580]
See ya.

[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.720]
There's a guy that we could all relate to.

[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.200]
A guy with a little sense of humor and not so uptight and psychotic and goddamn serious.

[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.120]
Your Uncle Lera and Lil Tommy.

[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.280]
Lightning has almost struck twice in Lake Forest.

[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:45.440]
I remember you reporting about the little poodle that weaved its way through the traffic

[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.960]
in Lake Forest only to be splattered by a Northwestern train.

[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:53.340]
Well, a similar incident happened about a week ago involving a squirrel.

[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:58.120]
My friend and I were on our way to get some lunch in Lake Forest last Saturday, and we

[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.140]
noticed a squirrel trying to weave its way across the traffic on Western Avenue.

[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:06.780]
We were in a car about 20 yards away from the squirrel when it started to make its way

[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.700]
across the street.

[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:13.160]
The squirrel was probably not as mobile as it could have been because its mouth was really

[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.860]
stuffed with nuts from the park.

[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:15.320]
Oh!

[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.440]
Luckily, the old squirrel scampered across traffic and my friend and I were relieved that

[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:19.920]
he was safe.

[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:24.180]
Suddenly, two girls who were on a bike ride appeared along the side of the street.

[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.880]
They were really flying when the confused squirrel jumped into their path.

[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.220]
The girl tried to avoid the squirrel but he somehow hit the back tire of her bike and

[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.360]
got caught up with his boat.

[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.340]
Oh, yeah.

[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:38.580]
Before a squirrel went around in the wheel several times before he got free and was

[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:39.560]
flung on the grass.

[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:44.460]
To our surprise, the day's squirrel got to his feet and staggered away.

[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:45.980]
Apparently, okay.

[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:46.600]
Oh, good.

[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.060]
The girl who was riding the bike was a little upset but I'm sure not as much as the squirrel.

[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.920]
Luckily, he didn't lose his life, but he might have lost his name.

[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:57.680]
Not.

[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:01.700]
That's right.

[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:05.960]
So anyway, where the hell is my old WLS, Jingles?

[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.180]
Oh, way to hell up there.

[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.860]
What is it doing near the top?

[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.520]
God, somebody's been...

[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.800]
Okay, Randy is right.

[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.100]
Larry Lujek was God.

[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:16.780]
He was great.

[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.860]
Not the best, Randy, but he was great.

[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.660]
1148, we have an open line on the out of town line.

[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.020]
1-809-4-4.

[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.520]
Maybe he was the best, huh?

[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.640]
I like Bob and Tom.

[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.800]
And I have no idea why they're in Indianapolis.

[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:31.940]
I don't understand that.

[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.560]
They must be making an ungodly amount of money and keeping it a big secret.

[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.920]
Because they are much too good to be an Indianapolis.

[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.020]
God, what are we doing here?

[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:46.820]
It's 1148 on the IOD Network.

[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.300]
Catch the latest news from the 610-WIOD News Center each hour.

[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.540]
Plus an update on traffic and the current weather forecast.

[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:01.400]
1152-WIOD, a little QAM spy report this morning.

[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:05.920]
Just had a call, somebody told me that Moynihan was talking on the air about what the QAM listeners

[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.500]
like best about Hank Olberg.

[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.780]
Get body, stupid!

[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.460]
That was funny.

[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.820]
More changes coming over there.

[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:15.780]
God, almighty kid, how'd you like to try?

[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:16.560]
You think we're bad.

[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.120]
How would you like to try to count the changes at QAM in the last year?

[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.920]
Besides the underwear changes every time the trends come out.

[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.680]
We have an open line in Broward 524.

[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.700]
Are we going to call Mike in my favorite muffin now?

[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:33.100]
Because we had a nice salad and we were thinking what would like top of it.

[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.140]
Look at Richard Bay here.

[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.380]
What the hell are these guys doing?

[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.120]
What is this all about here?

[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:39.940]
I think we're going to have a little action right on the screen now.

[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.820]
They're just all coming in from offstage.

[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:43.900]
Look at that blonde bin bet back there, huh?

[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.400]
Who's wearing one of those S&M outfits with a whip and a chain?

[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.100]
And this guy's about to take his pants off.

[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.300]
What's going on here, man?

[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:52.720]
Richard Bay is God.

[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:54.460]
Although I must say this,

[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:59.580]
Richard Bay is the one who convinced me to send away for that juice man too.

[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.940]
Okay, so not everything in life is much more than just hooring around.

[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:07.300]
Are you calling Mike at my favorite muffin and see if he'll bring some of those real?

[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.780]
Just one is all I want.

[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.420]
One of those ones that weighs about six pounds.

[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.740]
Because that's something you can eat.

[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:17.100]
See, people think that, wow, if you don't eat meat and all this milk and stuff that clogs

[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.720]
up your arteries and your body, that doesn't leave anything else.

[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:20.680]
Well, you're wrong, man.

[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.640]
You are so wrong.

[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:25.920]
In fact, I guarantee that you could still be the biggest fat slob and never eat meat again.

[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:26.680]
It's possible.

[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:28.160]
Eat enough of those muffins.

[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:29.660]
Miami Beach.

[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:30.640]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:31.220]
Yes, sir.

[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.120]
Hey, what's up?

[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:32.920]
How you doing, pal?

[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:34.080]
I got a question for you.

[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.540]
Did you see the movie Toys yet?

[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.540]
I wouldn't watch that if you paid me by the millisecond.

[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:39.400]
Don't go.

[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:42.700]
I've heard it is just the absolute biggest piece of shot in history.

[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:44.260]
I went last night and it...

[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:46.320]
Another Robin Williams bomb.

[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.540]
That has to be his worst movie yet.

[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:49.860]
Really?

[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:50.440]
Yeah.

[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:51.520]
That's saying a lot.

[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:54.040]
Hello, cool Jay couldn't do anything for it either.

[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:54.500]
Yeah.

[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.640]
I mean, I was ready to walk out.

[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:57.880]
Or ask for your money back.

[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.100]
Oh, if I wasn't like half a sweep, I would have left.

[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:01.580]
Yeah.

[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.560]
So just don't see it.

[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:03.980]
Okay.

[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:04.980]
Okay, thank you.

[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:05.640]
Have a great new year.

[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.060]
Bye.

[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:06.620]
Bye-bye.

[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:09.940]
Well, if verdict is unanimous on Toys,

[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.180]
poor Robin Williams, that's so bad.

[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.600]
So bad.

[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.620]
In the meantime, he's raking in millions of dollars

[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.020]
and we feel sorry for him.

[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.960]
See, that's what bothers me about how stupid we are.

[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.700]
We were dumb.

[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:24.240]
Guys getting millions of dollars

[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.440]
for every one of these bomb movies that he's making.

[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.740]
We should feel sorry for the people who put up the money

[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:30.900]
for these movies.

[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:32.520]
For the poor damn producers.

[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.400]
Like Gene No Wilder.

[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:38.020]
Why is it I always think that that was a Mel Brooks movie?

[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:41.300]
Was it the producers that was with Gene Wilder, wasn't it?

[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.640]
And then we're doing springtime with for Hitler.

[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.360]
That wasn't the producers.

[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.040]
What was that movie?

[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:50.980]
History of the World Part One.

[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:51.960]
No.

[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.900]
That was not history of the...

[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:55.000]
Hitler on ice.

[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:55.800]
What?

[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:56.960]
Hitler on ice?

[01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.400]
No, not Hitler on ice.

[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.080]
That's Eddie Shack was Hitler on ice.

[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:03.240]
You don't know what you're talking about.

[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:07.320]
Anyway, we have an open line on the out of townline.

[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:10.040]
1-800-944-9463.

[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.480]
See someday you'll be old and seen out to George.

[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:13.880]
You know, you don't even remember what your name was.

[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:14.320]
It was the producers.

[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:15.660]
It was the... See, there you go.

[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.120]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:17.960]
The producers.

[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:21.060]
And they were singing springtime for Hitler.

[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.200]
Now, wasn't that a Mel Brooks movie?

[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:24.080]
It was.

[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.920]
It was Gene Wilder in that movie.

[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:27.840]
And Bankrock was in a movie.

[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:28.420]
I know that.

[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.360]
What are you laughing about?

[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:33.520]
That's Mel Brooks' wife is Ann Bankrock,

[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.220]
who was in FATSO, but he wasn't.

[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.620]
But Dom Deloise was.

[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:39.320]
And I still haven't brought to that.

[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.940]
I don't want to bring you like a washed out old copy.

[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:43.720]
I want to bring you a virgin good copy,

[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:44.900]
because it's too good of a movie.

[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.200]
I mean, the copy I got of that is on a real bad quality tape.

[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.360]
It was off on TV.

[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.560]
And it looks like the colors are all running together.

[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.040]
It's like a fourth generation dub.

[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.480]
And if you're going to watch a good movie,

[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:56.640]
you should see good quality.

[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:00.320]
And especially when they're yanking all the food out of the refrigerator,

[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.780]
when that big Oscar Lapitas comes up there.

[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:06.660]
That's what are the greatest scenes in the history of the human race.

[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:07.520]
In FATSO,

[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.140]
when he calls Chubby Checkers,

[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:16.400]
because he's having a fit, he's had his brother put locks on all the refrigerator and all the

[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.000]
cupboards he had locks on there without the bagels.

[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.380]
And he likes chasing him around the apartment with a knife,

[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.540]
making him trying to get the key to the locks.

[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:28.700]
And so anyway, he's having his breakdown and he calls up Chubby Checkers.

[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:32.900]
You call them and they come and help you through the crisis when you're overeating.

[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:36.560]
And then comes this big fat guy.

[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:41.520]
His name is Oscar Lapitas and this other huge fat guy whose name I don't remember at the moment.

[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:45.340]
And they're sitting around and they're like drinking hot water

[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:49.260]
to try to help them through their desire to eat, to pacify them.

[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.820]
And they start talking about the kinds of food they like it about.

[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.320]
He says, do you ever take a jelly donut and melt it in the oven?

[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.040]
He says, oh yeah.

[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.600]
But do you ever take a jelly donut and fill it with a Reese's peanut butter cup

[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.000]
and melt the chocolate inside and they just start talking and talking.

[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:10.640]
And of course, as a fat person all my adult life, I can relate to it because God is just so true.

[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.600]
And before you know it, of course, they're drinking a hot tea,

[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.200]
but they're like, want to put honey in it.

[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.940]
Where's the honey junior and they take juniors, Dom Deluis's brother.

[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.920]
They take and they grab him and they grab the keys.

[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:25.620]
And now they open up the refrigerator and the cupboards and they call out for pizzas

[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:29.000]
and for courts of ice cream and they're sitting there and at the end of the scene,

[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.880]
they're all like passed out on the floor from an eating orgy.

[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.560]
And it's the greatest moment in history in George Never Sox.

[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:35.700]
Boka.

[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:36.720]
Oh yeah.

[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.440]
Am I your only caller here?

[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:38.860]
No.

[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.880]
Nobody else calling from Boka.

[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.580]
Well listen, don't knock it.

[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:46.140]
We already had another call from Boka today and that's our quota.

[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.140]
So you're the second one, that's it.

[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.440]
Yeah, I'm wondering something.

[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:50.480]
In fact, wait a minute.

[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.160]
Hold on a second.

[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.680]
Are you Boka on the starline?

[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:54.460]
Hello?

[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:56.780]
Boka.

[01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:57.760]
Yeah?

[01:23:58.640 --> 01:23:59.880]
I can't add it here.

[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.520]
Somebody put their kid on the phone.

[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:01.880]
Yes sir.

[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:02.140]
Go ahead.

[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:02.820]
Robin Williams.

[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:03.860]
I'm wondering something.

[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:07.280]
Is it just me or has he not been in a decent movie,

[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:08.500]
except good morning, Vietnam?

[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.620]
That's my opinion.

[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.580]
I haven't seen that like Awakening's.

[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.200]
I wouldn't watch because it's morbid and depressing.

[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.080]
A lot of people think that was a great movie.

[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:16.740]
It's morbid.

[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.160]
I've seen it.

[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:17.860]
It's not that good.

[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:18.320]
Okay.

[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:23.500]
And dead poet society was highly touted by a lot of pseudo intellectuals.

[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:26.560]
I try to watch it on a cable and within 10 minutes,

[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.580]
I had shut that off.

[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.600]
He's just not a movie guy.

[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:30.800]
He's a great stand-up comic.

[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:31.860]
He's a funny guy.

[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.120]
And we feel sorry because he's probably worth about $100 million

[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.840]
and he's in a lot of crappy movies.

[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.200]
I'm watching Richard Bayon.

[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:40.560]
I just want to get your advice.

[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:43.700]
You think the bronze, your brunettes would win the war?

[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:45.580]
There it is.

[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.040]
They've been fighting on the show.

[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:49.440]
Yeah.

[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:50.720]
That's what the show is about.

[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:51.940]
The Amazon's, man.

[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.780]
They all look like they could beat the crap out of us.

[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.440]
I'll tell you that.

[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.680]
Have a great New Year, pal.

[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:56.160]
You too.

[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.460]
And Richard Bay is God.

[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.660]
We need, that's one thing we need in 93.

[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.140]
A lot more TV like Richard Bay.

[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:06.400]
We don't need Sally and Heraldo and all these depressing stories.

[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.160]
Did you ever stop and wonder where do they get those people?

[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.420]
Where do you find people who are anxious to come on the air?

[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:18.120]
Like these couples who hate each other,

[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.280]
who allegedly despise each other and a husband is raped a wife

[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.240]
and run off with the children and

[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.940]
any, they're sitting up there

[01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:28.000]
are very commonly on the stage, side by side.

[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.900]
So you know it's either got to be contrived

[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.240]
and it's all make-believe

[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.080]
or they're getting paid through the nose to be on there.

[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:36.680]
Because what person in their right mind wants to come on

[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.180]
and what other person watching in their right mind wants

[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.900]
to watch all these other people's problems.

[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.540]
It's like Sally's radio show.

[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:44.660]
It's like Bruce Williams.

[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:46.420]
It's like Dr. What's her name?

[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:47.960]
All these Joyce brothers.

[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:48.820]
All these other shows.

[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.360]
You notice how long that fat lasted?

[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:53.620]
People are not interested in hearing other people's problems.

[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.060]
They got enough problems to their own.

[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:56.840]
They don't want to hear about all these other...

[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.820]
They want to see a lot of hot flesh on the air.

[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:02.400]
And maybe in January 20th after we get the new president in there

[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:05.060]
we get the sikes and all these other Nazis out of there.

[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:07.940]
This is South Florida's news,

[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:09.180]

well let me look it up in the book oh last minute earth was that the name of it it might have been

[01:39:50.740 --> 01:39:56.820]
last matter because that was the the storyline of the whole thing was like after the nuclear war

[01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:01.840]
and the few remaining people and they were like running around with rifles and shooting

[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:05.140]
each other because they were like trying to get the remaining food and they were all paranoid

[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:10.800]
and psychotic and it was really interesting it was kind of like living in Miami 21 afternoon on

[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:16.680]
the iod network don't miss the weekend magazine featuring the latest news information trends and

[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.400]
realistic version of a novel which was about vampires taking over and was previously filmed

[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:03.980]
unsatisfactorily as the last man on earth however I look under the last man on earth it's not in a book

[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:08.920]
but I do remember that was with Vincent Price and it says it blew and it was bad and etc we have

[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.380]
the last man on earth yeah because I saw it I saw both of them and Omega man is much better no

[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:36.280]

[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:43.640]
good it is depressing I know it is because it you know it it hits at the root of human nature and

[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:49.920]
about how basically barbaric and grotesque and selfish and hostile etc we are and who the

[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.540]
how wants to be reminded about that it sounds like Trump like I said it sounds like you live in

[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:28.140]
to you I was going to point out I don't know if you knew but the great Santini was also released the

[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:33.060]
Ace yeah that was the first name of it it was in the movies it was a bomb in the theaters and then

[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:39.120]
they changed the name to the great Santini and it became a cult hit on videotape I don't know why

[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:43.360]
because it was a tremendous movie I mean Robert DuVal and what's her name that played the wife

[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:48.940]
um oh I don't know how she's thinking she's always plays that kind of pumpkin uh southern she was

[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:54.080]
great it was just and and the sun was great the sun was great uh what's the last oh I

[01:46:54.080 --> 01:47:00.180]
I don't know his real name oh geez and then all of a sudden he got like a real Hillbilly Yahoo he

[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:03.920]
played in that movie where he played the ball player for the braves remember that that was at

[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:09.540]
the pressing movie now his name is Michael O'Keepe isn't it Michael O'Keepe oh I think that yeah I think

[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:12.580]
now he mentioned I think that's right he played the baseball player and that was such an

[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:17.680]
depressing movie and he got divorced and it was oh god it was then he looked so bad and the

[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.760]
sheveled and he just keeps getting looking worse and he's got the Davy Johnson syndrome where his

[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:26.800]
faces fall in a park you know I'll realize the great Santini was outstanding I don't realize

[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:33.040]
that like that we don't need to see that in the movies right no um I also I think that Sam Donaldson

[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:38.700]
Sarah is is really just uh he greases it down and comes in a funky kind of way I think how about

[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:46.440]
his hair uh that too yeah could be yeah I think he's greasing it all right before he slides down it

[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:56.440]
um do you have any other learning spell with Don Al besides uh I've heard Mr and I've heard

[01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:33.120]
or not a really kind of huh he what my father played in the great Santini she's good she is a

[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:38.320]
real good actress and she was in some other movie where she played with that with that cornpone accent

[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.040]
you know that real Southern cornpour I don't remember what that movie was maybe was one of those

[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:49.440]
made for TV movies I think it might have been but she is really a great great actress I'll tell you

[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:54.880]
who else are like in kind of a kvetshi way is say the Thompson from family she's a good actress but

[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:00.880]
she was kind of a kvetshi kvetshi mother she was like in fact that whole family uh because that

[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:07.620]
show is still on in syndication on like 75 times a day on the cable and uh and in its time I

[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:11.840]
thought it was a pretty good show but as you look back on it now and watch it it's annoying because

[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:17.260]
they were all like uh nerds they were all I mean willy uh you know willy get out of the house and

year because only perverts would watch those because he runs around his underwear a lot but that

[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:55.980]
was a pretty interesting movie if you're into sports and if you're into like the big fraud of uh

[01:57:55.980 --> 01:58:00.220]
the collegiate athletics and all that that was pretty good no you didn't like that did you see it

[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:20.120]
Warm up back for Dr. Kavorkin.

[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:20.680]
Really?

[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:21.700]
Get them right and move.

[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:26.760]
Oh, I love it.

[02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:29.860]
Bob can slow you down.

[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:31.540]
Just a little bit, yeah.

[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:33.920]
But he's good.

[02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:35.060]
He's great.

[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:35.600]
He's great.

[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:37.020]
He's a little comatose.

[02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:37.580]
That's all.

[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:41.920]
Keep bringing this movie up.

[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.720]
And I just was compelled to call you about FATSO.

[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:45.360]
Yeah.

[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:47.320]
That movie is super.

[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:51.380]
That one moment is super where they go get the honey Jr.

[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:52.220]
Oh, yeah.

[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:54.100]
That guy doesn't look like a state of Rhode Island.

[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:55.160]
You got it.

[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.500]
He's covered off the wall.

[02:03:56.780 --> 02:03:57.080]
Yeah.

[02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.860]
That is a real special cellular moment.

[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:01.380]
Get the honey, Jr.

[02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:06.860]
Another one in that movie is when he goes to get his nephews ice cream cake.

[02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:07.480]
Yeah.

[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:08.620]
Oh, you ate the ooney.

[02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:08.980]
Yeah.

[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:13.980]
And Bagcroft goes crazy and she's like digging her fingers into the ice cream cake and destroying it.

[02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:14.680]
Yeah.

[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:19.800]
Because he ate a big slice out of it where it said the happy birthday to me and he ate the ooney.

[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:21.180]
You ate the ooney.

[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.560]
If she goes nuclear, that's super.

[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:23.760]

[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:24.220]
She's great.

[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:25.880]
And Bagcroft is just a...

[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:29.500]
Can you imagine being a fly on the wall in that house with Mel Brooks and then Bagcroft?

[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:30.980]
I mean, what appear that's got to be?

[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:32.980]
That has got to be one happy couple.

[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:33.300]
Boy.

[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:40.800]
And another movie that I like that it's fairly obscure to get really active reviews was Why's Guy?

[02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:43.560]
With Piscopo and Danny DeVito.

[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:45.360]
Why's Guy?

[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:48.860]
There's a line in that movie that I would love to use around the holidays.

[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:55.560]
He goes to see a relative in the New Jersey shore to bail him out or whatever because they screwed up.

[02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:59.520]
You wasn't one of those newvo reach that Ed Till was talking about, wasn't?

[02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:00.820]
No, no, no, no.

[02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:04.160]
They play a couple of real bad wise guys.

[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:10.600]
But anyway, his aunt comes to the door and answers it and she goes like that.

[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:15.420]
We knew it was only a matter of time before you arrived at Piscopo.

[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:16.900]
That's a curious hello.

[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:22.380]
But I always thought that'd be a good hello to use when those relatives...

[02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:25.060]
You know Piscopo, but I don't understand him.

[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:26.180]
I don't know what's the deal there.

[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:26.860]
I don't get it.

[02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:32.880]
He had that little while on Saturday night live where his big thing was taken off on the king.

[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:34.780]
And then that was it.

[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.820]
Yeah, and then he did all those beer commercials.

[02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:38.640]
But I mean, what does his claim to fame?

[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:40.040]
I don't see anything there.

[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:41.440]
No, there's kind of like Jay Leno.

[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:47.480]
I don't know why people are surprised that Jay Leno was bombing because I never thought he was funny in the first place.

[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:48.440]
He just immediately...

[02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:50.420]
Really, a mediocre talent at best.

[02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:55.360]
And they try to build him up to be something that he's not and then they can't understand why he fails.

[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:56.460]
I don't understand that.

[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:57.940]
And he should be...

[02:05:57.940 --> 02:06:02.740]
I think rightly so he should be nervous because I think NBC is going to hang on the letterman.

[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:04.180]
But how can they afford that?

[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:05.840]
How the hell can they afford it?

[02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:07.820]
And how can...

[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:10.980]
Listen to me, how can CBS afford to offer him that money?

[02:06:11.060 --> 02:06:13.060]
They just lost a trillion dollars on baseball.

[02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:15.440]
I mean, they took the pipe on baseball.

[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:17.260]
They did.

[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:20.300]
Oh man, every long there is.

[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:21.600]
Big time on baseball.

[02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:22.140]
Yeah.

[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:23.780]
I laugh every time.

[02:06:23.780 --> 02:06:25.340]
So how the hell can they come up?

[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:31.300]
Don't you remember just a couple of years ago when CBS had all the cutbacks and they closed up their bureau here and all over the country?

[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:34.320]
They closed down all these bureaus and they fired a lot of really good people.

[02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:38.120]
In fact, who was the little guy with the white here? Fred Graham.

[02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:39.980]
He's now on board.

[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:40.920]
Everybody that was there.

[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.220]
But Fred Graham was good.

[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:42.880]
He was like...

[02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:45.040]
I had a Texas Hill Bay, the accident, but he was a good reporter.

[02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:46.140]
Now he's on court TV.

[02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:51.380]
But I mean, they fired like a whole bunch of people to make cutbacks because the economy sucked and they were dying over there.

[02:06:51.380 --> 02:06:55.000]
And now all of a sudden they got like millions for baseball and 20 million for David.

[02:06:55.220 --> 02:06:58.000]
I think they're hiding it under Dan Rather's mattress or something.

[02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:03.840]
Which everybody says, you know, it keeps crying about the money that the baseball players get.

[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:08.680]
And they keep getting the athletes, keep asking for it and they keep spending the money.

[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:12.580]
And everybody expects this golden cow to run out.

[02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:14.740]
But they exactly went out and shot him out.

[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:23.160]
It seems like somebody, somewhere has this sort of money that's just never going to run out of it.

[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:26.600]
I guess if they had a locker room at the Taj Mahal, they'd probably have a golden shower.

[02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:30.120]
Have a great New Year pal.

[02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:32.460]
And 50 million years from now, who'll give a crap, right?

[02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:33.240]
I got you.

[02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:34.120]
Have a great day.

[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.240]
We have an open line indeed.

[02:07:36.540 --> 02:07:40.340]
7-5-1 and one in Fort Myers-Fort Pierce and everything in between.

[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:41.860]
Immaculate, corkscrew.

[02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:48.200]
See, anybody can pick out like, you know, that Rick Riley picks out, what was the one?

[02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:49.480]
Newport Richie.

[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:50.680]
Well, anybody can do that.

[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:51.500]
Rick, come on.

[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:55.400]
I think that he stole my roadmap yesterday and that's how they did that.

[02:07:55.580 --> 02:08:00.420]
Because all of a sudden, everything that I had in here has disappeared mysteriously and suspiciously.

[02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:02.420]
Let's do Moral Springs.

[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:02.820]
Hello.

[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.120]
It's the gang line.

[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:05.880]
Gang line.

[02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:07.160]
Neil.

[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:07.600]
Yes.

[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:08.380]
Question for you.

[02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:09.440]
Whatever helped the big Dave.

[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:10.900]
Whatever happened to him?

[02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:12.040]
Yeah, don't hear you talk about him.

[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:15.280]
He's still around. He's in the vending business now. He's peddling it.

[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:16.320]
He's peddling it, huh?

[02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:16.500]
Yeah.

[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:17.260]
Oh.

[02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:19.940]
He's still okay. He needs a haircut, but I don't know how he's all right.

[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:20.680]
Oh, that's good.

[02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:21.680]
He lives in my neighborhood.

[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:22.620]
Oh, huh.

[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:23.600]
Couple of blocks away.

[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:26.200]
Oh, he's still taking bets for rides in your car or what?

[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:27.160]
He's doing what?

[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:27.880]
Never bet.

[02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:28.660]
The girl bet.

[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:30.720]
That Dave, you've always won the rough with.

[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:31.260]
Bet?

[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:32.240]
Bet, yeah.

[02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:35.200]
No, I remember Jill and of course I remember Kim.

[02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:39.180]
He lived with Kim for like four years and then of course they just split up again for the 85th time.

[02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:40.200]
But that won't last long.

[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:40.980]
And the bet.

[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:42.400]
Yes, now I do remember bet.

[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:43.180]
Crazy bet.

[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:43.960]
He gets around.

[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:44.760]
Yeah.

[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:45.500]
He gets his share.

[02:08:45.780 --> 02:08:46.560]
I kind of like you.

[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:47.280]
Yeah.

[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:48.140]
Right.

[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:49.920]
Anyway, that's what I wanted to know.

[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:52.880]
Well, I, you know, acquiring my, acquiring Heinz Wannano.

[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:53.620]
Have a great day.

[02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:54.140]
You too, Bob.

[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.220]
Open line and Broward, 524.

[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:57.560]
And one on the other town line.

[02:08:57.700 --> 02:08:59.220]
Come on, let's get with it there, man.

[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:02.220]
Let's get going in Punta Gorda.

[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:04.920]
Now they did, they did do Punta Gorda.

[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:06.640]
Now we had success with that, that one day.

[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:08.320]
Remember that, but it was a guy driving through.

[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:12.860]
Because nobody there is under the age of a hundred and can't get to the phone even if they would listen to this crap.

[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:16.660]
1-800-944-9, what is it?

[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:18.020]
946-3.

[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:20.620]
1-800-944-W.

[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:23.120]
If you're in Punta Gorda, if you're in the Port Charlotte.

[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:25.160]
Well, we have never had to call from Port Charlotte.

[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:25.540]
Have we?

[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:26.920]
Port Charlotte line.

[02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:29.200]
Robbie Benson is the Lord.

[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:34.520]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:36.560]
Was that Bob or Tom just in there?

[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:41.000]
You know, I hope that Tom Velvita is speaking of Bob and Tom.

[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:47.660]
I hope Tom Velvita, he was talking to him this morning before the show and he was just, he must be doing heavy duty drugs or something.

[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:52.060]
He was so happy, he was like spitting and puking and choking over the phone.

[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:53.800]
And he was something must be going on over there.

[02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:56.380]
They must be doing it as you went a lot better than we know they are.

[02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:59.560]
They must be actually selling a few spots, which for them would be a miracle.

[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:03.840]
Because they had that Cox broadcasting sales approach.

[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:08.440]
Like they go up to the client and they say, you wouldn't want to buy any spots would you?

[02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:09.560]
I didn't think so.

[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:12.180]
That's the whole approach here in sales.

[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:13.900]
But he is just ecstatic.

[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:19.520]
And I started to say I hope he really appreciates the fact that the tremendous sacrifices we've made for them.

[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.920]
For the honor of being on the great WSUN.

[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:27.200]
Bob and Tom, history, other than the Casey Kaisam thing, which they sent us.

[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.360]
See, they can also, the Jewish Polkinoes was the thing of theirs too.

[02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:32.560]
When they send you something, they can't take it back.

[02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:36.400]
And all I can say is they got a lot of goddamn nerve getting uptight.

[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:40.480]
Maybe if we gave them enough publicity, they might get their ass out of that God for a second Indianapolis.

[02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:44.540]
This is South Florida's news, traffic and weather station.

[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:50.040]
Newstalk Radio 610, WIOD, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and the Palm Beach.

[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:50.600]
On the label.

Now, the Neil Roger Show on Newstalk Radio 610, WIOD.

[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:33.360]
Inbroward, 2 hour.

[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:44.780]
Who knows the value of X? Ms. Duncan.

[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:47.720]
Hi, I'm Sandy Duncan for Perky Learning Centers.

[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:50.940]
When I was in school, the American Education System was terrific.

[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:52.580]
And I still had trouble with algebra.

[02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:55.620]
That's because I wasn't very bright and I only had one eye.

[02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:59.260]
But that didn't matter because I was Perky and all my teachers really liked me.

[02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:03.640]
Today, with up to 40 kids in a class, it's hard to get noticed, let alone to be teacher's pet.

[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:05.760]
That's where Perky Learning Centers can help.

[02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:09.860]
Perky teaches your kids how to suck up, kiss butt, and make dimples when they smile.

[02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:14.300]
Call Perky Learning Centers, P-E-R-K-Y, or I, or something like that.

[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:15.760]
I wasn't very good at spelling either.

[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:17.400]
For Christ's sake, I only had one eye.

[02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:19.780]
I was speaking of Mitch Lewis, by the way.

[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:22.160]
We'll also always remember...

[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:24.600]
There you go. We got a whole bunch of crap to remember Mitch by.

[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:29.080]
Wait a minute, let me just do something here.

[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:32.320]
Hi, I'm Emily Hasek.

[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:33.100]
You need neither.

[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:38.200]
For Christ's sake, I only had one eye.

[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:40.220]
Okay, well that's all you need to hear on that one.

[02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:43.160]
107 at WIOD, we have a couple of open lines.

[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:45.580]
They're in day-to-day. One more time, you're right.

[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:47.960]
Ah, Emily Hasek.

[02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:51.240]
It's spelling either.

[02:12:57.800 --> 02:12:59.560]
For Christ's sake, I only had one eye.

[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:03.620]
Okay, Sandy, we get to pick your, we can see it.

[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:05.520]
So you know what I'm watching now?

[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:06.840]
Family.

[02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:09.340]
What channel am I on here just a second?

[02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:10.480]
Oh, it's on WOR.

[02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:13.540]
Every day at one o'clock, it's that, because I mean,

[02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:16.560]
my watch, Santa Barbara anymore, it's going off the year any day,

[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:17.720]
and it's going to be very depressing.

[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:21.360]
And all the good people are dead except Raffa, and they've got,

[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:23.300]
he's all like bandages up and covered up anyway.

[02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:24.520]
So I waste your time.

[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:25.500]
So I'm watching family.

[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:28.960]
And there's James Broderick driving the car, which is quite a trick,

[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:29.560]
because he's dead.

[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:34.020]
And there's Seda, who's got that, oh, she's got always that look,

[02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:37.520]
always that like kind of constipated, oh, I haven't had a good

[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:39.480]
BM in years, and I'm really worried about it, look.

[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:45.300]
And he's got a real sour push on his face, and they're driving it.

[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:46.960]
Okay, let's go to Hollywood.

[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:47.360]
Hello.

[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:49.140]
Hollywood.

[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:49.740]
Hello.

[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:50.560]
Yes, sir.

[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:51.620]
Neil, how are you doing?

[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:52.120]
Great.

[02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:52.980]
Happy holidays.

[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:54.180]
And the same to you.

[02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:55.280]
And yours, and etc.

[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:56.380]
There we go.

[02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:57.540]
Uh-huh.

[02:13:57.880 --> 02:13:59.580]
Okay, I got some material for you, too.

[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:01.460]
But I'm going to go before that.

[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:04.760]
Okay, this is a request of not smooth with no tickets or nothing.

[02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:05.800]
Good, because we don't have any.

[02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:06.460]
I know that.

[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:07.140]
I've been listening.

[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:08.260]
Got some muffins, though.

[02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:11.560]
Okay, you know, that one for just $95, I believe it is.

[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:13.200]
You can become Jewish.

[02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:13.940]
Yeah.

[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:17.840]
This is from my sister-in-law, and can you get that on before you go off?

[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:19.320]
I beg your pardon.

[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:19.840]
The air.

[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:23.920]
Um, you know, something I haven't played that in ages.

[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:24.720]
I know.

[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:26.000]
They didn't get rid of it, I hope.

[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:30.160]
Uh, well, that's what I just want to check, because I don't like making any promises, and then you sit there.

[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:34.580]
Oh, boy, he's going to play it, and then I don't play it, and you're all sitting around there bitching me out.

[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:35.360]
I've got a long tape.

[02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:39.700]
Okay, well, while you're talking, I'll look for it, and the card, too.

[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:40.460]
Uh, okay.

[02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:41.340]
Can you slow her me down?

[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:41.820]
No, you can't.

[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:42.660]
Yeah, I hear you.

[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:44.560]
Okay, uh, you've heard that song, Steam.

[02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:46.700]
Steam, goodbye.

[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:47.280]
Oh, yeah.

[02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:56.540]
Okay, this is for all our Canadian friends, which you love, and especially the French ones, where it goes A-A-A, goodbye.

[02:14:57.100 --> 02:14:57.260]
Yeah.

[02:14:57.400 --> 02:14:58.500]
You can have some fun with that.

[02:14:59.340 --> 02:15:04.800]
Oh, too bad we don't still have mention Lewis here, if somebody created to do something like that, he'd have it on the air before two o'clock.

[02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:05.300]
There you go.

[02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:07.600]
I'm not going to call nobody a douchebag or nothing like that.

[02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:08.360]
Well, wait a minute.

[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:09.900]
What's the name of the thing I'm looking for?

[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:13.120]
Uh, you can become a Jewish for knife or something.

[02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:18.320]
Well, I'm just trying to figure out where the hell I would have put it in my great system here.

[02:15:18.340 --> 02:15:19.320]
And I'll find it.

[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:19.860]
It's in here.

[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:20.820]
Try to be under J.

[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:22.520]
Under J for Jewish.

[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:24.140]
I have a great new year, pal.

[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:25.240]
Okay, thanks Neil.

[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:25.780]
See you.

[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:26.120]
Bye-bye.

[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:27.180]
Bye-bye.

[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:30.040]
Uh, Earl's Stripes is the thing.

[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:34.160]
We haven't played that in a long time, I think, since the tissue ball we haven't played that.

[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:37.100]
Since we came on in four miles, we don't want to play too much yetish stuff.

[02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:38.240]
They get very upset about that.

[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:42.100]
They start getting their sheets out and getting real psychotic.

[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:44.220]
I don't know where the hell that thing is.

[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:50.160]
Well, there's so many cards that just kind of like disappear and walk out the door and you don't, you don't realize it's like the old saying.

[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:52.080]
You don't know what you got until you lose it.

[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:55.320]
You don't know that it's missed until you're looking for it.

[02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:57.800]
And then when you're looking for it and you can't find it, you miss it.

[02:15:58.240 --> 02:15:58.860]
Believe me.

[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:01.020]
Uh, it'll be around somewhere.

[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:01.560]
Maybe, huh?

[02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:02.200]
You think so?

[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:02.660]
Not.

[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:04.420]
Earl's Stripes.

[02:16:04.540 --> 02:16:05.120]
Maybe it's under S.

[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:07.060]
As in Stripes.

[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:11.420]
Hmm, maybe not.

[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:12.240]
Huh?

[02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:13.220]
Don't see it under S.

[02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:14.900]
Maybe it's under E as an Earl.

[02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:18.360]
Or maybe it's under J as in Jappy.

[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:19.600]
I don't know where the hell it is.

[02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:23.340]
I think this guy probably stole the card and he wanted to start up with me.

[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:26.660]
We have an open line in Broward 524 and two in date.

[02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:30.220]
Boy, you folks today are really on the old raggola, huh?

[02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:31.300]
What is their story?

[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:35.860]
At 7519463, it's 10 after one on the IOD Network.

[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.220]
That's the latest news from the 610 WIOD News Center each hour.

[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:43.520]
Plus an update on traffic and the current weather forecast.

[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:46.280]
WIOD!

[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:52.800]
This is Luna to spell with Don L.

[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:54.580]
I'll be Don L. Jackson.

[02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:57.100]
And today we're going to spell the word Delight.

[02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:58.700]
Spell it with me now.

[02:16:59.080 --> 02:16:59.500]
Delight.

[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:02.660]
D-E-L-I-G-H-T.

[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:05.460]
Now, let's use it in a sentence.

[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:09.900]
When I go to sleep, I always turns out Delight.

[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:12.700]
This is Luna to spell with Don L.

[02:17:13.140 --> 02:17:14.660]
I'll be Don L. Jackson.

[02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:22.440]
I'll be darned too because Earl Stripes is long gone, disappeared.

[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:26.760]
Probably miss filed somewhere or it just walked out and this guy that called is the guy that took it probably.

[02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:31.020]
We have an open line at Broward 524 and Dave is just a bizarre today.

[02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:34.460]
I can't remember any day ever that we've had this in Dave County.

[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:36.880]
And we've had it in Broward a lot but there was a reason for that.

[02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:37.820]
We don't know what it is yet.

[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:41.620]
But Dave County is just absolutely doing it.

[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:43.740]
Somewhere else they're not playing in our neighborhood today.

[02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:47.240]
They're probably all pissed off about how 105 that MOLO is getting fired.

[02:17:50.420 --> 02:17:51.480]
751-9463 and Dave.

[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:53.340]
751-W-I-O-D.

[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:55.100]
Come on, let's wake up out there, man.

[02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:58.360]
In Haya Lea, we haven't had one call from Haya Lea today.

[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:00.040]
South Miami.

[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:02.640]
In what?

[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:07.120]
Where the hell else is there is no place left in Dave County where anybody knows what's going on?

[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:09.200]
Here's Coconut Creek. Hello.

[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:10.280]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:11.640]
Okay, happy to you, sir.

[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:12.360]
Name to you, sir.

[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:16.300]
Listen, you know, if the season ended today the MAPOLO's would be in the playoffs.

[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:20.500]
The MAPOLI's have won not won but two in a row.

[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:20.860]
I know.

[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:21.620]
Whoo!

[02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:23.060]
What's going on with them?

[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:26.120]
Did you read about how they scored the winning goal last night against the islanders?

[02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:27.820]
I understand. I didn't get to read the reading here.

[02:18:27.860 --> 02:18:32.160]
Glenn Anderson takes a shot and he fanned on a shot and just got like a little piece of it.

[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:32.820]
All right.

[02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:38.960]
And the islander goalie fell back like out of the goal out of position and he just had a lie there.

[02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:45.560]
And as he was helpless out of the crease, the puck just slid, trickled into the net with 50 seconds left in the game.

[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:48.760]
And the Leafs get a greasy goal and win it and we will take it.

[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:49.520]
Unbelievable.

[02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:50.320]
It is.

[02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:50.980]
Unbelievable.

[02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:56.780]
All right. Well, I just wanted to let you know. I wanted to wish the MAPOLI's the good luck this year.

[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:00.740]
Well, we're going to pull out a little hat out of the trick bag this second half.

[02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:04.340]
Pat Burns is reactivating George. The chief Armstrong is coming back.

[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:07.000]
Well, as long as they finish above Tampa, I'm happy.

[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:08.380]
Well, right at the moment, what do you got?

[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:10.160]
About four or five points on M6 points.

[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:11.240]
Five points ahead of them.

[02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:12.060]
Five?

[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:12.500]
Five.

[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.200]
Like I said, we got a long way to go.

[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:16.180]
Pretty respectable.

[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:16.940]
Yeah, right.

[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:18.200]
Have a great new year.

[02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:18.700]
You too, sir.

[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:19.540]
See ya.

[02:19:20.060 --> 02:19:22.780]
Open line in Broward, five, two, four and two and Dave still.

[02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:24.140]
What's going on there in Dave?

[02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:25.540]
Hi, Alia North Miami.

[02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:27.500]
Miami Shore is Biscayne Park.

[02:19:28.420 --> 02:19:31.340]
Oh my God, you can't even begin a homestead.

[02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:34.640]
Norengia, P-Rine, Cutler Ridge.

[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:38.980]
West Miami, Sweetwater, Godwired, Little Havana.

[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:39.760]
Huh?

[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:41.740]
Hi, Alia.

[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:46.260]
They just don't give a flying crap about us anymore in Dave County, huh?

[02:19:46.260 --> 02:19:48.020]
I guess this is the thing in the new year.

[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:49.740]
Browards coming back, dates shipping out.

[02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:53.800]
Hey, listen, if you have it all at once, who the hell needs that?

[02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:54.800]
And look at that.

[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:56.860]
There's Kate is in the back seat of this car.

[02:19:56.920 --> 02:19:58.720]
This is a driving family show today.

[02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:00.180]
They're all in the car of the whole show.

[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:02.180]
And she's in the back seat with little baby.

[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:04.100]
And you just know they're going to get in some big wreck.

[02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:07.120]
You can just tell any second they're going to get a gigantic wreck

[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:07.680]
any minute.

[02:20:08.020 --> 02:20:09.260]
And there's Willie is on the phone.

[02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:09.800]
Well, that's good.

[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:11.500]
He's at least doing something a little more animated.

[02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:13.820]
He's such a deadhead that Willie, you know?

[02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:15.760]
Just to just bump on a log.

[02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:18.340]
Here's West Palm Beach.

[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:18.620]
Hello.

[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:19.860]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:21.380]
And got a frizzy haircut too.

[02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:23.040]
Pretty good. Happy new year to you.

[02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:23.840]
Hey, listen, man.

[02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:29.740]
I just called to say goodbye and to thank you for the entertainment you've been providing me with over the years.

[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:31.100]
Goodbye for what forever?

[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:32.940]
Well, I'm moving to Anchorage.

[02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:34.780]
Jeez, then it is forever.

[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:37.220]
Why the hell are you moving to Anchorage?

[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:39.000]
Have you taken a leave of your censors, sir?

[02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:42.300]
No, there's a big radio opportunity out there for me.

[02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:45.280]
A big radio opportunity in Anchorage?

[02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:48.540]
Well, you know, you got to do it.

[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:49.140]
You got to do it.

[02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:52.140]
You can big the big up here in West Palm or Miami.

[02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:54.080]
They don't have radio opportunities.

[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:55.580]
They don't have radio here.

[02:20:56.980 --> 02:20:59.900]
So you're going there to work in radio in Anchorage?

[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:00.220]
Yeah.

[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:00.580]
What?

[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.660]
Power 102, it's a CHR.

[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:05.000]
I'm going to be the afternoon dry.

[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:08.100]
A CHR in Anchorage, Alaska.

[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:09.500]
How the hell can you go wrong?

[02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:11.080]
How many stations have they got in Anchorage?

[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:11.980]
They've got 19.

[02:21:13.080 --> 02:21:13.800]
19 stations?

[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:14.580]
Can you believe that?

[02:21:14.740 --> 02:21:14.920]
Woo!

[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:15.820]
Oh, man.

[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:16.920]
Holy crap.

[02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:23.180]
But, you know, they don't have any here and it's just, I've been getting so sick of it and there's no decent jobs anywhere else.

[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:24.180]
I don't blame you.

[02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:25.660]
You know, getting the hell out of it.

[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:28.460]
Well, I don't know, though, but Anchorage, have you ever been up there?

[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:29.700]
Did you go there at all or is this just-

[02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:30.960]
I've never been in snow before.

[02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:32.360]
Never been in snow.

[02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:37.140]
Well, you know, one thing I've always said, if you're going to get into something for the first time, like dive right into it big time,

[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:39.580]
don't just beat around the edges, just jump right into it.

[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:40.320]
Damn right.

[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:40.900]
Right.

[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:41.500]
Alright.

[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:42.760]
You'll be back in three weeks.

[02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:44.320]
I'm telling you.

[02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:49.280]
Well, probably so, but I'll probably be back in three weeks just for them to miss you guys.

[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:50.280]
Right. There you go.

[02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:51.100]
That'll be a good excuse.

[02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:51.360]
Hey.

[02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:51.500]

[02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:52.560]
Good luck, pal.

[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:53.200]
Thanks a lot, man.

[02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:54.000]
Have a great life.

[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:54.240]
Yeah.

[02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:54.720]
Bye-bye.

[02:21:55.080 --> 02:21:55.760]
Oh, God.

[02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:56.460]
What a maniac.

[02:21:57.260 --> 02:21:58.660]
See what this business does to people?

[02:21:58.940 --> 02:22:00.080]
So, rural strides has gone.

[02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:03.640]
I just, you know, I'm not paying any attention what these people are talking about.

[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:04.960]
I'm just-

[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:05.480]

[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:05.620]
What is-

[02:24:11.740 --> 02:24:14.180]
What is-

[02:24:14.180 --> 02:24:14.300]
What is-

[02:24:14.300 --> 02:24:14.380]
What is-

[02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:14.380]

[02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:14.400]
What is-

[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:14.820]
What is-

[02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:15.740]
What is-

[02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:16.620]
What is-

[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:17.660]
What is-

[02:24:17.660 --> 02:24:17.780]
What is-

[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:18.700]
What is-

[02:24:18.700 --> 02:24:19.640]
What is-

[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:21.880]
What is-

[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:23.280]
What is-

[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:24.300]
What is-

[02:24:24.300 --> 02:24:25.260]
What is-

[02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:25.660]
What is-

[02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:25.740]
What is-

[02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:26.660]
What is-

[02:24:26.660 --> 02:24:27.560]
What is-

[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:27.940]
What is-

[02:24:27.940 --> 02:24:29.100]
What is-

[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:30.400]
What is-

[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:30.980]
What is-

[02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:31.300]
What is-

[02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:32.100]
What is-

[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:32.960]
What is-

[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:33.620]
What is-

[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:35.560]
What is-

[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:40.620]
What about-

[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:43.880]
What about-

[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:43.920]
What about-

[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:44.280]
What about-

[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:54.920]
In that time we really continue working despite everything,

[02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:56.240]
that we do not make make Bible bolt in our house

[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:56.240]

[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:03.960]
If we measure in the times of this

[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:07.140]
of broadcasting. Hockey night in Canada.

[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:12.680]
The hockey is lost. Kelly, that's the hooker. Hopefully it's left the end.

[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:15.520]
I'm going to leave. He's just going!

[02:25:17.380 --> 02:25:21.120]
Yeah. Anyway, just say happy new year.

[02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:24.720]
Don't seem too excited about all that me-police stuff I pulled out there for you.

[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:27.740]
Well, I left the beef. I did it just for you. Did you?

[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.380]
All right. You left when? I said we left the leaves.

[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:33.860]
What do you mean you left the leafs? What does that mean?

[02:25:33.860 --> 02:25:35.500]
We left the leaf. Oh, you left the leafs?

[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:38.200]
You said you left the leafs, as in behind, as in Maple Leaf Gardens.

[02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:40.500]
We're right behind the leafs all the way.

[02:25:40.660 --> 02:25:42.060]
Yeah, I bet you are way behind.

[02:25:42.660 --> 02:25:45.080]
You sound like the ghost of Harold Ballard, if you ask me.

[02:25:46.020 --> 02:25:49.140]
Harold would be turning in his grave. I think he's still spinning there.

[02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:52.220]
Why is that? Why? They actually want a couple of games.

[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:53.660]
They're here. It's better than when they're...

[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:53.700]
They're here. They're here. They're here.

[02:25:56.180 --> 02:25:58.000]
They've signed some other check, guy.

[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.280]
Well, we got all those foreigners on there, man.

[02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:03.980]
What Boria Salming wasn't bad. We got to get a few more foreigners on there.

[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:05.060]
Right up to mediocrity.

[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:08.000]
Right. And Doug Gilmore, he's doing it, not.

[02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:11.200]
I mean, he's got like 9 or 10 goals. I always love the way they look.

[02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:12.500]
Gilmore is a god. He's good.

[02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:14.220]
The guy is amazing at the same play.

[02:26:14.540 --> 02:26:15.820]
Yeah, he is good. He's very good.

[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:18.700]
And anyway. I'll believe it. He's good.

[02:26:18.980 --> 02:26:22.300]
Over here in Fort Myers, they need a few more. What can I say?

[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:25.460]
I never forget the leafs are trading away Vincent D'Amfouce, man.

[02:26:25.460 --> 02:26:29.760]
I mean, Daniel Merwaw, I can deal with that. I can cope with it, but not Vincent D'Amfouce.

[02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:30.360]
You just...

[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:31.380]
There always a crazy...

[02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:34.700]
The guy scores four goals in an all-star game and they trade him away.

[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:37.720]
They're really gonna do...

[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:39.220]
I don't know. Bring back Johnny Bauer.

[02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:40.640]
Just strap him up to the net.

[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:42.040]
Have a great new year, eh?

[02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:43.200]
Neil? Yeah.

[02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:46.360]
Love you. I just want to say a couple of people, a couple of douchebags.

[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:46.820]
Yes.

[02:26:47.140 --> 02:26:50.000]
Glenn, Susan, Carrie, and his dog, Tal. Major League.

[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:51.280]
And...

[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:52.300]
Have a good one.

[02:26:52.460 --> 02:26:52.620]
Bye-bye.

[02:26:52.620 --> 02:26:53.360]
See ya.

[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:54.460]
Foxes set a rise.

[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:57.980]
Park steals it at two on one for an all.

[02:26:58.560 --> 02:26:59.520]
Park scores!

[02:26:59.980 --> 02:27:00.260]
Hello!

[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:02.000]
Wendell Clark is God.

[02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:03.860]
Don't ever forget it either.

[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.960]
Okay, because it could be a trivia question on the Chuck Myers show Saturday morning.

[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:09.280]
We have an open line in Broward, 524.

[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:11.200]
That'd be a good one for dead or alive, Chuck.

[02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:12.860]
Bill Hewitt, Saturday morning.

[02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:14.280]
There's one to put in your little list.

[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:16.420]
Let's do the alley.

[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:16.740]
Hello.

[02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:18.260]
Hello.

[02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:18.960]
Hello.

[02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:20.460]
Yes, sir. Are you on the alley?

[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:23.220]
Yeah, I'm still on it almost off of it.

[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:25.360]
I've been on for a sense now. I could get back in the cell.

[02:27:25.980 --> 02:27:27.540]
Since you could get back in the cell?

[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:28.800]
Yeah, I was kind of...

[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:29.820]
That was Ted Bundy said, too.

[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:30.720]
I came from Naples.

[02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:32.820]
With a banjo on your knee, right?

[02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:33.500]
Right. No, no.

[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:35.880]
As you come across, you run out of coverage,

[02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:38.400]
and then you get back over here on the East Coast.

[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:39.260]
You mean they got a...

[02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:40.340]
They got a Rome spot.

[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:41.580]
They got a dead spot.

[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:42.260]
Mm-hmm.

[02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:43.280]
Yeah, I mean, is this...

[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:44.460]
Yeah, either. Yes, it is.

[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:45.220]
Oh, great.

[02:27:45.420 --> 02:27:46.740]
Well, who the hell did you think it was?

[02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:47.840]
First time caller.

[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:48.420]
Great.

[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:49.420]
Many years later.

[02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:50.000]
Yes?

[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:51.100]
Many years later.

[02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:54.440]
I tried to call you a Monday going over to Naples,

[02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:55.700]
and I believe it or not.

[02:27:56.160 --> 02:27:56.760]
You were busy.

[02:27:57.620 --> 02:27:58.740]
And I got you on the back.

[02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:00.020]
I got one question asked, you okay?

[02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:00.640]
Okay, shoot.

[02:28:00.780 --> 02:28:01.040]
Okay.

[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:03.480]
You have a dog that's a lab,

[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:05.220]
and it's got a problem with the fleas,

[02:28:05.300 --> 02:28:06.220]
and you were talking about...

[02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:07.260]
What are you talking about?

[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:08.040]
I don't have a lab,

[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:09.140]
and I don't have fleas,

[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:10.000]
and either of my dogs.

[02:28:10.260 --> 02:28:11.640]
Oh, I thought your dog gets fleas.

[02:28:12.140 --> 02:28:12.140]

[02:28:14.460 --> 02:28:14.820]
Okay.

[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:15.980]
Your dog does that.

[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:17.480]
That's fleas.

[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:18.960]
I beg your pardon?

[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:19.900]
I thought you...

[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:21.320]
I heard you on the phone,

[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:23.320]
or the radio about a week ago,

[02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:24.980]
you were talking about this dog food,

[02:28:25.020 --> 02:28:25.960]
did you gave your dog...

[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:28.340]
Oh, you were talking past tense.

[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:30.220]
Yes, I did have a bad flea problem,

[02:28:30.220 --> 02:28:31.420]
and one once upon a time,

[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:32.380]
a couple of years ago.

[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:32.780]
Right.

[02:28:33.180 --> 02:28:34.700]
And I got rid of the fleas.

[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:36.380]
I used that barracks who were in the carpets,

[02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:37.520]
and I got rid of the fleas.

[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:37.840]
Okay.

[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.480]
And then I used some good stuff on her skin,

[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:42.660]
some skin so soft from the A-von lady.

[02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:43.320]
Right, right.

[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:44.960]
And then I'm feeding them this,

[02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:45.800]
come and get it,

[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:47.100]
and there's that...

[02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:49.580]
Come and get it.

[02:28:49.780 --> 02:28:50.960]
That's the one I wanted to call.

[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:51.840]
I'll talk to you about it.

[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:54.420]
My golden retriever has got the best skin

[02:28:54.420 --> 02:28:55.620]
on the face of the earth.

[02:28:55.740 --> 02:28:55.920]
Okay.

[02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:58.560]
He is the finest dog that has ever been born.

[02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:01.280]
This dog that we have is so bad.

[02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:03.880]
One flea will turn the whole dog into skin,

[02:29:04.040 --> 02:29:04.240]
just like the white dog.

[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:06.360]
Right, because they have an allergy.

[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:07.520]
Yeah, oh, you've got a bad...

[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:08.660]
We take them to the vet,

[02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:10.180]
the vet screws around,

[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:12.300]
and rips us off for money,

[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:13.200]
and you know how they do.

[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:14.440]
You know, like a human being, you know.

[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:16.200]
Coming back and coming back,

[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:17.080]
and I'm going to tell you

[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:17.820]
that he never does any good.

[02:29:18.140 --> 02:29:19.900]
Well, where is your dog picking up the fleas?

[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:21.860]
I don't know.

[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:22.460]
Who knows, you know.

[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:23.820]
Well, what do you mean who knows?

[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:25.040]
Have any had a little chat with him

[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:26.140]
and ask him what the hell he's doing?

[02:29:27.580 --> 02:29:28.640]
Well, every time I talk to him,

[02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:29.360]
I just lick me.

[02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:31.800]
I have a friend like that.

[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:33.000]
Yeah, you have a dog like that.

[02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:33.780]
Yeah, but it's fun.

[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:35.040]
No, I didn't say I have a dog like that.

[02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:38.420]
But anyway, you've got to get rid of the fleas first,

[02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:39.920]
and you've got to do the skin so soft,

[02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:41.640]
and you've got to get the fleas out of your carpet,

[02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:42.520]
and out of your yard.

[02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:43.300]
Yeah, we do.

[02:29:43.420 --> 02:29:44.260]
No, I was just joking.

[02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:44.840]
We do that.

[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:46.200]
We got the skin so soft,

[02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:47.840]
and we spray the fleas in the house,

[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:48.540]
and all that crap.

[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:50.520]
And so what, so did you get rid of them?

[02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:52.500]
Yeah, but you know, you miss one,

[02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:54.280]
and he's back to eat himself again.

[02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:56.240]
I haven't had a flea in that,

[02:29:56.400 --> 02:29:57.660]
and my old house,

[02:29:57.760 --> 02:29:59.640]
or I had in the new house in the two and a half years,

[02:29:59.660 --> 02:30:00.620]
I haven't had a flea.

[02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:02.020]
Well, I mean, not one.

[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:04.540]
I come in every day when I come home from work,

[02:30:04.660 --> 02:30:05.680]
and I get on my hands and knees,

[02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:06.980]
and I crawl around the carpeting,

[02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:08.220]
and on the walls, and on the ceiling,

[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:10.340]
and I check, and I look in the dogs fur,

[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:11.220]
and in the backyard,

[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:12.300]
and then by that time,

[02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:13.080]
it's time to go to bed.

[02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:13.920]
Really?

[02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:14.780]
No fleas.

[02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:16.040]
Boy, it takes you a long time to go to bed.

[02:30:16.220 --> 02:30:18.100]
No, well, you got to be thorough, man,

[02:30:18.220 --> 02:30:19.660]
because like you said, if there's just one,

[02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:20.740]
that can be the end of the world.

[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:21.500]
No fleas.

[02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:23.080]
I'm telling you, come and get it.

[02:30:23.140 --> 02:30:23.800]
That dog food,

[02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:26.020]
and you don't have to go to the health food store,

[02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:28.380]
you don't have to go to some laboratory in China.

[02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:30.420]
All you do is you go in a supermarket.

[02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:32.240]
It's in a purple pig sack.

[02:30:32.460 --> 02:30:33.040]
Come and get it.

[02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:33.520]
It's great.

[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:34.420]
They love it.

[02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:35.840]
They'll come and get it.

[02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:36.760]
Believe me, and you're,

[02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:38.300]
and don't go feeding your dog,

[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:39.640]
and he can't, um,

[02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:40.520]
dog, no.

[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:42.220]
I'm repeating it to my son.

[02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:43.340]
No, can dog food.

[02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:43.620]
Right.

[02:30:44.140 --> 02:30:44.620]
Okay, that's the thing.

[02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:45.540]
Believe me, man,

[02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:46.240]
and not only that,

[02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:47.740]
but they'll be farting a lot less, too.

[02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:49.020]
Well, I don't care about that.

[02:30:49.140 --> 02:30:50.180]
Well, I care a lot.

[02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:50.900]
That's kind of fun.

[02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:51.960]
You know, I can't have a lot of food.

[02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:51.960]

[02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:53.320]
We're doing together.

[02:30:53.580 --> 02:30:54.040]
Is that it?

[02:30:54.100 --> 02:30:55.160]
Well, you can always blame the dog.

[02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:55.760]
That's right.

[02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:56.920]
Okay, have a great new year.

[02:30:57.040 --> 02:30:57.640]
One more question.

[02:30:57.800 --> 02:30:58.020]
Quickly.

[02:30:58.460 --> 02:30:58.900]
One more question.

[02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:00.400]
Okay, I've been watching this,

[02:31:00.400 --> 02:31:02.960]
what's this rush long bark after you've been talking to him,

[02:31:03.200 --> 02:31:05.200]
and I hate to say that he's kind of,

[02:31:05.580 --> 02:31:08.960]
he makes me sad to even consider myself semi-conservative.

[02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:12.120]
He's so, he like, I think he's a red herring.

[02:31:13.080 --> 02:31:14.140]
From the, for the liberals,

[02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:15.760]
they put somebody like that up to make everybody

[02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:16.980]
that semi-conservative.

[02:31:17.140 --> 02:31:17.980]
Did you say a red,

[02:31:17.980 --> 02:31:19.940]
a red garing is in Hermann garing?

[02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:21.320]
Have a great new year, pal.

[02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:22.920]
I can't stand the sound of the phone anymore.

[02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:25.180]
I mean, he's okay, but a little pushy, but God.

[02:31:26.140 --> 02:31:28.960]
Oh, man, it feels so good not to hear that noise, don't I?

[02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:31.440]
Oh, we have an open line in the starline,

[02:31:31.660 --> 02:31:33.960]
star-i-o-d, and one on the out of townline, one 800 flea.

[02:31:35.060 --> 02:31:36.380]
And let's do, uh, Miami.

[02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:36.760]
Hello.

[02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:39.400]
Miami at a power line, yes.

[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:40.080]
Oh, Neil, yes.

[02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:42.880]
I'm gonna go up the tampa next weekend.

[02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:43.780]
Bad move.

[02:31:44.140 --> 02:31:44.540]
Bad move.

[02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:46.000]
I'm just kidding. Just pulling your leg.

[02:31:46.220 --> 02:31:48.660]
Okay, I wanted to know if a tampa-feet lighting

[02:31:48.660 --> 02:31:50.120]
was playing either a Friday or Saturday.

[02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:51.840]
Well, you know, something you would have come

[02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:53.760]
to the right place, but that damn Roger,

[02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:54.260]
oh, wait a minute.

[02:31:54.620 --> 02:31:56.200]
Uh, no, this is the Marlon schedule.

[02:31:56.780 --> 02:31:57.560]
So help me.

[02:31:57.620 --> 02:31:59.380]
If he threw out my lightning schedule,

[02:31:59.580 --> 02:32:00.800]
I'm gonna be apple-plectic.

[02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:02.200]
I had all my stuff in here.

[02:32:02.540 --> 02:32:02.680]
Oh.

[02:32:03.140 --> 02:32:05.760]
You know, Roger, you make me nauseous, dammit.

[02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:07.340]
But what the hell did he do with all my crap?

[02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:10.920]
Got some goddamn nerve coming in here and throwing out all the stuff

[02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:12.680]
I had in my file cabinet here,

[02:32:12.820 --> 02:32:13.780]
and he threw it all out.

[02:32:13.860 --> 02:32:15.980]
I know it was him, because nobody else would have done that.

[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:19.500]
Mr. Clean, Clean Your Stuff Out, crap.

[02:32:19.660 --> 02:32:20.560]
I don't know what the hell is.

[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:22.500]
Well, somebody over there will call in.

[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:23.240]
When is it gonna be?

[02:32:23.780 --> 02:32:25.420]
It's off. I'm going Friday or Saturday.

[02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:27.600]
I mean, I'll be there Friday and Saturday, so.

[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:28.480]
Of this week?

[02:32:28.820 --> 02:32:30.060]
Not this week, but next weekend.

[02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:31.000]
The next weekend.

[02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:33.480]
Well, somebody will call in who's got a schedule

[02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:35.200]
and the Roger makes me puke.

[02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:35.980]
Okay.

[02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:36.940]
And have a good time.

[02:32:37.060 --> 02:32:37.460]
You two, then.

[02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:38.140]
See ya.

[02:32:38.840 --> 02:32:39.160]
What?

[02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:40.760]
Somebody's on there already on 9?

[02:32:41.260 --> 02:32:41.500]
Hello.

[02:32:42.140 --> 02:32:42.920]
And you all, how you doing?

[02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:43.960]
Pretty good. You got a schedule?

[02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:46.580]
Lightening are on their longest road trip of the season.

[02:32:46.660 --> 02:32:47.280]
Oh, that's right.

[02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:49.640]
They don't come back home till January 16th.

[02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:50.200]
Oh, thank God.

[02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:51.160]
I got to go off the phone,

[02:32:51.260 --> 02:32:52.860]
so I don't have to give them the bad news in person.

[02:32:52.980 --> 02:32:53.800]
They're long gone.

[02:32:54.040 --> 02:32:54.600]
Yeah, you're right.

[02:32:54.740 --> 02:32:55.880]
This is that big, long stretch.

[02:32:56.060 --> 02:32:57.320]
And then, of course, the 21st.

[02:32:57.360 --> 02:32:57.980]
They'll be home with them.

[02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.100]
Ape leaves. I'll be there.

[02:32:59.340 --> 02:32:59.880]
Do or die.

[02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:00.620]
Hey, leaves.

[02:33:01.120 --> 02:33:03.000]
Now, do you think that I'll have a little problem

[02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.240]
being in that very small arena?

[02:33:05.700 --> 02:33:06.960]
Depends on where your seats are.

[02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:09.320]
With all those Yahoo's in there screaming,

[02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:10.540]
go, leaves, go.

[02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:12.740]
I just don't think I'm going to be doing that.

[02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:14.160]
You're going to have a lot of them.

[02:33:14.260 --> 02:33:15.380]
I'll just say it under my breath.

[02:33:15.680 --> 02:33:16.320]
Go, leaves, go.

[02:33:16.600 --> 02:33:17.880]
I'll just whisper it to myself.

[02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:19.980]
Huh? Yeah, I think that's the best idea.

[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:20.580]
There you go.

[02:33:20.860 --> 02:33:22.040]
It's the prudent thing to do.

[02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:23.560]
This is the lighting's do or die,

[02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:26.000]
because if they fall apart on this road trip,

[02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.780]
they're going to be out of the playoff show.

[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:29.860]
Well, yeah, but they gave you a good run for your money.

[02:33:29.860 --> 02:33:30.760]
And you leave us alone.

[02:33:30.980 --> 02:33:32.500]
Okay, we'd like to get into playoffs,

[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:35.220]
at least one time before the Miami team gets in.

[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:36.040]
They're not over yet.

[02:33:36.620 --> 02:33:37.040]
You're right.

[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:39.000]
Now, they're playing good hockey.

[02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:39.440]
Yeah.

[02:33:40.180 --> 02:33:40.900]
Okay, thanks.

[02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:41.940]
Okay, thank you.

[02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:42.360]
See ya.

[02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:42.800]
See ya.

[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:44.600]
Okay, there was the deal.

[02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:45.880]
It was that Tom Velvita.

[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:46.940]
It sounded just like Tom.

[02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:48.020]
Only a little more animated.

[02:33:48.220 --> 02:33:48.800]
Couldn't have been Tom.

[02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:51.540]
So we couldn't find the Earl Strite's thing.

[02:33:51.620 --> 02:33:53.080]
And obviously, the guy never called you back

[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:55.200]
because it's not the 91 best, though.

[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:56.480]
I think it was the previous year,

[02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:58.580]
which maybe we got one of those in there.

[02:33:59.040 --> 02:33:59.400]
Huh?

[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:01.360]
No?

[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:03.000]
Well, I don't know.

[02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:05.000]
I'm doing a damn best I can for this guy

[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.760]
because he said before the end of the show,

[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:08.040]
and of course, you know it's a put on

[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:09.400]
and whoever took the card out of here

[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:10.780]
probably is like his boyfriend.

[02:34:11.900 --> 02:34:13.840]
And oh, call up Neil and ask for the car

[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:15.040]
because we know it's not in there anymore.

[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:15.740]
That kind of stuff.

[02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:18.600]
That happens every goddamn day, every day.

[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:21.340]
Maybe it's Joey's boyfriend.

[02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:21.820]
I don't know.

[02:34:21.940 --> 02:34:23.840]
Joey probably is fingering the stuff in here.

[02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:28.020]
It's like letting the fox into the chicken coop.

[02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:30.020]
I don't see it.

[02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:32.980]
And of course, that was another Mitch Lewis gem.

[02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:36.420]
That was a Mitch Lewis with little Laura classic.

[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:37.480]
I wonder how Laura's doing.

[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:39.420]
Every once in a while, I see her at Doris Market

[02:34:39.860 --> 02:34:41.020]
or at the supermarket.

[02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:41.960]
How you doing, Laura?

[02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:42.620]
We love you.

[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:44.060]
And let me tell you, Laura,

[02:34:44.060 --> 02:34:45.520]
it will make you feel good to know

[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:47.140]
that when they blew your ass out of here,

[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:49.460]
this place became a toilet.

[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:52.360]
A total toilet.

[02:34:52.580 --> 02:34:53.880]
I mean, the copy situation,

[02:34:54.180 --> 02:34:57.300]
the whole sales situation just became a nightmare

[02:34:57.300 --> 02:34:59.020]
when they blew little Laura's ass out of here.

[02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:00.080]
And the only reason they did that is because

[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:01.540]
Boy Gary hated her like poison.

[02:35:01.940 --> 02:35:02.940]
That's the reason they did it.

[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:05.080]
So I don't know where the hell that thing is.

[02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:07.220]
It's not on the 91, it's not on the 92,

[02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:08.540]
and maybe it's on the 90,

[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:10.320]
and if we can't find a tough luck,

[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:11.420]
Boka.

[02:35:11.700 --> 02:35:12.080]
Come on, Dave.

[02:35:12.860 --> 02:35:13.180]
Okay.

[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:13.860]
All right.

[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:14.500]
Hey, Neil.

[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:15.600]
What's going on in there?

[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:17.420]
What's going on in the background?

[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:18.440]
I can't find my car.

[02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:19.520]
Have you seen my father in you?

[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:20.040]
Huh?

[02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:21.880]
Somebody's bothering you in the back there.

[02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:22.940]
Yeah, I'm going to cut the crap.

[02:35:23.100 --> 02:35:23.900]
Gary's bothering me.

[02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:25.040]
Yeah, leave him alone, Gary.

[02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:26.940]
So anyway.

[02:35:26.940 --> 02:35:30.620]
Anyways, I got a crap load of stuff to talk about here.

[02:35:30.620 --> 02:35:31.400]
Okay, let's get right.

[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:32.720]
Let's stuff down as I'm going along,

[02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:33.140]
and take a look.

[02:35:33.140 --> 02:35:34.500]
Let's lay down some crap here.

[02:35:34.860 --> 02:35:36.900]
First of all, the game, Miami game.

[02:35:37.220 --> 02:35:37.380]
Yeah.

[02:35:37.780 --> 02:35:38.180]
Sunday.

[02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:39.040]
Terrible.

[02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:40.260]
Oh, nauseated.

[02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:42.120]
Did you see when I saw it all?

[02:35:42.540 --> 02:35:45.240]
He threw a pass and it was an interception.

[02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:49.420]
And the camera did a close-up on his face.

[02:35:49.820 --> 02:35:50.360]
And you did it.

[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:51.940]
And he'd lip-sync.

[02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:54.160]
M and F in bull shot.

[02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:54.840]
Yeah.

[02:35:55.140 --> 02:35:55.580]
Right.

[02:35:55.580 --> 02:35:57.200]
Yeah, I saw it.

[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:00.420]
And then they put it back in a small mold.

[02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:00.920]
Right.

[02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:01.840]
Yeah.

[02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:03.820]
Speaking of movies.

[02:36:03.980 --> 02:36:06.540]
I think that the lip readers of America,

[02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:08.140]
the deaf people are going to go to the FCC

[02:36:08.140 --> 02:36:09.840]
and start complaining about this crap.

[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:10.340]
Yeah.

[02:36:11.420 --> 02:36:13.100]
This Amy Fisher crap.

[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:14.620]
I didn't see it.

[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:15.220]
I didn't see it.

[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:15.920]
I taped it.

[02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:18.420]
Because I was at the track Monday night, huh?

[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:19.300]
You haven't watched it yet.

[02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:19.880]
No.

[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:21.080]
Is it good?

[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:25.460]
Yeah, but definitely the NBC movie is her story.

[02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:29.960]
And I'm not sure if it's ABC that's going to do history.

[02:36:30.700 --> 02:36:34.240]
And then CBS is going to do both of them together.

[02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:35.880]
Well, no, CBS already did it.

[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:36.820]
Or no, was NBC.

[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:38.140]
NBC, I see.

[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:38.220]

[02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:39.740]
Well, was it good?

[02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:40.980]
Yeah, it was pretty good.

[02:36:41.060 --> 02:36:42.220]
Because my mother said it was great.

[02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:44.300]
And of course, her taste is marginal at best.

[02:36:44.820 --> 02:36:47.420]
I wish I were to tape that she had an interview on.

[02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:49.080]
Because she thought a few good men was terminal.

[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:51.680]
And everybody else I talked to said it was a tremendous movie.

[02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:52.540]
Yeah.

[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:55.700]
Just 9 o'clock warm up in the morning.

[02:36:55.700 --> 02:36:56.520]
What is the deal?

[02:36:56.720 --> 02:36:57.860]
I have nothing to do with that.

[02:36:58.400 --> 02:36:59.800]
I mean, what is with Mary?

[02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:02.320]
He's always, first through he had a half an hour off.

[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:03.520]
Now he's taking a whole hour off.

[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:03.740]
Right.

[02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:06.540]
Well, pretty soon he's going to be on from 5.30 to 6 in the morning.

[02:37:07.180 --> 02:37:09.780]
I was going to say, why don't you just start at 5.30 and just go away?

[02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:10.440]
He's going to say, he's going to say,

[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:15.240]
Uga Buga and hold on to what you all got and read a couple of birthdays and go back home and go to sleep.

[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:18.820]
But it is fine to go listen back to the old things.

[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:24.580]
Well, whatever turns you on, I mean, if you enjoy George works his ass off to put that crap together

[02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:26.300]
and try to make it a meaningful hour.

[02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:28.860]
He's really doing it.

[02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:30.060]
That's what he told me this morning.

[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:33.500]
And then you add all the little stuff here in there that you should add it before.

[02:37:33.780 --> 02:37:36.960]
Yeah, I threw a few little goodies in there because I'm sitting here doing nothing anyway.

[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:38.320]
So I might as well toss something in there.

[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:41.020]
So it's way till you look at these muffins in here, man.

[02:37:41.020 --> 02:37:42.780]
You are going to jump up and down and scream.

[02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:46.180]
I remember when the Simpsons came out, he just cannot stand anybody called.

[02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:51.400]
If you try to look at the Simpsons and see what you like about it.

[02:37:51.460 --> 02:37:51.600]
Right.

[02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:53.120]
Well, I agree with him.

[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:55.720]
I did like the Simpsons but it was in an out-type fat.

[02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:56.300]
In and out.

[02:37:56.780 --> 02:37:57.940]
Kind of like Star Trek.

[02:37:58.160 --> 02:37:59.560]
The new thing is just Rand Stimpy.

[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:00.860]
Have you seen that?

[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:01.140]
No.

[02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:02.380]
Oh, man.

[02:38:04.060 --> 02:38:08.420]
Rand Stimpy makes the Simpsons look like kindergarten.

[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:09.120]

[02:38:09.900 --> 02:38:11.800]
If I went apart, I'll do it myself.

[02:38:12.020 --> 02:38:12.680]
There's a couple of things.

[02:38:13.180 --> 02:38:15.540]
There's a couple of things that these characters say.

[02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:17.880]
That would be excellent for a card.

[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:20.500]
And I'd like to give you a couple.

[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:23.300]
Okay, fast because I'm already like four minutes past the break.

[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:23.960]
Okay.

[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:25.840]
What are you trying to do?

[02:38:26.100 --> 02:38:26.980]
Make me puke?

[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:28.880]
Cripes.

[02:38:29.300 --> 02:38:30.460]
What is that smell?

[02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:33.600]
Okay.

[02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:34.360]
Later.

[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:34.900]
See ya.

[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:35.460]
Smell this.

[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.340]
140 on EID Network.

[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:45.300]
Miss the Weekend magazine featuring the latest news, information, trends, and what's happening this Saturday and Sunday morning right here.

[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:47.840]
Tell me why you're T.

[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:49.540]
Hey, I'm busy here, man.

[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:50.820]
What kind of a break was that?

[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:57.860]
Suts is in here getting a muffin and I'm busy looking around for that Earl Strikes, which I guarantee you something.

[02:38:58.100 --> 02:38:59.240]
Because this happens all the time.

[02:38:59.340 --> 02:39:00.380]
And look, we got the short court.

[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:02.020]
I can't even stand up and do it here.

[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:03.880]
No 90s in the closet.

[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:04.560]
I just checked.

[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:07.100]
There are no 90s in the closet.

[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:08.240]
Anybody we know in there?

[02:39:09.180 --> 02:39:10.080]
No, don't say it.

[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:10.980]
Please don't say it.

[02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:11.940]
He's so damn sensitive.

[02:39:14.100 --> 02:39:15.040]
Anyway, it's 144.

[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:16.880]
We can't find Earl Strikes.

[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:21.580]
And I'm just going to say right now that do ever the guy was that called with his big story that he made up about.

[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:23.760]
They've always got the story.

[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:28.780]
That grandma and grandpa who are like just under verge are going to die in about a half an hour.

[02:39:29.260 --> 02:39:33.040]
And before they croak, it would just make their whole life if we could play or whatever the hell it is.

[02:39:33.340 --> 02:39:37.120]
And then you look for it and it's gone and it turns out that these are the people that stole a card.

[02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:43.980]
So bring back our cards, pal, and cut the crap.

[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:47.620]
God, it's enough to make you a puke.

[02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:48.720]
I don't have a bone spot.

[02:39:49.100 --> 02:39:51.240]
We have an open line and Broward 5241.

[02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:55.200]
That's our, that she's like our regular once a week.

[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:56.260]
We get her from Davy.

[02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:56.580]
Okay.

[02:39:57.320 --> 02:39:59.480]
I guess the horse turned her down this week, huh?

[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:03.060]
So anyway, I still can't find.

[02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:08.440]
Let me give you that real slowly that AT&T came up with a house hotline number real slowly.

[02:40:09.380 --> 02:40:09.860]
One.

[02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:18.080]
Well, if you leave some dead air that delay builds back up again real quick.

[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:18.420]
Okay.

[02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:25.060]
1-800-852-0006.

[02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:27.700]
There it goes.

[02:40:27.700 --> 02:40:28.340]
Look at that.

[02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:32.280]
And we have 92,969.

[02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:34.260]
The mail hasn't even come by here yet today.

[02:40:34.420 --> 02:40:35.540]
So we're doing pretty damn well.

[02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:36.860]
Miami, hello.

[02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:39.120]
Hey, happy new year now.

[02:40:39.300 --> 02:40:41.960]
And the same to you, sir, and the same to that bitch that just called.

[02:40:42.100 --> 02:40:43.900]
Oh, I think that's the loose guy's wife.

[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:44.640]
It could be.

[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:49.440]
Yeah, you know, the guy on the alley had a point about him, you know, with, I think the guy has fleas, you know.

[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:50.880]
That might be it.

[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:51.800]
I saw him eating himself.

[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:53.260]
I know something crawled up in there.

[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:56.280]
Anyway, I saw the hockey highlights this morning.

[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:57.940]
Yes, and wild night, huh?

[02:40:58.060 --> 02:40:59.520]
The fires were going crazy.

[02:40:59.540 --> 02:41:01.100]
scored 10 goals.

[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:06.380]
And the kid in the Chicago game, they got busted into mouth at 100 stitches.

[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:07.240]
I didn't see that.

[02:41:07.260 --> 02:41:08.360]
Oh, awesome.

[02:41:08.660 --> 02:41:10.560]
People here are going to love hockey, you know.

[02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:11.380]
Yes, they are.

[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:14.480]
You know, all the people at the mall the other day were going to let that guy to jump.

[02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:15.380]
But they like violence.

[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:16.620]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:20.280]
Of course, I like it for the wrong reason, but we don't care as long as they buy the ticket and show up.

[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:21.020]
Oh, yeah.

[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:22.240]
What the hell can we do about it?

[02:41:22.820 --> 02:41:24.280]
Yeah, so listen, I had a question.

[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:24.780]
Yes.

[02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:27.320]
I was watching in living color the other night.

[02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:28.180]
How are you pressing?

[02:41:28.460 --> 02:41:29.420]
Yeah, seriously.

[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:31.600]
But the guy said, mo foe.

[02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:33.220]
Similar to what the other guy you dumped.

[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:36.240]
Is that, I mean, you know, that, can you say mo foe?

[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:38.600]
Yes, and we give you mo foe your money.

[02:41:38.660 --> 02:41:39.320]
What's wrong with that?

[02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:40.000]
Oh, okay.

[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:43.560]
And all depends on how you take it if I can say that.

[02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:43.860]
Yeah.

[02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:44.800]
I'm going to say that either.

[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:47.120]
Well, it was funny.

[02:41:47.340 --> 02:41:49.240]
This business about, can you say this?

[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:56.120]
See, that's what bothers me about people in this country is that they accept the worst kinds of absolutely unacceptable repression

[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:02.800]
if our ancestors, if the founding fathers would have been as wimpy as we are, we'd all be in camp somewhere right now.

[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:09.800]
I just, I can't believe that people are willing to accept all these infringements that are just arbitrarily made up by a bunch of fascist assholes.

[02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:10.880]
Oh, can we say this?

[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:11.640]
Oh, can we say this?

[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:16.900]
And then we sit back and tremble waiting for them to have like a meeting up there to decide whether it's okay or not.

[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:18.840]
Yeah, we're definitely living in fear.

[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:22.760]
But we only got, let's see, one and the twilight, three weeks to go.

[02:42:22.820 --> 02:42:24.100]
Oh, God, I can't wait.

[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:24.500]
Yeah.

[02:42:24.940 --> 02:42:26.540]
Hey, are you going out anywhere tomorrow night?

[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:28.440]
I'm going to pop it up park tomorrow night.

[02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:30.500]
How about afterwards for the ball drop?

[02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:32.160]
For the ball drop?

[02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:34.280]
You know, the apple.

[02:42:34.460 --> 02:42:36.860]
I wonder if Alex is going to have the ball drop on the years.

[02:42:37.060 --> 02:42:38.380]
That's something we're all waiting for.

[02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:42.420]
No, we're going to be, they're having a bash there at tomorrow night.

[02:42:42.420 --> 02:42:44.460]
So right at the track, I guess we'll watch the ball drop.

[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:45.140]
Oh, okay.

[02:42:45.140 --> 02:42:46.540]
Well, I guess we'll see.

[02:42:46.660 --> 02:42:47.660]
I'll be out on South Beach.

[02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:48.860]
But we love you.

[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:49.320]
Okay.

[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:50.000]
See ya.

[02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:50.660]
Have a great life.

[02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:54.760]
We have an open line in Broward, 524 and 2 in date.

[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:57.080]
So I guess we all got to watch the ball drop tomorrow night, huh?

[02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:58.580]
So there is hope after all.

[02:42:58.740 --> 02:42:59.000]
Alex?

[02:42:59.980 --> 02:43:00.480]
Mona Lisa?

[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:01.920]
Mona Lisa?

[02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:02.900]
Mona Lisa?

[02:43:02.900 --> 02:43:03.020]
Mona Lisa?

[02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:03.740]
Oh, God.

[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:06.040]
If you could only see that child.

[02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:09.060]
You just would be rolling on the floor holding your things right now.

[02:43:10.100 --> 02:43:11.800]
148 on the IOD network.

[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:15.020]
Here's Chuck Meyer, Joey Reynolds, Tom Hopkins,

[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:19.400]
Giamonditch and Randy Rhodes each week at right here.

[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:26.800]
I just noticed something that in one of your interviews with John Candy,

[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:28.640]
I believe it looked like an older interview.

[02:43:28.820 --> 02:43:30.240]
You had less hair than you have today.

[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:31.600]
How do you explain that?

[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:33.380]
I don't wear a wig, sir.

[02:43:33.660 --> 02:43:34.460]
Paint your ball spot.

[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:35.680]
What ball spot?

[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:37.140]
You paint your ball spot?

[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:39.800]
I don't know when you're talking about, sir.

[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:40.560]
My hair grows.

[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:42.300]
You paint your ball spot.

[02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:43.680]
I don't have a ball spot.

[02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:45.920]
How come you had less hair on the tape?

[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:47.660]
Maybe my hair grew.

[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:49.600]
Maybe I had a bad haircut that day.

[02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:50.900]
You paint the way something.

[02:43:51.540 --> 02:43:52.160]
What do you care?

[02:43:53.300 --> 02:43:54.200]
Paint your ball spot?

[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:54.860]
I don't.

[02:43:54.980 --> 02:43:56.200]
Do you paint your ball spot?

[02:43:56.380 --> 02:43:57.520]
Paint your ball spot?

[02:43:57.820 --> 02:43:58.660]
Yes, I do.

[02:43:58.960 --> 02:43:59.400]
152.

[02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:01.520]
So we're having this big meeting on Monday,

[02:44:02.340 --> 02:44:04.880]
and we're having it from 2 to 2.45.

[02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:08.760]
Now, I assume the reason we were having it at that hour

[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:11.340]
was because that's like a transition hour.

[02:44:12.320 --> 02:44:12.760]
What?

[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:15.700]
No, no, but I'm just saying that I thought

[02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:18.160]
they'd be sticking something on between 2 and 3

[02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:21.280]
and that you guys would be in the meeting.

[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:23.160]
And you're not?

[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:23.860]
No, I'm not.

[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:26.340]
Well, how can they have a staff meeting with a whole staff?

[02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:27.340]
And you're not, oh.

[02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:28.720]
Well, that's how they tell you.

[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:29.420]
Oh.

[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:32.660]
Well, you got to admit that is original.

[02:44:33.020 --> 02:44:35.520]
It's like saying, the whole staff is invited.

[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:36.740]
Everybody must be there.

[02:44:36.740 --> 02:44:39.000]
And Ricken says, by the way, don't bother showing up.

[02:44:42.820 --> 02:44:43.780]
Well, that's OK.

[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:45.540]
There's always a mumbling radio.

[02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:47.240]
I mean, stands on.

[02:44:47.460 --> 02:44:49.320]
Oh, in fact, no, what do you guys look a little depressed?

[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:51.260]
You got some heavy competition starting Monday.

[02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:52.240]
Who's that, Bernie?

[02:44:53.020 --> 02:44:53.200]
Huh?

[02:44:53.740 --> 02:44:54.560]
The Milky Way guy.

[02:44:55.020 --> 02:44:55.180]
Milky.

[02:44:55.780 --> 02:44:56.680]
Oh, what the hell is that?

[02:44:57.120 --> 02:44:58.860]
Oh, that must be stand on there right now.

[02:44:59.740 --> 02:45:02.020]
Yeah, I don't know if they can handle that radio mumbling thing

[02:45:02.020 --> 02:45:02.420]
on Monday.

[02:45:02.420 --> 02:45:03.420]
That's going to be heavy duty.

[02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:05.700]
Here's, uh, highly is gone.

[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:06.520]
Poppano.

[02:45:08.300 --> 02:45:08.660]
Poppano.

[02:45:10.480 --> 02:45:10.840]
Poppano.

[02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:13.360]
Park, 7th, 30 tonight.

[02:45:13.700 --> 02:45:14.520]
Here's, Boyton Beach.

[02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:14.840]
Hello.

[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:15.720]
Uncle Neil.

[02:45:15.980 --> 02:45:16.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:17.120]
How you doing?

[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:18.540]
Another hum-ridden phone.

[02:45:18.920 --> 02:45:19.940]
I'm sorry, I'm at a 7-11.

[02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:20.580]
Wow.

[02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:22.840]
Ironically, the same one my girlfriend drove my car through.

[02:45:23.180 --> 02:45:23.480]
Uh-huh.

[02:45:23.820 --> 02:45:26.700]
I'm like, I started out with a little happy-hine, I can tell you.

[02:45:27.060 --> 02:45:27.300]
Yes.

[02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:28.300]
And also, I have a question.

[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:28.800]
A little fat.

[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:29.800]
Maybe you can settle for me.

[02:45:29.860 --> 02:45:30.800]
OK, we can do it.

[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.140]
Me and my friend were discussing the heat last year.

[02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:34.900]
And he said, I have no idea.

[02:45:34.900 --> 02:45:36.040]
He said they were 7-0.

[02:45:36.980 --> 02:45:37.700]
They went what?

[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:38.440]
7-0.

[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:39.060]
What do you mean?

[02:45:39.260 --> 02:45:40.120]
7-1 wins no losses.

[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:42.020]
What do you mean they went 7-0 win?

[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:43.060]
They're beginning to see you.

[02:45:43.140 --> 02:45:43.640]
That's correct.

[02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:44.860]
They did go 7-0?

[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:45.520]
That's what Alex said.

[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:46.780]
That's what Mona Lisa just said.

[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:47.940]
Uh-uh, lost some big money.

[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:49.180]
You're in trouble now.

[02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:51.980]
Oh, and also like to tell you a little, uh, dog's flea story.

[02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:52.600]
OK.

[02:45:52.740 --> 02:45:54.460]
My mom got this powder for my dog.

[02:45:54.460 --> 02:45:55.460]
She had really bad fleas.

[02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:55.840]
Yeah.

[02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:57.800]
She got this powder and she put it all over the house.

[02:45:58.240 --> 02:45:58.440]
Yeah.

[02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:00.220]
And then after like a week, she vacuumed it all up.

[02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:02.040]
And if the fleas jump into the carpet,

[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:04.060]
they get dehydrated and they just die right there.

[02:46:04.060 --> 02:46:06.560]
So we have an athlete for like a year and a half now.

[02:46:06.860 --> 02:46:07.380]
And wait a minute.

[02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:09.080]
We've done it once about a year ago and that's it.

[02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:09.720]
Right.

[02:46:10.300 --> 02:46:10.900]
That's it.

[02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:11.320]
All right.

[02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:12.640]
I just lift everyone to the right.

[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:14.220]
We're going to go out to the vacuum amount.

[02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:16.240]
Well listen, have a great life and get a new phone.

[02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:16.840]
We're talking about an adieu start.

[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:17.160]
Sure.

[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:20.280]
Uh, Joe, you're feeding your football, kicking, mind me, hurricane.

[02:46:20.540 --> 02:46:20.760]
Love it.

[02:46:20.860 --> 02:46:21.100]
Okay.

[02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:24.580]
God, oh, it feels so good now to get that home off the ear.

[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:24.900]
Oh.

[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:28.240]
Oh, the sounds of silence are so comforting.

[02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:31.940]
Let's go to a bokeh on the starline.

[02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:33.060]
Hello, Neil.

[02:46:33.460 --> 02:46:34.040]
Hello, there.

[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:34.820]
How you doing?

[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:35.560]

[02:46:35.780 --> 02:46:37.260]
Uh, how's my phone sound?

[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:39.460]
You're phone in too bad compared to these others.

[02:46:39.580 --> 02:46:41.080]
This is my brand new portable.

[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:42.120]
Well, congratulations.

[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:44.620]
You got yourself a not so bad phone.

[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:45.480]
Got it for Christmas.

[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:47.240]
Not great, but not bad.

[02:46:47.620 --> 02:46:48.140]
Oh, okay.

[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:48.620]
Here.

[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:50.120]
Spy report for you.

[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:50.540]
Yes.

[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:53.440]
Um, your buddy over there at the light bulb.

[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:53.980]
Yeah.

[02:46:54.340 --> 02:46:55.760]
Um, Mr. Sliderman.

[02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:56.360]
Yeah.

[02:46:56.800 --> 02:46:58.500]
You're using your shot word now.

[02:46:58.880 --> 02:46:59.500]
Is he really?

[02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:00.120]
Yes.

[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:03.940]
I was listening to last night and he kept correcting people and everything.

[02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:04.940]
I was using this out.

[02:47:05.100 --> 02:47:07.760]
Well, you know, something he's still not getting any publicity on his show.

[02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:10.360]
They're just not enough people wasting their time with that.

[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:12.640]
And I can't imagine that you would indulge in that.

[02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:14.540]
Well, I love your show.

[02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:15.020]
Yeah.

[02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:18.320]
And you have a happy new year and I hope you make a million dollars next year.

[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:18.740]
Okay.

[02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:19.380]
All right.

[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:19.920]
And you too.

[02:47:20.980 --> 02:47:21.380]
Okay.

[02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:23.740]
Here's a guy in desperate search of a life if he's listening to that.

[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:25.160]
156.

[02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:30.500]
Don't forget that AT&T Camilo's House Hotline number 1-800-852-0006.

[02:47:31.160 --> 02:47:33.380]
We got today and tomorrow we got the mail coming in.

[02:47:33.380 --> 02:47:37.760]
And we could be somewhere between 95 and 100,000 by the end of the year, which is tomorrow.

[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:40.840]
And then we got the entire month of the January to go.

[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:41.720]
So we are doing it.

[02:47:42.180 --> 02:47:43.000]
Palm Beach Gardens.

[02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:43.620]
Yeah.

[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:44.320]
Hey, I didn't know.

[02:47:44.820 --> 02:47:45.140]
Okay.

[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:46.780]
I want to call.

[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:48.280]
Who do you think will win Alabama, Miami?

[02:47:49.460 --> 02:47:50.700]
I mean, we know who's always going to win.

[02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:51.760]
What does that mean?

[02:47:51.940 --> 02:47:53.060]
Who do I think is going to win?

[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:55.880]
Why do people call up radio stations and ask, who do you think of me?

[02:47:55.980 --> 02:47:56.900]
Who do you want to win?

[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.020]
Who do I want to win?

[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:00.820]
I want to see Alabama win 175 to nothing.

[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:01.260]
Yes.

[02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:05.740]
And I think Miami will kick the living crap out of them is what I think.

[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:06.320]
Yeah, you're probably right.

[02:48:06.460 --> 02:48:07.240]
That is correct.

[02:48:07.380 --> 02:48:08.700]
But, uh, nothing.

[02:48:09.340 --> 02:48:14.360]
What kind of spit does the guy say before the Ford commercial that, you know, the quick, quick talking?

[02:48:14.820 --> 02:48:15.720]
What kind of spit?

[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:16.160]
Yeah.

[02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:17.660]
Probably bullspit.

[02:48:18.580 --> 02:48:20.100]
Let's do a lady in sunrise.

[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:20.600]
Hello.

[02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:21.800]
Hello, Neil.

[02:48:22.100 --> 02:48:22.320]
Hi.

[02:48:22.500 --> 02:48:24.080]
Hi, I'm a first time caller.

[02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:24.580]
Great.

[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:30.440]
I just wanted to, uh, I have a complaint about, like, all these tourists that are down here.

[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:30.840]
Yes.

[02:48:31.120 --> 02:48:34.680]
The way that they drive, I mean, it's like it's not so bad that they're down here.

[02:48:35.020 --> 02:48:39.600]
But for them to, like, all of a sudden be driving and then stop in the middle of the road.

[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:43.320]
They don't even pull over to, like, look at direction or ask directions.

[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:47.680]
And it's just, I mean, I don't know if they can, like, came down here to kill people or what?

[02:48:47.980 --> 02:48:54.720]
They came down here to be obnoxious and disgusting and to fit right in with the ambiance of the area and they're doing a perfect job.

[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:58.180]
And they, and they, like, go out to places like restaurants and bars.

[02:48:58.180 --> 02:49:00.260]
And they can't even sit there and relax.

[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:05.240]
They just, like, start screaming at, like, the servers and bartenders and hosts.

[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:06.280]
And it's just not fair.

[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:12.400]
Well, I think what you ought to do is every time you see a tourist, you ought to get this, just stand right up and start jumping up and down and scream.

[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:13.780]
Go back where you came from.

[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:14.500]
I almost did.

[02:49:14.780 --> 02:49:15.500]
I wouldn't blame you.

[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:20.140]
I was in a restaurant yesterday and I started, you know, screaming at this guy, you know.

[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:27.980]
Maybe our memories are getting short, but it seems to me that this year we got the worst bunch of drivers I have ever seen in my life.

[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:31.100]
I mean, our own drivers are bad enough, especially since they're hurricane.

[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:39.800]
And I don't want to sound insensitive, but I mean, the hurricane has brought some of the most horrendous drivers into parts of Dayton Broward that ordinarily we wouldn't find them in their beat up gelopies.

[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:41.140]
And that's bad enough.

[02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:47.260]
But we, I was behind the guy yesterday had a New York plate who was driving so slow and I couldn't get over.

[02:49:47.380 --> 02:49:52.080]
I was on the way up 95 to the turnpike and he was in the left hand lane, of course, going way under the speed limit.

[02:49:52.220 --> 02:49:52.940]
I couldn't get over.

[02:49:53.460 --> 02:49:54.640]
And then he gets across.

[02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:59.400]
He makes the turn there to the palm metal and the turnpike and he doesn't know whether he wants to go to the right or left.

[02:49:59.500 --> 02:50:00.740]
So he straddles both lanes.

[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:07.720]
And as I think he's going to the right and I start getting around him on the left and passing him and he decides he wants to go back out of left again.

[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:11.440]
I mean, this man was all over the, like, like a obstacle course.

[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:13.160]
They're all over the place.

[02:50:13.580 --> 02:50:16.060]
He reminds me of the management of Cox broadcasting.

[02:50:16.420 --> 02:50:19.000]
They like to, no, they like a bunch of obstacles in your place.

[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:20.220]
That's what they like to do.

[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:21.940]
Throw a lot of roadblocks in front of your thing.

[02:50:21.940 --> 02:50:22.620]
Exactly.

[02:50:22.940 --> 02:50:26.720]
Well, listen, just smile and have a great new year because it's going to get a lot worse.

[02:50:26.860 --> 02:50:28.120]
Thank you for having me here too.

[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:28.880]
Thanks a lot.

[02:50:28.980 --> 02:50:29.220]
Sure.

[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:29.960]
Bye-bye.

[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:33.400]
Well, listen, that's just about going to do it, boys and girls.

[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:37.720]
See, Alex is in here for Marvin who's on a seven-year vacation now.

[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:39.080]
I don't understand it.

[02:50:39.220 --> 02:50:40.420]
I just do not get it.

[02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:43.380]
Hasn't he been on vacation, what, 16 weeks this year?

[02:50:45.580 --> 02:50:46.960]
I don't understand the dealer.

[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:49.080]
He, he's, he doesn't just have stills.

[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:49.940]
He's got movies too.

[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:51.100]
He's got like videotape.

[02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:52.880]
He's got motion picture.

[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:54.040]
He's got 35 millimeter.

[02:50:55.040 --> 02:51:00.440]
He's probably got like the sisters in the gym, Kennedy, and everybody in the company doing something to somebody.

[02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:01.380]
Maybe all to each other.

[02:51:01.380 --> 02:51:03.880]
I don't know what he's got, but boy, it must be a heavy duty.

[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:04.700]
It must be intense.

[02:51:05.960 --> 02:51:08.000]
Anyway, have yourselves a wonderful day.

[02:51:08.020 --> 02:51:10.080]
We're going to be here tomorrow on New Year's Eve.

[02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:11.960]
God, that's depressing and distressing.

[02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:12.980]
But guess what?

[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:14.180]
Friday, we won't.

[02:51:14.500 --> 02:51:15.140]
We're not.

[02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:21.260]
And I want you to find out what the deal is on Rick and Suds not being invited to our big staff meeting on Monday,

[02:51:21.260 --> 02:51:31.500]
which everybody who works at WIOD and WFLC and WIHQT and everything in the whole of the Gatsamish Bukhi are invited except them.

[02:51:32.780 --> 02:51:41.360]
This is South Florida's news, traffic and weather station, Newstalk Radio's 610, WIOD by any Fort Lauderdale and the Palm Beaches.

[02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:42.380]
Good luck, guys.

[02:51:45.140 --> 02:51:45.960]
Yeah.
