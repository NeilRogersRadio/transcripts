[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.160]
I'm 10 to 11 W.I.O.D. I'm taking my life in my hands again.

[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.100]
I'm hoping that the mobile is still there. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am.

[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.140]
I'll be knowing you. Sandy, you look at Berly here. Yeah. Okay. You hear me now? Okay.

[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.420]
Okay. Okay. I just want to tell you that I'm a very bad person for meeting elves of

[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:30.880]
the system and my symbols, my grandparents, stuff me with that stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.580]
Are you there? I'm here. So what should I do? What you do? Keep enjoying it. My

[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.120]
Bubby ate the same stuff and lived to 87, okay? Okay. I like some crabs though. That's much better.

[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.180]
Stone crabs is better. Yeah, all that butter, all that cholesterol. We're really doing for you.

[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.900]
Well, but the other stuff can still you. It's the blood of your arteries. That's the idea. That's why we say,

[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.680]
white or clog. You have a great day. See ya.

[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.260]
Faster than a touch-tone phone.

[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.640]
Louder than a pneumatic drill.

[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.880]
Able to sidestep reality in a single pound.

[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.080]
Look, they're on the phone. It's a rabbit motion. It should be in check as

[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.440]
G's. Do you believe these people? No. It's Yintama. Yes, it's Yintama.

[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.820]
Strange visitor from another market with a phone growing out of his head.

[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.680]
Right. Wording is going to do morning, son. G. What do you think? Yintama. With a bizarre

[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.100]
compulsion to pass along Radio Gossip. They thought it wasn't a clip of the sun, but it turned

[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.820]
out to be W. Ellis. Unbeatingly verbal.

[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.380]
Yintama, who can change the course of any discussion, dial two telephones with one hand,

[00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.420]
and who disguised as Lee Huller, ill-metered tacos for a semi-professional radio station,

[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.280]
bites a never-ending battle for rubber in Ywendo and arbitrawn advances.

[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.620]
Yeah, Neil is leaving my area to buy a station in Oligland. Do you believe that guy?

[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.720]
1252, but at Jim Schuyler, he's the best. How come he's not working here? I was thinking about

[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.120]
this morning coming to work. He should be working here doing something creative.

[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.100]
Anyway, we have an open line in Brow. Shouldn't he? He's great. He's a talent. Oh, that's why he's

[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.840]
not working here. Where's Palm Beach on the Star Line? Neil. Yes, sir. I'm Don't ask.

[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.100]
OK, don't ask. Yeah, you brought up all this stuff with this. I haven't had this much fun

[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.400]
since then, Major's in a Snickers show. Right. Now, I wasn't snicker as it was the

[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.800]
extra dark Milky Way. Oh, yeah, yeah. Extra dark. You know, if you got to tell you, the only thing

[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.160]
that was the children is that like one piece of density is like, you know, like heavier,

[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.340]
if you drop it, it would fall right through the earth like real heavy cheesecake. It got

[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.500]
to work. You don't believe out that. Yeah. And my mother when I was little used to make

[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.540]
kishgab in the old fashioned way, but I have no idea what was going to happen.

[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.520]
Now, I've never been able to figure out what's in it. These people that are called in today

[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.660]
with the recipe, I mean, there's got to be something more than that. How do you explain the color

[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.000]
of it? It's kind of like an orange brown. I mean, there's nothing that they've said that you

[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.340]
put in there. I mean, a chicken fat has no color. And so what gives it the color?

[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.800]
Well, you know, I'll be on assignment over the weekend. I can call my mother and find out

[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.200]
what's in there. OK, that's your homework assignment. OK, and I'll have to call you back on Monday.

[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.140]
OK, you have two. No, she said hello to the other mobile woman. No, she was called on her

[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.360]
dime. That's why I put around. No, she was paying for it. And we're paying for this call.

[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.140]
I don't like to pay for it. I know me either, but hey, sometimes you're desperate. Have a great weekend.

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.780]
You're doing the LCM. 1254 at WYOD. We have an open line. I don't mind, actually. It depends on

[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.440]
what it is. A star IOD is that number on the Bell South mobility line. If you've got a phone in

[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.940]
your car and it's somebody else's in their pants, they'll make any difference to his fan for it.

[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.080]
Because we pay the freight. How do you like that? Man, these sisters, they're loaded and they want

[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.900]
to spread it around with a big shovel. Miami. Buenos tardes. Just one thing I had, Kishki, in the

[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.140]
second avenue, Delhi, New York. Right. But I was puking for days. I mean, that's

[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:39.380]
I mean, that was really weird stuff. Yeah, it's the twisted sister special. Yeah,

[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.460]
I just like to call one person a douchebag. OK, just a magic boxing corporate. It's actually a company.

[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.540]
Nice talking to you. OK, see you. Wow. 1255. We're zipping along here. This hasn't been too bad for

[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.280]
Friday. OK, for a little pre-shop of celebration. Talking about food instead of eating it.

[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.240]
Much better for you. Remember what I said? Food allergies. Remember that. You may joke. You may laugh.

[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.280]
You may puke. You may, uh, that's where it's at. Trust me. Take it from somebody who knows,

[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.740]
who suddenly got all of his energy back at his blood sugar down and lost 10 pounds. And I feel

[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.300]
great. I feel like I do a 75 hour cooking marathon today, man. I'm on top of it.

[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.400]
Here's a big report in Miami. Deal. Yes. I hear it. 8.74. There he is. I can see him. Wait,

[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.480]
he's looking at me now. He's waving. Hey, he's listening to the Neil Rogers show.

[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.580]
That's my contribution from the eaters. Thank you, sir. 1255. Like I said, we have an open line

[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.380]
in Broward. 524 and the Star Line Star IOD. Starting next week, we're eliminating all the Broward

[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.160]
lines. We're going to 5 day lines, Bell Soffin Building, cellular one out of the world line.

[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.760]
And that's it. And then we'll have a good time. We'll never have to give any numbers out.

[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.200]
West Palm Beach. That's the end of the world, man. Did you see our movie, uh,

[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.760]
quite old, it's by Neil Simon? What kind of a phone are you on? Man, it's a crappy pay phone.

[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.480]
Must have like a double sock over it. Oh, well, let me bang on a little bit. No, I don't want to say that.

[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.240]
God. Listen, could you see a movie called Brighton Beach Memoirs?

[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.440]
Was that the one with the, um, the what's her name, Bet Middler?

[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.240]
No, no, no, no. This is the one. This is the one with the infinite

[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.100]
supper of Red Cabbage and Liver. No, no, okay. That wasn't the one with Matt Dillon. Was it?

[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.700]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, Brighton Beach Memoirs. I thought that was, uh, I'm sure that was

[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.000]
Bet Middler. No, no, no, no. Was the Neil Simon thing. It was a very good movie. It's about a

[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.560]
kid who grew up in Brooklyn. No, but I wouldn't watch that. I don't give a crap about Brooklyn.

[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.380]
Well, uh, never mind. You know, you, you have to, you have to be there. Right. Well, listen,

[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.360]
I don't want to be there. What I call Larry King is from there. That's enough to make me never want to go

[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.780]
there. Yeah. What I called you about is to complain. The only reason I listen to the station is

[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:05.280]
because of your show and Rick and Sputnik. Right. Uh, that's the only reason anybody to listen to this

[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.580]
thing. That's true. On the V. It's a behind me. Now, you know, you would think unless I'm awful,

[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.820]
uh, aren't way mistaken, the average intelligence or a person couldn't be the type of person

[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.240]
that would like to sit and listen to the radio and have some guy come on and tell us how good

[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.780]
that they give the world. And tell us how they have. Oh, hey, listen, I could do a whole show on these

[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:33.020]
promos. We're running sports. First of all, the hurricane season is over, okay? Right. It's

[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.300]
fine. Good luck, uh, you know, going good health. But now we're, it's not enough. We have to

[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.960]
reap. We have promos doing the whole play by play of the whole game. I noticed we don't have the part

[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.580]
where sunny call where it just feel go good, which was off by like 10 yards where he called that good

[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.940]
or they were crying about all the penalties and then turned out they were against the brass

[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.820]
gun about the big 10. We don't have that. But we like replaying the play by play of the whole god damn

[00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:00.320]
game. Then we go into a 60 second promotone. How great our news is you can go all over America

[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.260]
sir to any major market and you will not hear on any radio station long, ponderous,

[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:12.640]
tune out inducing promos like we run on this station. It's another example of the total incompetence

[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.760]
and lack of understanding of length of listenership that they have in our programming department.

[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.560]
They have no clue what it means to get the force to the audience to tune out. No, no understanding

[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.360]
whatsoever. Exactly. Our motto here, you know, when I came here three years ago, it was the same

[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.280]
even with different programming people. The motto was we can say in 50,000 words what most people

[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.800]
can say in 10. That's the motto here in the same with our news department, man. It's just incredible.

[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.980]
But listen if you don't like those spots, we'll just play a spot that the couple of days old.

[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:48.140]
Right. Oh absolutely. Hey don't forget the widener coming up this weekend that's a high

[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:55.280]
alia. There you go. Right. And don't forget that special Easter special coming up at a flower shop

[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.800]
near you. I mean, you know, if it's not good today, it'll be good in a couple of months, you know.

[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.480]
Well, I think that I got some guys sitting up in Boston, the way where the hell he is with nothing

[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.220]
else better than this and keeping busy to get more less crap to make up. Right. And you know, if

[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.420]
the one for you guys being so good, that's exactly right. I got to make a... They better kiss the

[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.600]
goddamn ground that we're here as sir because I got news for you for all the annoying. Just take a

[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.840]
look at the weekend programming on this station. That'll give you an idea of the creativity of our

[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.760]
programming department. Trust me. That speaks for itself. I have tried on occasion, but I can't

[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.280]
make it. I'm sorry. Well, who can? Hey listen, have a great new year in spite of it and have a

[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.740]
great life. Thank you. And you're hired. I see it. There's our new program director right there. He's

[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:43.120]
got a little bit of a clue, which is more than they got in this joint. Man, that football promo. I mean,

[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.960]
that's just like a slap in the face on and on. We got like highlights and lowlights at the 40,

[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.080]
at the 30, at the 30, at the 25. That's why, okay, we get the message. It's a touchdown. They won

[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.820]
a game. Get it over with. Why would the Leafs do it? Okay. Cut the crap. Who's doing the news? Tom Hopkins.

[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.900]
Tom Hopkins is doing news with that big new head of hair. And we'll come back in 105. Rickinconson's

[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:09.540]
a two-manage on sports talk. Hank Talks Flamingo 8-11. This is South Florida's news,

[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:17.300]
traffic and weather station. News talk radio. 610 WIOD. Miami, Fort Waterdale, and the Palm Beach.

[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.380]
News talk radio. 610 WIOD presents the Neil Rogers show. They get in touch and talk with

[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:36.920]
Neil Dio. 751 WIOD from day. Inbroward is 524 WIOD. Outside the 305 area, so

[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:45.440]
free 1-800-944 WIOD. And Bell South mobility customers make a free call by dialing star IOD.

[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.580]
The opinions expressed by the gas and toaster callers are not necessarily those of this station.

[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:57.340]
Now, here's Neil Rogers on News talk radio. 610 WIOD.

[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:10.060]
This is Dwayne Stahl for Black Teeth. And you're listening to the 2-1-R.

[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.480]
Just look at this place.

[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:43.320]
Oh, man, why are you here? Because you are a soulful ring. What happens to your face?

[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:53.220]
And the sky's been walking, you're giving it right. But man, where have you on track?

[00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:00.880]
A little oxy-fine, I'm in a black and blue color.

[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.320]
107 WIODs are my mammoth, gigantic, Dwayne stopped inducing 1-2 hour,

[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:15.280]
open line inbroward 524 WIOD. I like having those blinds open in there.

[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.640]
There are people running up and down the hall like they got St. Bite his dance. Man,

[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.360]
what's going on in this place lately? Just really bizarre. I guess they're upset because they

[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:29.560]
got to come back to work. Too bad, the party's over, guys. And when are we getting those

[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.980]
Dan cards to open the door? I'm getting calluses, I'm getting things on my knuckles from banging on

[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.800]
a window downstairs. We still don't have those things back from Gary Mills.

[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.400]
On works. Yours works. Well, that's great. I'm real happy for you. There's only maybe like a

[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.520]
four or five in a whole building that works. So I think that's an omen. The ones that work,

[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.440]
they want you to come in one more time to turn them in. Margate, hello.

[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.040]
Hello? Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay.

[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.300]
Call me. Did I call you?

[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:05.340]
Oh, no, wait a minute. I called you. Yeah. Okay. You gotta be easy on me because this is like my

[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.500]
first time calling. Yeah. Well, it's a bad start. So a feeble attempt at humor. Okay.

[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.820]
And the Eric Lambert School of I'm not so funny and I'm getting worse. Okay, but I have something

[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.940]
very important. More waiting. It's about redneck. Yeah. In a redneck bar. I was at a bar last night.

[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.660]
Yes. I'm just having a couple of beers and chicken wings. Yeah. And this redneck girl comes around

[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:28.900]
with an alligator face because she's out with suns alone. And she's in a negligent trying to

[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.340]
sell it to us. Mm-hmm. Trying to sell what to you? Uh, I think the negligent. Oh, I see.

[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.000]
But uh, she's trying to pedal it. Yeah. At the same time, there's a bunch of these like

[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.600]
biker rednecks with a lounge air and a leather and the chains on their wallets with nothing in the

[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.700]
