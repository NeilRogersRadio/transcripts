[00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.040]
Do we know how to get to that new audience or what?

[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.520]
1106 and WIOD. Broward, look at that. Broward is like in a coma.

[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.900]
The whole rest of the state is like flagellating and man there's squeezing it and jumping on it and Broward is like,

[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.580]
eh, where do we find it? Well, I'll tell you where we find it right on the bat line. Hello?

[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.740]

[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.320]

[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.860]
talking to me. That's what you were talking to me. That's what you were talking to me. Time like poisoning is going to tell you stories that will make you never listen to that station again. Anyway

[00:02:48.860 --> 00:03:06.220]
Federal eh. Exactly Federal eh. I think there's so many people who need the weapons out there and you know that well they told people who need the weapons out there's so many people need the weapons out there's just 12 players.

[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.280]
Those twofreirors that I thought weren't any defensive guys or people driven by them. On their phones I thought I thought they were never going to be switched off, I was annoying.

[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.840]
but because frequently you know when you call new i just a home you get things

[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.080]
like

[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.460]
but because you are a pain in the ass that now this man i want to tell you something

[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.840]
bob was a radio

[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.900]
yenta is the best expression i can think of

[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.200]
and was just constantly i mean now i understand why having heard the stories

[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.140]
but just constantly calling and probing for information and what's going on

[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.980]
at q a m what's going on at uh... the light bulb what's going on

[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.160]
and just it just got to the point where uh... like you know in the eighth

[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.960]
sitting in the cub game with a base no i'm not

[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.160]
yes you are okay i made it up

[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.220]
west of my talk to you q a m with full

[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.940]
well i'm just i'm not

[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.860]
fill in the blank whatever the station might be okay

[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.780]
you were radio yenta you can fess up to what i think you i had to

[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.200]
uh...

[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.300]
oh you had my spin down but he wasn't taking your calls

[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.200]
he always took my call yeah he'll take anybody's calls believe me

[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.940]
so uh... anyway bob was in tamper with these gigantic numbers went to

[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.680]
the wl i think she called the last time i saw bob last it was art uh... one of

[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.900]
our trips it was two years ago

[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.760]
two summers ago at murphy's bleachers across from really field and bob came in

[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.220]
they opened up the pride open the door with a shoe horn

[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.580]
and got bob and i both in there which is quite an accomplishment and we

[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.700]
have chatted for a couple hours and now back in those days i thought you were

[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.540]
doing okay at all i thought you were happy

[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.700]
uh... no there was already hit severe trouble but you just didn't want to

[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.540]
say it because you need the job well i'm

[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.260]
you know it is now yes i do

[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.240]
when you're in a business you lie a lot

[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.860]
great deal i can just imagine i can imagine the reverberations over there on the

[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.040]
west coast all those old ladies who love bob last year

[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.860]
no no no i had young man i didn't have any old lady you had young men

[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.440]
well we'll probably talk about that when we come back

[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.480]
think up some good stories

[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.720]
all right hold on i don't go away you got a lot of time for us today right

[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.300]
as much as we have nothing but time and you already got people on their way

[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.440]
to talk to you

[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.180]

[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.300]
all bob people you said to breath a fresh air to hear your voice you know

[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.300]
how these phony bastards are you know i really looking forward to it

[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.280]

thing i put my finger in the wrong spot

[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.080]

[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.720]
but it talk radio here in tampa

[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.660]
the was every all the listeners who were called can attest bob

[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.860]

[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.240]
since you left it's puke

[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.600]
i did it at the real bad

[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.740]
i have to eat some of you i have i still bring out the tapes of yours once in a

[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.140]
while with you in the old guy in the trail park and

[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.660]
this are a strange and then in the other guy

[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.400]
religious guy used to call you on fla all the time

[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.780]
jay cup and his wife with the i-bowl

[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.800]
and uh... it was a little is wonderful

[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.080]
but when you want to get a laugh remember what good talk radio was in this area

[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.860]

[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.260]
okay

[00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.040]
they love to meet the only love to be they did which i think says a lot about that

[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.260]
area so anyway wls uh... we kept going down the tubes and they have bush

[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.860]
being bang on in midday which so things speak for itself

[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.380]
like every other desperate station that can put on live local talent

[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.060]
like fla for example at once his tapes on tape delay no less

[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.620]
and post-funded s u n because they're bringing in stuff from out of the market

[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.760]
now are you serious yes

[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.160]
unreal that opi him he's like all well you know that syndicated stuff does

[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.860]
work in me while i got that the clown on the year on tape that fat right when

[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.200]
fascia's not see big well wait a second wait a second opi is a fine broadcaster

[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.020]
is a man of integrity of that report leader

[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.120]
you know prone to taking bubble

[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.260]
oh man i know there was a lot of that crap in on the ground in davenport

[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.240]
but you have must have been spent all your spare time shoveling it up

[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.240]
here's a lady in uh... clear water

[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.600]
our last year this is t day t j i you do it i'm just doing fun my god

[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.160]
it's so great to hear your voice i can't believe it i'm so excited

[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.120]
i think the least you can do is thank me for bringing bob on to that

[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.660]
i do thank you new you know i'm so excited i can't stand it

[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.260]
i don't understand what you're looking to know for i mean he doesn't do topics for

[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.040]
anything like that of you or he but i wish he would and that's why i'm just

[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.440]
dying to hear your topics again

[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.300]
it's so bad it is so bad that i can't

[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.780]
and it you know they can do actually ten hours

[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.920]
discussing the month of august and and you know what the uh...

[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.940]
the good things are about all good at the stupid things like that

[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.460]
absolutely disgusting on top of that it's so so so boring

[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.280]
i know the best thing about august is that most people go out of time vacation

[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.780]
they don't have to listen to the wf l

[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.880]
that's that's the whole thing but anyway

[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.160]
bob god we miss you

[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.080]
well i miss you too

[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.160]

[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.920]
anyway i'll tell you remember when you left town i remember this and i treasure this

[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.920]
because i was your very last caller i got on like the last minute before you left

[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.260]
June 26th three years ago

[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.840]
not that he's keeping track

[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.720]
three years ago i'll tell you it seems like ten

[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.420]
and you need to come back because

[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:25.060]
talk radio is not the same it is absolutely awful

[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.300]
and you were the best i'm sorry nia

[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.060]
i haven't listened to you long enough so i couldn't really tell

[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.120]
right you haven't listened long enough to hate me yet but you will in a couple of weeks

[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.200]
well that's alright i don't mind that but i just keep in mind that if a warrant for me

[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.960]
bob laceter would never have been on the year in tampa

[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.000]
would never have been on the year in chicago would never be sitting out there

[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.520]
desperate and suicidal in david port aowa

[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.180]
probably would have just gone on and had like a regular life

[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.780]
get all true

[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.160]
all he did mention your name quite often

[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.880]
right i'm not going to say what he said about you but he's

[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.480]

whatsoever one had to go into your four hour shift at night

[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.480]
but you want to tell people why it is that uh... you didn't work there anymore

[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.980]
because you said sit on the air but it didn't have an end in it

[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.160]

[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:05.740]

[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.020]
are you considered coming back to this area?

[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.680]
i like considered it we thought about uh... when when things blew up in chicago

[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.280]
we did consider moving back to tapah and uh... i still made one of these days i enjoyed it

[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.360]
well nilshows good no but you know they need some

[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.180]
no wait a minute don't now listen don't suck around that heavily sir

[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.380]
don't use my show to say nilshows good but

[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.740]
if you're the grinders but don't do that because even he don't pull him up

[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.920]
that though on issue and they need one they do need a very good host on issue and

[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.620]
what does that mean

[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.580]
they think they need a very good host over and over and over and over and over and over

[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.460]
well no there's no question about that but you think that those cheap bastards

[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.260]
that cocks are going to spend money to bring in a like a live person if you knew how much

[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.240]
they're paying us to carry in fact i should have told bob this last night which he

[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.660]
would just puke all over himself next to nothing i couldn't buy my dogs dog food

[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.320]
with him i were giving them this for practically for free because they're basically

[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.660]
incompetent inept at a bunch of geeks

[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.340]
well they would if they put bob on there they'd see their ratings shoot up but they'd have a 50 share

[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.880]
if they put his fat ass on that state tonight and if they put the rest of my money having 80 share

[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.860]
the best of night i gotta go back to work nights

[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.260]
six to ten oh the best one i ever saw was bob did a live remote from the same

[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.640]
piece shuffleboard court oh my god yeah

[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.940]
and just after he got last year's Lincoln and he drove it over there

[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.300]
and uh he did his live remote from over there and the people wouldn't come out and talk to him

[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.280]
they just still here and look over at him and he was supposed to

[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.720]
they wouldn't let us on the proper yeah i had to go out and buy bullhorn

[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.080]
yeah and so there's this guy walking down the street and bob ran after this guy and took off

[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.200]
down the road and caught him down near the end of the road

[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.000]
he just kind of shrugged him off and kept going

[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.920]
out as the best live remote ever saw him alive

[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.220]
i totally forgot

[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.700]
it was the best one i ever saw well bob have a good one

[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.220]
take care have a great life you do okay

[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.040]
we uh we had called up the uh shuffleboard court in St. Petersburg and asked

[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.720]
if we'd come and do it remote they were really thrilled and they said yes and we put in phone lines

[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.480]
in a whole bit and then the day before they found out who i was

[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.440]
and they banned it from the property

[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.420]
you mean you were over there picking on the old farts

[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:24.780]
well yeah

[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.240]
where did you where did you learn that uh

[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.560]
where did i learn that

[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.480]
uh great wording

[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.820]
all right hold on now bob hold on right now

[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.160]

[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.160]

[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.100]
he's looking for a sun city center and he's just a maniac you're there bob right

[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.380]
i'm here now standing through the miracle of modern

[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.200]
technology since your got his ass back into the control room and punched it up

[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.100]
uh we never got to the thing about so you got can in Chicago and WLS because uh

[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.080]
of what

[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.500]
uh i don't know

[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.840]
uh because i didn't fit in

[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.200]
you didn't fit in because you were a troublemaker and you wanted to do some real

[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.140]
whatever it was and they didn't like it because they don't want you to do anything

[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.900]
i didn't want to do anything anymore i just didn't fit in

[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.040]
didn't fit in okay and then

[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:41.540]
called uh... around in tampa had a desire to come back to the market where he was once king or prince or princess

[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:46.160]
and they said from jay core they said we'd love to have you back bob and uh

[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.460]
then you start talking money

[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.520]
well uh...

[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:55.220]
that was about a year and a half ago the last time i talked with them they suggested i get in touch with

[00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.540]
uh wtk and it maybe for weekends yeah but when you talked money that was the end of the conversation right

[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.540]
uh... basically there a bankrupt inter-bunch of cheap bastards and forget it

[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.880]
well if you i think you i think you ought to talk to bob honey over wsu

[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.000]
when in talk money when you hear that dial tone on the other end of the phone real quick

[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.520]
well you'll be able to relate to it okay let's take that

[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.500]
i didn't ask for much of the all i was dying i was making fifty one cents a clock

[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.020]
you can say slime ball

[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.940]
how about having iod final cast sq1 was bob at night and go the other way

[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.420]
now you're talking yeah we have complete rundown i would take care of that because

[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.700]
it gives me an open after six o'clock at night the station sort of fade away

[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.380]
uh... uh... yeah right

[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.360]
so what do you think is just like for real if people start rattling cages are you serious

[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.580]
and it's hard to tell if you're going to weigh your kid in a way or not

[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.760]
or you're probably very relaxed out there right now with

[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.060]
good reed

[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.860]
rattle cages are wild because you're talking to the state of Florida right now i guess

[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.560]
nil told you between iod and sq1 they've taken over the world

[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.180]
well i'll be real quick what it's doing friend

[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.340]

did the the quote unquote fear issue right exactly there you go that was the problem at wl

[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:56.340]
as the management up there is trying to do with stuff that went out with nickers 20 years ago

[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:01.220]
i was up to all of up in Chicago to godwood a station terminal in fact it was two years ago this

[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:05.880]
week out up in Chicago living my nephew and i i turned Bob on and i said to my girlfriend that

[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:11.140]
i said something they've taken it something's wrong with Bob they have taken the cajonis out of

[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:15.360]
Bob last year there was another problem too though in Chicago the audience didn't know how to play

[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.400]
along the audience in Tampa did oh there's no fear the call from well wait a minute are you

[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:25.640]
saying to me that the audience in Chicago was stiffer than the audience in Tampa oh god much

[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:30.540]
stiffer the call by god i mean all of these people that were talking about no wonder there are so

[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:35.700]
many cup fans they're too stupid to be upset now i understand what it's all about but all of the

[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:40.200]
all of these colors that were talking about from the old days in Tampa these weren't my contrivances

[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:45.040]
these were just mere mortals who made up characters and called in and and didn't do it too often

[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.240]
and it was great believe i'm here that i'm not sure they didn't do it too often believe me the

[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.460]
way they sound i can i can buy that so we knew about us coming from we like to play along i

[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:59.120]
could print as a show walking on the state fair with a bullhorn and yet you knew don't well

[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.220]
was tongue in cheek but i used to have the people used to calm up and and would take Bob
