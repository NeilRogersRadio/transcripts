[00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.640]
I just had to tell you we love your show up here in Land O Lake. Land O Lake.

[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.020]
Five minutes north of Luke. You know I have never heard so many you know I've lived in Florida for

[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.760]
19 years now and I thought I knew the state pretty well. I've been around you know

[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.100]
I've been around the backyard once or twice and I'm here in a place is that I have never heard of before

[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.440]
We got a call yesterday from bomb

[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.160]
Yeah, I heard of that and we're like we have like right down there by will mom or why mama?

[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.100]
We are a monster in why mama?

[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.760]
Yeah, did you go to the shell stage and then get your map yet?

[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.720]
No, I still didn't do that. I forgot about it.

[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.180]
And these cheap bastards here they won't give us some map. They won't do they won't do anything here man because our

[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.900]
program director is a geek and he's just not into this thing. It requires a little bit too much effort.

[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.800]
He don't like anything that smells like work.

[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.820]
Yeah, well we try to do social see ourselves from the people from Luke.

[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.780]
I don't blame you.

[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.860]
But believe it or not there's some people in Land O Lake that have a loop address.

[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.920]
So I think you're probably like

[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.500]
Oh, what?

[00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.600]
Yeah, yeah, they're going oh no, they think we're from Luke.

[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.960]
Yeah, we really living Land O Lake and it's even in a different county.

[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.980]
Well, it's been a real tweet and we'll talk again. Okay.

[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.840]
Okay, good night.

[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.220]
Have a great week. Bye bye.

[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.400]

[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.680]
Land O Lake, George. Put it on the map.

[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.060]
Let's just think about your pins in a wall. We don't have any map on here.

[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.360]
We'll just think about your pins in it.

[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.480]
So anyway, the state peak time this morning. This is great.

[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.580]
This is the kind of stuff that I really love because you've got to get a shovel out

[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.320]
man and just pile it and pile it and pile it as high as you can.

[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.820]
It's under the what's news column by Roger Fisher in the St.P. Times and it says

[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.220]
there's a new talk station in town and WFLA couldn't be happier if

[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.840]
operations manager Gabe Hobbs that's OP is to be believed.

[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.280]
WFLA Sucks.

[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.580]
I just want to know where to send the check he said after briefly sampling the first

[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.820]
day's worth of chatter on news talk 620 WS U.N. on Monday.

[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.000]
So far they've spent a lot of their shows talking about us.

[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.580]
WS U.N., which in fact is poking fun at itself for cost effective programming,

[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.320]
made its debut as an all talk station with live somal cast from corporate

[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.280]
sibling Miami's WIOD. The ever controversial the Arragist and to the wacky

[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.620]
Sucks to the 6th form the major portion of WS U.N.'s live talk programming,

[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.300]
none of which is based in Tampa Bay.

[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.400]
An opening day both shows host spent a lot of time trying to talk WFLA in its

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.180]
various personalities. One has to wonder if WIOD's home based Miami audience was

[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.100]
at least a little confused by some of the chatter directed at the Tampa Bay

[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.600]
approach.

[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.080]
It's serious they loved it. This approach certainly is cost effective whether

[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.340]
it becomes simply effective remains to be seen.

[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.480]
Now here's the great line in here.

[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.340]
Any life on the AM dial should be welcomed by listeners and even by its competitors.

[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.160]
How do you like that? To show you that AM over there is almost as exciting as it has been

[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.560]
over here. Okay, terminal deadly comatose on nightmare.

[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.700]
But I always love these guys like Opie over there. Oh yeah, where do we send the

[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.040]
check? They're giving us a lot of publicity. Who the hell are you kidding?

[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.980]
You paranoid slime ball?

[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.680]
Like he's got everybody locked up tighter than a drum they can't respond to us.

[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.680]
They can't talk about it. We don't operate that. We hear because we're not paranoid.

[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.260]
Opie we talk about everybody. We talk about whatever we want to talk about.

[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.880]
And when the numbers come out each and every month when the trends come out we

[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.800]
read them all whether we do well whether we do crappy or in between.

[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.120]
We go down a hole because we want our listeners to know what's really going on.

[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.300]
And we don't lie and we don't make them up and we don't say hey we beat the crap out of

[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.700]
everybody when we didn't because we're not paranoid and because we're like kicking

[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.720]
ass like yours Opie. Let's do a lady in Sarasota. Hello.

[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.000]
Hi Neil. How you doing? Wonderful. I'm so happy. I know you don't want depressed

[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.320]
stories today and I want to tell you you're the most wonderful thing that's happened

[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.660]
to Sarasota. I've been here three years and you're refreshing like a pyramid

[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.540]
animal. It's wonderful. I have to tell you. Yeah.

[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.280]
Playing your bed last night and I started laughing and my husband asked me what I was

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.980]
laughing about and I was thinking about your show. You are a riot. You're wonderful.

[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.540]
You're literate. It's just tremendous. What are you talking about?

[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.720]
What are you talking about? You might just say we kind of move the tube from South Florida

[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.640]
to cover the entire state. That's right. It's wonderful and I have to tell you that.

[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.480]
I've been home sick from my family up north and I was planning a trip and now I'm not

[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.620]
going to go because listening to everyone who listens to your regulars who call in

[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.140]
and even the guy in lutes it's like a large, disfigured family.

[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.100]
The guy in lutes is like an integral part of the show now. Yeah. Well it's like a large

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.560]
dysfunctional family so I'm not home sick anymore. Great. Well today don't forget

[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.760]
being Friday. It's Raspberry Sorbet and I'm a day in Sarasota. Oh well I'm going to have

[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.360]
to run to public. Yeah. What a wonderful job. A lot of people have got to runs

[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.820]
over there today believe me. Hey they all do and we talk about it in the lines

[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.920]
at the grocery store. Well listen say hi to some of my old friends over there

[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.640]
man because I was there 19 years ago 1973 at the St. Arman Circle WS PB. Well they're all gone now.

[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.280]
Oh man. They're all gone now. But again thrilling I was spinning through the AM dial.

[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.960]
I love talk radio and I'm and I've even listened to rush just to listen to talk radio. Oh God.

[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.260]
No wonder you're so happy. I'm too excited. It's wonderful. It's great.

[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.240]
And I don't care about all those people who don't like you just like I said they're

[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.660]
codependent. They need to talk to you because they're going to try to fix you. Yeah screw them.

[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.820]
Well listen have a great weekend. Thanks. Bye bye. Bye bye. Sarasota man were like

[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.080]
setting that town on its ass which doesn't take much although the old

[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.820]
Heidelberg was pretty good. I will say that. Let's do o Lakeland. Hello. Hello Neil.

[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.520]
Yes sir. When WSU and I advertised their format change they have

[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.520]
been called at confrontation radio. I feel like this is called septic tank radio.

[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.560]
Right. The worst show that I think I've heard and I've listened to talk radio.

[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.660]
That's right and we're very proud of it sir. We're very proud of it being in the tank.

[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.320]
Yeah I would assume you are. You can relate to.

[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.980]
Let me ask you a question sir. How long have you been sampling septic tank radio?

[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.360]
Well I tuned in Monday because when I heard the news over the weekend I thought oh great.

[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.560]
I'm going to talk radio. Right and now here it is Friday and you're still listening.

[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.440]
No I'm not. I tuned you out Tuesday because. You tuned us out on Tuesday and you waited till Friday

[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.480]
to make sure to call and let us know how much you love.

[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.020]
Pressing radio sir. Well you know you know something you know something sir.

[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.860]
Can I say something to you sir with all due? Are you saying all of that?

[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.980]
If you don't let me talk. I already let you talk. I'm proud of it.

[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.880]
It's fine. I'm proud to respond to what you're saying sir but go right ahead.

[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.860]
You just lay it on us. How depressing it is. Yeah okay. Is there really any need for you to use

[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.240]
three and four letter words every other sentence? Are you that illiterate or what?

[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.700]
Yes I'm a totally illiterate goof boss sir. Well you sound like a jerk.

[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.940]
I am I'm a total right. Really? Go ahead and say it if you like it. You get a big target.

[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.900]
Longer term you mean like as Jack asks? Yeah I like you know you.

[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.140]
Like maybe you call your donkey ass like in the middle of an emotional moment with him.

[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.700]
You know what you should do. Look up a picture.

[00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:02.340]
Sir let me ask you. No seriously stop. Stop. Stop and think about it because I let you ramble on and ramble on with your in our

[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:08.020]
yard. Yeah. Let me ask you a question. Here it is Friday. You listened on Monday and Tuesday.

[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:18.100]
Why would any person who had any semblance of a life waste the time to call and express their dismay with something they don't like as opposed to just turning it off and going on with their life?

[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.660]
What are the reasons for polluting the airwaves here at the best place?

[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.360]
No I'm not polluting anything because nobody's forcing anyone to listen to it.

[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.760]
I know it comes as a great shock to some of you over there but you know what we have something called freedom of choice.

[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.780]
I know that comes as a tremendous surprise and if you want to listen and you like it.

[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.640]
Yes what go right ahead and if you don't want to listen then you don't like it.

[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.280]
There ain't nobody going to come over there and make you listen. Isn't that a reason?

[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.240]
Exercise that choice. Well great and I'm going to exercise my choice to stick the finger right up your head.

[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.720]
Okay sir. On the phone that is because we don't want to make you smile.

[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.080]
Yes I am. That is shocking okay?

[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.220]
No it's probably not.

[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.200]
Do you know the other caller from Loots?

[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.960]
Oh you mean the Yahoo pickup driving to back a spitten boy car?

[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.340]
Oh yeah hold on a second okay?

[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.000]
Alright don't go away. Okay.

[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.200]
Do you hear what he just said?

[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.280]
Yeah I heard it just said just said some warrior that's all I want.

[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.140]
Just let me know where he lives that.

[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.440]
Okay. You hear me?

[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.180]
I hear you. So how are you doing? How are you doing to that?

[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.180]
Now what did you talk about I was having?

[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:32.440]
Why are you saying I did not say sexy you like fill in the blanks you massed you spent a pleasant evening probably in the barn area?

[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.860]
I had a call in early because I got a special meeting of the KKK tonight.

[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.180]
Alright. I have to analyze this stuff.

[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.280]
Now there you go. There you go again. You seem to have a one track might you see you're going to analyze it?

[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.940]
I said analyze. Don't be put in words.

[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.860]
You said I'm not saying it.

[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.060]
Or anything else in there right?

[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.200]
Now listen here.

[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.980]
Can I ask you a question before you go on with your hysterical tie-rate for the other?

[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.060]
Yeah put it up. I'll go right up against it.

[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.720]
You'll go right up against it?

[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.280]
Put it right up against it. Go ahead.

[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.540]
Do you want to talk to the other guy?

[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.680]
Yeah you put it right on it.

[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.100]
Alright. Are you there?

[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.100]
Yeah I'm here.

[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:07.900]
Hey man.

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.040]
What you're probably trying to take on my life.

[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.560]
I'm over here trying to take it.

[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.280]
Yeah I have to hear you.

[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.540]
So what are you doing on my line?

[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.500]
You're taking away his thunder sir. He wants to be hard.

[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.040]
I'm thanking you for taking off the couch to be music.

[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.380]
You know what you sound like when a little faggot's over there to college.

[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.260]
So what you are now now.

[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.780]
Now he's one of them little faggot's up the street.

[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.640]
And he's been watching you in the sheep late at night.

[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.940]
No you know what it is. It was I was watching him in the sheep but he's jealous.

[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.500]
Well why were you watching? Are you lonely?

[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.540]
No I ain't lonely but I'd tell you what.

[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.580]
Are you like the warrior at the bottom of the sea?

[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.180]
But you're talking about Jesus as a fairy tale.

[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.200]
About what?

[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.740]
You say in Jesus as a fairy tale.

[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.700]
You have this fairy thing man. You're like obsessed with fairy tales.

[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.520]
Well if any bad things you know about fairy you should know.

[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.920]
I'm the expert pal I know him from A to Z.

[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.500]
I know everyone that's ever been invented.

[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.520]
I could believe it.

[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.480]
You're not telling me what.

[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.200]
Loot is the only place you could go to that you'll be welcome.

[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.720]
So when you come on up here we'll make sure you're really welcome here.

[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.400]
The rumor has it we're going to be doing a full time studio up there in Loot.

[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:16.940]
So that's the rumor.

[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.260]
You bring it and you bet you will help you build it.

[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.100]
I'm serious we'll be real friendly to you when you come on up.

[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:23.980]
I'll bet you will.

[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.560]
Now do you hang out at that nudist conviet all?

[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.340]
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever...

[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.180]
The most disgusting thing you've ever seen right?

[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.140]
What?

[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.200]
That's the most disgusting thing you've ever seen.

[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.700]
That is the most...

[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.100]
No no let's get back to it.

[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.960]
No don't try to change this object you just admitted you've been watching that nudist conny with your telescope.

[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.500]
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard of.

[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.820]
First of all you watch a guy in his sheep play tonight and now you're looking overpoking your nose in that you must be lonely.

[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.700]
That's nothing to do with sheep but I'll tell you to be lonely.

[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.480]
You must be lonely that's why you call us every day now because we give you like a lot of time.

[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.440]

[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.280]
You are our number one caller.

[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.260]
Well I'm telling you one thing and I have to clean up this show now if you want people to listen to me.

[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.140]
Well wait a minute now did you hear the guy from Lakeland?

[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.580]
I heard him.

[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.060]
And he was upset about ass.

[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.480]
He's good he's good he's right on tray he knows what's good.

[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.680]
Are you upset about ass?

[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:25.640]
About what?

[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.500]
About ass are you upset about that?

[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.720]
No I'm not upset about it but just saying a fortune in they will need to hear that on the radio.

[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.820]
We're not we don't talk abortion you're the one that just said that.

[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.380]
I said ass and right away you're on abortion.

[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.900]
I heard earlier you said that.

[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.100]
This guy's been listening to that Heinrich Himmler look a lot better I think.

[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.180]
I heard you say something about abortion on the radio earlier.

[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.320]
That was it.

[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.420]
That I said that this show was an abortion.

[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.820]
So why do you compare that to something like that?

[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.900]
Like what like ass?

[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.460]
Come on try to try to confuse me you know what I'm talking about.

[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.640]
I'll begin what you look like.

[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.420]
Yeah right the other guy's interest didn't ask.

[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.960]
Well that's his problem.

[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.320]
He doesn't like bear breath either.

[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.760]
Who don't say who's that saying that I can barely hear it.

[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.900]
That's your buddy in loads.

[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:22.040]
Well let me tell you something you tell him just to come on out to eat the plant city or anywhere around there and I'll meet up with him.

[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.320]
Well wait a minute wait a minute why does he have to come out to plant city?

[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.560]
Because I got a bunch of my friends and plant city.

[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.060]
Why are you waiting man?

[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.280]
Why is it always you and your friends we're back on this again.

[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.720]
Can't you meet this guy head on he sounds like a little nice wippy guy,

[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.740]
No I'm gonna buy him something but he ain't gonna be that.

[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.200]
Or you're just gonna fry his ass.

[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:57.760]
What?

[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.040]
I said you're just gonna have a good time with him.

[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.860]
I'll tell you something man you are the most thickest piece of garbage I ever heard in my life.

[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.500]
And thank god you discovered us.

[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.560]
And I'm telling you we're just gonna keep up to you off you understand that?

[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.360]
Keep it up.

[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.260]
We will and you can still be off now.

[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.420]
You might not be worried you hear?

[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.280]
I will be off.

[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.900]
All right sooner or later we'll all be off. Have a great weekend.

[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.760]
Yeah you too.

[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.460]
Oh did you hear that sir?

[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.520]
Oh this is that it's wonderful it's great.

[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.220]
I love it.

[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.880]
He's the best.

[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:25.960]
He's the best.

[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:32.440]
And I always got a pickup truck and a pit bulldog and spitting the back all over the place up there.

[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.280]
Right and probably an outhouse with like a half a moon on it.

[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.540]
Yes exactly.

[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.900]
Which fits right in with the news corner I think he goes over a moon's them right now.

[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.340]
He's a good guy really is he just he just we had a bad upbringing or something.

[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:43.920]
He's just bitter.

[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.180]
I wait every day for him to call in.

[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.380]
Either that or he had like a bad bull like Rich one time.

[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:50.580]

[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.240]
But it was really young you know and he hasn't been able to get it out of his system yet.

[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.120]
Fruit and Panama.

[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.640]
But one of these days man that baby will squirt right out and he'll feel a lot better about.

[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.580]
Yes exactly.

[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.300]
Kind of a brain cleansing experience.

[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.200]
So you're liking lutes but probably not like up the street from him at all huh?

[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.700]
No I hope not anyway.

[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.900]
Yeah well you'll recognize him I guarantee you that if you see him at you float and we're one of those places uh you'll probably recognize him.

[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.380]
Exactly.

[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.740]
Well listen have a great weekend you can I'll tell you well you can be like lutes number two okay?

[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:27.900]
Okay listen yeah I got like the FL Lake calling number I would like you to call in and bust Russia's Bible for.

[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.320]
Now they won't first of all rushes on tape number one he don't take any line call.

[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.680]
No they lied to you about that he's on tape.

[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:39.380]
And number two they wouldn't put any of us Rick and Suds tried that on Monday right out of the box they tried to call in.

[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:45.280]
Be friendly and just say how you doing and they're so paranoid over there they won't put anybody on the air that even mentions SUN ring of this.

[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.340]
So it's a waste of time okay?

[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.520]
Well you're sure great man.

[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.260]
Well thanks a lot.

[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.240]
I've made the switch.

[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.640]
Have a good one and watch yourself.

[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.740]
Okay bye bye.

[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.040]
Bye bye.

[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.900]
Man we are just elutes is like a hotbed of activity for us.

[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:06.760]
You're listening to a tape delayed broadcast from our sister station in Miami the Neil Rogers show on News Talk Radio 620 WSU N.

[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.380]
Some people don't.

[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.580]
They don't have a clue.

[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:33.460]
They walk all around with their head up their glutes.

[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:38.000]
It's always the same.

[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.900]
They're just looking for fame.

[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:57.900]
And they close the abuse like the chronic influence over chronic problems.

[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:27.880]
And they're just looking for fame.

[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:27.880]

[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:27.880]

[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:27.880]

[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.780]
And they're just looking for fame.

[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.240]
And they're just looking for fame.

[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.460]
And they're just looking for fame.

[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.640]
And they're just looking for fame.

[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.280]
We sound like that baby now.

[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.600]
Are you an elevator?

[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.440]
Are you an entry?

[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.840]
I think you've been up an entry.

[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.720]
It was an elevator.

[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.540]
If you want to admit it now it'll wait till tomorrow.

[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.760]
Some people don't.

[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.820]
They don't have a clue.

[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:23.040]
They walk all around with their head up their glutes.

[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.400]
It's always the same.

[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.120]
They're just looking for fame.

[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.280]
And they love the abuse.

[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.040]
The life of chronic problems.

[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.580]
Is the chronic problems.

[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.400]
Oh, you don't want to forget to mention today?

[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.100]
WFL lace sucks.

[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.100]
We're like just spreading like a big gigantic tortoise.

[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.820]
We like crawled out of the mong and we're like creeping along and poking out every now and then.

[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.540]
And just sticking that big one eye out to see who's here and what's what.

[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.260]
Speaking of what's what.

[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.780]
Let's go to Hollywood. Hello.

[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.200]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:17.280]
I got to say this has to go down in the all-time Neil Rogers archives of the best week ever.

[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.600]
The anals of broadcast history, sir.

[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.440]
You know what?

[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.280]
It goes to show you that if you give people a chance to like branch out and do new things.

[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.960]
That it's just amazing what can happen even though we do have a mental case for a program director.

[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.760]
Yep, yep, yep, yep. That's him.

[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.140]
You know, you got. Why, are you sure this isn't him?

[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.340]
No, no, no.

[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:42.780]
You got Big Bob of sitting up there in Plants City on a Pinewood bench in front of the country wood store there.

[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.200]
Yeah.

[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.680]
With his pick him up truck and his pit bull name popped in his rebel flag.

[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:53.060]
And he's probably just going down to the dry cleaners and get his freshly white press suit that he's going to wear with his hood tonight.

[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.500]
Yeah, and he's I'm actually going to say you're in a way.

[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.320]
We ain't going to stay in for it, Neil. You better get off the end. We don't like this.

[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.300]
Yeah, we don't like it, but turn it up a little bit.

[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.620]
Yeah, I tell you have another beer, Bubba. Have a cold.

[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.400]
We love you, Diane.

[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.280]
I think he's really calling from P Ryan, sir, to be honest with you.

[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.980]
I think he has to. He's a long time, Neil. I don't think he's fooling anybody.

[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.800]
Right. You know, and I just don't know who he's trying to fool.

[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.280]
But I probably bring him, probably bring us some lunch on Monday.

[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.220]
Well, I can't wait to hear him Monday. You know, he's got to be almost as...

[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.020]
Oh, man. Can you imagine after all the big meetings over the weekend, he'll probably be just fuller.

[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.720]
It never probably would get Loot's junior there on there with him too.

[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.000]
I think he only probably trimming up that big furry beard he's got on his face.

[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:38.140]
I think Loot's one and Loot's two. I think something may happen with those two pretty soon.

[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.040]
Trying to fit into them bib overalls, go down to the dry cleaners.

[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.520]
They have a knack about themselves. They all sit on that pinewood bench in front of the country with the tortoise,

[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.040]
sipping on the cold beer. So, you know...

[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.460]
Bib overalls, man. You know those guys that wear those bib overalls like for long stretches,

[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.840]
like many, many days at a time. Oh, man, it must be really ripen there, baby.

[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.740]
Well, I just want to say one thing, Bubba.

[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.160]
Bubba, leave the girls alone now. Go get yourself a handful of sheep for the weekend.

[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.660]
And then just talk about Neil, because we love you, Diane.

[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.040]
And don't say more bad things about us. That's it. We just love you, Bubba.

[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.900]
Come on down. We listen to Neil for many, many years.

[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.440]
It's time we turn John to him. So, come on down, Bubba.

[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.540]
Okay. Have a go.

[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.980]
Pick a winter pal. I'll tell you one place where we are kicking, I mean, besides Loot's.

[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.860]
I mean, we know we got Loot's wrapped up.

[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:29.180]
But in Sari Soda, can you believe it? We're just like between New College and the clown college.

[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.460]
Any what?

[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.060]
Hello, the guy's, hello.

[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.040]
Yeah, there's just a few clown college. Yes.

[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.880]
Got a question for you. Is this St. Tweet?

[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.280]
The other St. Pete.

[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.600]
Okay. Got a question. Where the hell did you guys crawl out of anyway?

[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.700]
The slime. Out of the way?

[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.640]
Out of the slime.

[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.260]
I believe it. I've been listening to that station for the last two years.

[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.200]
Also, you asked whole show up. Right.

[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.060]
And you're talking about all the old people. I don't think so.

[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.760]
Oh, you don't think so. What?

[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.560]
They're St. Pete.

[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.220]
Oh, no, there's no old people in St. Pete. I just made it up.

[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.820]
You just made it up.

[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.760]
Right. Just like you made it up. That were assholes. Okay.

[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.720]
Now, I didn't make up. You are an asshole.

[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.760]
You don't know that. So you don't know us well enough to be called as asshole.

[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.100]
Oh, yes, I do. I've been listening to clowns. I've got news for you.

[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.960]
Who has clowns like all of us are clowns. And why is that so?

[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.060]
Because we're not playing your favorite spit kick in music.

[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.660]
On a station that was like losing their ass that couldn't find an audience at a panty rate.

[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.400]
Panty waste.

[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.620]
Panty waste. Yeah, on a panty waste. That's in lutes.

[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.420]
Panty raid. Panty raid. We have to like spell it out for you.

[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.380]
You've been listening too much of that music. So it's been affecting your mind.

[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.260]
Now, are you still listening?

[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.120]
Oh, yeah, clown. I'm listening.

[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.780]
You're still listening. Now, how is that possible?

[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.420]
Are you lucky to ask an M like on the M side like a serious masochist?

[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.600]
Like you can't stand it and we're clowns and we suck.

[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.280]
And I'm an asshole, but you're listening.

[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.140]
How is that possible?

[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.240]
How is that possible?

[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.640]
Right. Where do you have one of those?

[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.940]
Where do you have one of those pieces of station they had?

[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.280]
You have one of those crystal sets that only tunes in 620 and you can't find any other station?

[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.520]
I said you were only the only thing.

[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.880]
No, no, no, no, no. You're just kind of a wiseass.

[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.160]
Now, let me ask you again. Why are you still listening?

[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.960]
You don't like me. You don't like the show. You don't like Rick and Suds.

[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.420]
You don't like anything you said at all.

[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.460]
You've got to listen to a cop.

[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.160]
Idiots in here are going to couple of them that like to listen to it.

[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:22.540]
What?

[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.440]
I got a couple of idiots out here that like to listen to it.

[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.840]
You don't like to talk with it.

[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.860]
And so in other words, they got like you hell hostage in a broom closet and they're forcing you to listen.

[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.180]
No, they're in my office.

[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.300]
They're in your orifice?

[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.660]
And for the orifice they got like you to help us.

[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:35.860]

[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.100]
Yeah, in my office.

[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.360]
They're in your orifice.

[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.680]
Boy, I call a police.

[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.420]
He was good, man.

[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.440]
Now, who are you, sir?

[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.960]
Who are you, kiddin', okay?

[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.660]
Who's Chan? Are you Yankin' Pal?

[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.100]
We hear this crap here all the time.

[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:49.280]
Yeah?

[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.200]
Oh, I can't stand you guys, but we got a couple of people here at the office and I'm forced to listen to it.

[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.040]
Well, just to get away from the radio, go stick your head out the window, get some fresh air.

[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.680]
Another professional mouth content for whom we are doing a massive pubic service,

[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.480]
because he's happy to be unhappy.

[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.420]
We make him unhappy and he's happy with that.

[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.620]
You follow what I'm saying?

[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.180]
He wants to be unhappy and we are making him damn unhappy and he loves it.

[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.540]
Now, I want to keep track.

[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.420]
Okay, keep like a mental note of between Ludes and the guy in Lakeland and this guy.

[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.400]
And like we're going to have a big party up there at Stakin' Flake,

[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.160]
one of these days, and we're all going to sit around and be unhappy together.

[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.820]
Oh, man, this stuff really sucks.

[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.460]
You know, that kind of, yeah.

[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.360]
And we'll play our little strata various and fiddle with it.

[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.920]
All right, I'm looking forward to that.

[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.320]
Let's get back to what I was going to tell the story.

[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.660]
I'm sitting there minding my own business on Saturday in my house watching some boring thing on TV.

[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.360]
And the doorbell rings.

[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:10.880]
And my dogs start barking and screaming and puking and carrying out like they usually do just for variety.

[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.100]
And I go to the door and it's Rick, my mailman.

[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.140]
It was a good guy.

[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.760]
Okay, good guy in his own bizarre, like most mail carriers are peculiar way.

[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:28.240]
And I go out and he's got like, you know, I thought he's got like a registered letter or a certified something special.

[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.160]
No, he just wants to be asked.

[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.080]
So I go outside and I'm talking and he says,

[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.400]
boy, he says, you know, that this new out of town hookup,

[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.220]
this is sure the best thing that's ever happened.

[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.580]
I said, yeah, we're having a great time.

[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.620]
Because over there at the post office, man, they were all a surgeon.

[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.040]
It was getting really desperate.

[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.960]
They were all like ready to tune out.

[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.000]
They were all searching for something else.

[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.120]
And this came along just in time.

[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.660]
And here I just got through between the 930 to 10 half hour, which they nearly killed me.

[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.600]
And then the gallbladder, which came very close, I thought, to killing me.

[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.820]
And you know, it's like, it's like, here's a guy who's been, you know, not through the most pleasant time recently.

[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:12.420]
And who gives a crap and so the collar is suck and his town is basically boring as dog droppings.

[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.240]
And the guy's like, well, you know, we were ready to tune out, you know.

[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.540]
They were searching, well, search for this.

[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.820]
Okay. Are you goofballs at the post office in plantation?

[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.400]
Oh, God.

[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.900]
Just like kicking you in the teeth.

[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.340]
I mean, like goes out of the way, did not have it just like three crappy couple of bills

[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.420]
and a couple of pieces of trash mail like usual, nothing special.

[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.860]
And he goes out of the way to tell me the story about what?

[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:41.160]
All those guys in the post office, man, all your good oil friends over there.

[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.920]
They were out, they were out of way out, man.

[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:48.980]
This thing came along just in time because your show sucked is what it basically tried to say.

[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:49.740]
Well, thanks, Rick.

[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:57.560]
Thanks for taking the time to ring the doorbell and to get me out of like, I think I was napping at the time out of a solid sleep

[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.560]
to get me to come outside so you can give me those three putrid bills, a couple of crappy letters

[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.780]
and tell me that the guys at the post office in plantation are a bunch basically of assholes

[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.940]
is what you were saying, okay?

[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:11.840]
God.

[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.220]
They give no meaning to the word mail carriers over there at the plantation PO.

[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.280]
Here's Daniel on the starline.

[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.600]
All right, Daniel, how you doing?

[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.000]
Great.

[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.180]
I got two questions, not two questions, I got two things to talk about.

[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.480]
All the Broward Lines, by the way, are dead as a door nail man out there.

[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.520]
It looks like porous lawn cemetery on Broward 524WYOD.

[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.040]
I say let's take all the Broward Lines and put them in the 800 trunk.

[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.020]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.420]
Good things.

[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.560]
Number one, how pathetic this state of Florida is.

[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:46.220]
Number one, I come out of my house the other day and my wheels off my garbage pile are gone.

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:46.800]
Yeah.

[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.860]
Supposedly in Hollywood, you're now allowed to have wheels on your garbage pile as to get a fine.

[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.060]
That's number one.

[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:53.580]
Wheels on your garbage pile?

[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.900]
Yeah, you're supposed to have garbage piles with no wheels on there.

[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.820]
If you can't wheel on one of those, it's supposed to be wheelless.

[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.340]
There's an ordinance in Hollywood that you can't have wheels on your garbage pile.

[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:02.960]
That's great.

[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.120]
Number two, how long electrical contact that came down from New York?

[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.700]
It took two years of paperwork to come down here to transfer and take a license down here.

[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:12.860]
Listen to this.

[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.060]
I first, I lose my paperwork and there's only six of us who pass the exam.

[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.920]
I don't know how they can lose my paperwork.

[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.560]
I think they're very anti-New York first off.

[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.480]
What does that mean for anti-New York?

[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.420]
What does that mean?

[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:26.880]
I don't know.

[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.660]
There's a lot of people coming up from up north down here.

[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.400]
We don't want any more people from New York.

[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.260]
I don't blame them with too many of us anyhow.

[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:33.540]
Right.

[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.100]
If it's so great in New York, how come everybody wants to come here from New York?

[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.040]
David Dink and to such a wonderful mayor he ruined the city.

[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.080]
I got news for you, sir.

[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.620]
They were coming here long before David Dink was ever mayor of New York, okay?

[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.600]
There are people coming here to pay for his lunch.

[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.820]
I didn't die anyhow.

[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.960]
My fault is in the States.

[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:50.240]
Yeah.

[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.080]
I found it to me like you have a lot of complaints this morning.

[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.320]
Oh yeah, I'm a complaint on my mind.

[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.580]
Everybody is really all bent out of shape this morning.

[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.860]
My only complaint is about my people at the post office in plantation.

[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.600]
Other than that, everything is great.

[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.260]
And of course about the fact that Allison and Randy never got their jobs done.

[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:06.660]
Okay.

[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:07.880]
Other than that.

[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.240]
Listen to this one.

[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:09.720]
Yeah.

[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.500]
I went in to put a first day out to get a license on the state.

[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:12.980]
Oh, God.

[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:13.400]
Yes.

[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.340]
I paid them to go to activation fee and they tell me I got it in April.

[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.060]
I think you like it.

[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:18.100]
Sure.

[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.420]
Can I listen with all due respect?

[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:20.320]
Can I make a suggestion?

[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:20.820]
Yeah.

[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.380]
This could solve the problem, okay?

[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.720]
Go back to New York.

[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:29.060]
See you people up there at the plantation post office can sit up there and critique about

[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.700]
well, a call soft.

[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.260]
And this is not so exciting anymore.

[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.840]
And he goes adduct back and get your sitting up there with your finger with that, with your finger

[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.720]
with a moon node shine, okay, with your fist on your colon.

[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.220]
God is in pathetic up there in Broward.

[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.060]
That's the problem.

[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.580]
We need to divert all those brothers.

[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.340]
This has been going on.

[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.860]
This wasn't something that just started.

[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.500]
This has been going on for two years up there.

[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.900]
Those people have locked yaw man in Broward County.

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.420]
There's something wrong with the place.

[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:58.080]
It sucks.

[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.080]
Let's do a new port.

[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:00.420]
Richie.

[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:00.660]
Hello.

[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:01.940]
Yes.

[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:02.520]
Neil.

[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.200]
Yes.

[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.120]
You suck.

[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:04.820]
Okay.

[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.800]
Thank you so much.

[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.180]
I love you.

[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:06.640]
You know what?

[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.020]
Yeah.

[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:07.920]
Let me tell you something.

[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.420]
It's refreshing to hear you.

[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.200]
Let me tell you something.

[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:11.820]
You know what I'm saying.

[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.140]
You know what I'm saying.

[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:14.240]
You know what?

[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.860]
You're the first black talks to a host that has really got to me.

[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.460]
You're cute.

[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.320]
You're not a fan.

[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:19.680]
Yeah.

[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.880]
We're listening to you this morning at the Golden Nugget.

[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.320]
Let me ask you guys your question.

[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:23.520]
Yes.

[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.480]
How long you been working up this material, okay?

[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:25.880]
All weekend?

[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:26.740]
All weekend.

[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.320]
How about you have a team of writers put this together for you like Jay Leno.

[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.680]
We just got that crap.

[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:32.780]
I'm trying to tell you.

[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.120]
No, I will not stop this crap.

[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.000]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.220]
I will continue with this crap until I motivate the people of the plantation post office

[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.900]
to get their finger out of their...

[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:41.980]
How do you like that?

[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.400]
Forget that plantation post office.

[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.040]
They make me sick up there, okay?

[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.280]
Listen, I'm going to tell you something.

[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:46.780]
You know what?

[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.040]
I used to listen to the Bob Lasseter sit on his big fat ass and talk to him.

[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:51.680]
He's a neo-ridger.

[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.080]
He stole all your material for two years, right?

[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:54.500]
Yeah.

[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.040]
He thought you were God.

[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:56.840]
Yeah.

[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.060]
This guy thought you were something else.

[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.140]
Yeah, I am something else.

[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.460]
By the way, I talked to his old producer the other day, Neil.

[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.060]
Oh my God, the day is lost.

[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.460]
The day is lost, it is all over.

[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.520]
Oh, I knew it.

[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:07.940]
I knew it.

[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.440]
I knew it.

[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:08.660]
Yeah.

[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.680]
Oh, Bob, he's back.

[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.360]
He's back.

[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.280]
Hey, I talked to his producer the other day.

[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.740]
Have you ever met anybody that's got fat on their eyelids, sir?

[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:20.240]
Bob Lasseter is the only human being in the world who's got fat eyelids.

[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.120]
He can store food, you know that?

[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:22.400]
Yeah.

[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.540]
I mean, the guy's unbelievable.

[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.360]
I'm ugly legs in a short pant.

[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:25.660]
Right.

[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.300]
You know, I would like this.

[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.400]
Matter of fact, you said he was storing nuts for the wintertime.

[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.360]
I don't know what he meant by that.

[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.120]
That's what he said.

[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.400]
Why do all talk, show host?

[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.360]
Not all of them, but the majority of them get fat and grow beard.

[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:42.520]
Because they sit on their big fat ass all day and just all of the only exercise to get is their gums.

[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.300]
Is that what it is?

[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:43.560]
Right.

[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.660]
Hey, you know all the techniques.

[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:45.820]
You know, Neil.

[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.500]
I don't have a beard by the way, sir.

[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:47.960]
You don't.

[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.100]
I'm clean, shaved, and...

[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:49.800]
What is your weight?

[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.000]
What is my weight?

[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.360]
Yes.

[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.580]
Why are you writing a book?

[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.800]
Well, you start that.

[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.440]
I weigh 193 pounds as of this moment.

[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.180]
And what's your height?

[00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.300]
My height?

[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.100]
How tall are you?

[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.120]
How big is it?

[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.100]
How tall are you without heels?

[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.100]
Five-nine without the slippers.

[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.180]
Five-nine, for the light.

[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:09.960]
Some a little...

[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.920]
No, it's not just right.

[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.520]
I should weigh about 160 pounds.

[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.660]
No, no, no, I'm like skinny guys.

[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:14.980]
You're right.

[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.440]
I don't want to look anorexic.

[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:16.840]
Yes.

[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.860]
You get better with the skinny guys, like going a bed with Venetian blinds.

[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.160]
You know, really?

[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.620]
Well, I guess the voice of experience.

[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.160]
Well, have a great day.

[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.160]
Neil, yes.

[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.160]
You're coming in strong.

[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:28.440]
And I'll tell you something.

[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:29.780]
Keep up the good work.

[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.100]
I'll tell you, you do have some bad colors.

[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.020]
You're not too far from a Hudson, are you, by the way?

[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.300]
Well, this is no part of Richie.

[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.460]
This is a class area.

[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.800]
But that's not far from...

[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.080]
You know what?

[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:38.900]
This is the homeowner.

[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.740]
The most boring talk...

[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.320]
The most boring talk show in the world.

[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.740]
Which one is Ed?

[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.380]
Mr. Williams lives here.

[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.300]
Mr. Williams.

[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.000]
Bruce Williams.

[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.460]
Oh, Bruce Williams lives there?

[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.240]
Makes his home.

[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:50.980]
Oh, God.

[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.940]
It's a new part of Richie Florida.

[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.840]
Well, that's a good place for him, believe me.

[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.380]
There's nobody living here under the age of 65.

[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.180]
Mm-hmm.

[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.840]
Hello, Bruce.

[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.360]
I want to go into business.

[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:01.980]
I'm a hundred and ten.

[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.880]
I want to invest in my future.

[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.500]
Wouldn't you like to hear him just once?

[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.660]
One of these guys call in and say, you know, Bruce, I can't make my payments.

[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.260]
And I've lost my job.

[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.700]
What advice should he...

[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.100]
You know, wouldn't you like to hear him just once?

[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.560]
Say, burn your damn house down and run out of towners.

[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:16.840]
Right.

[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:17.580]
Exactly.

[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.320]
That's the kind of advice you would give him.

[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:19.720]
You bet.

[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.520]
Well, that's the kind of advice you would give him because you're all hard.

[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:23.880]
I don't want to suck up to you.

[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.260]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.660]
Yes, you do. You've already started.

[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.520]
But I want to tell you that.

[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.760]
I said the voice of experience.

[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.980]
You're a breath of fresh air.

[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.840]
Well, have a great day.

[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:30.520]
See you later, Nick.

[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:30.980]
See you.

[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.360]
New part, Richie, ladies and gentlemen and Hudson.

[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.340]
Right, close together there.

[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:39.520]
In fact, I think Aaron's coming over to that guy for a little lunchtime something.

[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.580]
That's our new sounder.

[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.520]
Those are the boots from Loots.

[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.940]
Is this really a Loots call?

[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:52.820]
Yes.

[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.900]
Our new Loots lister?

[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:55.820]
Yes.

[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.420]
On brand new lister.

[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.060]
On believable, sir.

[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:07.940]
I always said all the Yankees would go back with their pension selfish, but I'm not

[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:08.900]
just going back.

[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.440]
They stink and they talk funny.

[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:11.820]
Right.

[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.700]
They come down here and they take all the jobs away from people that live here.

[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.040]
Right.

[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:16.720]
They work for nothing.

[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:17.360]
Right.

[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.680]
And they just, they stink.

[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.960]
They're screwed up.

[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.700]
You know, I always say, would I go back?

[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.480]
They're obnoxious and they smell bad.

[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.020]
Yeah.

[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:25.520]
Yeah.

[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.400]
I'd rather have to, and they got just pounds of armpit here.

[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.920]
And I don't know what it is about you, but I like you, but you suck.

[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:33.640]
Right.

[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:40.560]
You sound like the guy from, he sounded just like the guy from what you call, Newport Richie

[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:40.820]
didn't he?

[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.880]
With a different voice.

[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.100]
He likes me because I suck.

[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.480]
Well, I've heard that before.

[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.780]
That was another caller from Loots.

[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.680]
Man, we are kicking ass in Loots.

[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.160]
We can't buy a call in Broward, but we are dynamite in Loots.

[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.760]
I bet you there's a lot of dynamite in Loots.

[00:33:59.200 --> 00:33:59.940]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.060]
Here's a plantation.

[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:02.560]
Hello.

[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.640]
How many food did you eat?

[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.460]
What is it?

[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.760]
How many food did you eat?

[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.020]
How many food did you eat?

[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.820]
Let me ask you something.

[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.000]
How old are you?

[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:12.900]
A morning 10.

[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:13.540]
10.

[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:14.820]
Would you like to make it 11?

[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.240]
Yeah.

[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.240]
And don't ever make a call like this again, punk.

[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.360]
We have an open line in day, 751 111, Broward 5249, 4.

[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.480]
How many food did you eat?

[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.280]
How many food did your 10 years old?

[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.140]
And that's the way you speak.

[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.000]
God help us, the human race, manners, no hope for us at all.

[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.420]
No wonder Al is just eating.

[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.380]
At least it tastes good.

[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.300]
At least it's satisfying his immediate urges.

[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.960]
Because I think the guy in what the wacko and waco may have a point.

[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:38.540]
This could be it.

[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.860]
This could be our last paysock.

[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.240]
You know what?

[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.980]
So let's just pick out extra butter on the monsters tonight, guys.

[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:45.840]
Bradenton.

[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.140]
Oh, I didn't do the thing.

[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:49.500]
Hello.

[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:50.220]
Hello.

[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:50.800]
Hi.

[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.440]
This is your chronic every three weeks.

[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.400]
I call the three.

[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.240]
You are one caller in Bradenton, great.

[00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.860]
Well, I'm not eating it.

[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.640]
I'm not sweating.

[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.240]
So can I still be on your show?

[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:02.880]
I guess.

[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.840]
I won't give you a whole hour though.

[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.580]
You have to eat a lot in sweat or hell of a lot to get a whole hour on this show.

[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.660]
I'm not exaggerating.

[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.380]
He was sweating so profusely in his face with so red,

[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.700]
especially when he started laughing.

[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:15.320]
I know.

[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.880]
I was crazy to the phone.

[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.540]
I was convinced that he was not going to make it through that hour.

[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.200]
I mean, he was just barely functioning.

[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.520]
I want to wish you a baby chicie puff up.

[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.580]
Oh, and likewise.

[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.200]
I'm not.

[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:27.480]
I'm not.

[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:28.500]
Japanese, too.

[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.720]
Are you serial?

[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.760]
Are Japanese, too?

[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:31.560]
Yes, I am.

[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.080]
Well, how much sushi do you have on paysock?

[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.140]
Unlikely, huh?

[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.700]
Are Japanese, too?

[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.220]
Yes.

[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.180]
Is that by conversion, by marriage?

[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:41.820]
I know.

[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.280]
No.

[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.480]
There are Japanese Jews?

[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.280]
No.

[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.940]
My grandfather was Jewish.

[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.900]
My grandmother was French and Japanese.

[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.300]
Well, I'll be damned.

[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:50.780]
That's incredible.

[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.060]
Well, not really.

[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.520]
Well, how many Jews are there in Japan?

[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:54.500]
Six?

[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.900]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:57.120]
Huh?

[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.180]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.500]
Not a whole lot.

[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.340]
I've never counted.

[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.120]
Never counted, but probably could have.

[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.060]
You had those a couple hours.

[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.120]
I am American.

[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.400]
Well, that's great.

[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.800]
I wanted to do a...

[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.040]
That's a great lady to say, Neil God.

[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:14.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.080]
How about in Japanese?

[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.140]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:20.520]
Huh?

[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.360]
Could you do that?

[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.380]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:23.820]
Yeah.

[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.980]
But I don't think I would.

[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:26.620]
Why not?

[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.800]
Let's give it a shot.

[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.100]
Come on.

[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:29.800]
We'll make you a start.

[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:30.580]
We'll put it on card.

[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.740]
Well, I wanted to put some...

[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.260]
You remember when Marilyn Monroe sang,

[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.900]
have it for a state president?

[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:39.540]
Right.

[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:40.640]
Mr. President.

[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:40.960]
Right.

[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.420]
Right.

[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.220]
Well, I wanted to...

[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:48.960]
And actually, my religion is a bit more serious to me than putting, you know...

[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.000]
Well, I can say, uh...

[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.020]
Neil...

[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.000]
...Sintar.

[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.820]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.640]
That's it.

[00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.480]
Tired it up, George.

[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.380]
But I wanted to tell you a story.

[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.640]
I wanted to say Neil God.

[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.300]
Well, that's great.

[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.300]
May I?

[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.040]
Go ahead.

[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:09.780]
Neil...

[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.380]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.320]
God.

[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:13.760]
How's that?

[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.100]
Well, it sounds like Al got the audience sufficiently aroused even if he wasn't.

[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:17.860]
Have a great day.

[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.220]
Hey, I wanted to ask you something.

[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.260]
Happy pay, Sock, yes?

[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:20.820]
Was...

[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.720]
Was the hockey game yet named?

[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.480]
Was the hockey team yet named?

[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.660]
Uh, yeah, Goiim.

[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.320]
We're going to call him.

[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.520]
My Emmy Goiim.

[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.500]
How do you like it?

[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.340]
Florida Freeze.

[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.000]
Florida Freeze isn't bad.

[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.000]
In fact, Al's probably eating one of those right now in his way to the game.

[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.480]
Okay, remember who said it?

[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:35.800]
Okay.

[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.800]
You bring it.

[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.520]
Have a happy.

[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.120]
You too.

[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:38.460]
Bye-bye.

[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.020]
There's our Japanese U.

[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.900]
We have an open line in the green line, 1-800-944-Pace-Authy.

[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.360]
What sparks a champion?

[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.340]
Spark U and champions.

[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.320]
Choose Weedies.

[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.340]
Let's see that spark in action.

[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.640]
Keep your eye on Fleetwood and Richie Ashman, patrolling centerfield for the Phillies.

[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.400]
Here's the pitch.

[00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.200]
Uh-oh, it's a low-sinking liner out of a second.

[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.200]
Looks like it's in there.

[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.360]
Ashman's racing in.

[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.460]
He makes a desperate dime.

[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.620]
And he's up for that ball.

[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.560]
What's the big, you spring catch by Richie Ashman?

[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.640]
Man, oh man.

[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.320]
He's really got that spark.

[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.700]
Champion Ashman fires up with Weedies.

[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:13.740]
How about you?

[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.760]
Remember what sparks a champion?

[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:16.540]
Spark U.

[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.560]
What sparks a champion?

[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.800]
Spark U and champions.

[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.580]
Choose Weedies.

[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.580]
I guess, uh, uh, shout-out already.

[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.000]
I guess diving for those line drives is a good way to get a Richie Ashman, huh?

[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.020]
He has a matter of fact, you know what else I saw?

[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.980]
The founder seats, they have special food.

[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:47.580]
I was watching one of the pieces on the news over the weekend and they were showing one of the concession guys and he was peddling some kind of seafood stuff with shrimp and lobster.

[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.060]
I don't know what the hell it was.

[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.940]
And they said, well gee, this isn't like your real regular hot dogs.

[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.620]
And he said, no, this is strictly for the founder's section.

[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.320]
And that's where I'm going to be sitting.

[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.440]
That's where all of our WIOD seats are.

[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.560]
And those great founder seats right behind the dugout like tomorrow night in the third row.

[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.200]
So what can I say?

[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.960]
See how you played your cards wrong if you would have come with me to the game tomorrow?

[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.700]
You could have liked really good nuts.

[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.840]
You could have had like ten times as much food and ten times the excitement and cholesterol.

[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:16.820]
Sunrise.

[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.640]
Hello.

[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.320]
Sunrise?

[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:21.920]
Hi.

[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:22.360]
Yeah.

[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:23.360]
How are you doing?

[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:23.880]
Okay.

[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.920]
I see the martyrs made the front page.

[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.800]
Hey, what are you making about the eye, isocreomy man?

[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:31.640]
The what?

[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.040]
The isocreomy man.

[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:33.720]
Meaning what?

[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:34.920]
He's selling isocreomy.

[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.120]
Is he?

[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:36.700]
Yeah.

[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.500]
You know there's an old saying about saying you scream iscreomy, we all scream for isocreomy.

[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.460]
Yeah, there sure is.

[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.060]
So how you been?

[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:44.660]
Pretty good.

[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.520]
Okay, we have an open line at Broward.

[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.800]
It was from Sunrise.

[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:50.880]
What do you want, George?

[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.480]
My God.

[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.840]
The median age there is death.

[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.660]
5249463, that was a super sunrise hole we had.

[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.940]
He's all worked up for the game, huh?

[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.180]
He's had his weedies.

[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.680]
And probably getting ready for a moving experience any second.

[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.480]
Tampa.

[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.520]
Holy cow.

[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.100]
Exactly.

[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.860]
Hey, I see you guys.

[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:11.060]
They printed in the tripping yesterday the name of the new Miami hockey team.

[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.620]
The Florida Panthers.

[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.500]
No, please.

[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.440]
Can I reach a headline here from Futures Sports Edition?

[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.780]
That's not official, is it?

[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.220]
I don't know, I just wouldn't know.

[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.220]
No, but I can just see the headline now, lightning drop pants.

[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.460]
Yeah, that's cute.

[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.720]
Go, pants, go.

[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.600]
I want to say something about Bird.

[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:28.540]
Did you think?

[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.480]
I was going to include Rob Zaminer, is he going to do that?

[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.040]
Either him or Demile.

[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.500]
Because I want to be there with that game.

[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.620]
By the way, all you flyer fans, Gary Galley is God.

[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.040]
I just thought I'd mention that.

[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.120]
So you're a good thing.

[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.420]
I'm kind of getting my keen in for a coach, ain't you?

[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.220]
No, we're not.

[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:45.420]
Well, they were showing the game here Saturday and Bobby Clark

[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.280]
and him were sitting under press box together.

[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:47.960]
Oh, really?

[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:48.320]
Yeah.

[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.500]
Well, the story is here said that it's going to be somebody else,

[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.320]
but that would be great.

[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.040]
I like my keen and man, we have him.

[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.960]
He'd be the next best thing to Don Sherry.

[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.220]
Everybody be spearing and knocking each other's heads off.

[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.000]
That's why we did it.

[00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:58.260]
Yeah.

[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.140]
For not doing nothing, he'd be well, man.

[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:01.460]
Exactly.

[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.560]
For a guy who had a rather mediocre career, both as a player and a coach,

[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.680]
he is sure parlyed into a lot of money.

[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.000]
Really?

[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.040]
Um, about Bird.

[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:10.620]
Bird?

[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.140]
Yes.

[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:11.780]
Be Bird?

[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:12.420]
Be Bird.

[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:12.840]
Yeah.

[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.160]
His taste is in his ass.

[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.080]
Well, we know that.

[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.520]
Any guy who likes choking puke or chokers,

[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.140]
uh, run and run.

[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.900]
I mean, they're not no Skylar and guitar, man, but cheese, you know?

[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.460]
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.080]
Woo-hoo!

[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.100]
Hey, whatever happened.

[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:27.900]
The best they can do.

[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.820]
Lightening round of Neil Godch, you did.

[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.100]
Whatever happened to it?

[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.700]
Yeah, you said you were going to cart a whole bunch up,

[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.820]
and I've been waiting for myself to come up on there.

[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:35.680]
Cart a bunch of what?

[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.520]
You said you were going to do a whole bunch of those Neil Godch.

[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.140]
The only one I've heard is Wayne Doug.

[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.800]
Oh, oh, um, I have a whole bunch of them carted up.

[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:44.220]
Oh.

[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.640]
There's no way to hear myself.

[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.740]
Where the hell are they?

[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.220]
What the hell happened to all my Neil God cards?

[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.880]
You must be the guy that was in here over the weekend and stole that card.

[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:53.500]
No, sir.

[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.120]
Gone?

[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:54.960]
Uh-oh.

[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:55.480]
Missing?

[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:56.040]
Uh-oh.

[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.200]
I can't put my finger on it right now, but it happens to be in the machine.

[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.340]
Neil God!

[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:01.860]
Is that it?

[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:02.960]
No, it was the guy...

[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.680]
Neil God.

[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:04.460]
No.

[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:06.640]
It was the guy...

[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.000]
Neil God.

[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:07.880]
No.

[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.440]
Neil God.

[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:10.300]
No.

[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:10.940]
Neil.

[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:11.820]
God.

[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:12.440]
Neil.

[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.140]
No.

[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.980]
Ha, ha, ha!

[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.360]
Neil God.

[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.440]
Definitely not.

[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.320]
I think that last one I recorded at the rectory.

[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.420]
Neil God.

[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:22.480]
No.

[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.760]
Neil God.

[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:25.920]
Shut up, Kurt.

[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.220]
Neil God.

[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:28.940]
No.

[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:29.540]

[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.920]
Neil God.

[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:31.580]
No.

[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:32.480]
No.

[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:32.540]
Neil God.

[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:32.540]

[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.780]
Well, how many of them are on here, George?

[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:34.720]
A lot?

[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.200]
Neil God.

[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.300]
That's funny, fuck.

[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.720]
Yeah, it's not a nugget.

[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.880]
You notice what a wimpy is?

[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.880]
He won't call me anywhere after he said bullshot on here on this station.

[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.080]
That we have fingered him for being the abuser of our airwaves that he is.

[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.280]
Wouldn't do it on magic one or two point up your nose over there.

[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.080]
But when he comes on this station, he says all kinds of crap.

[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:54.880]
Neil God.

[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.180]
No.

[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:56.960]
Wow.

[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.720]
Neil God.

[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.020]
Are you sure it's on here?

[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.700]
Neil God.

[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:04.980]
No.

[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:05.760]
No.

[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:06.320]
No.

[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.040]
God, Neil, is that thing for real?

[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.580]
Neil, just Neil.

[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:12.820]
No.

[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.260]
It was before that.

[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.820]
It was after the guy that said it was a question.

[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.220]
You told me to clean up the phone.

[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.420]
Neil God.

[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:20.500]
No.

[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.540]
That's Scotty Mack.

[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:22.160]
Yeah.

[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:22.720]
You're right.

[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.160]
Come on, cue up here.

[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.060]
Is that the end of them?

[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.920]
Yeah, I think that was the last Scotty Mack.

[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:28.180]
How well?

[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.320]
How do you know what's on the card?

[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.860]
Because I happen to tape it that day.

[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.020]
I'm not being a Yen.

[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:33.720]
All right, here we go.

[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:34.920]
Neil, Teal.

[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:35.920]
No.

[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.320]
Neil God.

[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:40.540]
No.

[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:42.260]
Marvin Goddiff.

[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:44.940]
Marvin Gardens.

[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:46.660]
No.

[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.860]
By the way, speaking of Marvin, he can be seen any hour morning noon and night, rollerblading,

[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.360]
like a maniac on Miami Beach.

[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.700]
I saw him the other day.

[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.160]
This guy.

[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.140]
He's looking for a job in a bar.

[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.300]
He's out of his mind.

[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.780]
I mean, this guy's going to get killed.

[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:04.440]
He thinks he's in what the hell was that movie in LA, a rollerblade?

[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.520]
Roller, Derby.

[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:07.680]
Roller, boogie.

[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.440]
Roller, boogie.

[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:08.740]
Yeah.

[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.980]
Neil, I don't know.

[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.260]
Oh, that's for paysocks.

[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:12.860]
That's the Hebrew version.

[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.080]
Neil God.

[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.060]
Jesus, how many of you are on this damn thing?

[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.440]
And now we've got to get that Japanese Jewish on here, too.

[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.920]
Oh, Neil God.

[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.300]
No, not the old.

[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.600]
See the old just to...

[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:24.780]
Neil.

[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.160]
Yeah.

[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:28.440]
No.

[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.560]
Neil God.

[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:30.740]
It's right after that.

[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:31.360]
Oh, here we go.

[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.580]
Okay, big build up here.

[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.120]
Here we go.

[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.060]
Wait a minute.

[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.840]
I may get so excited when I hear this, then.

[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:37.640]
Now, wet my pants.

[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:39.280]
Neil God.

[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.340]
That's the one.

[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.160]
Oh.

[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:41.840]
Okay.

[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:42.420]
Thanks.

[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.460]
Thanks for telling two minutes.

[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:44.020]
Yeah.

[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.240]
Venture, white, bureau, driving, deroyed, taken...

[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:47.460]
Yeah.

[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:48.020]
Okay.

[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:49.440]
Wow.

[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.280]
Man, if very cool could kill as much productive time as that did.

[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.380]
Yeah, let me speak to that.

[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.000]
1152 Al Goldstein's here for another eight minutes until we kick his fat ass out of him.

[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.380]
So what's new on the Pornos scene now?

[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.580]
Okay, I made my first...

[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.400]
My first Pornos film four weeks ago.

[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.120]
I don't even think it's new.

[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:05.960]
Oh, God.

[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.900]
You're gonna be the Al Goldstein line of sex films.

[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.000]
You're not blowing the certain point of view.

[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:11.780]
I'm not in it.

[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:12.360]
Wait a minute.

[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.200]
Is that a guy or a girl around the right arm?

[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:14.620]
Richard Bay?

[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.180]
Is that a guy?

[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.780]
Is that a guy or a girl?

[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:17.460]
It's a guy.

[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:18.120]
It's a guy.

[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:18.500]
Huh?

[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:19.880]
It's a Guitau.

[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.520]
It's one of those New Jersey Guitos.

[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.340]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.120]
I don't want any New Yorkers to be offended, but I've said it many times before.

[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.260]
Why is it not only...

[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.600]
Well, there are a lot of Jews in New York.

[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.240]
But why is it that people from New York are so sexless?

[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.180]
Almost...

[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:34.900]
What do you laugh at?

[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.480]
Almost every New Yorker that I've met, they're cold,

[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:38.500]
impersonal.

[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.460]
They have sexes like a function.

[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.140]
There is no emotion, no passion.

[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.360]
They'd be good in the church because they're no passions, so they can't come at any sense.

[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.500]
There's this very cold thing with New Yorkers.

[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.160]
What is that?

[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:52.140]
Oh, yes.

[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.140]
Oh, absolutely.

[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.160]
New Yorkers wear so sexless.

[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:56.380]
The weather is cold.

[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.860]
In fact, you look on his show, Richard Bay, any day.

[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.980]
And once in a while, he brings some...

[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:01.540]
Yeah, she was pretty.

[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:02.880]
He wants it a while.

[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.100]
And I have some people like that.

[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.300]
But more often than that, see that...

[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.040]
Well, I forget about her.

[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.300]
On the stage, the woman that's on the left, the young right there.

[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:10.520]
Yeah.

[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:11.880]
She's typical of what you see.

[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.180]
They're like New York Valley girls.

[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:16.280]
Well, they all live in Jersey.

[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.940]
If you talk about Manhattan girls, a lot of them are hot.

[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.160]
I don't agree with you.

[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.900]
I think New York City is great.

[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.220]
I'm not knocking New York City.

[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.980]
No, I'm talking about people from New York.

[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:26.900]
I didn't say the girls.

[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.100]
You forget who you're talking to.

[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.080]
I'm just talking about New Yorkers in general.

[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:30.480]
Okay.

[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.580]
Very sexless.

[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.020]
It's like Jews who are sexless, which is most.

[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.260]
Well, okay, but Jews are looking for the next meal.

[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.680]
Did they test it?

[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.680]
Damn, it all depends on what you're into eating now.

[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.840]
I guess that's where it's at.

[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.640]
Can you have sex if they didn't know?

[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.700]
Are you seriously going to have a line of porn?

[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.280]
You're not going to be doing stuff in the Marino.

[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.160]
It starts with the Hitchcock thing.

[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.840]
You know, the silhouette of Hitchcock.

[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:51.180]
Yeah.

[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.180]
They've hit wide, wide angle.

[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:53.800]
They've hit wide angle.

[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.940]
Yeah, wide angle.

[00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:02.220]
We can have films, but it's hard because you spend $12,000 for a full-length movie.

[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.600]
Five sex scenes.

[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.280]
We had to stop the shoot for two hours because one guy could not get in the show.

[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.740]
For two hours.

[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.780]
Is that the one you were talking about?

[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.400]
Well, yeah, it's amazing.

[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.020]
But a sex film can't be that good.

[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.400]
There is enough money to do a second take.

[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.000]
Scripts are important.

[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:22.360]
And you'd rather have a pretty 19-year-old girl in a hands of 25-year-old guy

[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.680]
than somebody who could speak lines.

[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:24.820]
Exactly.

[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.240]
That's the genre.

[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.580]
So you just accept it, right?

[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.120]
This is just being in a shock.

[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.320]
Okay, getting back to Abe Hirschfeld.

[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.640]
What are we going to do about this guy?

[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:35.940]
Are you going to pressage him?

[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.220]
Is he really going to pressage him?

[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:38.660]
I can't even press him.

[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.400]
How can you be a press agent for a person?

[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:41.080]

[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:41.380]

[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:42.580]
Pusted.

[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.100]
You don't have to put him on the air.

[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:44.920]
You don't want to talk.

[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.420]
I had lunch with him.

[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.000]
I love Abe because he's nice.

[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.540]
He's absolutely certifiably in the show.

[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:52.820]
But he doesn't need as much as you do.

[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.600]
He eats a lot.

[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:56.920]
Does he grab my food?

[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.360]
Does he want a lunch with him?

[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.460]
I hate to see anybody try to grab your food.

[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:04.700]
It is fighting words.

[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.340]
No, seriously, I don't want you to die on the air here.

[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:08.040]
I feel guilty.

[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.680]
I feel like I contributed to your demise.

[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.200]
And I don't want to be responsible for that.

[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.580]
Now, if it happens between here and the ballpark,

[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.820]
it could be an accumulation.

[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.680]
It could have been like the pastrami sandwich

[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.980]
or the peaking duck probably.

[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:18.680]
You have a lot to do with it.

[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.320]
Do you take blood sugar?

[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:22.500]
I mean, you must have diabetes.

[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:23.540]
No, I don't.

[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.280]
You don't?

[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:24.840]
I don't have that.

[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.680]
How is that possible?

[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:26.660]
It shows you.

[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.820]
I see my fights.

[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.560]
So, seriously, what is your blood sugar?

[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:30.640]
Do you have any idea of fasting?

[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.640]
No, I don't know.

[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:32.780]
I know my blood pressure.

[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.780]
I'm on low presser.

[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:36.820]
And I have a cholesterol.

[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:37.820]
I take mevacore.

[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.520]
Oh, what is your cholesterol?

[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.760]
Cholesterol is about 240.

[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.480]
You said you 175.

[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:44.520]
I can't believe it.

[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:46.400]
Yeah, but my last time was a little higher.

[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.120]
It was over 200.

[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:47.760]
Okay.

[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.240]
So, I got to stop eating things like pizza again after today.

[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.680]
Yeah, next season.

[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.300]
You don't know what your blood sugar is?

[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.320]
No, I should look it up.

[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.180]
When's the last time you went to a doctor?

[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.480]
A full four weeks ago.

[00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:58.900]
Yeah.

[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.560]
You know, to blood tests.

[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:00.980]
They didn't.

[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:01.720]
They took your blood.

[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:02.480]
Yeah, it was amazing.

[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.700]
And you're not diabetic?

[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:04.400]
Nothing.

[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.280]
I will be soon.

[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.800]
And you'll be taking insulin.

[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:07.740]
Doesn't make any difference.

[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:08.660]
You'll be taking insulin.

[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.820]
And then I'll have to start chopping your legs off.

[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.260]
Every day you give yourself an injection.

[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.700]
No, I don't take insulin.

[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.600]
I take, thank God, I take oral medication.

[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:18.760]
Oral.

[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.280]
Can you relate to that?

[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:21.140]
You're a food pig.

[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.800]
No, no, I am a food pig.

[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.360]
But I'm with a little bit of control.

[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:25.760]
I mean, you have no control.

[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:26.280]
No, none.

[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.960]
I have never seen a person.

[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.360]
In fact, I'm trying to think of a parallel like you.

[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.620]
If he were a cheese, he would like me.

[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.520]
Fab rich is, but he doesn't look as bad as you do.

[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.320]
I mean, he's big.

[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.060]
I don't know how much he weighs, but it's like more proportion.

[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.620]
But you're like the schmoo.

[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:43.220]
Like I said, it's like, your head is like regular size.

[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.440]
I mean, the neck is getting a little, what are you doing now?

[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.240]
About 19 now?

[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:46.720]
Yes.

[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:47.700]
Yeah, 19.

[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.440]
So he was probably a 17 before.

[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:50.960]
I started at 16.

[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:51.600]
Okay.

[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.180]
I was a content.

[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.720]
So your head, if you took your head right from the beard up.

[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:55.260]
Beautiful.

[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:55.840]
Perfect.

[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.940]
Put it on the wall somewhere.

[00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:57.580]
Huh?

[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.360]
To the face.

[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:02.680]
But from the chin down, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.640]
And then around the middle, which is the worst to your heart.

[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:06.360]
This is where it is.

[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.720]
It's like this enormous schmoo-like thing.

[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.900]
Like I said, it's like somebody took a tube and they put helium.

[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.440]
Seriously, I'm not joking about that.

[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.280]
Like a blow up.

[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.080]
Al Goldstein, the walking blow up doll.

[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.320]
That would be a good piece for screw.

[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.140]
Everybody should have an Algie at the Goldstein.

[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:21.200]
You're depressing me so much.

[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.100]
No, because I'm trying to get you out.

[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:23.640]
What do you need?

[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.140]
Do you have a mirror in the house?

[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:28.540]
Do you have a mirror?

[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:29.260]

[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:29.260]

[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.200]
You have to look at the mirror.

[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.560]
You have to stand stark naked.

[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:37.640]
Before this day is over, I want you to stand stark naked and look in the mirror.

[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.700]
But you probably have a donut in your hand while you're doing it.

[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.220]
Because I know you won't have anything else in your hand.

[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.280]
Because you can't find that.

[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.300]
You're very cruel.

[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:46.960]
No, I'm not.

[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:49.620]
I'm trying to appeal to something.

[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:50.460]
But it's obviously not.

[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:51.180]
It's going to work.

[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.100]
Why don't you say this?

[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:52.740]
You don't care.

[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.900]
Be honest with us.

[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:54.900]
You don't care.

[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.460]
Why we can make some news here.

[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.360]
We can make breaking news.

[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:01.420]
Al Goldstein says for the first time, he's going to eat himself to death but with a smile.

[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:02.720]
Why don't you just say that?

[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:03.620]
Is it true?

[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:04.820]
I won't do it.

[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.120]
I won't do it for spiked.

[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:08.960]
Because I want to outlive all my ex-wives.

[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:09.620]
I really do.

[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.560]
That's the truth.

[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.220]
I'm going to be thin within one year.

[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.740]
I'm going to be here and you're going to say, Al, how do you do it?

[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.600]
Lead me master.

[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.660]
I'll be in Waco with my brethren.

[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.140]
But truthfully, you're going to see it all.

[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:23.800]
You'll be in Waco?

[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:24.440]
Yes.

[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.300]
You're going to lock yourself in and wait for Paisa.

[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:27.720]
What is that all about?

[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:28.540]
Here's this far.

[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.800]
Biss and a maniac over there.

[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.260]
They're locked up.

[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.540]
They said, well, when Passover comes, then something big is going to happen over there.

[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.160]
What is that all about?

[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.540]
But you have to keep wanting to know Jews.

[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.880]
The other way, you'd have pizza delivery trucks and Chinese delivery trucks.

[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.240]
No food in 38 days.

[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.200]
That's what you think.

[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.740]
Jeff Cohen from Pizza Loft is probably on his way over there right now.

[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:45.420]
One of our people.

[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.960]
Anywhere there's a cable audience over there.

[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.600]
Look at this.

[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.800]
You started to choke on it now.

[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.760]
Don't you have attacks?

[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.160]
Do you have like coughing attacks?

[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:54.640]
Fits?

[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.420]
I cough a lot.

[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:55.640]
Yeah.

[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:57.360]
But that's all in it.

[00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.880]
Like many seizures.

[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.220]
Because you had one of those before.

[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.500]
Because I said something during a break.

[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.760]
That was a sweat and stuff.

[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:04.700]
It's a mama chest.

[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.360]
I had a one.

[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:05.700]
Yeah.

[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:06.820]
Exactly.

[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:08.860]
I want to start right here.

[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.340]
So I get full at the stadium.

[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.720]
I want to do the having the food.

[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:12.300]
Something there.

[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.080]
Possibly.

[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:16.760]
Any of the concession people is, you might want to call for takeout just in case.

[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.160]
Because I know they're prepared for a huge crowd for opening day.

[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.060]
They didn't count on you showing up.

[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.020]
So what would you have there today on it?

[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:23.920]
Are you the three hot dogs?

[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.540]
Are you the peanuts?

[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.200]
No.

[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.020]
Peanuts are no good.

[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:26.300]

[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:30.500]
And you got to take them out of the shell to explain to many calories taking them out of the shell.

[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:31.320]
It's like exercise.

[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:31.760]
Yeah.

[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.040]
Any hot dogs.

[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.240]
Like you probably don't eat like cramps.

[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.300]
Because it requires two slow and requires a lot of energy.

[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.460]
You get a shell, the good.

[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.120]
Shell.

[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:42.860]
Okay.

[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:43.960]
And the three hot dogs.

[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:44.920]
Three hot dogs.

[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:46.480]
What else do they have?

[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.760]
How about the big pretzels with mustard?

[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.660]
Very high like in...

[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:50.680]
Yeah, up to the wall.

[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.220]
Yeah, right.

[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:53.240]
What else?

[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.320]
Did they have hot and candy?

[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:55.420]
No cotton candy.

[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.820]
That's because it was sure they'll be great.

[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:57.960]
How about you miss the youth fair?

[00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.460]
We just finished with the Dave County youth fair.

[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:00.740]
You could have gone out there and gotten some...

[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.640]
I love cotton candy.

[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.640]
I haven't had it in years.

[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.120]
Great.

[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.440]
You know what I had last week?

[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.160]
That was great for the first time in years.

[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:06.940]
Bit of honey.

[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.040]
Wow.

[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:08.880]
Yeah.

[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.340]
It's been the last time you had a bit of honey.

[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.360]
No, I love that one.

[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.160]
Oh, you wouldn't like that.

[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:17.280]
That's not your kind of candy bar because you have to peel each section off your table.

[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.640]
I forget about that.

[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:20.600]
But you have to peel each one off the section.

[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.040]
Yes, I would.

[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.640]
You're kind of candy bar, which I've also had a couple recently.

[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.200]
Was the big king size Snickers?

[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.460]
Oh, great.

[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.240]
Would you just peel it and just pop the whole thing in?

[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:29.660]
I love it.

[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:30.200]
Yeah.

[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.020]
Quarter vice, it was great too.

[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:32.860]
What kind?

[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:33.800]
Hagen Dazs again.

[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:35.160]
I had a chocolate peanut butter.

[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.160]
De-chocolate butter.

[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:39.100]
Did you see Fatsow with Dom Deloys?

[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.080]
Great, wasn't it?

[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:40.300]
I love it.

[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.160]
Because this is like what this is all over again.

[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:43.560]
You could be Oscar Lopetus.

[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.280]
Remember the guy?

[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:45.600]
Yeah.

[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.760]
From Chubby Checkers?

[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:46.900]
Yeah.

[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.980]
Well, you know, this is a sad experience.

[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:53.700]
No, no, because it's just a period of addiction.

[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:54.820]
It's a way of adjustment.

[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.260]
Well, I'm going to be sitting again.

[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.740]
I was thin once, I'll be sitting again.

[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.020]
He's from Gargantua and the just Fats.

[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:00.600]
I would see.

[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.960]
You know what would have happened to you, the problem?

[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:08.340]
If you would have been the way you were before, before you went on the Oftafast, you were fat,

[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.800]
but not dangerously fat.

[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:11.580]
You were you.

[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:11.960]
Yeah.

[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:12.360]
Okay.

[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.120]
Now, you're trying to be something else.

[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:19.680]
And the frustration level is so great in not being able to be that slim, whatever, that

[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.960]
you're over, you're going the other way.

[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:21.840]
That this is what we do.

[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.080]
This is the real thing in the fact.

[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:27.560]
Is the frustration level causes you because you can't in a few days wake up and look like

[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:30.500]
Peter and Arthur, whoever it is, you want to look, then you just go crazy.

[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:30.920]
Yeah.

[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:32.800]
And now you're going to keep doing this accordion thing.

[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.140]
But you're in fact, you're right about therapy.

[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:38.440]
You learned that we are very, we find it hard to be moderate.

[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:39.260]
I bet you will.

[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:40.020]
You will have a lot of people to be alive.

[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.180]
You are excessive because I am.

[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:42.580]

[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.320]
In fact, it's the compulsive of the first.

[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.020]
Other than gambling.

[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.120]
Other than gambling.

[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.660]
Well, I can't pitch you moderate in it.

[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.180]
Very moderate.

[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:51.040]
So that's it.

[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.340]
There are watch, watch a few races.

[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:53.060]
Almost every night.

[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:53.860]
You're so powerful.

[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:54.800]
You're obsessive.

[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.340]
No, I'm not.

[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:56.820]
No, you'll watch it.

[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:57.840]
You only sex in food.

[00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.800]
For me, it'll be just the food.

[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.180]
Yeah.

[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.220]
Well, have a great time at the game.

[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:02.660]
Thank you.

[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.040]
You won't have any food tomorrow.

[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:04.920]
I'm very happy to see.

[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.680]
I wish I could say it was an uplifting experience.

[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.420]
But I want to know.

[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:11.540]
See, your friend here, Abe Hirschfeld's press agent, he's looking at me this whole hour.

[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:13.100]
See, this guy is a bastard.

[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.820]
I'm trying to somehow shame you and do it.

[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.480]
This is beyond the point of funny.

[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:18.940]
No, no.

[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.360]
I mean, you could be funny in being laughed at.

[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.140]
Like, God, look at how, but that's not you.

[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:25.280]
No, I'm going to grab hold.

[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:26.920]
And, yeah, you're going to grab hold.

[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.040]
Well, how are you going to do that?

[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:28.240]
Yeah.

[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.480]
I'm going to take a search party for you to grab hold.

[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:31.140]
But look at this thing.

[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.060]
Now, the press agent, Abe's press agent, really.

[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.400]
He is so thin.

[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.560]
I don't think he enjoys food as much as I do.

[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:39.100]
He's busy.

[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:39.880]
He's busy.

[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:40.640]
I haven't sex yet.

[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:41.980]
With other things in his mouth, okay?

[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:42.220]
Yeah.

[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.460]
Have a great time, Al.

[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.280]
Good to see you.

[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:48.940]
Say hi to Top's leader in Tommy's Align, Tony Hipacrit, and have a great time at the game.

[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:49.700]
Go, Marlon's.

[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.460]
Don't eat too much.
