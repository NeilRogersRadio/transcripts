[00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.760]
easy on Bella

[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.340]
So I said I can

[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.060]
convince everybody that the town really sucks that they'll pack up and get out of here and then the town will be a lot better

[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.480]
Because all the miscreants in the

[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.340]
Dirt bags and crap heads. I'll get that all out of here and make way for some living and breathing people

[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.420]
A lot of come down here and have a good time and open it up a little bit and get all these repressive right wing old dying creaks out of here

[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.880]
And I said, I've been trying that for 17 years and it still has awards.

[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.780]
You notice why he's wearing a skirt up to our armpits and he's got those things strapped on towards him?

[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.500]
What is this, a new look now?

[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.200]
I guarantee you that there's some whips and chains and dungeons and dragons going on without carrying whatever's name is.

[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100]
Cory Hayne or whatever's name is for boyfriend?

[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.700]
We have an open line at Dave, 751. Here we go again. We got an open line at Dave. We got an open line at the star line.

[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.520]
We got the over here. We got over there. Has anybody wanted to talk to us? That's this town. Adam is right, Janet. God.

[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.400]
It sucks.

[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.140]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.180]
Neil, how you doing there?

[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.140]
I'm doing great.

[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.260]
It sounds pretty good.

[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.340]
I want to say something. Never about a month ago you're talking about that.

[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.120]
That's good that you want to say something. I would hope that's why you call.

[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.020]
Given about a month ago you're talking about these women that are driving.

[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.920]
No, worse. Oh my God.

[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.920]
I am so, so, so, worse.

[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:36.420]
When I was driving myself home from the hospital last week I get behind some old bag, some disgusting, pathetic, brain dead bitch.

[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.820]
And he's going making the thing off 95 out of a turnpike there driving like two miles an hour in reverse.

[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.320]
And he's weaving in all the lanes at the same time and I thought I was going to kill myself there before I got home.

[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.340]
Well, I'm driving. Okay. And I'm at high Leah getting ready to get on.

[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.820]
I'll be driving or I'll be road and there's this girl.

[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.460]
So I won't say something else. Yeah.

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.960]
Please not all the makeup looking in the river mirror. Right? Yeah.

[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.100]
He doesn't notice the light. Turn. I hawk a little bit. He takes off.

[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.060]
I see. He's on. He's going to weave and in it out every road.

[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.640]
He's not paying attention. Car gets another light car in front of a stop. He doesn't realize it lands on the brakes. Right?

[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.260]
Almost eats his rear end.

[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.640]
Next thing you almost ate his rear end. Yeah. It was with her car. All right.

[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.580]
He starts looking all over.

[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.000]
Why did I just, you know, I just had a feeling. I mean, I knew there was no doubt in my mind that before the end of the car he was either going to say that or he was going to say.

[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.920]
We have an open line and date. Well, I was sure he was going to do it.

[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.020]
Won't you?

[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.100]
Let's go to plantation. Hello.

[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.760]
Can't breathe when I'm job brushy. I love your past.

[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.280]
WS. Let's set up and take your clothes off.

[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.160]
Why baby? Why don't you see?

[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.520]
Why? Why can't you see?

[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.280]
I don't know. God.

[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.480]
That's enough.

[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.260]
1208 is my cranberry would say that's enough. And that what he says is that's one of the famous lines along with Uga Bougain.

[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.200]
And challenge, challenge, challenge.

[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.740]
We have two open lines. You're both in Broward again. Two open lines.

[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.780]
Loin in Broward at 5249463524WYOD. This is the worst.

[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.480]
This is just don't answer any more calls today. I'm doing streamless after I do these. I'm sure I can't take it.

[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.240]
I just cannot. This is the worst WYOD.

[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.280]
I'm calling for the plantation line.

[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.400]
From the plantation line?

[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.560]
The Broward line.

[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.400]
Yeah. How's it going now?

[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.620]
Great. Welcome back.

[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.720]
Why do you say that? I'm calling from the plantation.

[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.340]
Or is he busy now? He digested.

[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.800]
Another reason I'm calling him.

[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.240]
It's her next. Think you're radio down.

[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.140]
Give it a rest.

[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.760]
So the real thing about women drivers. Remember that radio was going in India now?

[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.260]
What's in it?

[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.760]
K.A.

[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.220]
Susan, thank you.

[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.000]
Yeah. What's next?

[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.160]
I have no idea.

[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.580]
And then they had some women wrestler on the other day from some wrestling team.

[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.780]
What the hell is that all about?

[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.460]
And they had some women hockey player on the other night from the hockey ward.

[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.080]
There was some bitch who plays hockey in Canada somewhere.

[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.360]
Oh my God. What's next?

[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.000]
Yeah. I really don't know.

[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.900]
God only knows.

[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.600]
Next to the women's topology.

[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.080]
They're making that base for women with Madonna.

[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.780]
Yeah.

[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.640]
Like Madonna can play baseball?

[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.560]
Once he's got enough arms to it here, I would say.

[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.720]
Probably more than Steve Stone.

[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.700]
I don't know.

[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.100]
Only I just want to say welcome back and wish you the best.

[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.680]
Thanks a lot, sir. See you.

[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.880]
WYOD.

[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.840]
Come on up to that.

[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.920]
You're new in the WYOD.

[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.960]
Do we need to do that to spice up the proceedings a little bit here today?

[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.660]
Okay. Do screen lists the rest of the day?

[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.660]
You're on hold.

[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.340]
Don't panic.

[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.440]
But if nobody answers, just George is busy at digesting.

[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.640]
Outback steakhouse is bringing us some of that great.

[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.600]
The best in the world.

[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.060]
Walk about soup tomorrow.

[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.020]
And if you eat enough of it, boy, you'll be walking about for hours.

[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.860]
Non-tonious.

[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.980]
Like a combination of onion soup and cheese soup.

[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.160]
And a little on the pepper side.

[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.780]
And boy, it is tremendous.

[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.300]
God, I could just jump into a huge bat of the walk about soup.

[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.760]
Now, this week for Father's Day, of course, they're going to be open starting at noon.

[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.420]
Or nearly all the outbacks are open for dinner only every night, seven nights a week.

[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.340]
But because it's Father's Day, the Sunday, they'll be open at noon all the way through the afternoon evening.

[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.540]
So take that over for a fantastic feast at an outback nearby you.

[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.760]
And check out those delicious tender steaks and great appetizers like the blue banana and the walk about soup.

[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.120]
And prime rib and chicken and ribs on the barbie and pasta and seafood and grilled fish.

[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.920]
And gigantic, fattening, disgusting desserts like the chocolate thunder from down under.

[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.480]
Something for the kids too, new kids activity books.

[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.500]
So what's that got the outback for Father's Day starting at 12 noon,

[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.100]
you'll find the outback steakhouse in Kendall in the town of country center.

[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:24.140]
On West Flagler Street in the Flagler Park Plaza on Southwest 89th place in Breyer Bay on Northeast 163rd Street in sunny isles on Pines Boulevard in beautiful Pembroke Pines.

[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:33.240]
All they used to be beautiful until they built cemetery village on Riverside Drive and Coral Springs on North Pine Island road in Jackowanda Square in prestigious plantation.

[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.040]
And on Southwest 18th Street in Boca, take that out for a great feast this Sunday to the outback.

[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:48.420]
$10 million worth of name brand furniture market down 25 to 70% or rain for signal credit term and you've got one heck of a sale.

[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.740]
See the modern age ahead and today's newspaper.

[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.080]
Send hurry in and save during the $6 million dollar summer sacrifice.

[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:05.660]
Shampoo listen to this all lazy boy first line and restaurant are sale price 25 to 70% off all plouncer action lane and palisers 25 to 70% off.

[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.420]
That's right all your favorite name brands are clearly marked with certified savings of 25 to 70%.

[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:19.460]
What more do you ask for? How about special credit terms? You got it by today at modern age and you make no payment for 90 days.

[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:25.640]
Absolutely nothing is held back. Oh and one more thing your satisfaction is always guaranteed.

[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.660]
So you'll never make a buying mistake at modern age.

[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.360]
Whatever you do don't miss history in the making during modern age is gigantic.

[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.700]
$6 million dollar summer sacrifice today 9 a.m. to 90 a.m. at all modern age locations.

[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.280]
Extra extra extra is monotone extra for my day.

[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.040]
Extra is my best.

[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:53.580]
The lowest price and chain of beansteam. The best is the food and the best.

[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.280]
Variety, quality and freshness. Low prices that only extra can offer.

[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.860]
Like our dynamite item on bonings that rose at $1.28 per pound.

[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:10.080]
Everyday low prices only an extra but if you find lower prices anywhere else who'll triple the difference in gas.

[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.620]
No, just so do the bakery.

[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.960]
The banding dollar and extra private.

[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:24.100]
Also, look for our hot prices on items like extra large blue bags at only $59.00.

[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.620]
No one has lower prices than extra and that's not guaranteed.

[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.840]
Look for more details and stores offer balance of $2.24.

[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.220]
The list of prices only just for the same price.

[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.020]
Extra savings is extra.

[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.440]
This fall join us for another exciting season of dolphins in hurricanes.

[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.360]
But fall I've been away here on down for an export station.

[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.940]
You know little crack out real close to the tree they called this game.

[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.680]
Look a visitor said any smoke from a high school is so gay.

[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:14.800]
As the mind slowly drifted away from the crack and the sex of the day.

[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.320]
Through the fog and the heat you know we heard the promise to say.

[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.780]
Take another minute on the pipe field.

[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.680]
I'll see you here.

[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.680]
Take another minute on the pipe field.

[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.680]
I'll see you here.

[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.840]
Take another minute on the pipe field.

[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.560]
I'll see you here.

[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.660]
Take another minute on the pipe.

[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.500]
I'll see you here.

[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.280]
Take another minute on the pipe.

[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:49.280]

[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.880]
So 14 and W.Y.

[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.880]
It seems like only was 70, 80 hours ago today we sat down here.

[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.240]
Isn't today Friday?

[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.140]
I'm telling you.

[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.380]
You may not think so but I'm pretty sure it's Friday.

[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.520]
Miami.

[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.640]
How are you doing?

[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.800]
Glad to hear you feeling better.

[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.920]
You seem like you have a lot more energy now.

[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:12.500]
Right.

[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:21.280]
All of a sudden he's Batman and there's no Robin and it's just like a whole different story and they have hord and destroyed.

[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.980]
If I want to see Batman I'll turn on the satellite.

[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.320]
I can see it every afternoon about 10 different times.

[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.340]
Now I've got it now.

[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.360]
Batman was a fun thing.

[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.340]
Well it was corny but it was a little bit clearer than what they're trying to find out now.

[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.420]
I mean you have to remember what they're trying to find out.

[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:46.220]
What they're trying to base everything on now is the old comics that came back.

[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.940]
Came out originally where Batman wasn't this guy running around in tight-sect and stupid.

[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.700]
He was a...

[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.800]
Well Robin was the guy running around in tight.

[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.780]
Are they a pluses or not a set of files?

[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.940]
I think Goldberg had worked there.

[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.500]
Yeah he really knows this stuff though.

[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.500]
I thought the first movie was fair at best.

[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.840]
I wouldn't watch it.

[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:18.400]
Come on the tube and I've seen about two minutes of it about three different times and I just shut it right off because there's no resemblance at all to Batman that I know.

[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.500]
I'm just not interested in that.

[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.160]
And I read it as a comic book as a kid and it's still a movie has nothing to do with that.

[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.820]
It would probably be better really to have like sister, fociaro, whatever be catwoman.

[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.240]
Right, there you go.

[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.480]
Sister Soldier.

[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.340]
If you ever noticed though in the first one in this one there's no black people involved.

[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.500]
In what? No, well they're all purple.

[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.020]
No, I mean there's no African Americans and either one.

[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.240]
I thought that was kind of odd.

[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.640]
Is they trying to make Gotham City kind of realistic? Why would they not?

[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.660]
Well why worry have you ever been in Gotham City?

[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.700]
I don't think anybody's been in Gotham.

[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.840]
Well there you go. How many black people were in Superman?

[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.980]
That's true also. It's up for Richard Prior.

[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.860]
You know the black people are got caused to be okay. Leave them alone.

[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.880]
They don't need Superman and Batman. They got enough fantasies already.

[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.100]
Did he got sister Soldier? They got to live down okay?

[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.580]
Have a great day.

[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.100]
Okay.

[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:12.580]
Yeah.

[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.360]
God.

[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.720]
12-18 is of it. Just a comic book. He's like Dan Klail now with God Dan Murphy Brown okay?

[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.820]
All right so if you just had a stomachache it was just it was a false alarm Dan.

[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.680]
West Palm Beach.

[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.140]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:28.640]
Yeah.

[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.540]
I'm a new listener. I was just wondering who you're supposed to be.

[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.860]
Thank you so much. It is pretty good. It's pretty Dan Good sir.

[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.780]
All right. Listen. When I was shooting with Lana Breed fans, the question.

[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.300]
Yeah.

[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.380]
What makes y'all think of y'all's America's team?

[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.440]
What makes y'all think that y'all's America's team?

[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:46.860]
That's right.

[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:47.480]
Oh.

[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:48.740]
Seriously?

[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.300]
Well what do you ask your name for? I'm not a brave fan.

[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.180]
That's exactly what you're down in loop.

[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.700]
I'm not a brave fan. I can't stand loopin' Ellie. It makes me sick.

[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.600]
Well look look what the man did for the rest of the day.

[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.180]
I don't care what he did for anybody. He still makes me sick.

[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.380]
And the rest of the veteran right along in the braids have.

[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:02.820]
So?

[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.380]
Yeah so shoot man. The braids will have nothing.

[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:07.700]
They'll have nothing.

[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.300]
You better wake up and slip the lilac pad.

[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.040]
You better get with it. Okay. This week it is the moment of truth.

[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.640]

[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.840]
No problem.

[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.520]
You didn't have that big, small, brab dibble on the team.

[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.320]
We knocked everybody down. If you didn't have anyone have anything.

[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.360]
Yeah. The place will have nothing either.

[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:30.760]

[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.180]
In the Neal Rogers dining room.

[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:24.520]
Right.

[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.880]
Oh, you're talking about...

[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.920]
Oh, and now you're bringing up that place again.

[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.840]
Don't do it.

[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.320]
Oh, this is a setup.

[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.740]
Are you sitting up there right now?

[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.620]
Is he anchored on your ponytail or something?

[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.100]
I know.

[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.560]
Can you put him back in a hole?

[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.120]
No, I can't.

[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.040]
We got a lot of people who want to get through here today

[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.140]
and I put you on hold and that's the best you can come up with

[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.200]
is to mention him again.

[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.380]
God.

[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.840]
No, Jeff, you're just...

[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.840]
You're beyond...

[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.800]
Over and above and beyond the call of duty.

[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:52.840]
And nobody can just handle the...

[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.900]
the incessant.

[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.940]
Did he bring any goods to guards, by the way?

[00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.440]
Well, no, I don't want...

[00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.960]
Well, you know I don't want one like that,

[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.420]
that elephant's repository.

[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.560]
No, no, like a little one.

[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.160]
That's not the kind of cigar I would ever smoke.

[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.700]
Even when I felt great.

[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.860]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.840]
A little one, something that I can handle,

[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.800]
something that I'm more...

[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.320]
can identify with more closely.

[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.960]
And I'm not talking about those disgusting...

[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.900]
Well, yeah, I'll smoke one of those.

[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.000]
If you bring them later in.

[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.740]
I told you I've never smoked in cigars again tonight.

[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.060]
It's these calls.

[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.100]
It's these calls.

[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.500]
W-I-O-D.

[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:27.580]
Nail.

[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:27.920]
Yeah.

[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:28.980]
Good afternoon.

[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.740]
Well, boy, how's it going, sir?

[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.560]
How are you?

[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.900]
I'm a met fan, but...

[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.880]
I don't know, I really don't have any complaints.

[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:36.360]
I think I've been...

[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.380]
The long way to go, it's 162 game seasons, sir.

[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.400]
Don't let them stop their cleats in your face until it's all over.

[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.180]
I haven't seen the standings in seven days either, so...

[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.740]
Well, you're about eight games behind,

[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.220]
and the Cubs even are a game and a half ahead of you guys.

[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.100]
Oh, thank you.

[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.260]
Mitch Lewis brought me a nice slim cigar.

[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.400]
Looks like it's pre-smoked.

[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.580]
It's a long way to go, pal.

[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.780]
We got like almost 100 games to go.

[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.240]
Hey, can I make a request, Neil?

[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:00.840]
Of course.

[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.060]
I like the way you didn't beat around the bush and suck around first for two.

[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.880]
No, seriously, I don't like people that do that, that suck around,

[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.100]
and feel they want to ingratiate themselves.

[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.280]
Oh, by the way, I love you so much.

[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.100]
Would you please play?

[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.060]
I don't need that.

[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.780]
I'm just a realistic guy.

[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:15.880]
What is it?

[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.040]
You are a great guy anyway, Neil.

[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:17.880]
I am. You're right.

[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.240]
See now you're doing it.

[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:19.620]
Okay.

[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.900]
Can I request Bob Prince?

[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.060]
Can you request him?

[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:24.500]
For my father?

[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.220]
Well, he's got a bad headache, but...

[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.520]
Yeah, he's a pirate fan, so he's...

[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.760]
He's over at the parts going up the metro going down and...

[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.840]
He's a pirate fan?

[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.160]
Yeah, he is.

[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:35.640]
Not me.

[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.180]
I bet you haven't heard.

[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.260]
Well, he gave one.

[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.660]
You suppose you can grab one.

[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.840]
How about a dingo land?

[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:41.760]
Can you give it?

[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.700]
And he take it away.

[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.280]
He is one out of here now.

[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.340]
This would be some kind of pandemonium.

[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.340]
And why not?

[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.600]
Here's the one two-page premiere show.

[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.440]
And there's a ball, Hick Deep Direct Field.

[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.280]
Back close by, they ball on.

[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.000]
And he can't get his football.

[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:01.760]
Oh!

[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.520]
How's that?

[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.240]
Yeah, sure does bring back memory.

[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.200]
Sure does. Back when I was a pirate fan in a good old days,

[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.260]
when he actually had some guys in there who looked human.

[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.280]
Why used to watch him when I was a kid?

[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.160]
When the committee was in right...

[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:15.360]
Right.

[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.340]
Darjo and left, so Bob Skinner, right, Bill Verden.

[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.480]
Yes, it was Bob Prince and Noah King every night, so...

[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:21.680]
Right.

[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:22.300]
That was great.

[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.740]
And Jim Woods the Possum.

[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:24.500]
Absolutely.

[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:25.140]
Right.

[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:25.960]
Hey, thanks, Neil.

[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:26.740]
Have a great day.

[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.240]
Fuck you.

[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:27.740]
See ya.

[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.300]
What happened to that lighter that I was going to have in here briefly?

[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.040]
You know, it's really interesting when the food comes in,

[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.780]
you're sitting in there carrying on like some kind of a petal and child.

[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.260]
And that could have you didn't he?

[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:42.100]
And all I want is a stinking cheap like 23 said,

[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.880]
don't stand there and wait, I'm keeping it in here for a while.

[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.960]
You know these cheap cigars are hard to keep lit?

[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.960]
Hmm, they're like our audience, they're hard to keep alive.

[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.480]
Let's do the starline, shall we?

[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:55.260]
Hello.

[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:56.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:56.900]
Hey, Neil.

[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:57.400]
Yeah.

[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.520]
Excuse my ignorance, but I've been wondering...

[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.680]
Why should you be any different?

[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.020]
I've been listening on and off to the show for the last week,

[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.140]
and I keep hearing about this blimp that got away.

[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.900]
I don't know anything about it.

[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.200]
Oh, I make blimp.

[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.260]
Was there a blimp that got away?

[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:12.980]
I don't know.

[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.400]
And it must have been while I was in a hospital.

[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.360]
Oh, okay.

[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.580]
Where was it?

[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.320]
I don't know.

[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.840]
I just keep hearing college calling.

[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:19.840]
You know, I'm going to have a WIOD blimp.

[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.460]
Adam let it.

[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.860]
But the IOD blimp that Adam let you away,

[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.460]
like that's a major story, like that's a news bullet,

[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.040]
and the IOD blimp got away and it wound up in Vegas,

[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.100]
and they thought it was Hank.

[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.800]
You didn't see it on CNN?

[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.780]
No, you're right.

[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:33.720]
Right.

[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.380]
So what kind of blimp will be?

[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.280]
Yeah, on Cox News Network, right.

[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.700]
What was this blimp for?

[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.860]
It's the WIOD blimp.

[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.980]
It's for a while.

[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.780]
It's like a little promotional thing

[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.400]
because we can't afford any real promotion.

[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.600]
Well, I make blimp.

[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.320]
Maybe I can help you out with the blimp.

[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.860]
No, we don't need any new blimp.

[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.240]
She don't need a new blimp.

[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.600]
We don't want no blimp.

[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.480]
How about a hot air balloon?

[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.780]
We got enough hot air to do.

[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.200]
Come on, I got to make a sales call.

[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.340]
They're going to fire my ass.

[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.240]
Yeah.

[00:33:58.700 --> 00:33:59.680]
So who are you going to talk to?

[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.160]
There's nobody to talk to here.

[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:01.840]
They're all out.

[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.340]
Well, let me talk to one.

[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:03.860]
Huh?

[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.720]
All right, hold on.

[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.560]
Talk to him, like for a second, and then hang up on him.

[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.520]
12.45, or just hang up on him, period.

[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.940]
At WIOD, let's do a date, county.

[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:14.220]
Hello.

[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.240]
Neil.

[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:15.760]
Yes.

[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.180]
We've got a little problem.

[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.340]
What's the risk of this guy's problem with Batman?

[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.900]
I mean, there's a black guy in the first Batman.

[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:25.820]
There is?

[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:32.020]
Yeah, there's a guy who played in Star Wars, the big black guy.

[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:32.400]
The big-

[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.000]
The ability Williams.

[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:34.740]
That's right.

[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.160]
He was the commissioner in Batman.

[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:36.920]
Huh.

[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.980]
You know, these people, there's no black people here.

[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.580]
Well, suppose there wasn't any black guy in Batman.

[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.300]
Was there any Jewish guys in there?

[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.700]
You have to take their pants down.

[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:47.440]

[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.060]

[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:48.760]
Yes.

[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.600]
Also, for once a part of Batman America.

[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.100]
Oh, the Robin wasn't in it, huh?

[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:53.580]
Yes.

[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.360]
Once a part of Batman America, you've got to rent the long version that's unearned.

[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.820]
I have the long, I have the long-undered version, unexpercated at home.

[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.620]
And you understand the movie, do you not?

[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.120]
Mm-hmm.

[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:04.900]
I think.

[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:05.880]
I think.

[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.680]
Well, they've watched this film on TV.

[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.880]
Oh, we don't understand.

[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:09.940]
They've watched it all around.

[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.520]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.840]
Were there gunshots at the end before the garbage truck went running off?

[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.640]
Yes, it was.

[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.820]
I forgot that.

[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.740]
See, because it's been a long time since I watched it.

[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.520]
Yes, it was.

[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:23.180]
I didn't watch it on TV because I knew it was going to cut out a lot of things that it's brainwashed.

[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:23.700]
Oh, of course.

[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.720]
A lot of what's going on.

[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:25.100]

[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.940]
Well, anyway, I just wanted to share my little insights with you.

[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.500]
Have a great day, and I'm glad you're back.

[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.160]
Thank you.

[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.140]
And Brian Bloom is God.

[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.840]
1247 at WIOD.

[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.740]
He's in the battle of cigar.

[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.600]
It's like a noodle that miscavied.

[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.600]
It's a rac canudo?

[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:42.260]
Oh.

[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.280]
It's a minuto?

[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.260]
I'll start with that minuto crap.

[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.940]
We got enough problem with this place already.

[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:57.000]
So, by the way, speaking of minuto, how's Buddy Nevin's coming with that pedophile radio ring that we heard about last November?

[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:57.700]
What is this now?

[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.900]
Like, is it July almost?

[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.620]
I'll tell you, buddy.

[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.660]
Man, this must be some investigation.

[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.720]
Even Shylock Holmes and Batman and Robin and Hank are having trouble uncovering the fact that they're going to be in the battle.

[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.040]
They're going to be covering all the characters in this.

[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:10.720]
God, buddy.

[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.560]
What a job at the Sun Sentinel, where if there isn't a real story there, we'll make one up.

[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:21.160]
Okay, especially if it makes people in radio or TV or anybody else, we don't like look really bad.

[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:22.660]
Yeah.

[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.760]
That massive radio pedophile ring.

[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.660]
Because you know what they say at the Sun Sentinel, don't you?

[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.880]
I know what they say.

[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.020]
He was his word.

[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.120]
Not his pedophile.

[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.400]
Hey, Goldberg is your host for another Gold Merged Night Radio show tonight at 8.

[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:46.360]
It's the radio's biggest fan of the new IoT.

[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:51.100]
He's not just Hank Goldberg, he's a hip hop hot-a-mus.

[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.820]
And the WYOD Blimp.

[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.100]
1251 of WYOD.

[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.040]
Hello.

[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.200]
Deal.

[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:57.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.880]
Glad you're feeling better.

[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.200]
I'm feeling a great man.

[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.780]
I'm talking to Stan Major.

[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.240]
He has a question for you.

[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:03.740]
Yeah.

[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.920]
Who do you want playing second base for the cup?

[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.500]
What kind of person do you want?

[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.480]
That's that Palm Beach County humor.

[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.200]
WYOD.

[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.420]
Hello, Neil Rodd.

[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:21.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:22.720]
How you doing?

[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.180]
Okay.

[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.160]
You sound pretty good.

[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:24.680]
I do.

[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.200]
How are you being?

[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.740]
I've been pretty good.

[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:28.620]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.520]
I heard you had been making fun of Mount Sinai recently.

[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.660]
I've been making fun of Mount Sinai.

[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.080]
No, I haven't been making fun of Mount Sinai.

[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.600]
Sir, I've been relating my personal two life experiences, sir.

[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.560]
And it was no fun.

[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:44.240]
Yeah, but I mean, if the hospital wasn't there, you'd be still passing that stone.

[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.180]
That's true.

[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.040]
Why you work there?

[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.040]
No, I don't work there.

[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.240]
This isn't Omar, is it?

[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.020]
Excuse me?

[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.160]
This isn't Omar from Mount Sinai, is it?

[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.500]
No, this is just a listener.

[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.200]
Well, what the hell do you know if you ever been in Mount Sinai?

[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.200]
I was born there.

[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]
You were born well, right?

[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.820]
That bears out what I've been saying.

[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.380]
God, I'm speechless.

[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.060]
I'm just literally like that.

[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.380]
Yeah, but you know, it wasn't like that.

[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.160]
So you were born there?

[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240]
What did you have to do with that?

[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.000]
Like, you couldn't have been born someplace else?

[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.540]
No, but I mean, at the good hospital.

[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.840]
And suppose they would put it like a big dent in the middle of your head when you were born

[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.500]
and you walked around looking like a bonehead on your life.

[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.960]
You can go to, if you went to Jackson, you probably would have still been sitting there now.

[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.220]
Well, I'd be better off for it, wouldn't I?

[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.920]
At least they wouldn't have done anything to me yet.

[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.020]
I mean, do they do any rectal exams on you?

[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:32.020]
In fact, they had like a, a battery of proctologists in there, a search party.

[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.140]
Oh, well.

[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.180]
And they said, oh, yeah, you work at WIOD.

[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.480]
I said, how do you figure that out?

[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.140]
They said they all, all the same assholes work over there.

[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.100]
But you should go back over there next time you get sick.

[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.260]
Maybe they'll take better care of you.

[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.680]
Okay, thanks so much.

[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.180]
All right.

[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:44.600]
See you.

[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.760]
Who the hell are you kidding?

[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.120]
Okay.

[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.920]
He wasn't born at Mount Sinai.

[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.400]
He was hatched.

[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.020]
1253 at WIOD.

[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.840]
Dave County.

[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.200]
Welcome to 610 WIOD, your highly overrated station.

[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.440]
Hey, uh, you're joke of the airwaves.

[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.720]
Hey, I don't want to argue with you.

[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.020]
Where Meg Green is queen and the plant guy might be too for all we know.

[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:06.480]
What is it?

[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.520]
Hey, I don't want to argue with you about it.

[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.860]
I'm glad that you're back by the way.

[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.320]
You would know what argue with me about what?

[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.300]
Uh, this sister soldier thing was, uh, a name isn't soldier, sir.

[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.060]
It's soldier.

[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:18.760]
Whatever.

[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.380]
Soldier as in soldier boy.

[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.940]
Well, anyway, it was taken completely out of context.

[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.800]
And, you know, she said on the air yesterday wasn't taken out of context.

[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.640]
She is a disgusting and militant obmanacious.

[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.500]
Uh, just absolutely needs to be smashed in the face bitch is what she is.

[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:46.240]
Maybe this is something that I didn't hear, but I heard her saying something about she'd never used drugs when he had and talk about him cheating on his wife.

[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.140]
So what the hell is that have to do with anything?

[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.540]
What does that got to do with their telling black people to go out and kill a bunch of white people?

[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.660]
What's that got to do with any he puffed on a joint one time and that makes him a bad guy?

[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]
I bet she's puffed on worse things than that.

[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.000]
No, it doesn't make him a bad guy.

[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:07.340]
But, I just like, just like Jackie Mason said, whoever put a salami sandwich or a pastrami sandwich in their mouth, they didn't intend to eat it.

[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.220]
Well, so who the hell is he kidding?

[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.140]
I know you have your feelings about it.

[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.960]
I know that you've just read the quote that was taken out of context.

[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.720]
I didn't just read anything, sir.

[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.300]
I don't come on a year and just start mouthing off if I don't know what I'm talking about.

[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:25.160]
I saw the press conference and I saw her yesterday morning on CBS this morning, which made me want to toss my cookies.

[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.440]
She is nauseating and militant and disgusting.

[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.820]
And if Bill Clinton never does anything else besides, I tell Jesse Jackson were to shove it, he'll be okay in my book.

[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:41.000]
I am so sick and tired of everybody in the Democratic Party sucking around with Jesse Jackson because they were afraid he's going to control all a black vote

[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.880]
and they're not going to get in. They never get in anyway.

[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:52.220]
It's about time somebody told Jesse to take a hike with his big fat trouble making stirring the pot opportunistic, leasing the public mouth.

[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.980]
They don't need deep breaths, deep breaths.

[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.700]
Meal though. He did take it completely out of context.

[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.380]
And what she said originally wasn't like what it came out like.

[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.300]
Whatever you say.

[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.360]
I love sister soldier.

[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.020]
Well, you know, I'm nice to either without lemon.

[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.080]
I don't care when we're the other about it.

[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.820]
Well, then why do you keep talking to Trinic about it here, sir?

[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.920]
You just want to keep repeating and just ramming it down our ears.

[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.780]
No, why don't you like an ear infection just hearing this over and over and over again?

[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.260]
No, in fact, I wanted to talk about.

[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.060]
Who are already is what I say.

[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.440]
But he did take it out of context. I heard it.

[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.280]
Yeah, it's a fourth time. You said that.

[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.440]
Your point is made, sir. Your point is made.

[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.340]
You don't care about it, but I don't have any point.

[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.400]
Well, you're talking about how bad she was to have said.

[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.100]
I'm not talking about anything.

[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.720]
I never even mentioned her today.

[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.480]
Forget about her and the boats she came in on.

[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.320]
Score.

[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:47.120]
Okay.

[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.920]
Who the hell is she anyway?

[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.900]
I don't know.

[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.720]
Exactly. Okay. So forget about it.

[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.820]
Because it's something that was on.

[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.840]
It was something on television again.

[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.380]
Okay. That's the problem with this whole goddamn country, sir.

[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:04.180]
Is whatever is on television is like the buzz word of the moment.

[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.160]
And everybody starts buzzing about it.

[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.780]
And nobody ever heard of these people.

[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.420]
And probably were just as well or better off for not hearing of them.

[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:11.260]
Well, the only one that I have ever heard.

[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.540]
Who gives a crap about sister's soul job?

[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:18.680]
Well, the only reason that I have any interest in it at all is because I heard the original comment.

[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.320]
You're repeating yourself again, sir. It was taken out of context.

[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.140]
You said that 50,000 times.

[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.500]
Well, that's not what I was going to say, but okay.

[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.180]
Wait a minute. What is this?

[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.200]
Why too late?

[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.940]
No, are you the lighter lady?

[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.740]
Well, good. Give that one back to George.

[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.960]
And thank you so much. Thank you a million.

[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.600]
You're a great American. Thanks a pile.

[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.020]
The lighter lady just came in, sir.

[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.040]
Oh, how much?

[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:40.980]
That's okay.

[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.780]
Well, listen. So I see you've got to remind me that's about that anyway.

[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.260]
What is the point?

[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:49.020]
You've already made your point 50,000 times.

[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.340]
Why are you saying that?

[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.640]
Well, you answer me one question.

[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:52.600]
What do you answer me?

[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.860]
We've made the point about that.

[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.860]
You're trying to move on. Well, let me give you a hand.

[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.500]
1257 at WIO.

[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.900]
Oh, God almighty. What a pain in the ass.

[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.500]
How do you like to have him in your household, okay?

[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.060]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.340]
For the eighth, for the 18th time,

[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.080]
let me make a point here, okay?

[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.240]
Let me make a point.

[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.820]
Who, first of all, nobody gives a crap.

[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:18.640]
That's number one.

[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.520]
And then just to keep repeating it and repeating it and droning,

[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.080]
you're worse than my mother.

[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.840]
I'm in the middle of this massive allergic reaction.

[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.220]
That penicillin I'm breaking out in hives and I'm scratching.

[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.620]
And I'm practically in tears.

[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.120]
And she starts in, she gets on this kick like a Joan Crawford routine

[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:35.840]
with a hangers.

[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.760]
What happened to all those plastic hangers?

[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.480]
I gave you this expensive hangers.

[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.500]
I gave you 14 to 20 of those hangers.

[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.400]
You've got all those cheap wire hangers in your closet.

[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.420]
I said, good, call up Joan Crawford.

[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.980]
The two of you can cry over it.

[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:48.680]
Maniac.

[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.700]
I'm going through this agonizing, living hell.

[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.320]
I'm trying to scrape the skin off my fingers with a bath towel

[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.180]
because I'm itching and screaming and I got like hives.

[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.860]
And I've taken like 80,000 milligrams of this disgusting

[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:09.300]
grotesque penicillin for my pill doctor across the street.

[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.960]
And she's talking to China about what happened to all those expensive

[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.940]
plastic hangers I had in the goddamn clothes closet.

[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.840]
And what a disgrace because I got my clothes on all these cheap wire hangers.

[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.360]
That's what that guy reminded me of.

[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.140]
The definitive right there.

[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.360]
In fact, sir, let me suggest something.

[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.280]
Take a hanger right now and go into the closet and try it on for size.

[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.240]
Try that deal.

[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.280]
You know where you put the rope around your neck and you hang yourself

[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.080]
from the ceiling and see if it like heightens your sexual excitement.

[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.300]
And stick your fist right up your button.

[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.660]
See how the call is on Monday and let us know how it came out.

[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.140]
New is from around the planet with Rick and SUDs from two to six this afternoon

[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.540]
and free weed for the classroom.

[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.780]
We got sunny Hershey and Joseph.

[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.420]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:00.660]
On draft talk at 605 tonight and Hank Goldberg live from the WIOD Blimp at

[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.320]
Caesar's Palace in Vegas tonight decided to fully field home championship fight.

[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.120]
Nobody does it like Hank Goldberg at night.

[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.880]
South Florida zooms traffic and weather.

[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:15.360]
Who's talk radio six 10 WIOD my every four water deal in the Palm Beach.

[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.100]
It's.

[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.000]
We're either here.

[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:24.460]
WIOD.

[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:34.600]
Hi, this is Ron McGill from Miami, Metro zoo and I listen to that Neil Rogers one at two hour.

[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.620]
Hell, let's even better than sex with the animals.

[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.580]
Yeah, got you.

[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.300]
Everyone is proud.

[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.400]
Everyone is proud.

[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.280]
All the guys are gay.

[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.400]
All the guys are gay.

[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.440]
Most are fruit and nuts.

[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.360]
All the fruits and nuts.

[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.760]
All the rest are flakes.

[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.180]
All the rest are flakes.

[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.300]
Earthquakes take the ground.

[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.060]
Earthquakes take the ground.

[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.140]
The mud flies every day.

[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.300]
The mud flies every day.

[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.200]
California's sliding up.

[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.240]
California's sliding up.

[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.240]
Interceptance is go bad.

[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.280]
They've went us to the beach.

[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.440]
Then when they're getting laid.

[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.440]
Wearing nothing but a snake.

[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.500]
But a snake.

[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.820]
A smile on their face.

[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.760]
A smile on their face.

[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.900]
They put more oil on their butt.

[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.740]
Oil on their butt.

[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.080]
Then in a several days.

[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:46.920]
California's sliding up.

[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.720]
California's sliding up.

[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:48.980]
California's sliding up.

[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.580]
Interceptance is go bad.

[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:51.840]
They've got.

[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:54.700]
Interceptance is go bad.

[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.280]
106 of WIOD.

[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.960]
There's something sterile in the environment here.

[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.360]
It's not the year either.

[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.160]
Any minute that stuff that botulism could break out again.

[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.640]
Or is that on the yes salads here on the table that I've been sitting here for about three hours now?

[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.680]
I want to make a stentorian pronouncement now.

[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.260]
And I know we'll never live up to it because I say this every few days.

[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.560]
And we always are full of crap.

[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.380]
Tomorrow outback is coming with that walk about soup which is about my favorite thing in the world.

[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.900]
Oh God, do I love that.

[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.480]
But after that for the remit.

[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.540]
What's it eight tomorrow the 19th?

[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.580]
The rest of the month of June there shall be no more food in here during 10 to 2.

[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.780]
Because remember I said before the food started this morning about how great I felt.

[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.980]
And that after the food I would be like a little less full of piss and vinegar.

[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.800]
And the oil and vinegar and all that other stuff.

[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.440]
And it's true.

[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:43.880]
You feel like draggy.

[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.580]
You start like you want to sleep and you feel tired and lethargic.

[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.480]
Being on the year is not the time to be shoveling food in your mouth.

[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:57.320]
So with all due appreciation to Villa deli and all the other food forces out there in radio land.

[00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.940]
We're taking a hiatus for several days.

[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.140]
Tomorrow we got the soup from outback.

[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.300]
The walk about which is great and will not make you the lethargic.

[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.480]
It'll make you just jump up and down and scream for joy.

[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.900]
And that's about it.

[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:15.200]
And all you sales people out there in the back room go out and sell somebody and get out of our face.

[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:16.940]
W-I-O-D.

[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:17.700]
Hello.

[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.360]
Yes sir.

[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.300]
Yeah hold for Neil.

[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.520]
This is he.

[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:21.680]
He'll.

[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.100]
Yes.

[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.100]
Still God.

[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.620]
What do you mean you're holding for Neil?

[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:25.280]
What are you holding?

[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.800]
The phone is just ringing isn't it?

[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:28.780]
Oh yeah it was.

[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:32.060]
Yeah we're doing screenless this because George needs a long rest.

[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:32.940]
You shot me.

[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:33.540]
Good.

[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:39.060]
I wanted to give you a bitch story about another female driver.

[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:39.940]
Yeah.

[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:45.000]
Yesterday as I was coming off of I-75 getting on a palmetto.

[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.720]
You know I have got all the cars lined up there in rush hour.

[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.480]
Well this bitch decides to go up to the front of the line.

[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.220]
Don't you love those?

[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.120]
Cut and cut in on an 18 wheeler.

[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.480]
Only he didn't stop.

[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.940]
He rammed her right in the passenger side door.

[00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:58.740]
Oh!

[00:48:59.480 --> 00:48:59.880]
Outstanding.

[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:00.640]
It was the best.

[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.560]
See there is justice here once in a while if only by accident.

[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:07.460]
Yes and then yesterday later on after that I'm tailgating this car.

[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.660]
There's a bout room for her.

[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:12.380]
There's a roof.

[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:18.040]
There might not be a lot so funny just the way you said that like that's the way it's supposed to be you know.

[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:19.620]
Well that's all you can you know.

[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.160]
Wait.

[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.780]
All you can fit within a square mile of.

[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.320]
Exactly.

[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.500]
Anyway there's a bout room to fit a Ugo in between me and the car in front of me.

[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:26.880]
Yeah.

[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.360]
And this bitch with a Cadillac holds right in there.

[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.360]
I beat my horn.

[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.640]
I had to plan the brakes on.

[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.780]
And then she throws me the finger.

[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.560]
How do you like it?

[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:38.260]
Classy.

[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.280]
Hey you're classy.

[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:39.740]
Yeah.

[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.000]
That guy that little while ago.

[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:47.180]
I would have sandwiched her ass with whatever was in front of her and just turned her window up pancake.

[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.540]
I should have if I had been driving my Ugo she was she was mine.

[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.000]
Did me.

[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.800]
That guy that called a little while ago about sister soldier.

[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.520]
Yeah.

[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.620]
Your phone's cutting out I think it's a conspiracy.

[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.440]
I probably told Nicole you.

[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.860]
He believed her alone.

[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:04.400]
Right.

[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.200]
I'd like to call quickly before your.

[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.980]
Like I said I think the phone was dying for a good reason though.

[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.180]
It's you I think it was an Omen.

[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:15.700]
110.

[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.080]
10 after one.

[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.560]
The one hand the little hands on the one and the big hands up your butt.

[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.560]
Catch the latest news traffic and weather info each morning with Mike.

[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.720]
What's the most surprising thing in the morning information team just before the meal.

[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:28.360]
Resurrect.

[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.540]
So anybody got a dog.

[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.480]
Oh why not?

[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.020]
You have you have no shame at this stage of your life.

[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:36.760]
Why should you?

[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.320]
I bet you somebody in our audience has a small dog.

[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.860]
Cades that they like to give Cheryl.

[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.220]
For her dog that she's getting is that okay.

[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.280]
I'm trying for you with our vast audience out there of at least 30 or 40 people.

[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.820]
Most of our brain didn't know a dog if it bit him on his.

[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:51.060]
Yes.

[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.600]
But anyway if somebody's got a little dog cage call George up and he'll get the number and give it to Cheryl.

[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.920]
And we'll solve her problem there at least one of them anyway.

[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.860]
114 at W.I.O.D.

[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:02.740]
Wasn't that nice?

[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:03.860]
What's wrong with that?

[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:08.100]
The probably people got it put away in the garage somewhere that haven't used it in 20 years.

[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.720]
Clean it out first before you bring it over here by the way.

[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.040]
Okay don't bring her some filthy trashy dog cage.

[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.680]
Bring her something nice and new and shining and clean and antiseptic.

[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:19.580]
Anyway it's 115 at W.I.O.D.

[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.340]
And we're doing screenless till 2 o'clock today.

[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.280]
We got Rick and Scott.

[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.680]
Are they in town again today?

[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:24.860]
Is that two shows in a row?

[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:25.300]
God.

[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:30.720]
Man they're really a dangerous president just like the one we got up in Washington.

[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.400]
W.I.O.D.

[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.740]
So weak, weak, weak.

[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.740]
That was the worst one we've heard in years.

[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:39.640]
Terrible.

[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.260]
W.I.O.D.

[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:42.140]
Dale.

[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:42.800]
Yes sir.

[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.220]
You know what I'm talking about in Erie.

[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.980]
Oh please, Possum.

[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:51.740]
Well you know I used to think that you had the best job in radio.

[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:52.440]
Yeah.

[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:54.620]
And then I realized it's really Reneerie.

[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.940]
I mean you might not make as much money as you.

[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.820]
But how do you know that?

[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.160]
Nobody knows how much of it.

[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:00.780]
Well that's true.

[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.860]
He's pretty tight lip like most Possums okay.

[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.300]
Well let's look at what Reneerie does for his money.

[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.660]
Let's look at it typical out.

[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:07.460]
Oh that won't take long.

[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.640]
Well you got the 7 o'clock news.

[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.120]
No come out.

[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:10.960]
No come out.

[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.200]
The 7 o'clock news goes 10 after 12 after.

[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:14.500]
Right.

[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:15.820]
Erie comes on and says up.

[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.120]
Got to play a couple of spots.

[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:17.400]
Yeah.

[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.680]
Comes back on.

[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.200]
Worthy list.

[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.320]
Let's check Bob's over.

[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.060]
Worthy list.

[00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:21.500]
Does the weather.

[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:24.420]
You're gonna weather in the sports and here's the voice of the kids.

[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:25.720]
I'm gonna hear you for the next 10 minutes.

[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:26.040]
Yep.

[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:26.600]
That's it.

[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:27.440]
Right.

[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.240]
Good four hours.

[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:29.200]
Doesn't say anything.

[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:30.240]
And here's the attack.

[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:31.300]
10 movies this week.

[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:31.980]
Well a Batman.

[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.340]
20 million dollars this week.

[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:33.620]
Yeah.

[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:34.480]
Hey.

[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.340]
What a great deal.

[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:37.200]
He comes in and he.

[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.460]
I mean you got to talk to him.

[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:41.260]
What are you not supposed to talk about this because they haven't discovered that yet.

[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.040]
And he'll get very upset if they ever find out.

[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.980]
Yeah because they could save a lot of money there.

[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.860]
But I don't know.

[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.880]
You talk about the easiest job in radio.

[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.260]
I wouldn't wish following the 9 to 10 hour on anybody.

[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:57.880]
Well I just thought that I just you know thinking about that.

[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.200]
Have you ever heard the voices on that thing?

[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:01.960]
What do we call it?

[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.080]
Were the people call in?

[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.640]
Oh the telephone.

[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.260]
The telephone.

[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.780]
Have you ever heard the voices on there?

[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.260]
It's like the same six people and five of them have been dead for 20 years.

[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:15.840]
Well I think the telephone question this morning was they wanted to know how many times in the show when Erie picked his note.

[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:16.200]
Right.

[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.660]
And a lot of interest in that one.

[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.000]
Nope but none of the audience could count that high.

[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.980]
Well he's got a great job and I don't know how long.

[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.060]
I'll get a grip on yourself.

[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.040]
Sir and have a great life.

[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.200]
Okay you're just a little too out of control for me.

[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.420]
117 at WIOD.

[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.180]
Hello.

[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:34.240]
Yeah.

[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:34.900]
Yes sir.

[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:35.500]
Hello to Neil.

[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:35.920]
Speaking.

[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:36.740]
Neil.

[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:37.180]
Yes.

[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.400]
You pick up the phone now.

[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.640]
I'm doing screenless today for a little while because George is on strike.

[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.780]
This is all right.

[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:44.860]
This is a little kid in coil springs that you hate.

[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.000]
Sir can I say something to you?

[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.560]
Why don't you find something to do besides try to call here and be a smart act?

[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.380]
If you would call, if you would call, if you would call,

[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.660]
would you shut up and listen?

[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:56.300]
What?

[00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:00.440]
If you would call rarely like most intelligent people instead of like every camera.

[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:00.660]
Yeah right.

[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:05.160]
And engage in some kind of verbal dialogue.

[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.060]
Besides trying to be some kind of a smart act and show your butt to the whole world.

[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.220]
Is that what you want to do sir?

[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.820]
Why don't you just take your pants off?

[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.220]
117 at WIOD.

[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:14.560]
See what I mean?

[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.920]
He just, he's not capable of it.

[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:16.200]
Okay.

[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:20.340]
I guess when you're born that small it's just a cross that you have to bear for the rest of your life.

[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:21.100]
So to speak.

[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:22.820]
WIOD.

[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.080]
Neil, what side of your body hurts when you get that operation?

[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.540]
A big your pardon?

[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.140]
The side that you're a gallbladder zone like the right side?

[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.060]
Oh.

[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.100]
Well Hank was wrong that last time.

[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.700]
Wrong about one.

[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:40.980]
He was mentioning your remonies that make sure everybody punches you on the left side.

[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:41.240]
Oh.

[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:42.220]
Yeah.

[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.200]
Well he's out there for the fight.

[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.540]
A Neil?

[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:49.180]
Yeah.

[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.120]
I'll just go into Snapple this.

[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.100]
118 at WIOD.

[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:02.300]
See what I mean about just barely, barely making the needle move at all like on the Richter scale of life.

[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:03.740]
WIOD.

[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.060]
WIOD.

[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.120]
Mr. Radio's the best.

[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.300]
Was that Gary Sibel?

[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.840]
I would swear it sounded like him.

[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:21.000]
The opinions expressed in this program are not necessarily those who stand WIOD rich projects.

[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:30.820]
When you were a child your mother told you to clean your plate because there were people starving in India.

[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.780]
You always wondered what good it would do.

[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:40.800]
The fact is it makes those starving people feel a whole lot better to know that you're not letting food go to waste.

[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.020]
Food that they could eat.

[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.100]
The Clean Flate notification bureau can help.

[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:52.560]
Every time you clean your plate, the Clean Flate notification bureau will let a starving family know about it.

[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:58.980]
Just imagine the smiles on their grimy gong faces when they hear you beaten all your dinner.

[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.000]
Oh, get around everybody.

[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.720]
It's a letter from the Clean Flate notification bureau.

[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.680]
Oh, what did it say?

[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:11.900]
It's just little tibi grease, but in Kenno, I'll clean this plate every night plus week.

[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.020]
He keeps it up here.

[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.200]
Oh, he keeps it all heavy.

[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.240]
Look, they sent the Clean Flate.

[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.880]
I should make sure it's clean all the way.

[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:22.480]
Oh no, no, no, no.

[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.940]
This is Bernie the Flate.

[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:30.080]
You and the Clean Flate notification bureau can do a world of good, a third world of good.

[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.840]
So how's your friend micromember doing up there in Coral Springs?

[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.240]
123 at WIOD and let's do a Broward County.

[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:37.560]
Hello?

[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:39.760]
Hello?

[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.620]
There's somebody on there, you know?

[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:43.460]
Trust me.

[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:44.460]
Hello?

[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:45.180]
Yes.

[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:46.980]
Hello?

[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.240]
Yeah.

[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.860]
Okay, another punk.

[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:52.880]
They're out of school now.

[00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:57.180]
Send him to camp, barbed wires, lots of microwave ovens, large radar ranges.

[00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:58.460]
WIOD.

[00:56:59.040 --> 00:56:59.300]
Nail.

[00:56:59.580 --> 00:56:59.700]
Yeah.

[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:00.460]
Hi, how you doing?

[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:00.920]
Okay.

[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.900]
Did I call you last Thursday before you went in for your operation?

[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:04.600]
Yes, sir?

[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.000]
I had, I was someone going in for the effect of me.

[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.120]
Oh, well, I sure hope you had a better thing than I did.

[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.840]
Well, it was, it was still.

[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.080]
It was a different experience.

[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:13.600]
Yeah.

[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.280]
I did that.

[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.920]
I was the thing I was worried about most was when they go to give it an over cane.

[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:21.100]
And I tell you what, that first little prick will definitely get your attention.

[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:21.980]
I believe it.

[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:22.800]
If I can say that.

[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.140]
That's what they saying, Coral Springs.

[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:29.060]
Yeah, it was, I wouldn't want to do it again, but it's over and done with.

[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.980]
Well, I don't want to get to a personal, but where they administer the over cane.

[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.440]
Well, I mean, at the base, can we say?

[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:37.280]
At the base, yeah.

[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.440]
Right around that area.

[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.560]
The base of the base.

[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:40.420]
You got it.

[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.140]
And it brought me up out of the table.

[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.600]
I would think so.

[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.460]
But we made it through it.

[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.720]
I did all the horror stories I've heard about afterwards.

[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.220]
The next two days weren't really a little tender, but.

[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:52.920]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.160]
You're right.

[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:54.660]
Love me tender, right?

[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:55.400]
There you go.

[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:56.160]
Well, that's good.

[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:58.040]
We both survived it.

[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.020]
I'm glad you made it through too.

[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.820]
Well, I was a little harrier, but what can I tell you?

[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:03.160]
Yeah.

[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.100]
And the operation too, right?

[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.500]
It's all in the distant past now.

[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.960]
You just look back and kind of laugh.

[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:08.580]
There you go.

[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:09.920]
And hold your side, real tight.

[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.460]
Well, the only of them, my biggest problem now is the mafiliate fans.

[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.880]
So the suffering continues.

[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:15.500]
It's different.

[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.180]
Hey, tonight's the big night.

[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:18.880]
Cubs and the fillies at the vet.

[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.140]
We got chilling on the mall.

[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.020]
We might have a chance.

[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.500]
The first one, flew picture for the cub.

[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:23.580]
Castillo.

[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:24.220]
Yeah.

[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.480]
Now, let me just tell you about Frankie Castillo.

[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.520]
He's either very good or very bad.

[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:31.320]
There's no happy medium with old Frank.

[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.040]
Yeah.

[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:32.920]
So we're.

[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:33.940]
Did that fill you?

[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:34.700]
Yeah.

[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.460]
So we'll see which one shows up.

[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.860]
7.35 PM tonight.

[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:38.640]
I'll be listening.

[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.060]
OK.

[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:39.440]
All right.

[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:39.780]
Bye.

[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.220]
1.25.

[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:42.840]
Already.

[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:43.360]
God.

[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.580]
This is moving along like lightning, isn't it?

[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.780]
It seems like what?

[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:50.520]
70, 80, 90 hours ago that we sat down here today.

[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:54.460]
And this basically almost empty building where there isn't nothing going on.

[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:55.080]
It is.

[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.100]
It's sterling here.

[00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:56.960]
It's like a vacuum.

[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:57.700]
There's just nothing.

[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.060]
No excitement.

[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:00.140]
There's no vibration.

[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.020]
There's no anything.

[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.760]
There's no pulse.

[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:05.180]
It's like death.

[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.640]
You walk up and down the hallway.

[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:11.180]
And there's a couple of like salespeople who look like they're lost, wandering around.

[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:15.260]
And some of the people from the coast are like, ah, what's going on?

[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.120]
We still on the air?

[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.100]
What's the worst platewood?

[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:18.480]
Where's the playlist?

[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.540]
Although I again commend them.

[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:24.740]
I cannot believe that they played I in the sky this morning by the Alan Parsons project.

[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:25.260]
God.

[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.920]
The greatest record in the history of music.

[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:31.580]
I mean, undeniably beyond the shadow of a doubt because that's my opinion.

[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.060]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:36.620]
W-Y-O-D.

[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:37.800]
Neil.

[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:38.160]
Yeah.

[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:41.160]
I was in a hospital at the plantation.

[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.660]
For a plantation general?

[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:44.580]
Excuse me?

[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.580]
Plantation general?

[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:46.240]
No.

[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:48.420]
Humana?

[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.140]
No.

[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.700]
It was university.

[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:52.800]
University?

[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.580]
It was University Pavilion on University Drive.

[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.500]
Never heard of it.

[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:57.120]
Never heard of it?

[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.600]
I didn't know where University and what?

[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.580]
74th, something.

[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.720]
I'm from Dave Callies.

[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.180]
I don't know.

[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.800]
74th, something.

[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.640]
I think it was the address of the University Drive.

[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.360]
Well, whatever you say.

[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.900]
Well, anyway, I think I had a worst than you did.

[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:13.860]
I'm ready to see you back.

[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.400]
Everything is OK.

[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.060]
I have a request.

[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.060]
Well, what does that mean?

[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.640]
I mean, what did you just say?

[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.660]
You think you had it worse than I did and what?

[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.220]
What do you have?

[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:23.980]
I had it worse than I did.

[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:24.380]
Oh.

[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:25.160]

[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.400]
I basically got off easy.

[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.200]
OK, what is it?

[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.760]
I want to hear Sammy Smith-Carrity at yesterday.

[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:32.620]
OK.

[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:33.360]
Thank you.

[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.080]
Good luck to you.

[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:34.360]
Thank you.

[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:34.920]

[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.800]
Oh, man.

[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.640]
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.080]
We can't say sorry enough.

[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:45.640]
127 at WIOD and I'm telling you, man, what's going on in this town?

[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.880]
I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Himmler and Eva Brown on a bad day or sister soldier.

[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:51.380]
God.

[01:00:54.180 --> 01:01:01.500]
Yes, today, Sammy Smith-Carrity went all the way.

[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:06.620]
Will that bum never know how to play?

[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.460]
I can't believe what happened yesterday.

[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.640]
Yesterday, the playoff didn't seem so far away.

[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.620]
Thanks to Sammy, now there is no way.

[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:39.240]
Oh, yesterday, so clearly, why you drive that ball and your face will go away.

[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.360]
Sammy, now I love you, Brian.

[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.260]
So shame.

[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.780]
By Sammy, pack that man a sandwich.

[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.900]
Salami on Rye with mayonnaise.

[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.240]
129 at WIOD and let's, how about line 8, WIOD?

[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.920]
Why have this discovered a gallbladder?

[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.520]
WIOD.

[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.840]
Now that they're free, they're even those banana.

[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.080]
They're still as we...

[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:10.720]
WIOD.

[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:12.580]
Hello.

[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.200]
WIOD.

[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.320]
Give it up, Neil.

[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:17.900]
WIOD.

[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.360]
WIOD.

[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.240]
Hello.

[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:21.820]
Yes.

[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.260]
Who's this, micromember?

[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.420]
WIOD.

[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:28.400]
Yes, Neil.

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:28.920]
Yeah.

[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.100]
Oh, you're doing a different format today.

[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.060]
Yeah, we sure are.

[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:32.760]
Oh.

[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.780]
Like to mix it up a little bit, you know what I'm saying, sir?

[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:35.960]
Yeah, I was confused.

[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.140]
I was calling and calling and calling and calling.

[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:38.880]
Just let it ring.

[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.420]
Is that a keep doing it?

[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.080]
It's like weird.

[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.360]
Yeah, it is like weird.

[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:43.840]
Like.

[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:44.420]
Like.

[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.380]
Anyway, how you doing?

[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:46.740]
Uh, I like.

[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:47.400]
Yeah.

[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.940]
What do you think of all the things going on in the news today?

[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.380]
Like depressing, man.

[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:56.520]
That's the day the worst contention of Taco I we've spoken to in many, many years here today.

[01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:57.700]
WIOD.

[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:58.920]
Yeah, Neil?

[01:02:59.160 --> 01:02:59.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.600]
Oh, I wanted to talk to you about Rick's Census.

[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:02.460]
Why?

[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.360]
Oh, you, we saw him at a, you know, Rob's department store.

[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.120]
You know what?

[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.220]
At a Rob's.

[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:09.380]
Our OASS.

[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:10.160]
Rob?

[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:10.820]
Yeah.

[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.540]
And he was changing his shirt right in the middle of the store.

[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:14.100]
Yeah.

[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.940]
And this guy's, I mean, he's a total idiot.

[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.860]
130 at WIOD.

[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.060]
Let's go to a Dave County.

[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:23.480]
Hello?

[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:24.960]
Oh, you all.

[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:26.420]
WIOD.

[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.340]
Only air.

[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:29.760]
WIOD.

[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.780]
You know, Alan's ruined.

[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:32.440]
How you doing?

[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:34.760]
WIOD.

[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:35.980]
It's, hey, Neil, how's it going?

[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.400]
Pretty good.

[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.040]
All right.

[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.340]
Listen, first I'd like to leave all these celebrities we're hearing from today.

[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.600]
The greats and the air greats.

[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.420]
We had Elvis Jr. Jr., we just had Elvis Rubin Jr.

[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:46.820]
I hate it when that happens.

[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:47.200]
Yeah.

[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.860]
And listen, I'd like to say thanks to you and Rick and Suds.

[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.340]
You made me a top radio conference.

[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:53.880]
Do you like to remember Jr.?

[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.060]
Yeah.

[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.900]
Yeah, you guys are making money for the station.

[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.480]
In fact, two parts commentary.

[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.760]
One of them is under the soldier thing, whoever is later.

[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.380]
I think the Benjamin Hookson, people like Alex Darsen and Jesse, they got a lot of nerve

[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.740]
saying that people are struggling in the issues when they're given a lot of credit to this lady,

[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.320]
possibly with an eye for eight education.

[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:18.480]
It has talent field where anybody who can make a real cheap rhyme can make a million dollars.

[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.820]
So let's talk about minimalizing the issues.

[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.520]
What's wrong with making a cheap rhyme?

[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.620]
Just ejection been doing.

[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.580]
They're making a career that's for 30 years now.

[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.740]
Yeah, but you know, people, you're absolutely right about the TV thing.

[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:33.160]
If there weren't for the TV, then this woman wouldn't be causing anybody any problems.

[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.940]
I'd never heard of her and my life would be a lot better.

[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:35.440]
Thanks, Max.

[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:39.760]
Anyway, so that a good hospital story, boy, you might like this stuff.

[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.960]
It was up in West Palm, so that's to tell you something anyway.

[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.520]
My uncle, he's a pretty subtle guy.

[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.260]
He's about 55.

[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.020]
He's pretty tough, but he's still working.

[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.700]
And he had none of the job accident.

[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.140]
And he screwed up his knee and his back.

[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.860]
And he was hospitalized for a cute pain.

[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:52.700]
He couldn't move or anything.

[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.600]
So he told them, first off, hey, I'm allergic to Thailand all.

[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.700]
And I'm allergic to tape.

[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:57.760]
And they put it on his charge.

[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.120]
And they stick him in bed.

[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:00.700]
And they said, hey, you got some good pain there.

[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:01.140]
So what do you think?

[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.920]
And they taped a bunch of Thailand all the way there.

[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.760]
So it's just about.

[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:07.180]
They started pumping in with Thailand all three.

[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.700]
You know, good coating stuff in there.

[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.420]
And they taped the IVs with arm of course.

[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.460]
And so he had this spectacular allergic reaction for as well.

[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.560]
So in order to treat the allergic reaction, they stick him in the bathtub.

[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.600]
It's got like a side door, like an old model A roadster or something.

[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.500]
It's called about 100 gallons of water.

[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:27.020]
And he put oatmeal or some kind of crap in there to relieve the allergic reaction.

[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.920]
And he's sitting in there just starting to give him a little bit in this side door.

[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.480]
Blow is open on this thing, right?

[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.800]
So this poor 65-year-old man gets blown out on the water.

[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.280]
So out on the floor with 100 gallons of water.

[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:40.720]
And I was hooting though.

[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:43.920]
On the surface right up to the part where he hits the...

[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.500]
The landings there.

[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:44.740]
Yeah.

[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.280]
And that wasn't so soothing.

[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.100]
So then they said, oh yeah, well, we've been having a problem with that.

[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:55.060]
And the next day they're stuck him back in it and guess what happened?

[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.180]
It blew open again.

[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.120]
One more time.

[01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:59.040]
It blew open again.

[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.940]
So, in the meantime, he's talking real nice lawsuit.

[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.080]
They keep opening with the tire over.

[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:06.160]
Massive lawsuit.

[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.540]
Massive lawsuit.

[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.560]
Just keep sanitary.

[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.340]
Okay, but now it has a good rain to it.

[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.260]
But we're not quite finished.

[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:11.800]
Yeah.

[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.040]
They put him in his table.

[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.880]
It's some kind of entire body traction, right?

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.080]
And this thing rotates from side to side to keep the blood bodily fluids moving and stuff.

[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:21.520]
Like that.

[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:27.520]
And they didn't quite have a hang on how to put him in there because he's got this back problem, right?

[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.060]
But they sat them in at the feet.

[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.320]
They sat them in around the top of his head, but they didn't mobilize his back.

[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.360]
So this thing rotates from side to side.

[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.820]
And he's swinging back and forth like that.

[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.980]
So the head is all that's exactly in right?

[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.860]
Oh man, that would be good on paper and talent.

[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:41.520]
That would be great.

[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.140]
So it was lovely.

[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.440]
So he said screw you.

[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:44.640]
He made him give him his clothes.

[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.560]
He got up and left.

[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.300]
And now he's going to see their ass off.

[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:47.940]
Oh, it's amazing.

[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.140]
So I have a good day at Yale.

[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:49.920]
We have half.

[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.960]
So let's see.

[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:53.060]
134.

[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:57.780]
You know, that punk that's called before about how, how come I'm ripping my side out because he was born there?

[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:04.020]
I mean, what kind of logic is that when you stop and think about that, talk about pre-pubescent mentality?

[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.280]
How is it possible for there to be somebody dumb kids running around on a loose?

[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.100]
How is it possible?

[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.540]
Like I was born in strong memorial hospital and watching you in New York, okay?

[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:17.500]
And if somebody got butchered up there, when I say, oh, yeah, you shouldn't be knocking him.

[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.320]
I was born there after all.

[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.620]
So how does that mean?

[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:22.900]
You punk.

[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:31.560]
Get the latest news, traffic and weather info each morning with Mike Granari in the morning information team just before the New Reggie show.

[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:37.060]
I think the latest season is very crappy.

[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.540]
He had a stuff of kids with a hubby.

[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.000]
Now he's getting black from our 90GC.

[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:44.840]
I'm getting black from our 90GC.

[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:50.220]
I'm getting black from our 90GC.

[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:50.840]
I'm getting black from our 90GC.

[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.760]
I'm getting black from our 90GC.

[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:58.180]
Why is Dan Quayle started picking on me?

[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.800]
Every time he sees this, I just never wait.

[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.620]
He's got a fucking bird.

[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:05.380]
He's got a single leg.

[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:06.380]
Well, it's hard.

[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.120]
He's got a cow.

[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.800]
We're getting down on every side.

[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.720]
I'll be here when the house is going away.

[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.400]
We must have something better to do with VT.

[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.480]
Hi, Dan Quayle.

[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:40.320]
Get a light.

[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.620]
We're going to go on a little bit more on slime ball.

[01:08:46.740 --> 01:09:00.820]
You're going to get a lighter.

[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.480]
You're going to get a lighter.

[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.180]
We're going to get a lighter.

[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:07.560]
We're going to get a lighter.

[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:07.560]

[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:07.560]

[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:07.560]

[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:07.560]

[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:07.560]

[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:07.560]

[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.100]
We're going to get a lighter.

[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:09.580]
It has a tiny little baking crème family over there.

[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.720]
There's a glimpse through there called Fat Jack the North Yew,

[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.080]
and it looks just like Enkelburg.

[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.240]
Oh, I did see that.

[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.080]
Oh, yeah, here it is.

[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.040]
That's like a candy sandwich.

[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.920]
You were doing it in 1986.

[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.080]
I recognize those kids anywhere, man.

[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:29.480]
But,...)

[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.780]
Now, you know, I spend all that 3 time in Vegas.

[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.060]
Absolutely, it is.

[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.540]
I rest my case.

[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.520]
That's probably the other woodmobrene right now.

[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:41.480]
Yeah, but maybe to refresh my memory didn't properly set up Sunday racing.

[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:46.820]
And that they did I think last year and year before they tried it for two seasons and I liked it a lot

[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.840]
I thought it was great, but they didn't like it and they dropped it.

[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:53.580]
Yeah, because I thought it was their one Sunday night, but I was in the argument with someone to say no, now they never

[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:58.560]
But if you're dead two years in a row, we did it and I was there every Sunday and I liked it a lot and

[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.780]
What can I tell you? They didn't like it.

[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:05.500]
I thought so, but just remember when you're ripping hands, he's obviously got friends in high places there

[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.740]
And you don't want to sleep with the fishes or whatever.

[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:08.260]
All right.

[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:09.780]
See you again.

[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:10.220]
Bye.

[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:19.900]
142 at WIOD and let's do, I don't know, do the screenless and I try to jump all around a picture that we get micro organ on a couple of times.

[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:21.460]
WIOD.

[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:24.440]
WIOD.

[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.480]
Yeah, currently doing the talk show.

[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:26.980]
What?

[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.200]
I'd be on talk show.

[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:28.820]
How old are you?

[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:29.880]
I'm 23.

[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.080]
Wooo!

[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.920]
Let's go to Dave County WIOD.

[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:42.660]
Yes, I want to know the time to be a Brent.

[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:43.880]
WIOD.

[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.420]
But me, oh, yeah, how you doing?

[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:45.960]
Pretty good.

[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:49.100]
I'm asking you, uh, that was you know, that was on edge of sound.

[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.400]
That was our buddy from Homestead.

[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:51.200]
I had blind too.

[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.160]
I couldn't hear because you got in the phone ring and I couldn't hear it so.

[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.240]
Believe me, you're very lucky.

[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.380]
Pretty bad, huh?

[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:59.880]
Uh, Neil, how's the, you know, the satellite?

[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.160]
You have the number for that?

[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:03.200]
What are you talking about?

[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.400]
So for the satellite company?

[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.280]
Do I have the number for it?

[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:06.540]
Yeah.

[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:10.540]
Oh, like, it's barely like hello or anything and already you want something?

[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:11.020]
Yes, I'm.

[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:12.160]
You barely like said hello?

[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:12.860]
How you been?

[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.700]
How's the operation?

[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.160]
Nah, too late now.

[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.000]
Too late now.

[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:16.860]
You just want something.

[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.960]
You want the number for which international is that it?

[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:19.480]
Is that it right?

[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:20.380]
And you're going to get a date?

[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.100]
Yeah, I'm thinking of getting a date.

[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.180]
Don't think about it.

[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:23.620]
Do it.

[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.360]
Yeah, definitely.

[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.600]
You will kiss the ground and send the love letters in the sand and uh, the sand.

[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.440]
I'm telling you.

[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.440]
And uh, the only thing that can keep you sane in this town.

[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.100]
Are you in date?

[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.260]
Yeah, I'm in date, yeah.

[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.220]
895.

[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:36.460]
895.

[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.000]
7661.

[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:39.380]
7661.

[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:40.600]
Okay, one more question.

[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.440]
Do you ever watch this old Dream On in HBO?

[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.980]
Never heard of it.

[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:44.640]
Never heard of it?

[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:45.260]
Dream On.

[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.060]
Yeah, Dream On.

[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:46.900]
It's a dream on.

[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:47.680]
It's pretty funny.

[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:48.440]
It's about what?

[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.720]
It's an adult comedy.

[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.140]
Uh, I'll take it out.

[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:52.600]
I like it.

[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:52.960]
Okay.

[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.020]
Okay, Neil, thanks.

[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:54.740]
Good luck with your date.

[01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:04.960]
143 at WIOD, the Starline, he said, with great anticipation and hopes for the best and there's

[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.500]
nobody on there, which like I said, ain't too bad.

[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:08.620]
My comparison.

[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.200]
WIOD.

[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.060]
WIOD.

[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:16.560]
144.

[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.900]
See there, you did that one little moment there and you think, well, you know, just maybe.

[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.640]
Let it get them out of the system.

[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.140]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.580]
Like some old bad green snot.

[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.460]
It's like way up in your assigned system.

[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:34.080]
And it's just just hopeless because I mean, it's so small, it's like an ingrown hair nail.

[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.080]
An ingrown hair nail.

[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.120]
Which is a combination.

[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:39.900]
No, seriously.

[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:41.180]
That's like an ingrown hair.

[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:43.400]
A combination ingrown toenail and ingrown hair.

[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:48.140]
And boy, you get those two babies in there together, fighting to force their way out.

[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:52.240]
And you got some heavy duty pressure, depending on where it might be.

[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.280]
WIOD.

[01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:57.820]
Okay.

[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.220]
WIOD on the Starline.

[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:01.940]
Hi, Neil.

[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:02.420]
Yes.

[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:05.120]
Hey, I'm so glad you're here that you're feeling better.

[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:08.460]
You had me in fit-tutoring your operation.

[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.980]
We were really concerned.

[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.500]
Yeah, you had me in fit-tutoring.

[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.100]
That's clever.

[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:13.180]
A little play on words there.

[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.360]
Oh, well, we were concerned.

[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.540]
We don't want to lose you.

[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:19.660]
Yeah, I can tell by the response I've been back to the audience who's just a mesmerized.

[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.180]
Well, they're all a bunch of, you know, what?

[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.480]
About the true listeners really care about you.

[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:24.700]
Yeah.

[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:25.700]
All those things.

[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:26.360]
All those things.

[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.040]
How's the deal?

[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.920]
You used to play out fit-tut, you know?

[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:32.620]
What is it?

[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.680]
You used to play a fit called a blue job.

[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:37.540]
And I've been dying.

[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:38.460]
A long gone.

[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.020]
A long gone.

[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:40.380]
Why?

[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:41.760]
Because they answered out.

[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.300]
Well, where do we get it?

[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:45.800]
You don't get it.

[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.420]
There's nothing to see as where do we get it.

[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.000]
It's gone.

[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.360]
They've pulled it out of here because they're a bunch of panties.

[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.240]
Oh, the center shift is a bunch of jobs.

[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.680]
Well, there you go, sir.

[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.760]
We got no more trousers, trout.

[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:56.960]
We got no more Memphis.

[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.800]
We got no more blue job.

[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.180]
We got no more green job.

[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.480]
I told my wife about a snow job.

[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.440]
That's what we got here.

[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:03.980]
That's about it.

[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.200]
We got a big snow job from the panties and talks broadcasting.

[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.140]
That's what we got.

[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:11.300]
Well, with all the money they had, they can afford to pay the fine.

[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:11.940]
Yeah, right.

[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.300]
You know, we should have...

[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.300]
Oh, that's the problem.

[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.400]
They did pay the fine.

[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.360]
That's the problem instead of standing up and fighting it like they have some principle

[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.340]
to stand on, where they're $5 billion.

[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.060]
I've got a car.

[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:23.840]
There's money.

[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:24.840]
Oh, John.

[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.460]
Did they take it out of your salary?

[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:27.420]
Of course not.

[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.420]
Oh, well, I couldn't have for small things.

[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:30.920]
Well, Neil, listen.

[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:32.500]
I just wanted to personally say...

[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.300]
What do you mean did they take it out of my salary?

[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:35.060]
What does that mean?

[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.080]
Well, where I work, if I threw up, they'll take it out of my salary.

[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:38.800]
No, I didn't...

[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.880]
I didn't screw up.

[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:44.700]
Everything that this station got fine for was approved by the middle-level management on this radio station.

[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.940]
Oh, you mean it's looking like a dinner?

[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:47.240]
Didn't come out...

[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.780]
I don't know who it came out of.

[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.180]
Siri, didn't come out of my height.

[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:50.880]
I'll tell you that.

[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:53.360]
Well, we all have to stop for a week's pause with it.

[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:53.720]
Yeah.

[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.680]
I'm sure you'll survive, okay?

[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:56.460]
Well, we will.

[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:58.240]
Now that you're back and healthy, why?

[01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:59.260]
Okay, I'll say, have a great life.

[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.280]
I can grow up already.

[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.900]
$146.00 to WYOD.

[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.440]
What is that?

[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.400]
What do you want?

[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.540]
Why are you holding that?

[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:19.820]
Like you've got some like magic potion in your hands, like holding that cup of coffee, like a witch's brew behind some piece of boring coffee you've got again.

[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:22.120]
God, you hear that one spot he does?

[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:28.240]
Yeah, it starts out like somebody is just stuck their foot about 40 up his butt, like somebody goofs him.

[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.840]
You're regressing back into that 50-year-old.

[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:31.860]
Hey, that was all you.

[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:32.980]
Yeah.

[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.380]
Probably talking to Ron St. John a lot lately.

[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:38.380]
$147.00 at WYOD.

[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.640]
$147.00 at WYOD.

[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:41.880]
$147.00 at WYOD.

[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.880]
You win the Super Dade.

[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.160]
And Mr. Music or Mr. Radio.

[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:46.520]
What's his name, Mr. Radio?

[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:47.040]
What up?

[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:47.760]
What up?

[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.760]
Well, did you ever see that guy, Mr. Radio?

[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:50.320]
God.

[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:57.640]
Oh, man, Mr. Radio, you are like a rottling sack of walking crap is what you are, okay?

[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.460]
You are just pathetic.

[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:03.680]
God, I'd rather see Alombardo than Mr. Radio.

[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.980]
I'd rather be dead than see Alombardo again.

[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:09.420]
I'll probably have it pomp and I will have to be settled with his ugliness again up there tonight.

[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:12.560]
Wandering around desperately hoping that somebody speaks to him.

[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.840]
I love that gang up there on the fourth floor.

[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.200]
They're just all like wander around, find the olex.

[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.360]
I had the two over the three, four, five, and a lot of us.

[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.120]
Nobody cares.

[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:21.400]
Nobody cares.

[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:25.380]
Just sit in your own seat and tag your carrot up and just have a good time.

[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:30.280]
It's not running around trying desperately to find somebody to validate your pathetic existence, okay?

[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:36.500]
Now, 148 at WIOD and this weekend we're going to be at where we're going to be.

[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:41.360]
We're going to be at Brandsmark and the Saga Sino small from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday.

[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:42.380]
Get it right.

[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:48.200]
This Saturday keeps saying it over and over again this Saturday and they'll be demonstrating the Sony dated this man.

[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:54.940]
We'll have our Commodore Sous-CDs and those new t-shirts and some tickets to the Dolphins Preseason opener against the Cowboys

[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:57.880]
and tickets to the Hurricane Home opener against Florida A&M.

[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:03.280]
And speaking of the Sony dated this man, it is about as much fun as you can have in the palm of your hand legally.

[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.580]
I'll tell you that anywhere in Dayton, Broward, guaranteed.

[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.720]
And there's got all kinds of neat stuff that you pop in there like the dictionary of American flying.

[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:16.600]
And the Webster Crossword Puzzle dictionary and monarch notes in the International Wine Guide and the official airline guide.

[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.600]
And World Travel Translator and E-Burts Movie Home Companion.

[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.860]
And the timetable of Arson Entertainment is porting his baseball guide and registered and much more.

[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:30.640]
The Sony dated this man is an electronic book reader that's capable of displaying thousands of pages of text and graphics

[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.840]
stored on a removable disk you just pop them in and yank them out.

[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.760]
And they give you access to an entire library worth of information right on top of your desk or on your briefcase.

[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:44.060]
And of course it's the perfect gift for Father's Day graduation or back to school or back to school.

[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:52.100]
So check it out. This Saturday at Brands Mark from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The Sony dated this man I'll see you at the Saga Rasp mill Saturday.

[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:59.680]
Got those low moving, great dragon bumper to bumper blues. Must be your second traffic right now.

[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.820]
I guess you missed that traffic report on 610 WIOD.

[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:10.420]
Stop singing and stay tuned to 610 WIOD for Skywatch 610 traffic updates.

[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:13.960]
30 days from morning into the afternoon and throughout the night.

[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:26.260]
Skywatch 610 traffic from South Florida's noon traffic and weather station noon truck radio 610 WIOD and bus stop bumper to bumper blues.

[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:32.840]
The night is 610 WIOD and bus stop bumper to bumper blues.

[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:36.960]
The night is 610 WIOD and bus stop bumper to bumper blues.

[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.300]
Yeah man how you doing?

[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.360]
Hey if you've been riding around your low ride a course and for bands of days you probably pretty hungry right about now right?

[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:54.420]
So let's just go and go. Go home where you gotta watch your hair, see your rumbles on the table, see people thank you.

[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:59.560]
You don't gotta do that. Come see us cause we're not your mama.

[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.440]
The new service Mexico Reserves.

[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.640]
Excuse me I'd like to contest the door special.

[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.840]
Hello you can see whatever you want cause I'm gonna go for you.

[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.060]
Yeah not your mama.

[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.080]
Not your mama.

[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.880]
Sivin' up the bathtub and it's been your one.

[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.160]
It's more reasonable by the naked yourself.

[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.800]
I was great.

[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.300]
I'm gonna be back for you.

[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.200]
Why did you get my hand worse?

[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.200]
So for a sex match with more respect is I throw my mama.

[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.680]
Do you see it yourself?

[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.320]
We're not so mama.

[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.320]
153 at WIOD.

[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.060]
Sivin' a mother.

[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.280]
Johnny Dorkley just in here briefly and boy are we depressed about that.

[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.500]
WIOD.

[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.160]
Oh yes. Can I be on the mirror?

[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:50.020]
No chance. WIOD.

[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:51.760]
Hello.

[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:52.560]
Oops.

[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.020]
Too late. WIOD.

[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:54.400]
Who?

[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:55.440]
WIOD.

[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:56.580]
Zero.

[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:57.920]
How you doing?

[01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:58.360]
Okay.

[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.540]
Listen you're killing me down here in Southwest Gate.

[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.420]
Why is that?

[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:07.440]
I've been beaten to steering wheel and laughing so hard tears are running out of my eyes.

[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:08.220]
Really? Me too?

[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:11.760]
Listen I got an absolutely seamless request.

[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:12.500]
No chance.

[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:13.360]
No chance.

[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.560]
Well it's pretty late.

[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.360]
Well I understand but it will kill a little bit of time.

[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.340]
What is it?

[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:19.020]
Rayceroni.

[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:20.180]
See ya.

[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.760]
153 at WIOD.

[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:23.540]
Starline.

[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:23.900]
Time.

[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:24.620]
What is it?

[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:25.640]
Rayceroni.

[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:26.700]
See ya.

[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:29.360]
153 at WIOD.

[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:30.180]
Starline.

[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.480]
That is it.

[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:32.260]
Rayceroni.

[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:33.360]
See ya.

[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.960]
153 at WIOD.

[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:36.780]
Starline.

[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:37.500]
That is it.

[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:38.240]
For up close.

[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.000]
Oh and then we get the phone crashed out.

[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.020]
That was special.

[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.340]
That was the hour and a half of this screenless and you saw this is pretty good.

[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:50.980]
This is garbage.

[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:53.260]
And then finally we strike gold man.

[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.600]
That made the whole show.

[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:56.960]
Thank you so much sir.

[01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:05.100]
That was like the time tunnel and confusion and phone crap and just like rolled it off into one big gigantic electronic ball.

[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.620]
And you're like sitting right inside of it.

[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:08.340]
That was it.

[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:08.820]
God.

[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.740]
Man the hairs inside the follicles inside my colon are like trembling now from that.

[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:15.840]
God that was good.

[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.240]
WIOD.

[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:20.780]
WIOD.

[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:21.620]
Neil.

[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.000]
Yes.

[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.040]
I have to tell you this.

[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.360]
I want to celebrate this with you.

[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.880]
24 years ago I had my gold bladder removed.

[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:29.600]
Yeah.

[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:31.420]
You know by who?

[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:35.460]
I know it's Vietnamese doctor using a Russian petition rocket.

[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:40.420]
155.

[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.620]
Well hey, at least it was cheap anyway.

[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:51.140]
And no you don't have to worry about the dangers of that very very nauseous anesthetic either.

[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.100]
WIOD.

[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.160]
You play the stock tendon promo.

[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.040]
Yeah right.

[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:57.420]
WIOD.

[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.340]
Hi.

[01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:58.720]
Neil.

[01:21:59.060 --> 01:21:59.520]
Yes man.

[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.840]
Yeah I just wondered if you knew the 4Fs that were associated with gold bladder disease.

[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:06.720]
The 4F?

[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:07.160]
Yes.

[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.640]
It's not that bad.

[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.320]
Is that fertile 48 and flat?

[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.720]
Do you have any of those?

[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:15.660]
Please don't take the effort.

[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:19.400]
I think that's pretty interesting.

[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.120]
Yeah that's cute.

[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:20.660]
Alrighty.

[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:21.940]
Not great but cute.

[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:22.600]
It's cute.

[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:23.420]
It's real though.

[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:23.780]
Yeah.

[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:24.340]
Okay.

[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:24.700]
Yeah.

[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.100]
Bye bye.

[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:26.140]
Pretty weak.

[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:28.260]
156 of WIOD.

[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:28.720]
Who's that?

[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:30.080]
Or is that you?

[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:31.700]
Or do you pick it up?

[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:34.400]
It was what?

[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:36.660]
Oh cranked.

[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:37.320]
On the bat line.

[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:38.180]
Oh boy.

[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:39.100]
Bat riches.

[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.260]
Given that number out again.

[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:41.580]
Probably got another feeding ticket.

[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.220]
See I originally wasn't going to, I wasn't going to sit on him.

[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.520]
You know, but he keeps every kind of get stopped to give the cop the bat line.

[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.220]
He's going to get a big boy.

[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:53.940]
He's going to get a big boy.

[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:54.780]
Give it I'm saying.

[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:55.520]
There you go.

[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.080]
Bat riches boyfriends again.

[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:58.480]
WIOD.

[01:22:58.780 --> 01:22:59.240]
Hi Neil.

[01:22:59.500 --> 01:22:59.660]
Hi.

[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.360]
For the ticket was born in downtown.

[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.080]
I went in there 20 years ago.

[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.560]
Perfect and came up with a brain damage child.

[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.940]
How you love brain damage.

[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:07.380]
Yeah.

[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:11.140]
Number two, sit through your soldier was on, uh...

[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:12.100]
Speaking of brain damage.

[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.780]
So gone, you asked the right.

[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.960]
And he went, uh, he had food stamps, tap of the life.

[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.380]
And received a scholarship to go to college.

[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.560]
And now he's condemning the very system that gave her that chance.

[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:24.800]
I think that's pretty unfair.

[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:26.040]
He makes me an author.

[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:26.380]
Tell him.

[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:29.600]
He makes me want to go back in the hospital and they'll let them do anything they want to make.

[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:30.640]
I'm glad you're so well.

[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:30.840]
Thank you.

[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:32.260]
Or put her in there instead.

[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.540]
Well, that show was really something to see.

[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:35.300]
No, I'll see you later.

[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:35.680]
Thank you.

[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.160]
Okay.

[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.640]
Well, we got that straightened out.

[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.780]
Okay, for the punk who survived my sign, I had birthed.

[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:42.020]
Okay?

[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:43.540]
Mr. Hot Scott.

[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.460]
Mr. Expert.

[01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:45.900]
Mr. Rocket Scientist.

[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.240]
WIOD.

[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.020]
WIOD.

[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:51.160]
Yeah, it's so cool, man.

[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:52.360]
WIOD.

[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.260]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:53.820]
Okay.

[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:55.700]
Well, you know what I want to do with the symposium.

[01:23:58.840 --> 01:23:59.280]
WIOD.

[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.040]
Bring back the lightning round, man.

[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:02.160]
WIOD.

[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:03.160]
Hello, here are you.

[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:03.620]
Okay.

[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:04.360]
Good.

[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.340]
You know that's that gold blood operation?

[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:06.820]
Yeah.

[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.340]
You know, it's the second most frequent forms of surgery.

[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:12.080]
Yeah.

[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.940]
And I think, by the way, I forgot to mention the CBS, the eye on the news, whatever they're

[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.340]
calling that thing on CBS news.

[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.780]
I think it's the night they're having a feature on that.

[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.300]
Oh, really?

[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:22.360]
Because all these people are...

[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:22.780]
It's in a mail.

[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:23.980]
All these people in hospital.

[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:24.400]
Huh?

[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.560]
I get this news tape from Portland in hospital.

[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:30.280]
No, but seriously, people are bleeding to that stomach because there are surgeons performing

[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:34.360]
who are like beginners and are like experimenting on patients and they don't know how to do it yet.

[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:34.980]
Oh, no.

[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.580]
And they're having all kinds of exciting little things.

[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:40.060]
Yeah, it takes 6.6 days, hospital's day.

[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.060]
How long did you say?

[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:43.040]
6.6 days.

[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:43.900]
Yeah, this is sad.

[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.680]
I was there for about five days.

[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:47.960]
Oh, you worried about that?

[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.200]
I was expecting you to be over night for one day.

[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.080]
That's the big sales pitch.

[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:52.540]
Oh, yeah.

[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.820]
You come in for one night, rest up, and you go home the next day.

[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:56.580]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:57.280]
No, I'm listening.

[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:02.200]
I'm calling in six from your work from last Saturday until I'm sorry.

[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:07.360]
Your doose bag and Kevin, your bed wet and fancy.

[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:07.880]
Okay.

[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:08.240]
Good idea.

[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:11.880]
Okay, so I'm going to go to the next day.

[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:11.880]

[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:11.880]

[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:11.880]

[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:11.880]

[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.460]
What about these strange sounds we got there?

[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.720]
Those are the little farting sounds on the phone.

[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:18.380]
Well, anyway, we got that one call in the mobile.

[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:20.100]
It certainly made my entire day.

[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:23.440]
And now that I'm between that and getting my paycheck, I feel it was like a redeeming thing

[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.420]
even to come in here today.

[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.680]
Because certainly there are a lot of other people who didn't bother to.

[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:29.540]
This is like a ghost town in here.

[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:30.720]
It's like a skeleton crew.

[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.400]
It's like a...

[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.820]
It's just a certain...

[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:37.740]
I was just saying a certain atmosphere in here, but it's like a lack of atmosphere in this place.

[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:39.540]
Like there's just nothing going on.

[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.500]
Like we're just day walking.

[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.300]
I don't know how to describe it.

[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.080]
Like we're just going through the motions of life.

[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.460]
Like we're faking our way through.

[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.040]
Like we're on some horrendous drugtrip.

[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:57.540]
Like somebody has released all kinds of hallucinogenic drugs throughout the ventilation system.

[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.440]
Anyway, speaking of that, breathe deep now.

[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:05.760]
News from around the planet with Rick and Spud this afternoon are going to be smoking the carpeting.

[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:14.260]
From 2 to 6 this afternoon to make way for a basketball and football draft talk with Sonny and Joseph Gackackackie at 6.05 this evening.

[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.280]
And then of course the highlight of the day every day.

[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:21.320]
Monday through Friday here on WIOD, a monster in the broadcast industry.
