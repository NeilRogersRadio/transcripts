[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]
is that by all i and con rarely pitch well against the cubs and and franko to

[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.260]
usually have no problem with those guys and the guy that kills us as

[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.800]
a separate and this was coming back into weeks by the way yeah but that the

[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.160]
other night that was this place by you be broke i was ready to go there uh...

[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.180]
there are there are sorry defensive lot you can complain about their defense

[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.780]
because they don't have any uh... she's unbelievable and uh...

[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.780]
one other thing i saw larry came last night i think he is he is just the biggest

[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.360]
uh...

[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.140]
i don't know what the show is interesting at all because i think

[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.180]
just a book is in your conference

[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.100]
yet he doesn't uh... any questions that

[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.720]
you know require anything uh... other than

[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.220]
you know i think uh... god is punishing hang for uh... trying to emulate

[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.580]
larry by sucking around all those politicians that's why i think i sick last night

[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.100]
i think that somebody sending him a message

[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.640]
i really do

[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.740]
i'll say the two greatest cards you have is that larry came up

[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.960]
uh...

[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.480]
the one

[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.500]
uh...

[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.020]
well in closing let me just say one thing

[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.280]
and i'll put the stock

[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.060]

[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.540]
carpenters

[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.460]

[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.660]

[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.360]
got a very attractive white little tall

[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.500]
but he does have a step letter he said

[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.680]
little one

[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.040]
and a step led

[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.560]

[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.580]
he's a little

[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.700]
uh... bizarre but

[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.040]

at w i o d well you see it's provocative when you come on here and you make

[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.160]
some uh... tremendous announcement like that that i like and mary people are like

[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.280]
uh... shouting from the rooftops their buzzing and uh... having a their

[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.940]
flittering sally's tossing her batteries around to go in nuts

[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.400]

[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.300]
danie song and i guess if we just listen to the Kenny logger you can't tell

[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.080]
me part until i get to the part where there's the gender thing about the him

[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.000]
and her or whatever

[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.400]

[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.700]
see that's what got that's what got me sucked into this it's kind of like subliminal

[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.440]
right and you know any recording artist who has to have those spots on where

[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.800]
they sell their best four thousand hits most of which they never recorded before

[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.780]
that they're dying over there they're desperate like zizam fear and uh... roger

[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.240]
widaker right they're trying to make the uh... rent payment roger widaker only

[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.420]

roger widaker the last farewell that's the only hit he ever had

[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.140]
and he sells this album that's got like his top seventy five hits

[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.500]
that no one's ever heard seventy four of right well know you heard him but

[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.200]
they were all by somebody else who did them well

[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.520]
oh okay and you'd like to hear him again by somebody else right there this

[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.500]
