[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.360]
Hi, this is Sonny Fox. I listen to Neil Rogers because I can hear the word asshole.

[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.240]
506 at WIOD we have a nice lady in Sarasota.

[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.140]
Hello?

[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.860]
Hello?

[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.540]
Yes.

[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.780]
Do you have to use that vulgar language on T's on radio?

[00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.420]
Yes.

[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.160]
Why?

[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.600]
Because I feel like it.

[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.380]
It's not that we don't use any vulgar language, ma'am.

[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.240]
That is absolutely sick.

[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.760]
What?

[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.580]
And I want to tell you something.

[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.900]
Well, are you going to tell me something?

[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.960]
For your information of you who don't use language like that.

[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.560]
Yes, you do.

[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.440]
No, we don't.

[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.600]
Yes, you do. You've heard it all.

[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.600]
Can I ask you something?

[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.600]
Can I ask you something?

[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.860]
Can I ask you something?

[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.240]
Well, how about if I ask you something for a few more time?

[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.380]

[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.400]
I want to ask you something.

[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.320]
Oh, in some other words, when you make the call, it's like a one-way conversation.

[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.960]
My polite lady friend.

[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.000]
How about if I ask you a question?

[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.780]
All right, ask me.

[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.380]
How long have you been listening this morning?

[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.240]
All morning.

[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.640]
Well, why all morning?

[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.540]
Well, how can you have it?

[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.680]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.940]
Let's have a conversation.

[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.960]
Okay, let's try.

[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.220]
Now, if you're so offended, why haven't you shut it off yet?

[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.200]
Well, because I wanted to really be sure and I decided to make this call.

[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.440]

[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.300]
And this is going to be it.

[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.260]
Be sure what?

[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.080]
Let me ask you something.

[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.860]
Well, in other words, after the call, you're going to turn it off.

[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.180]
Let me ask you something.

[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.280]
Are you going to turn it off?

[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.060]
Oh!

[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.800]
Did that bitch hang up?

[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.880]
I mean, did that nice lady in Sarasota hang up?

[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.320]
We seem to be hung up on Sarasota.

[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.300]
Now, as I recall, when I worked there back in 1973, there were like two or three people.

[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.080]
There were the IQ bigger than their shoe size.

[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.120]
But they're probably all dead by now, huh?

[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.000]
Or close to it.

[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.340]
She sounds like she's getting real close.

[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.580]
I was riding on a train to Austin, Texas.

[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.720]
Oh, and a very lovely lady to send next to mine.

[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.920]
When she got a picket, I was just a bite, but hold her sight.

[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.520]
I was more than happy too.

[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.860]
And now there's more I'd like to do.

[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.140]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.420]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her ear.

[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.700]
I want to hold her behind closed doors and more.

[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.000]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.260]
When she returned, she said she was an actress.

[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.600]
She showed me an album of pictures of her opening,

[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.280]
when she'd been sitting on.

[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.040]
She seemed to swear she could be,

[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.740]
but I could clearly see she was the kind of girl

[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.620]
whose domain's hearts has been wrecked on.

[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.760]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.740]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her ear.

[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:11.220]
I want to hold her behind closed doors and more.

[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.300]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.940]
Well, I'll never forget the train ride down to Austin.

[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.660]
We're saying you're the sweet and we shared our tales.

[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.540]
But as my heart tries to leave her behind,

[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.080]
regrets are all I find,

[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.840]
because I hope that could get that girl in the end.

[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.460]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.920]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her ear.

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.560]
I want to hold her behind closed doors and more.

[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:26.060]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.680]
It's time for the tour.

[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.580]
A Mitsuhiti Archie engineer was telling me that S.U.N.

[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.560]
Cycle goes up across the Gulf all the way up into Tallahassee.

[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.100]
He said, in the middle of the day,

[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.100]
you can like a local.

[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.280]
It just booms in there.

[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.520]
So if the governor is listening,

[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.220]
man, the pro-zac supplies in the mail.

[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.820]
God, can you imagine?

[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.100]
Talk about nose pickers in Tallahassee in the panhandle?

[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.380]
God!

[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.400]
Here's Arcadia.

[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.920]
And Nail.

[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.600]
Talk about bringing some sanity back to our show, yes sir.

[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.140]
Yes, almost a tree, huh?

[00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.680]
Yeah.

[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.200]
Hey, I want to give you a little spy report on Rush Limbo.

[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.120]
Good. There we go.

[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.140]
You ask, can you give it?

[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.060]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.060]
He comes out in FLA at one o'clock after...

[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.320]
Now, let me ask you, does he wear like that body arm band

[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.460]
that hold that big swastika of the body band?

[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.140]
I don't know.

[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.320]
I've always seen him on TV, one of those commercials on TV.

[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.180]
Yeah, you got to have a big screen to see him.

[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.280]
You got to have something big to listen to him.

[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.640]
Yeah.

[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.960]
And it's not a brain either.

[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.180]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.820]
That's right.

[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.580]
So what time is he on?

[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.100]
One to what?

[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.560]
One to four, I believe.

[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.220]
Oh, God.

[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.460]
Three hours of that Heinrich Himmler crap?

[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.040]
Yeah.

[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.620]
And then Lionel comes on and that's about idiotic radio.

[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.940]
Yeah.

[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.380]
Well, so what have they got on here?

[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.340]
All I'd like right wing slime ball stuff?

[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.140]
Is that all they got?

[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.760]
Well, they got Mark Larson.

[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.780]
What do you want to call it?

[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.660]
He's their token like a liberal, right?

[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.020]
Yeah, his Loucott, the ideal world, no compassion.

[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.660]
Yeah.

[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.040]
And they got a real entertaining.

[00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.700]
They got one?

[00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.160]
Sir.

[00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.820]
Yes?

[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.960]
J. Mervin.

[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.620]
Yeah, I heard about him.

[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.980]
Yeah, I heard he's like a disciple of that right wing.

[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.420]
And I heard he talks about me all the time.

[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.320]
He hates me like poison.

[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.980]
Well, he's not like that.

[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.080]
And I've never even met him yet.

[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.240]
He's another one.

[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.020]
Another one.

[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.500]
Yeah.

[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.160]
Okay.

[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.500]
You only Jew on the West Coast.

[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.620]
He's a Jew and a right winger?

[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.680]
He's probably a he's proud of it.

[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.000]
Yeah.

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.240]
Yeah.

[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.180]
Well, keep up the good work.

[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.100]
Hey, listen, we're going to check for sure and find out.

[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.720]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.280]
And we finally got some good radio up here.

[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.020]
Thanks a lot, buddy.

[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.020]
Yeah, bye-bye.

[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.280]
Yeah, they're piping us right into arcadeio, by the way.

[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.600]
Probably it's past noon on 610 News Talk Radio, W-I-O-D.

[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.920]
Well, that wasn't right.

[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.420]
Okay.

[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.740]
I had all the right words and not the right order, George.

[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.160]
God, we got to give a little cue to our friends up there.

[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.020]
They're a little slow.

[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.420]
And what is it?

[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.700]
News Talk, whatever it is.

[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.380]
Tonight at 6, it's Sports Talk 6 Gens.

[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.580]
How Ford is most listened to's board show.

[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.920]
News Talk Radio 6, Tim.

[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.780]
Tim, would you want your team?

[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.120]
Ben, Ben, Bites.

[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:04.920]
O.

[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.420]
When you were a child, your mother told you to clean your plate

[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.420]
because there were people starving in India.

[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.400]
You always wondered what good it would do.

[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.100]
The fact is, it makes those starving people feel a whole lot better

[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.400]
to know that you're not letting food go to waste.

[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.620]
Food that they could eat.

[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.760]
The clean plate notification bureau can help.

[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.880]
Every time you clean your plate,

[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.300]
the clean plate notification bureau will let a starving family know about it.

[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.140]
Just imagine the smiles on their grimy, gong faces

[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.700]
when they hear you've eaten all your dinner.

[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.700]
Oh, can you round everybody?

[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.760]
It's a letter from the clean plate notification bureau.

[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.380]
Oh, what did it say?

[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.420]
It's just little to be Christmas.

[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.580]
And can you know how clean these plates every night last week?

[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:53.800]
Even the people.

[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.980]
Oh, I think they thought I had me.

[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.920]
Oh, look, they sent the clean plate.

[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.060]
I even think it.

[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.620]
You make sure it's clean all the way.

[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.320]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.600]
It's just funny, the plate.

[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.920]
You and the clean plate notification bureau can do a world of good.

[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.880]
A third world of good.

[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.460]
1217 to WIOD on a momentous Monday man,

[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.000]
a day that just kind of makes you twitch inside.

[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.140]
Here's a lady in Sebastian.

[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.260]
Oh, yay.

[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.000]
Yay.

[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.520]
How you doing?

[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.240]
So excited.

[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.120]
We were sitting up here looking over the beach and we heard you on the radio.

[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.400]
And it was like, yeah, absolutely excellent.

[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.320]
It was like, yes?

[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.500]
Yeah, it was like, yes.

[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.240]
You know, made the day perfect.

[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:32.960]
Well, that's great.

[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:33.540]
Yeah.

[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.200]
Like, yeah.

[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:35.840]
Like, wow.

[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.580]
Like, wow.

[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.680]
Like, holy crap.

[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.220]
Well, I don't want to get that old bitch in Sarasota.

[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.060]
So all of a, she turned it off already, right?

[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.540]
We can have a good time now.

[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.400]
She tuned it out.

[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.520]
Well, I love the guy.

[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.460]
She's busy taking her peanut butter animal now.

[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.380]
I love the guy that was threatening you.

[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.440]
I thought, oh, my God, I thought Hitler's son was dead.

[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:51.860]
Yeah.

[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.320]
Yeah.

[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.140]
That was the Joseph Gerbels Jr. by the way.

[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.920]
Anyway, you're making me smile when it's wonderful.

[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.060]
Well, that's what it's all about.

[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.480]
I know, and I really appreciate it.

[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.100]
You can't have a little smile in your piles.

[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.960]
Then what the hell's it where you know, these people with no sense of humor that are so

[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.680]
uptight and are so psychotic just relax.

[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.000]
My God.

[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.400]
50 million years from now, who's going to give a damn about any of this, right?

[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:12.700]
Well, yeah.

[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.120]
And I wanted to tell you too, you know, when you were talking about the governor.

[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:15.660]
Yeah.

[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.080]
Well, down here we call him the Prince of Prozac.

[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.500]
Yeah.

[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.360]
Down here we call him a brain dead asshole is what we call him.

[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:22.880]
We do.

[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.560]
He's pathetic.

[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.980]
Oh, we don't want gambling.

[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.840]
We don't want this.

[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.320]
We don't want it.

[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.340]
We just want all your money.

[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.140]
That's all we want.

[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.220]
Let's close up the schools.

[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.240]
Let's, I mean, this guy is incredible.

[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.760]
He is, and well, I happen to be a teacher and he really isn't.

[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.380]
What a Yahoo!

[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.620]
Governor Bumpkin, man.

[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:36.800]
Yeah.

[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.980]
We should have seen him coming.

[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.460]
Well, I think we did, but, you know, everybody just thought it wouldn't exist.

[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:42.920]
Yeah.

[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.640]
Anyway, I wonder.

[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.400]
One good thing I love about politics in America is we always get real good choices, you know.

[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.280]
That's my favorite part, yeah.

[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.280]
Yeah.

[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.120]
Well, listen.

[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.060]
Well, listen.

[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.000]
Have a great day.

[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.820]
Okay, listen, and thanks very much.

[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.260]
You made my heart pound.

[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.740]
You gave me a little bit of a, we were body ratchets.

[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.400]
Just excellent.

[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.360]
Don't say rush.

[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.880]
Have a great day.

[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.500]
Okay, thanks.

[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.040]
Bye-bye.

[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.700]
1219 at WIOD.

[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.400]
We have an open line in dayed 751.

[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.760]
The out of town line is just waiting on you now, baby.

[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.700]
We're waiting on you.

[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.160]
Toil-free.

[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.340]
That means we pay.

[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.800]
We pay for you to call us and say something.

[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.080]
Nice or say something nasty.

[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:20.920]
How do you like that?

[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.900]
What an offer that is.

[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.900]
When somebody else is going to pay for your insolence and disgusting diet tribes,

[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.840]
what, how can you get an offer like that except a company owned by a bunch of dummies?

[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.620]
1-800-944-WIOD.

[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.320]
1-800-944-WIOD.

[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.500]
Yeah, hello?

[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:40.420]
Yeah?

[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:40.860]
Yeah.

[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.300]
I'm in Central Florida.

[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.680]
They call Watchula.

[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.520]
Watchula, I know that.

[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.780]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.800]
Yeah, I'll just go up and back.

[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.500]
I'll go and call spring, then go to back.

[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.540]
And I turn the radio and I always get a set on 610.

[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.500]
You must have just about driven right into the thing, huh?

[00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.480]
I pulled over.

[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.320]
I'm at some Bristol Yahoo store here.

[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:02.780]
Yeah.

[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.600]
And I called you.

[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.260]
I can believe it.

[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.340]
It's just amazing, isn't it?

[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.080]
Today, Florida, tomorrow, the world.

[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.340]
I heard that bitch from Sarah Soda.

[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:11.760]
Yeah.

[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.640]
I mean, I mean, I had a...

[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.820]
She's a little upset her bag dried up.

[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.320]
Yeah.

[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:19.960]

[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.760]
Well, anyway, I just set the stop and call you before I just couldn't believe it.

[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.320]
Well, get the hell out of that place.

[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.280]
That's my best device.

[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:28.800]

[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.400]
All right.

[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:29.940]
Yeah.

[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.740]
Have a great trip.

[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.020]
Call to say, you know, unbelievable.

[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:33.840]
Okay.

[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.400]
All right.

[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:34.720]
Take care.

[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.280]
See ya.

[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:37.960]
Unbelievable.

[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.440]
From La Chula to Inverness.

[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.280]
From Immaculate to Englewood.

[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.240]
From like the Bowls on Dale Maybury.

[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.960]
Can I ask a stupid question?

[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.760]
I don't want to suggest that some of the powers that be over there on the West Coast are as stupid as our people down here.

[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.620]
How can Dale Maybury, you know, when you're on the expressway down there?

[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.960]
And the sign says, east and west.

[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.480]
And under the...

[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.300]
It says like east, southbound, west, northbound.

[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.240]
How can it...

[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.180]
First of all, it's a road that goes north and south.

[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.320]
You know Dale Maybury in Tampa?

[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.880]
It's like one of the main drags of St. Amazon and out west there.

[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.960]
And like, it goes north and south.

[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.840]
See it? I just said out west because I got sucked into the same mentality.

[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.360]
How can it say east and west on the signs?

[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.900]
And on the same signs, it says northbound and southbound.

[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.880]
1221 on News Talk.

[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.220]
Radio 610, WIOD.

[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.540]
There's plenty of baseball action this weekend right here.

[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.520]
Join us Saturday and Sunday for the best American and National League game.

[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.220]
WIOD.

[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.360]
I have no cavities. I have no teeth.

[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.380]
1225 at WIOD.

[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.320]
A lot of people, we were asking during the break, some of us in the hallway, some of us degenerates.

[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.080]
How come they have like steak and shake and burn steakhouse?

[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.300]
And a lot of great eating places over there that we don't have here.

[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.800]
They're not steak and shakes over here.

[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.080]
And the reason being that most of the people in this part of the state have their teeth in a glass.

[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.700]
So when your customers are going to come in and gum the food, it doesn't need to be like that.

[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.000]
Okay?

[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.900]
Anyway, I have a cart that I've been threatening to play if I ever got a hold of it.

[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.260]
But needless to say, was never going to get it from inside the building.

[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.900]
Number one, requested piece of material the last two weeks, the call I made from the hospital to Rick and Suds.

[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:38.900]
And one of our great listeners, K by Brands Mart Saturday, headed on cassette and, you know, our listening audience is so far ahead of the inside here.

[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.020]
It's like day and night.

[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:50.160]
And so when you listen now for the benefit of the new audience, I was in, I had that laparoscopic gallbladder surgery that's supposed to be a snap and you're in one day and you're out there.

[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.240]
All this other crap and these butchers, man, these butchers of medicine.

[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.860]
The same people, you notice by the way who are who never are at the forefront like the thing about MSG on 60 minutes last night.

[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.320]
Where are the doctors on that?

[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.700]
Oh, hey, we don't have time for food poisons.

[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.700]
We're too busy with drugs.

[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.900]
Okay, we're too busy writing prescriptions like for the governor.

[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:17.640]
And when you hear the sound quality of my voice on this call, you don't even, it doesn't take a proctologist to figure out that I felt like I was moments away from death.

[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.040]
Hello.

[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.220]
He's in right now while he's still alive.

[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.000]
I was just going to talk about you.

[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.080]
I don't have time to wait, okay?

[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.020]
I know you talk.

[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:33.960]
And this is like, yeah, and I am appealing to anybody out there who's got any ounce of insanity left in their body, something has got to be done.

[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.620]
And I'm not being meldramatic or cute to get me on.

[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.620]
I'm in Mount Sinai Hospital on the beach and I'm telling you that I'm never going to get out of this place alive.

[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.400]
Now for those who are missing, like a joke, yeah.

[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.840]
This ain't no joke, okay?

[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.860]
This is a joke about things like your health.

[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.640]
And these people are going to kill me.

[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.740]
I have never been through an experience like this.

[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.660]
I remember Bobby's to with the photographer from the herald years ago.

[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:02.960]
Yeah.

[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.740]
Who went into a local hospital for a very minor thing.

[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.160]
He didn't come out alive either.

[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.820]
And I keep thinking about that because this place is an insane asylum.

[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.280]
I have a physician who performed a surgery who thinks he's real cute and real flip.

[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.300]
And I can't get old because he's too busy making money doing other surgeries.

[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.040]
And I can't get an answer out of anybody in here.

[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:30.920]
And they keep coming up with wilder and wilder stories about pulmonary blood clots and about this and that and about internal bleeding.

[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.600]
Nobody has got an answer from anything in here.

[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.700]
Anybody that goes, I remember when I used to have Bob Mendelssohn on all the time,

[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.460]
who by the way, they also killed, he's dead.

[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.920]
Now, seriously, remember, he's talking about Mendelssohn.

[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.360]
He's talking about his uncle killed him.

[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.680]
You sound terrible.

[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:55.400]
And he's saying, don't go and I don't ever allow yourself to be in a hospital alone because you have to have somebody to fight for you.

[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.960]
And my good fat friend who is the one who advised me about what a great piece of cake the surgery was.

[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.920]
And a par of e-Juniors listening by the way, you're right, Olive Orleans lemon juice would have been a lot better than this.

[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.620]
Even if I stuck it up my butt.

[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.180]
Do you know how many stows you had?

[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.680]
That's not important.

[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.120]
I know.

[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:10.380]
I know.

[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.020]
I have to get over it in the younger.

[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.220]
The younger is the important because that's the doctor that I can't seem to get a hold of.

[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.660]
If I could tell your audience the stories of what's going on here since Friday, they would...

[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.520]
I'll try to. They blow their brains out right now.

[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.940]
Because if I had a gun here, I would do it.

[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.260]
And I'm not... I've been saying since Friday evening I will never get out of this place alive.

[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.940]
And I really believe that.

[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.280]
I have to hunger calling.

[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.960]
Oh, Dr. Runger is that. Maybe we ought to do it on the ear.

[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.080]
Wow.

[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.540]
All right, I'll get back...

[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:44.940]
All right.

[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.480]
Okay. Good luck.

[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.420]
I'll get back to you, Diana.

[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.460]
You talk about a way to get some fast service boy.

[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.340]
You notice how quick the doctor was on the phone?

[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.380]
And all of a sudden within the next 20 minutes there were all these PR people.

[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.520]
They were lined up for 20 city blocks.

[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.160]
Oh, hey, Mr. Rogers, how you doing?

[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.600]
I'm Mr. Joe PR and this is Suzy PR.

[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:05.500]
Yeah.

[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:07.660]
God.

[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:08.820]
How you doing?

[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.900]
I kept saying to everyone, I'm never getting out of this place alive.

[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.800]
And you can... What a sound in that voice, huh?

[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.260]
Was I like full of energy?

[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.920]
And the smell of fear and death?

[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.440]
You can smell it right over the radio.

[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.500]
Cooper City.

[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.960]
Yes. Welcome back, Neil. Good to...

[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.080]
I fooled him. Didn't I? I got out alive. How do you like that?

[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:34.080]
Right. When I came out here a few years ago, the headlines in the local tabloid paper was,

[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.860]
the Jew comes to Cooper City.

[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:36.580]
Right.

[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.360]
I know how they feel in service, so...

[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.040]
Oh, yeah. Wait till you see the Jew coming to Davey next week, man.

[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.380]
Right now, on horseback, like, Paul Reweer.

[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.580]
A couple of things I heard over the weekend.

[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.920]
I thought you'd kind of be interested, kind of,

[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.860]
go along with your supportive police or fascist state that we're in.

[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:55.220]
Yes.

[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:03.360]
I don't know about how reliable a source is, but approximately 25% of the workforce

[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.280]
is in some way shaped or form connected with the judicial system.

[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.120]
Yes.

[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:17.240]
And the other statement was that there are no black senators.

[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.640]
I don't know.

[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.220]
There's any correlation here.

[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:20.980]
Yeah.

[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.520]
But are you...

[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.720]
Well, I'll push you away that there are no black senators.

[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:26.720]
And...

[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.620]
And Chuck's a baseball fan.

[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.600]
Remember the Washington senators? I remember like...

[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:29.760]
What you're talking about?

[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.700]
Yes, your meal was white.

[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.100]
And Wayne Terwilliger was white.

[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.720]
And Camilla Pussquall and Pedro Ramos did a couple like token hispanics on there.

[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.840]
But no blacks, I don't think I'd have watched in senators.

[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.720]
No, no.

[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.260]
Right.

[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:44.980]
But I would like to know what kind of fight did Carl Lewis have with his boyfriend this past weekend?

[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.160]
Carl Lewis?

[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:46.860]
Yes.

[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.820]
He didn't make the Olympic...

[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.580]
Oh, he didn't make it?

[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.040]
No.

[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.900]
Oh, the ship it must not have come in yet.

[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.720]
The ship it must have had to come in?

[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.180]
Yeah.

[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.560]
Well, I was...

[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.720]
I thought that was kind of quite surprising.

[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.260]
And of course, it was a pretty strong rumor locally that how it's turned six to ten hour.

[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:03.820]
Yeah.

[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.360]
And I'm pumping that, man.

[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.280]
Pumping that.

[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.920]
And I'd like to call my wife...

[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.980]
In fact, Connie Francis and Carl Lewis are making a new one.

[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.040]
It's called Where the Roids Are.

[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:11.420]
Yes.

[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.380]
And I'd like to call my wife Sherry on Major Duce Pegg.

[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.180]
Okay.

[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.760]
And good to have you back.

[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.600]
And happy circus.

[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.680]
That's same to you.

[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.040]
Okay.

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.580]
1231 at WIOD.

[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.260]
We have an open line.

[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.840]
How come we haven't had it from like a whole bunch of Jewish people on a West Coast yet?

[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:26.700]
Huh?

[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.720]
Have they kicked them all out?

[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.180]
No, I remember when I was in Sarasota.

[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.100]
There were a few of my pizons over there, huh?

[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.080]
One or two?

[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.960]
Come on.

[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.120]
Two or three?

[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.120]
Seabring.

[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.240]
Yes, how you doing, Neil?

[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.080]
Fine business.

[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.640]
Fine business.

[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.160]
Johnny Meater.

[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:47.500]
No!

[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.680]
No!

[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.860]
You're absolutely right.

[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.340]
Are you cereal?

[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.720]
I was just...

[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.220]
I just mentioned your name within the last thirty minutes.

[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.160]
You won't believe that.

[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.300]
Is that right?

[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.580]
You won't believe what I said either.

[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.460]
No, you're just right.

[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.020]
No, because our chief engineer was here.

[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.860]
He told me about where SUN is.

[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:05.180]

[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.620]
And I said, you know, an old friend of mine, John Meater took me out there one time years ago,

[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.000]
and we drove to the end of the pier.

[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:11.780]
You remember where it was?

[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.180]
We were in the old million dollar pier.

[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:15.840]
Oh, that's not there anymore?

[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:16.440]
No.

[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.240]
They replaced it now with, I don't know what.

[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.500]
Like a new million dollar.

[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.800]
That was one of your favorite Jewish people on it.

[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.000]
Who was that?

[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.780]
High-evidence.

[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.120]
I don't remember that.

[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.440]
Oh, you have a much better memory for all that old crap.

[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.860]
You probably start talking about Wayne Wright.

[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.740]
Well, you know, our good one.

[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.140]
And who else?

[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.520]
Alice Short Scurts.

[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.660]
Rally Short Scurts.

[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.220]
Let's go back to Immarshall Michigan.

[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.580]
Man, those were the good days.

[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.300]
Yeah.

[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.900]
We had a lot of fun, didn't we?

[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.480]
We sure did.

[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.020]
Yeah.

[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.740]
Didn't make any money, but we sure had a lot of home.

[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.340]
We used to have dinner at wind shulers, there we go.

[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:48.580]

[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.400]
Oh, God was that a great guy.

[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.400]
Yeah, my wife Sharon used to feed us once in a while.

[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.240]
Your ex-wife Sharon used to feed us?

[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:54.460]
Yes.

[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.300]
She listens to everyone once in a while.

[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:56.840]
Where is she?

[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.720]
She's still in West Palm Beach.

[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.740]
Well, what do you owe in West Palm Beach?

[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.260]
That's right.

[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.460]
You were at WIRK.

[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.620]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a John Metre,

[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.660]
one of the great stars of radio

[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.840]
and like some of the smallest markets in history.

[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.960]
Seabring, Florida, and Marshall Michigan,

[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.760]
and LLB at Michigan.

[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:17.640]
Wait a minute.

[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.920]
Now you're in West Palm Beach.

[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.700]
You're on WS.

[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.080]
You are in St. Pete.

[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:21.660]
Right.

[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.740]
That's what I was at.

[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.720]
That's what I was at.

[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:24.860]
That's what I was at.

[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.580]
Great station.

[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.040]
Did you know that they're signal now that they get up to Tallahassee

[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.720]
and a two egg and Perry and LLB?

[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.400]
I think that's why I was there.

[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.000]
They did?

[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.020]
Oh yeah, absolutely.

[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.140]
Didn't help he did a John.

[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:36.720]
Hey, man.

[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.720]
Don't put Seabring down.

[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.700]
This is a beautiful place.

[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.420]
I love it here.

[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.300]
We had like two other calls from Seabring already this morning.

[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.340]
Well, you had some from Wanchula and Arcadia,

[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.300]
which you know the radio station I worked for.

[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.180]
It's signal covers that.

[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960]
And what was it?

[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:50.820]
I can't keep up.

[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.440]
What was the other one?

[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.140]
There are two stations here.

[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.340]
Our AM is all talked.

[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.300]
We have your favorite person on right now.

[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:57.800]
Rush Limbaugh.

[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.440]
Oh yeah.

[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:58.840]
Yeah.

[00:22:59.160 --> 00:22:59.980]
Heinrich and Drag.

[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:00.580]
Yeah.

[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.200]
Yeah.

[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.060]
It was all hard.

[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:02.740]
Yeah, right.

[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.300]
Our AM is talked 24 hours a day.

[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.440]
We were just sitting here deciding

[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.900]
should we put Neorodgers on.

[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.540]
There you go.

[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.740]
Now do something smart for once in your life, man.

[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.240]
Wait a minute.

[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.520]
One of the owners are standing here.

[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.460]
He said, no, no, no, no, John.

[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.580]
We want to keep our license.

[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.380]
No, I see.

[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.020]
But it was really great to hear you.

[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:18.620]
I can't hear you.

[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.680]
What do you got like a chicken crap owner up there in Seabring

[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.360]
was just no brains and no balls is that the deal?

[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:25.620]
God.

[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.500]
Not at all.

[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:27.840]
Not at all.

[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.160]
There's great people and I love it here.

[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:29.700]
Well, that's good.

[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.620]
He belongs in radio.

[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.900]
It's a perfect place for him.

[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:32.360]
What?

[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.980]
In fact, he ought to be a Cox Broadcasting, basically the same.

[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:35.560]
Who should?

[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.360]
You're whoever you're talking about.

[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:37.900]
I don't know.

[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.680]
Whatever his name is.

[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.200]
Well, right.

[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.000]
Oh, okay.

[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.400]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.640]
That was fine business, remember?

[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:42.980]
Right.

[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.720]
I do it when you said that while almost just like

[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.480]
dropped it right in the waist pass, could have.

[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.340]
I can't believe that.

[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.680]
Well, I called earlier and left a message with your receptionist

[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.900]
to give it to you that fine business call.

[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.060]
But I figured that I'd never be able to get through on this one.

[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.100]
John, I got news for you.

[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.780]
If you leave a message with our receptionist,

[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.360]
there's only one thing that's going to happen to it.

[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.200]
She's going to eat it.

[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.200]
Believe me.

[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.860]
Hey, Neil, it's really, really great hearing you again now that I can tune you in on

[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.400]
S.U.N. My old alma mater over there in St. Petersburg.

[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.560]
So how does S.U.N. come in and Seabring?

[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.140]
It comes in fine, fine business.

[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:12.800]
Fine business.

[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.140]
Yeah.

[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:13.680]
Great.

[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.080]
Hallelujah.

[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.560]
You can promote you because you're in competition now.

[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.160]
No, we're not.

[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.400]
What's it you have?

[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.600]
Oh, you have talk.

[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.520]
We got, yeah, we're talking 24 hours a day.

[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.940]
We got Rush Limbaugh on now.

[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.620]
Like I said, with a crap you got on what differences are we?

[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.200]
Hey, we probably have one of your heroes on here at three o'clock.

[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:32.840]
Who's that?

[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.180]
Alan Comes.

[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.500]
Who is that?

[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.680]
Alan Comes.

[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.280]
You know, I have one question, Neil.

[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:39.920]
That's the rumor.

[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:40.940]
Alan Comes it.

[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.380]
Yeah.

[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.700]
I have a question before we get off.

[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.000]
Yes.

[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.400]
Why do you take delay?

[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.680]
I mean, there couldn't possibly be anything said that you haven't already said.

[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.040]
Bye, bye, John.

[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.220]
Bye, bye, Neil.

[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:51.820]
See ya.

[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.260]
Okay.

[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:52.960]
See ya.

[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:53.920]
John meter.

[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:54.960]
Oh, man.

[00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:02.300]
All of a sudden it's like somebody pulled a plug on the animal bag and this opened up the whole state like a whole world.

[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.340]
All these new horizons that have opened to us.

[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.700]
And keep in mind, this is all by accident.

[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.500]
The only people who are hearing us today, it's like an accident.

[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.020]
It's just like WIOD.

[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.980]
Hey, ha, ha, ha.

[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.580]
The only people who discover us, it's by accident because we're sure never going to get any promotion over here.

[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.860]
1236 on News Talk Radio 610, WIOD.

[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:27.260]

[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.100]
News Talk Radio 610.

[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:32.880]
WIOD.

[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.040]
Hey!

[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.960]
Excuse me.

[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:47.900]
Yes?

[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.820]
One of those bukkoboi genes down around your ankles?

[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.780]
Why, yes, they are!

[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.160]
Bukkoboi genes.

[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.280]
Available at FineStores Everywhere.

[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.660]
1240 at W.I.V.D. Why are we stuck on such a bad run in Sarasota? Hello?

[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.200]
I have a nice day.

[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.480]
Okay. South Miami. Hello?

[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.080]
Yeah.

[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:38.780]
Oh, I saw your favorite big lip bitch on TV, uh, over on the west coast. It seems like, uh,

[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.400]
your buddies next door at the coast have a new radio station over the whole cloud to shore.

[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:44.560]
The shore?

[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.460]
The shore.

[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:46.400]
Are you cereal?

[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.200]
I'm cereal.

[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.360]
What is that?

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:53.100]
Oh, wait a minute. Let's see. Do we have an FM as a W-W-R-M warm?

[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.060]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.120]
Where was the shore?

[00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:00.060]
Do you realize that that station is number two in the market in Tampa, St. Pete?

[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.940]
Right behind the FM Country Kickin' Station?

[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:03.680]
Yes.

[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.620]
W-W-W-W-R-M, the shore.

[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.260]
The shore?

[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.920]
Are they playing the slush over there, too?

[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:14.160]
I don't know. I refuse to listen. I just saw a TV commercial with her big ol' lips and coming listen to us.

[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.380]
Oh, you mean that bitch that's on the TV spot?

[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:16.660]
Yeah!

[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.300]
Oh, she don't know whether she's on the coast or the shore.

[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.280]
She didn't arrest her on Uranus.

[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.200]
Not on the line.

[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.480]
She didn't know what planet she's on.

[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.320]
Anyway, listen.

[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.160]
Oh, W-W-R-M, the shore.

[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.980]
Well, you're having such a problem with these people over there.

[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:31.440]
Yes.

[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.600]
You're not married to your sister right there.

[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.660]
Right. That's right.

[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.400]
That's a whole thing.

[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.560]
And I don't have no sheep in the backyard either.

[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.260]
No sheep?

[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.280]
No real well.

[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:40.620]
Yeah.

[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:48.220]
No, could you play the Country Music, um, the two guys that have the little verses out of the Country Music?

[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:49.520]
No, I'm talking about that.

[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.220]
You mean the Country Music Song Titles?

[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:51.740]
Yeah.

[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.520]
Well, where the hell am I going to find that?

[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.560]
Well, that's...

[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.640]
You've probably got a...

[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.920]
Well, I'll dig real deep, okay?

[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.720]
Oh, I'll do it in a really thruster vibe.

[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.860]
That'll do it over there on Radio Sun, man.

[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:02.440]
You glad?

[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.020]
Okay.

[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.580]
I'll go to it.

[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.140]
Bye-bye.

[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.520]
Here's a line from the song.

[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.480]
It took a hell of a man to take my hand, but it sure didn't take him long.

[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.520]
I liked that.

[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:17.860]
Yeah.

[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:22.300]
She ain't much to see, but she looks good through the bottom of a glass.

[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.080]
I've heard that one.

[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.220]
That's a good one.

[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.020]
I wouldn't take you to a dogfight, even if I thought you could win.

[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.780]
Don't cry down my back, baby.

[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.340]
You might rust my spurs.

[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.440]
If fingerprints showed up on skin, I wonder who's I'd find on you.

[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.160]
Here's a good one.

[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.340]
If you get the feeling that I don't love you, feel again.

[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:58.820]
Here's one.

[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.740]
Obviously, there's some guy singing this song, and he's in some cheap,

[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.840]
flusy bedroom at the time.

[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.480]
I'm ashamed to be here, but not ashamed enough to believe.

[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.500]
That guy to sum up our situation here at WLS too.

[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.940]
I've ashamed to be here, but not ashamed enough to leave.

[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:27.880]
We'll just take the money.

[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:28.420]
Thank you.

[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.840]
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart.

[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.900]
Oh, I want to hear it.

[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.080]
You really wonder about guys who write lyrics like this.

[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.880]
You don't know how much drink they've been doing.

[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.020]
It's the bottle against the Bible and the battle for Daddy's soul.

[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.200]
Here's what I really like.

[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.120]
It's Commode Huggin' Time in the Valley.

[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:23.840]
If you want to keep the beer real cold, put it next to my ex-wife's heart.

[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.280]
My wife ran off with my best friend, and I miss him.

[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:42.840]
Okay, Larry Lou Jack, little Tommy from WLS on one of their for charity type albums stuff like we do.

[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.120]
I just thought I'd mention that so that all the people over there all those new people.

[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:51.480]
I had Slurry Lou Jack, WLS, yeah, that's where your boy went over there.

[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.200]
That's where the great hope of Tampa Bay went, Bob Lasseter.

[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:54.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.040]
To WLS, God has asked fire it up there because he forgot all Niels' material.

[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.660]
Let's do a Naples.

[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:00.980]
Hello.

[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:02.900]
Naples.

[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.620]
Speak to us.

[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.780]
What do you want to say?

[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.460]
I want to say, how you doing?

[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:08.500]
Yihaw.

[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.420]
I'm one of these Yihaw's from Avon Park.

[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:11.940]
You always thought?

[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.940]
Avon Park, one of America's.

[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.540]
Do they still have that German restaurant there?

[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.660]
That's in South Lake Wales.

[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.440]
That is the Black Forest?

[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:21.300]
The Black Forest.

[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.180]
That's a good place.

[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.440]
Yeah, I heard you talking about it one time several months ago.

[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.000]
You could probably throw like a brick from where you are there, right?

[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.020]
You could peek that far.

[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:28.480]
Yeah.

[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:31.580]
Yeah.

[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.500]
What's the deal with the delay on here?

[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:34.380]
What do you mean by that?

[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:39.780]
Well, I got my walkman on me and I can hear the delay and then...

[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.140]
Yeah.

[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:40.680]
Here he was.

[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.700]
That's when nobody gets the old one.

[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.860]
Oh, in other words, when you were on hold, so somebody says crap that we just like dump it out.

[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.400]
I don't know.

[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.100]
Because we don't want no vulgarities on the way.

[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.180]
We don't want nobody saying crap on the ear, sir.

[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.360]
You don't want to offend the ass.

[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.240]
We don't want to offend all those old farts over there in Sarasoto.

[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.200]
Okay, so we want to make sure that nobody says s*** on the ear, okay?

[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.720]
That's right. We want to hear some murals.

[00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.400]
Damn straight.

[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.280]
All right.

[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.600]
You had a good day now, buddy.

[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.580]
I got pulled over there by the old police this morning, too.

[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.440]
I just want to let you know that.

[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.760]
You mean they're doing it over there?

[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.160]
They're doing it here.

[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.520]
They're doing it up in the name of the park.

[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.360]
The parkers are outpooks.

[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.020]
The park patrol.

[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.100]
Well, listen, don't forget those pig reports.

[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.340]
We want to start doing this all over the state, okay?

[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.060]
Hey, I think we ought to.

[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:20.900]
All right.

[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:21.840]
Get some speed.

[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:22.560]
Okay.

[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:23.540]
You got it, buddy.

[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.120]
Bye-bye.

[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:24.620]
Bye.

[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:26.780]
12.

[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.420]
Oh, God.

[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.880]
Oh, is there hope for the human race?

[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.440]
He asked.

[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.060]
1246 at WIOD.

[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.340]
We have an open line on that new out of town like God.

[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.560]
It is smoking, man.

[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.260]
It's smoking.

[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.760]
We had John meter.

[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.400]
I forgot to ask Johnny meter about the old fun seeker.

[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.280]
What's Bill Gray doing now?

[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.080]
Don't call back, John.

[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:46.820]
Call me another day.

[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.260]
We'll talk about the fun seeker.

[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.320]
From battle creek.

[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.640]
Oh, God, man.

[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.960]
We have to get some inside stuff that nobody will have any idea what we're talking about.

[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.380]
For Lauderdale.

[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.180]
Hey, how's it going?

[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:57.700]
Gray.

[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.660]
Best show in three years.

[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:06.420]
It's about time they opened up our horizons and kept us from this imprisonment in this little Yahoo corner of the world, right?

[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.260]
You got it.

[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:07.840]
You got it.

[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.440]
Y'all know what's going on now.

[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.580]
I don't think I'd say hi to the more, never mind.

[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.040]
To what?

[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.840]
Okay, couldn't handle it.

[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.300]
Just faded out of the pressure.

[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.660]
1247 at W.Y.

[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.300]
No, wait a minute.

[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:24.960]
Let me say it again.

[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.800]
1247 at News Talk Radio 610 W.Y.O.D.

[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.940]
The opinions expressed in this program are not necessarily those of 610 W.Y.O.D.

[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.680]
Red Sponsors.

[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.320]
I got a facts.

[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.940]
I got a facts from one of our spies in Tampa Bay.

[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.240]
Now, we had the wrong info on Jay Marvin, by the way.

[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.760]
Somebody gave you some bum information, George, because it says here he's not the right wing.

[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:50.480]
He's left wing.

[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.600]
Actually, an okay guy.

[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.340]
The best thing FLA has gone for it.

[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.380]
Two issue oriented so the show can be boring.

[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.220]
Best feature regularly attacks racist Republicans and other neo-Nazis.

[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.440]
We love you, Jay.

[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.660]
Even though you hate me like poison, you're okay.

[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.380]
Yeah.

[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.420]
We think.

[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:07.880]
Let's see.

[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.360]
Mornings.

[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.980]
They got Al Gardner and company, a weak plastic Nambi Pambi guy who clips the

[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.700]
Tampa Tribune the same Pete Times in USA today and repeats their articles on the air.

[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:17.840]
Yeah.

[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.900]
There you go.

[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.640]
It says this city at once claimed that listeners should throw their newspapers away to long,

[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.440]
laborious interviews, redeeming feature none.

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.760]
Midday Mark Larson.

[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.780]
It says this ding dong owns a radio production company and once worked on the pig, the power pig.

[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.120]
WFLZ.

[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.860]
Couldn't make it at the pig.

[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.220]
So, Jay Korsave this loyal backstabbing employees job by throwing him on the AM.

[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.380]
It says he really does put his hand behind his rear ear when he talks, etc. etc.

[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.200]
Midday rush fat right wing slime ball.

[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.440]
Afternoons Lionel.

[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:57.600]
An attorney who used to call in on the weekends got a weekend gig because he was so talented

[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.960]
and had such a beautiful voice.

[00:34:59.340 --> 00:34:59.480]
Not.

[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.900]
And then full time.

[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.060]
It says obviously his practice wasn't going so well, talent rating for redeeming feature none.

[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.840]
And then about Jay Marvin that we were wrong about except he hits me like poison which is fun because he's jealous.

[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:19.660]
And then the best part it says it also says the rest of the night tape playback of Bush Bingbang and Bruce Williams as are the weekends.

[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.340]
Oh, and I was wrong.

[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.140]
WWRM is warm.

[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.700]
The shore is like in four meyers or something that somebody else.

[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.020]
So don't get them confused.

[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.620]
Get the coast and the warmth and the shore all in the right spots.

[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.780]
Okay, like get warm.

[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.100]
But here comes the best part.

[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.540]
It says on this facts from our spy in Tampa.

[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.820]
Remember that Jay Kors is getting set to go under.

[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.620]
Oh, it's 140 million dollars worth of debt is callable in August.

[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.520]
The company's assets total to more than 125 million.

[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.980]
So it won't be long.

[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.800]
Oh, now that's I'm just repeating what's in the facts.

[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.420]
I don't know that to be true or not, right?

[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.180]
That Jay Kors is going bust.

[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.740]
And then all the people at WFLA will be lined up at crystal.

[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.920]
Man, 1254 at WIOD.

[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.900]
Let's go to Tamarack.

[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:08.200]
Hello.

[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.260]
Yeah, Neil. How you doing?

[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.760]
Maybe this move of ours will help like put him over the edge.

[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.300]
Pretty good.

[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.280]
Yeah, first of all, for the old bag in Sao and Sao Astoda who called up earlier.

[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.600]
No, but you know she's not listening anymore much, right?

[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.240]
The question is, Afro, Afro, Afro there.

[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.440]
I had to get that out of my system after hearing her.

[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.400]
And she was complaining about the vulgar language.

[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.360]
Boy, she's probably sitting on the radio now.

[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.440]
I wouldn't be surprised.

[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.220]
I listened to that.

[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.160]
Thru's Bing Bang is on another station in Tampa Bay area too.

[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.880]
A BRD in Bradenton.

[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.740]
The big bird in Bradenton that carries the pirates games at least they used to.

[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.560]
Yeah, and I figure at 1420 in the town, they're probably just as powerful or maybe...

[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.580]
They're like about six watts because I know when I worked in Sao and had back in those days.

[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.580]
It was a Pirates fan.

[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.680]
And I used to try to hear the big bird at night.

[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.280]
And I used to have to drive halfway from Sao Astoda to Bradenton to hear it at all.

[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.100]
Yeah, I didn't know if they were comparable to the light bulb or not.

[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.220]
Yeah, very similar.

[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.880]
And when you mention the shore, I think the Arran Fort My is there at 94.5 FM.

[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.860]
They're called as WCVU.

[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.960]
And when they get the term shore out of those call it is I have no idea.

[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.740]
Maybe Dinos sits on the transmitter.

[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.540]
That is a possibility.

[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.780]
The brunels.

[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.480]
And judging from some of the calls you've gotten from the Tampa St. Pete area,

[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:26.700]
if you any wonder why they didn't get a baseball team, the big thing now...

[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.460]
Yeah, we got the Marlins by the way.

[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.660]
We got the Marlins.

[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.820]
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:31.540]
I shouldn't say that.

[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.240]
Yeah, and where do they have the Giants?

[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.580]
They'll probably get the Giants, man.

[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.380]
They'll probably get an established team with Matt Williams and that ugly Will Clark

[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.660]
and Roger pardon me from an Aqualma Crague.

[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.400]
Yeah, but yeah, what they're doing now is a sundome.

[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.700]
I think it's now the World's Lodge.

[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.500]
I just tracked the puller, and I think that's the only thing that saves that...

[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.740]
Well, they are pulling over there.

[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.760]
Believe me what I tell you.

[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.120]
Okay, okay, I'm just about out of material.

[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.180]
But before I go, for all the Yahoo's in a Tampa and St. Pete who are listening,

[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.180]
I think you should throw on Blue Job if you have that,

[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.960]
or my wife left town with a banana.

[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.280]
Or sometimes I feel for a country person.

[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.000]
Yeah, God, are you just emotionally like a basket case.

[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.820]
This is probably the most exciting thing that's happened to us in years, right?

See, we think it's the most exciting thing that happened over there, but we're wrong.

[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.000]
This is the most exciting thing that's happened for us,

[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.360]
because you think it's boring over there, man.

[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.860]

[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:49.060]
