[00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.540]
Wait a minute, what just happened here?

[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.920]
Oh, here's another torn cart.

[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.460]
Okay, so we now have people who are coming in here and ripping the carts.

[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.320]
Okay, here's another cart with the tape ripped in the middle of it.

[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.720]
And now at this point it ceases to be humorous.

[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.120]
The best of Rogers continues in minutes on News Talk Radio 610 WIO.

[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.000]
Alan, everybody can't stand and pin in the ass-dresener.

[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.840]
Exactly.

[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.060]
Yeah, what about him?

[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.240]
You remember when you had a bunch of people out from Cooper City?

[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.740]
Yeah.

[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.660]
Well, I was over your house.

[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.940]
Well, it's not exciting.

[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.620]
Yeah.

[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.200]
Yeah.

[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.340]
You had about 700 other people.

[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.740]
Exactly, we had a great time.

[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.420]
Yeah, well, I'm glad I couldn't take that.

[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.580]
I could only have five years later, but you know, I'm just calling to thank you.

[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.520]
Well, you're sure welcome.

[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.940]
Yeah.

[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.580]
I think you can do it again.

[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.520]
What?

[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.020]
I think you can do it again sometimes?

[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.600]
No chance.

[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.200]
No.

[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.600]
No.

[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.160]
No.

[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.360]
Don't.

[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.180]
Call up Tanner, he'll have you over.

[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.240]
Who are these people and where have they come from?

[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.520]
That is the question of the day, folks.

[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.260]
Who the hell are they and who the hell needs them?

[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.780]
Oh, no.

[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.720]
Your show really blows.

[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.460]
No, no, no, no.

[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.380]
Oh, no, no, no.

[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.940]
Oh, no, no, no.

[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.600]
Oh, no, no, no.

[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.320]
Oh, no, no.

[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.600]
Your show really blows.

[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.260]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.640]
Oh, no, no, no.

[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.220]
Oh, no, no, no.

[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.840]
Oh, no, no, no.

[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.840]

[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.840]

[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.840]

[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.840]

[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.680]
Your show really blows.

[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.320]
Oh, no, no.

[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.320]

[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.100]

[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.980]
Oh, no.

[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.420]

[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.960]
Oh, no.

[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.960]

[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.960]

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.000]

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.000]

[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.240]
Oh, no.

[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.420]
Shakey, shakey, shakey.

[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.000]
Oh, no, no.

[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.460]
Your show really blows.

[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.780]
Oh, no, no.

[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.320]
I say, do a show really blows.

[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.240]
Oh, no, no.

[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.200]
I say, do a show really blows.

[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.280]
It's hot.

[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.900]
We have one open line in date.

[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.460]
I'm probably the worst show in the history of broadcasting

[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.600]
and I'm really proud of it.

[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.320]
I say it's funny that it comes on the day after we discovered

[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.600]
that Joey is back in town.

[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.200]
You think it?

[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.120]
Now Joey is on WSPR in Bokas that the rumor now.

[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.040]
The other day we had him on Super Surf and he was also on

[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.180]
like every station that's ever been invented.

[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.480]
And now all of a sudden he's on WSPR in Bokas.

[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.320]
Whatever the deal is, the bad news is Joey's back

[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.040]
and we're paying a wicked price for it.

[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.160]
Well, I'd like to know who died and made near Rajiv.

[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.600]
There are more cancers of WIOT and all these imploidy

[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.440]
and a world of people of the state of New York

[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.040]
and of the state of Florida when his only claim to fame

[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.060]
is two flea bags and a covert.

[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.640]
Go lay under your Mustang and leave me alone with your punk.

[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.280]
I'm getting like catching my breath from that tremendous assault

[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.300]
on my system from Barbara Slim Foods.

[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.820]
I want to make sure we give her lots of plugs

[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.860]
and mention the name frequently down there in Kendall on sunset.

[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.920]
Oh, Bob-Wah.

[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.080]
What you've done to me?

[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.780]
Why you do this to me, Demi?

[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.380]
You're listening to the best of Rajiv's on News Talk radio.

[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.760]
Six.

[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.180]
I thought we're playing golf here.

[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.320]
It sounds like the skins game, as Jack Nicholas would say.

[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.680]
We have an open-eyed at Broward.

[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.260]
I can't, I mean, golf is just so the skins game.

[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.200]
There's just something about it.

[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.280]
If I get started on golf,

[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.360]
or near you'll drive off the road.

[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.940]
He's probably on a way.

[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.780]
See, it's good, though, that we got a station.

[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.520]
That's like diverse and perverse.

[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.160]
I mean, renearies into golf and what else?

[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.340]
What else does he like?

[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.360]
Drinking?

[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.140]
And the nose picking.

[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.920]
I mean, he's those are mainly, you know, that's Mike.

[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.620]
And then I'm like into horse racing and plunging my guts out.

[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.160]
And a few other things.

[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.800]
And Rick is into like skiing.

[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.940]
And what else?

[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.160]
Huh?

[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.100]
Politics.

[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.040]
And politics.

[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.320]
Yeah!

[00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.140]
1035 at WIOC.

[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.880]
So what are you doing with your life?

[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.220]
Getting up, fighting the truer.

[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.900]
My soup.

[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.880]

[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.040]

[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.600]

[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.600]

[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.600]

[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.020]
I'm the same thing as I'm the girl

[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.240]
I'm the same thing as I'm the girl

[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.600]
I'm the same thing as I'm the girl

[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.620]
I'm the same thing as I'm the girl

[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.900]
Sleazy little girl

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.540]
In the fatty man

[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.520]
You have the money now

[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.180]
So go and change your arms

[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.720]
Shreds me little girl

[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.300]
You're gonna lose them the chance

[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.360]
If you would, any clothes on you

[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.600]
No, I won't last, she always wear

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.760]
I'm the one stockings

[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.960]
So I need old bras

[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.900]
Like a lingerie that far mid in a Kmart store

[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.780]
We're gonna use this bag like Chacha Gabor

[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.160]
You're just another $50 whole world

[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.160]
And a little carried away there, I don't think so

[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.720]
10.41 at WIOD

[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.740]
I think we're gonna bid farewell to our line, the cleaner here

[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.860]
Hey, I'll let you go

[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.180]
I think you've been holding it far too long

[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.320]
Longer than the law allows

[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.680]
I really want to thank you, cheer up my day

[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.660]
Well, have a great day

[00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.000]
And by the way, definitely uncut is the way to go

[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.900]
Put you up

[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.060]
See you later

[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.340]
Okay, we got a PIVI port and a Ford Lauderdale, let's get right to it

[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.000]
Hey, Neal, what's up?

[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.840]
Listen, I'm heading north down on I-95

[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.340]
Yes sir, about a mile south of 595

[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.240]
There's one on the Sterling Road bridge

[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.460]
And he's sitting up on top

[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.340]
And he's calling out to the other guys

[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.580]
There's 11 of them out there

[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.900]
11 of them out there

[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.100]
You'll be very excited to know that yesterday

[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.300]
Governor Bumpkin signed a bill that bars the Florida Highway Patrol

[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.880]
And other police agencies from setting ticket quotas

[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.800]
That's the one that Rick and Suds have been talking about for weeks

[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.360]
The Governor Bumpkin signed it

[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.980]
And obviously it's having a real big impact

[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.580]
They're taking things into their own hands

[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.820]
Yeah, they are taking it into their hands

[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.460]
But the thing of it is, you don't see the guy sitting up there on top

[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.900]
And he's pointing the gun right at you

[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.780]
I'm calling to work on 75 this morning

[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.800]
And there was an FHP porker

[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.600]
Like, burrowed in, there's like a clump of trees

[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.460]
Like an median and one strip there up north of Sheridan Street

[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.680]
And he's like burrowed in there

[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.200]
Just with his nose sticking out so we can stick his thing out

[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.900]
And you know, pick up everybody on the radar

[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.280]
What a slime ball

[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.440]
Yeah, right

[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.620]
No quotas and no hiding, not

[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.860]
All right, hey, all you guys from maybe some pilots are going to do this back

[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.380]
Thank you, honey

[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.360]
See you

[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.180]
Yep, no quotas, so now they're just doing it for the fun of it

[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.020]
Because there are a bunch of sadistic pigs who want to make your life miserable like I've always said

[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.820]
They're not, you know, they're not fooling anybody

[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.920]
Hoped line and brown, 524WIOD, man, my aim is so clogged up now

[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.160]
Thank God that Ponytail is going to get that soup

[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.860]
Because it's obvious that Denibirk one more time, just totally

[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.020]
Totally couldn't get the job done

[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.920]
What a, what a loser, Tom

[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.340]
I mean, you look in the mirror and you see this pathetic little wimpy image

[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.060]
And you say the look of an absolute total loser and that's little Tommy D

[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.420]
But he's proud of it

[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.340]
Miami

[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.000]
And he's a Metz fan, yes

[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.560]
I got this connected

[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.140]
Can hear you, hello?

[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.460]
There we go, a little louder

[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.820]
Yeah, I got this connected yesterday

[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.220]
From?

[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.100]
Well, I was talking to you and started telling you the story about the crop

[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.020]
And he was around and told me

[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.900]
No, you didn't get to disconnect it, you blurted out the S word, sir, and I had to disconnect your call

[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.840]
Because you used some intemperate language here on 16th your family station

[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.440]
Oh, they're my apologies to your audience

[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.000]
Right, so just say crap

[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.580]
I'm sorry without, because I'm sure you're going to like the end

[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.180]
I like the end?

[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.980]
You're going to like the end of the story

[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.480]
Okay, well I tell him what kind of crap is this?

[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:26.940]
There you go

[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.240]
Okay, I can use that one, right?

[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.480]
And he says, hey, it's no crap, I said, I said, Tom

[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.340]
You know what I think about this crap and I just flip my hip over and fart it

[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:38.860]
Really?

[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.880]
I just farted and he goes

[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.480]
You're disgusting ass

[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.000]
Where do you officer are rescuing me for passing gas?

[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.420]
Yeah, oh yeah

[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.040]
Governor just signed that podium yesterday to us the new farting bill

[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.420]
But did you like my little um, uh, what you call it now?

[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.360]
You're a little, what you call it?

[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.200]
No, remember when I told you

[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.180]
Yeah, uh, gone

[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.900]
Wait a minute, wait a minute, it's coming, it's coming

[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.620]
It's coming, yeah, I've heard that before

[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.160]
What? You're little what?

[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.100]
What's that guy name?

[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.140]
George? Yeah?

[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.100]
Okay, I told you the uh

[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.880]
God, I don't know man

[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.600]
Well hold on, hold on, I'm thinking about it, we'll come back to him, he's thinking about it

[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.940]
We have the star lines open if you have Bellsoft mobility

[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.940]
Maybe the star line knows what he, um, his little thing is all about

[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.700]
Star I-O-D only for a circumcised callers on a star line today by the way

[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.220]
We'll have like alternate days now

[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.900]
Um, let's do Delray Beach

[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.800]
Hello, Neil, yeah

[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.160]
Can I air a grievance with you?

[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.520]
Yes sir, it's with you

[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.660]
Well, I doubt it, I'll give you a short call, what's your problem now?

[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.820]
How come you have a problem with everybody like

[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.620]
That wants to play golf or if they want to ski if that's real

[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.800]
I don't have a problem with it at all, I just said it's boring

[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800]
I said it's boring

[00:09:53.900 --> 00:10:00.020]
No, it's not boring to me, every, yes they do, there are a lot of people to get tired of talking about horse racing, everything it's boring

[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.280]
That's just my opinion, sir, I guess I'm not entitled to

[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.220]
Well, that's what they pay me for, see opinions, sir, are like assholes, everybody's got one and that's my opinion

[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.620]
Well, you know what my opinion is?

[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.500]
I don't really care

[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.380]
1046 at WIOD, we have an open line on a star line, star IOD and out of town where we just got that

[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:21.820]
Prispecace's call from Delray from a real big flaming one is 1-800-944-Schmuck

[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.540]
Are you, uh, you caught up now, do you figure out what it is?

[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.740]
Yeah, that's not the last one

[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.060]
But I can't hear you again

[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:27.680]
Huh?

[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.700]
I said I can't hear you, speaking of the little holes

[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.460]
Which one?

[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.220]
The ones in the phone, there you go

[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.740]
Is that lighting up there?

[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.360]
Yeah, good

[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.180]
Okay, that translation to that card that you have?

[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:39.500]
Yup

[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.100]
It goes like this, no single, widow and lajola

[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.580]
You already said that

[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.620]
You already said that?

[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:48.940]
Yeah

[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.800]
Yeah, what do you think about it though?

[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.840]
We think it was great and have a great life, we love it

[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.140]
What the hell is he talking about?

[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.840]
Pretty soon I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna sit here in Georgia and translate all the calls, okay?

[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.700]
God, are we losing control or what?

[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.420]
And that will be getting the French calls in from the frogs who want their equal time

[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.900]
Open line of day, 751-W-I-O-D

[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.720]
I do have my snapple here, thank goodness, because, boy, when you're plugged up, so to speak

[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.300]
When your ears are quaken and your knees are shaken

[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.380]
There's nothing like having a bottle of snapple dyed raspberry iced tea to kind of cool you off and keep you going

[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:32.000]
Through a long, rough day when nobody seems to be coming to your side or helping out with any of the damn things you need

[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.340]
And snapple, of course, has the big 60-noun standard size bottle, that's 33% more than the imitator standard size

[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.420]
So you get a bigger one for your money, which is always pleasing to me

[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.640]
And of course you get real good stuff too, no artificial ingredients, no additives, no crap

[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.220]
Snapple is made with the best natural ingredients on the face of the globe, okay?

[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.800]
So pick up the celtiers in the complete line of real-brood iced teas and sodas and fruit juices

[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.520]
And for our sports department that all natural football drink, I mean for everybody else, it's a sports drink

[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.300]
But for our sports department, it's strictly a football drink, snap up, or as Joe would say, snap these

[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:15.220]
Snapples available now at pantry pride, at grapevine wine and cheese, Norman Brothers produce all woolly's fine foods, easy quick, shortstop, willing, kindle

[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:22.180]
Miami Market, Doris Market, Lorenzo's Epicure Walgreens, Great Value, Albertans Gardeners Market, and a Freddy's nearby you, George

[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.880]
I thought maybe you'd go...

[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.980]
You moved here from Canada?

[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.540]
Hey, no you didn't

[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.660]
No, I'm just teasing, I would never live in Canada

[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.800]
Good, and I tell you truthfully, I didn't want to trip to Vegas either

[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.020]
I'd like to play golf, but I knew if I could play...

[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:39.440]
Yeah, right, same asshole I called before from what you call, from Delray Beach, same asshole

[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.280]
And that proves my case, he's in the golf, okay, go chase these, okay you idiot

[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.080]
We have an open line out of town, that's an atline 8, which is soon gonna be transferred to like the deadline

[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.460]
Although I think we've already beaten you to the punch

[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.140]
1-800-944-W-I-O-D, Pompato Beach

[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.000]
Paul Castronova's Fire Report

[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.340]
Yeah, we know about saved our sopere

[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.000]
No, no, no, no, even worse

[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.160]
Even worse, another ripoff?

[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.500]
Today's issue of excess?

[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.240]
Yeah

[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.720]
On page 6 says the bear facts

[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.200]
Video is in killing radio in South Florida, the police are

[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.560]
Yes, it is another disc jockey is allegedly screwing up in public and getting arrested

[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.720]
This time the lucky lad is Paul Castronova, host of the Rock & Roll Breakfast Show on WSHE

[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:32.000]
Instead of being caught with his pants down, Castronova is a Castronova or OVO

[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.620]
Whatever you want to say

[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:33.980]
Whatever

[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.680]
OVO

[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.340]
And a compromising was found in a compromising situation where a topless bargoer in Pompato Beach

[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.680]
An observer set

[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.160]
A crowd ensued which brought the Pompato Beach police department

[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.420]
Castronova and the woman were charged with disorderly conduct

[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.260]
Castronova had no comment on his arrest

[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.140]
In a surprising legal move

[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.500]
Wait a minute, he was busted for this?

[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.180]
Apparently

[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.380]
How come it's like such a non-story?

[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.380]
Probably was contrived

[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.960]
You want me to continue?

[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:06.560]
Go ahead

[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:13.960]
In a surprising legal move, however, his lawyer Mark Hennuzio said his...

[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.160]
Nuzio, Nuzio

[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.460]
Fabrizio

[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.600]
A parallel mark of Fabriz, whatever his name is

[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.380]
Fabriz Hennz

[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:21.780]
Go ahead

[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.240]
Said that his client is totally innocent of everything

[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.720]
But not to worry, the public will soon cast its erotic eye on the next sucker DJ

[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.100]
Until then, Castronova will just have to grin and bear it

[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.940]
And I don't get it, I don't get it

[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.700]
What is it that they were supposedly doing?

[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.020]
Apparently, just getting a cheap fill, I don't know

[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.040]
I guess they saw him in here and I said there's one boob too many in his place

[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.240]
Okay, I just want to let you know about it

[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.180]
Well thanks for the good news, okay I'm glad that Paul's getting, you know, Mucky C Mucky do

[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.100]
Well, when you're over at that station, that's about to happen

[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.420]
We'll look for him at the gate this weekend, thanks a lot

[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:54.760]
All right

[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.840]
Okay, 20 past 11 at Good Old WIO, do you just...

[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.180]
Okay, now how come that story got no exposure at all if we can say that, huh?

[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.520]
How come the reporters were knocking down his door?

[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.260]
How come a little Erika, what, Levintol from Channel 7, there wasn't the pounding on his thing at the house, huh?

[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.340]
He's just small potatoes

[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.520]
Because he's small potatoes is right, trying to be big potatoes

[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.620]
He's a big sack of something, I'll guarantee you that

[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:22.440]
We have an open line in Broward, 524 WYOD, 524 Mucky C Mucky Spank

[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.900]
And out of town, 1-800-944, you got it

[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.580]
If you like college basketball, you won't want to miss Goldberg at night, it's tonight

[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.920]
It's called Frequent Burping Syndrome

[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:39.340]
It's terrible, I'll be on a date or a business meeting and...

[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.060]
And...

[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.720]
Excuse me, see, see what happens?

[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.080]
Frequent Burping Syndrome, it can ruin your life, but it doesn't have to

[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:55.760]
Now there's a clinic that can help, trained specialists, sensitive to the needs of compulsive belchers

[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.760]
A special place known as...

[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.200]
Burp Enders

[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.940]
Gosh, Burp Enders saved my life

[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.220]
Joanne and I were in love, I really wanted to ask her to marry me, but...

[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.120]
I just knew that when the moment of truth came, I'd let out with a big ripper, you know?

[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:21.760]
Burp Enders, no shame, no guilt, no more tummy rumbling smelly belches, no more stopping in mid-sittance

[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.560]
Just to one cork, a big cheesy blaster, just carrying professionals and to help you need

[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.320]
Don't wait, here's the number to call

[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.500]
555-2877-5555

[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.340]
Burp Enders, call today and stop being so gross

[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:42.880]
I agree

[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.200]
1126 at WIOD, rumor has it, Paul Castrenov is coming out of the closet on the year tomorrow

[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.680]
And then on Mondays going out and buying a couple of corvettes

[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.480]
But that's just a rumor, we have an open line in Broward 5249-463

[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.560]
Thanks a lot, not to the guy who called yesterday and gave me that technique about opening up your ears

[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.700]
Because I've been doing that the last couple of minutes and they're so plugged up now, man, it's just a brutal

[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.360]
I can't hear a damn thing, here's a lady in Miami

[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.640]
Hi, Neil, how you doing?

[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.140]
What? I know I can hear, it's just a little joke

[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.320]
Okay, listen, I was calling to say something to Jorge

[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.220]
Yeah, let him have it

[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.080]
He is wrong, okay, it's about ugly women that are Cuban

[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:22.660]
Right

[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.960]
My parents are Cuban and I have three boys

[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:31.080]
Yes, you did say that, George, you said they're fat and they're ugly and they like, look real skanky and cheap and sleazy

[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:31.960]
Okay, what I'm saying is...

[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.860]
He's trying to deny it now, I heard it

[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:41.720]
That is not your film on 5 to 7, 110 pounds, blonde hair, green eyes, I am far from being ugly and I am not skanky

[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.740]
Now what about Cuban men?

[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.580]
Okay, Cuban, you know, well, it depends

[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.800]
Oh, that's what?

[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.540]
Well, what does that mean? It depends on what?

[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.280]
It depends on how hairy they are

[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.640]
Are they really all hairy?

[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.460]
Some of them, my boyfriend is not that hairy

[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.240]
Well, how old is he?

[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.460]
He's 22

[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.660]
He's 22 and he's real hairy?

[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.240]
Mm-hmm

[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.220]
Well, that's unusual

[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.820]
Yeah, is he circumcised?

[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.040]
No, he's not, I wanted to talk to you about that

[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.140]
Oh, God, where was he born?

[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.900]
He was born in Cuba, but he came here when he was 9 months old

[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.320]
Well, that explains it

[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.880]
And I wanted to tell you that the reason that most Cuban men were in circumcised

[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:22.340]
is if they were poor, for some reason, their parents thought that they would fall off if they circumcised it

[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.360]
They really did

[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.060]
Boy, that's what happened to me

[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.400]
Huh?

[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.140]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.040]
In fact, did they want to have in circumcised because they were too scared?

[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.200]
They thought it would fall off

[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.260]
They were truly scared that it would fall off

[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.780]
Highly educated in other words

[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.920]
Well, that's a...

[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.480]
An old superstition

[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.420]
They're Wahedos, you know, the Cuban Hilvedos, they don't know anything

[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:44.800]
Yeah

[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:45.840]
And I...

[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.160]
Here's we got more factions here today, it's just unbelievable to be here

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.240]
Porto Ricans and the Cubans and the Colombian dope peddlers and it's just incredible

[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:53.700]
Really?

[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.600]
Well, I wanted to say something to that Daytona guy

[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.020]
Tell him to go back into the sewer that he crawled out of because the minute he got on the air

[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.140]
I can smell him from here

[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.640]
Yeah, all the way from Daytona

[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.040]
Yeah

[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.900]
Okay, thanks for the lowdowns, so to speak

[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.680]
Have a great day

[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.060]
You too

[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.800]
Well, this is certainly a fly and I open her here today, I'll tell you that

[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.060]
Well, we're getting like...

[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.940]
I just can't get over it, all these wild stories

[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.880]
A real hairy show, we have an open line in date, maybe some of these guys are growing back there here because of Mitch Lewis

[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.680]
A lot of these guys were hairless till I started listening to WIOD and I was just growing it

[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.680]
751 in date and one open line in Broward at 5-2

[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:33.640]
Ooh

[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.220]
Oh, did that plug up my right ear?

[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.960]
I mean, I'm the worst, it's working in reverse yet today

[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.940]
Yesterday it worked, so if it works the first time you figure out, do it again, forget it

[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.700]
Plugged up that ear, man, it just can't hear a thing

[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:54.020]
And by the way, it's 29 after 11, we are nothing, we got nothing in here today

[00:19:54.020 --> 00:20:01.140]
No supplies, no first aid, no soup, no hummitation, zipity doodah, the covered is bare

[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.820]
And thanks a lot again, Tom, you little sleaze bag

[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.180]
God, it's here, useless twerp, mobile in Miami

[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.340]
Yes, the Cubs in number one, Neil

[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.140]
Yeah, right

[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.300]
Well listen, if you have any hair...

[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.260]
Less like, say, less like, has to rules

[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.660]
If you have an a hairy show, I need to know something, is a hairy, hairy, hairy?

[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.360]
I would think so

[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:19.900]
What do you think?

[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.100]
He's old and hairy

[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:21.720]
Okay

[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.420]
See ya, good call

[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:30.720]
Open line in date, 751 WIOD, what in Broward at 5-2-4 crank, and let's do a, let me get it, WIOD

[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.120]
I can speak to Neil, please

[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.640]
Sure

[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:33.940]
Hello

[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:34.880]
Hello

[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.400]
Neil

[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:36.600]
Neil

[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.080]
Neil, listen

[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.600]
What's so funny?

[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.640]
Just the change in your voice, it just was interesting

[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.040]
I don't know how I was talking to you

[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.360]
Well, that's the idea

[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.160]
Well listen, tell me, what's going on with the witness? Call the witness

[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.440]
What's going on with him?

[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.100]
Yeah, but not, he's not a horse anymore

[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.860]
That's correct

[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.840]
Can you tell me what's going on?

[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:57.840]
What does that mean?

[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.620]
Well, what do we look for in the paper to go see race?

[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:17.900]
Overnight delivery, Friday night, the 11th race, he finished second in our people's horse race back in November in the rural state that when the top horse can't is either injured or is disappeared, which is the case here, and I'm not too happy about it, but when it happens, the second place horse is the next one

[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.980]
Is there, what's the reason for that?

[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:27.820]
The reason is that Rod Lorenzo claimed him back, and he was going to race him here one more time, but he had a little injury again, and he's shipping him up to Windsor, and he's going to race him back

[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:39.080]
And there are a lot of us who are not really pleased with Mr. Lorenzo because it's a big promotion, but he looks at it like a lot of people like it's a business, and it's a good horse, and he wants to make all of money with it, so it's, you know

[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.180]
Is this horse any good?

[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.440]
Well, we'll see

[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:48.080]
We'll see, he finished second in the people's horse race, we'll hope that in these Dave Ingraham's driving him, so we've got our people's driver

[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.780]
All right, that's good

[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.980]
You're going to say, I guess you can be there Friday night

[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.660]
Friday night, I'll be there tonight for the driver's showdown, we've got Kevin Wallace and Bruce Ranger

[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.020]
Oh yeah, it's for that in the paper

[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.940]
All right, and by the way, I'm heading out to the Yankee Expo game now, I wish I can go to the Cub game, but

[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.460]
Well, if you go to Macy, you can see all the Cubes you want

[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.560]
All right, thanks a lot

[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.800]
Maybe you can go to Vegas with that guy who won the atrip night

[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.720]
Oh, he was so full of it

[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.060]
Okay, good luck

[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.920]
1131, while we're all hallucinating, why should they be any different from me?

[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:25.180]
I dreamed I won 1.7 million on the slots last night, and I'm just counting, and it's got like piles and piles, or hundreds and fifties and twenties, and I'm schlepping and counting and jumping up and down

[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.180]
And then I woke up damn it, a pomp and obiach

[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.020]
Neil, how you doing?

[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.020]
Okay, good, and you'll have you ever seen the Robert Redford movie The Catterty?

[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.840]
Yeah, there's building

[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.800]
Don't you understand that everybody knows your voice by now?

[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:48.940]
We have an open line in Broward, 5249463, and one on the star line at star IOD, see when you have a disgusting, distinctive voice like you do, sir, and you do nothing but make professional

[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:55.400]
Even calling Meg Green on Saturday with your Kakarai, I mean get serious, get a life

[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.760]
Starlines open, star IOD, let's do for Lauderdale, hello

[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.020]
Hello, yes sir

[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.480]
Hey guys, I mean my ears are plugged up and I can still tell that guy

[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.200]
Alright, the first, this is second time caller

[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:07.760]
Okay

[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.860]
I like to say all women are beautiful

[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.860]
All women's is beautiful, okay?

[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.700]
But these Cubans are a bunch of assholes

[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.820]
What is that?

[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.940]
These Cubans guys are a bunch of assholes

[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.120]
Cubans guys are assholes based on what?

[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.940]
Because that I was like, well you're what?

[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:23.960]
I'm Cuban myself

[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.240]
You're Cuban, but you're like George in other words you're a self-hating Cuban

[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:34.000]
Oh, no, not really, some of them are fine, but I mean, all Cuban guys are assholes, sir?

[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.140]
Yes, man

[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:35.900]
Except you

[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:44.700]
Like that guy I call about the young people there, assholes because of the way they talk, that's crap

[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.360]
Yeah

[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.800]
You should go to New York, come out there, let them go to New Jersey

[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.420]
But to tell you, my convertible talk, I like it

[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:53.860]
Right

[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.200]
You know which one it is

[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:55.480]
Right

[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.220]
So what's the thing?

[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.720]
I mean, that's the best thing you should have

[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.940]

cruise for about a half an hour and then like hold my breath and suck up a malalooka plant

[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:33.440]
and see what happens boy look at Chuck Meyer all spift up in his blue and white W.I.O.D. jacket

[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:40.280]
man am I impressed just because the pirates traded away John Smiley because they can't afford

[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.700]
to play the good players they got right in Bobby Bonilla because they couldn't afford to pay him

[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.800]
and next year there'll be no Barry bonds or Doug Drabeck they traded away the pennant

[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:54.500]
yesterday they traded away their life yesterday because they can't afford to win the pennant anymore

[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.680]
that's the problem with the pirates is there a bunch of cheap skates and now they're gonna have to

[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.680]
pay anyway because Jim Leland's gonna be chain spoken and they're gonna have to buy like thousands

[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.820]
of cartons of cigarettes at the Seminole Indian reservation just to keep his ass happy and keep him

[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:12.860]
there till he comes here next year I think he's coming Rick and Sods we love meat at the top 10

[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:18.580]
tabloid trash headlines are next or is that Heinrich and Sods Jim and Joe on football talk and

[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:24.340]
I Hank previews the NC double A's 8 to 11 tonight this is out Florida's news okay what's wrong again

[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:31.100]
nothing I the good question what is that about a sixth call now we have an open line now and now

[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:37.400]
you wonder why he got his ass canned over there we have an open line and Broward 524 W.I.O.D. and

[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:42.480]
out of town 1-800-944 that's got to be at least his third call and he just a malcontent in a

[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.400]
sourpuss and any place that has to do with parties he ain't the guy to be working there okay

[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:54.480]
Hollywood Dale how you doing okay a couple of quick things I went to the ballgame Saturday at

[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.260]
Jo Rabi we've heard very little except for the first few minutes of the show which you would

[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.400]
have thought we had tons of calls about it today with all the stuff with the mound and a bullpen

[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.800]
we've had like maybe three calls the whole day about it which indicates to me that this

[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:11.040]
places out to lunch actually I thought it was a real good time and I think once they work the

[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.920]
king's out it's going to be a fun place to see a ball yeah right this kid stankowicz for the

[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.540]
Yankees hit a grand slam late in the game and it took about two seconds to get out in left

[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:25.960]
field so the Marlins get a couple of big right handed power like Andre Dawson yeah like a Dawson

[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:31.520]
or a Kent Saker or a field or somebody we might be looking at 50 55 diggers all right should be

[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:37.460]
a lot of fun the other thing is the biggest joke on South Florida radio it's got to be Waxi 106

[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:45.300]
as you know yes I do know the other night I happen to punch them up and the guy they do some

[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:50.960]
kind of a all-request house party show you know with the phony can sound effects and stuff and

[00:31:50.960 --> 00:32:00.940]
I get over the crowd noise okay it's a lie I am not a Nazi okay so the he was incredible this

[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:07.100]
little this card came on this guy put the chalk that was on play the cart and that's real

[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:13.940]
round radio sounding guy comes out and says Waxi presto requesto wow and this little girl must have

[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:19.520]

oh no yeah we're not a crowd noise drowning around and stuff yeah the brain surgeon on the air comes

[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.900]
back about three seconds later is it you'll be by Tommy James by Sean Del

[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:38.020]
and she comes back I think so and he comes back to what's your station for music and fun

[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:45.600]
Waxi 106 unbelievable yeah they should be shot I want to tell you right now there's only one guy

[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.420]
over there who does all the voices okay you know who it is yeah yeah you get all and you start saying

[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:56.380]
yeah yeah it is Neil and honor of that at some point you don't necessarily have to do it today

[00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:02.520]
could you play that uh Ricky Ricky your show really blows to the tune of Louis Louis oh no

[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.040]

[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.400]
lot of her happened to that by the way huh what the hell ever happened to that thing I don't know

[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.560]
but during the break I'll dig it up the shoe fits man thanks a lot feel better okay bye feel this

[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:22.460]
146 at W.I.D. that's right if he wouldn't have said that that thing would have like uh fallen off

[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:30.520]
into never never land what the hell happened to that card boy sometimes I feel

[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.640]
see we need we need that thing on the wall you know that they're not going to get us

[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:43.040]
in the other room in a control room they get them like a $3,500 big hot song in a dance thing with

[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:49.360]
80 million racks on the wall because those are the spots those are the commotion's okay that's

[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:55.360]
the bread and butter and here the bread and butter of our show all of these millions of cards all

[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.400]
of these bits all the stuff that the people listen to the stick in station for oh no we kind of

[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:08.940]
for that that's big bucks man maybe next year not so it goes to show you just how much they care

[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.340]
all right they talk a good game they give you a big song of the dance so they're all behind you

[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:18.180]
they love you as long as you got some numbers and that's about it I don't know what the hell

[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:22.660]
happened to that thing George you don't think that thing is in with all the rickinson stuff

[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:30.120]
because if it is that would really frost my big fat ugly grotesque perneated butt I'll tell you

[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:38.040]
that right now well we'll see what we can find it man 148 at W.I.O.D the water exchange came

[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:44.420]
about a week ago put one of those GOA reverse osmosis systems in my new home and guess what all

[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:49.840]
of a sudden I can drink straight from the tap good clear in fact they also tied it into my big new

[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.340]
expensive refrigerator so the water that comes out of the fridge and all the ice cubes that come

[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:58.440]
out of the automatic ice cube dispensing thing in the door same great clear water I mean what's

[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:06.660]
a sense what is the sense of going out and buying bottle water and then like putting a crappy ice

[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:11.540]
from the water from the tap line it goes into you know how I'm saying it's crazy so instead of

[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:16.700]
spending half your salary on bottled water check out the GOA drinking water system from the water

[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:21.580]
exchange it takes about 40 minutes to install no mess no fuss you don't have to patch your

[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.860]
round with it all the time they came one one time a year they come to your house change the filter

like you know I don't want to hurt Bruce he's feeling so good guy but Kevin Wallace is heads and

[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:34.440]
shoulders above Bruce and his hair is better too okay but I mean you know we get this exciting

[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:40.600]
last 10th 10th race and Kevin wins it like a champion okay I mean you open legs like

[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:45.280]
look another big comeback like Jeff Gregory made last week and here Brucey is whipping and

[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.840]
flailing and Gary Lewis if he wouldn't have dropped his shawl on the ground he would have

[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:52.720]
hit it that horse one more time Wango Tango and he'd gotten third and beat Brucey I

[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.880]
will have this long photo I think they even adjusted the finish line and Brucey gets third now

[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:02.880]
it's tied okay so if it's tied have a tie breaker race Friday Saturday you know right sometime

[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:07.220]
I don't think it's fair that's the only way to do a tie I mean you don't play a hockey game until

[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:11.060]
the end of the game and if it's tied three to three they flip a coin to see who won or they find

[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:15.940]
out which team paid the most to get in the stadium I mean they play it out I don't think it's

[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.480]
it would have been exciting yourself so instead they have the Kent Williams this parking

[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:26.060]
pine is crazy connoct he comes up with this idiotic deal where whoever whichever a driver if

[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.500]
you bet two dollars across the board on each one how what the payoff was the most on the five

[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:35.020]
races well what have they got to do with that they have no control over that I know and the horse

[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:39.260]
that paid 1360 handshake can of wars like three to one in a morning line he shouldn't have paid no

[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:43.940]
1360 that's because the people were stupid that's all well I don't think it's fair that we're

[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:50.800]
getting overnight delivery for a horse well don't get me started on that oh please now you're

[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:56.360]
starting up and see the thing of it is now all these 700 or however many people that are

[00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.820]
involved in our deal which has my name on it by the way those people have got to continue coming

[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:05.100]
out till the end of the regular meeting now every night that overnight delivery races if they

[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.400]
want to be eligible to share in the pot okay and I think we're going to have a few of those people

[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:15.540]
like maybe 695 a little bit disgruntled because overnight delivery has let's just keep our fingers crossed

[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:19.200]
and hope for a miracle you know what I'm saying oh he can't that have to put them in with like

[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:25.240]
a 20-year-old man like with chicken picker and dick macomba you're right all right Neil well let's

[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:29.560]
hope for the best and Kevin Wallace's god just don't forget it whenever I call you all the people

[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:47.340]
together. I wonder if her boyfriend's got like poppy seeds in his nose. Along with all that here.

[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:53.440]
Anyway, Elaine's got the new NYOD nose. Rick and SUDs Laura corn is back with her corns

Janorino with the very large Hank Goldberg A-11 o'clock tonight.

[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:24.580]
This is South Florida's news. DRAPIC WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beaches

[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:30.200]
is the best morning show in South Florida. I don't think I was just a nice here on an AM station

[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:34.600]
as a hero in my book. Do you like State Thomas Aquatic? You got no problem with me. Even the other

[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:39.460]
morning shows listen to the The O'Rodges show on the date of fall. I hope you beat me in the

[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:44.400]
ring. You better than I have. Well, what can we say about that? I am that Hemerite,

[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.480]
1206 at WIOD. And you remember the time I saw Joey in Windixie that night and I came on to

[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.060]
here that's like a couple of months ago and I mentioned it and I'm sure it was him. I'm positive.

[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:59.840]
And we got all these different while the conflicting stories about Joey. Does anybody care?

[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:07.900]
Of sunrise. Well now that I guess Paulie's gone and well George is out of his mind. I guess

[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:15.660]
I guess Bill Clinton is the only one with a little foreskin. Hey Neil, how you doing?

[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.340]
I'm out here in beautiful sunrise today. Who the hell is this? Who is this?

[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:27.200]
This is Mr. Anoucet. Oh, well isn't that wonderful? I'm an answer just like you Neil.

[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:34.240]
Well that's great. What station to York at Exxon? No, I don't work at any station. I'm self-employed

[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:40.060]
and I just sit in a little happy sleep. Well that means you're like out of work on a beach.

[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:44.600]
Good. Join a club. Let me tell you something. Go ahead. I am a virgin. I mean a virgin

[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:51.960]
caller with your fabulous show. And I would just like to tell you about this tremendous. I mean

[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:57.180]
absolutely. Can you believe I talk like this? Yes. Absolutely ridiculous.

[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:03.600]
Book meeting that I saw today as I was driving off the Seahorse Expressway.

[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:08.180]
I'm talking about the songgrass of course, Neil. Don't I really sound official?

[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:14.700]
Anyway, I was coming off the song and expressway. I know the minute, Neil. Hold your foot

[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:19.220]
or what is this? Is this Bush Bing Bang in drag or what? Well I'm something.

[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.800]
God. Anyway, I'm coming off the Seahorse Expressway at sunrise. You're coming off

[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:30.820]
or something. I'll write I think it's a three day drunk. Well, no, I'm I'm I'm I haven't had a drink

[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:38.440]
in years. Right. Anyway, I'm coming off the Seahorse Expressway looking off to my left. And what do I

[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:45.360]
see? But there must have been more pigston in a pig pen. Neil, I didn't have to drive through there.

[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:51.340]
I had to walk through there and guess what, Neil? I heard the reason that they're pulling people

[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:57.980]
over is to see if they have like cigarette lighters that are hot and I'll give you a ticket.

[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:02.440]
Right. What is the meaning of those still? They have the hodomeater and if your thing is too hot

[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:08.140]
man, you're your history. I'll pay you dead. These guys feel that there must have been there must have

[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:15.100]
been at least a dozen. Who is this? This is Mr. Anoubster. No, seriously. Who is this? We've got to

[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:23.400]
know who this is. Who is this? I wouldn't repeat my name on the on the air. Even if I had your

[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:38.120]
paycheck. Yeah, I bet you would about 20 times you'd repeat it. Then you'd only wouldn't have to

[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:42.920]
walk over you again. Okay. Nice talking to you, Mr. Anoubster.

[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:49.280]
This fabulous relationship. It's just Mr. Anoubster, a pen beautiful sunrise.

[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:56.440]
Goodbye. Have a nice life, Neil. Who was that? I know who that is. You know what I'm saying?

[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.220]
It's like Jerry Markbright. I know who it is, but I can't put my finger on it probably.

[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.120]
Who was that? It sounded like a cross between Gary Owens and Rush Limbaugh.

[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:15.700]
Tell me, Mr. Mike Raphon. Yeah. It's Mr. Microphone. Oh, that was what's his name? That was what

[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:22.720]
you call it? Ron Hershey Highway, wasn't it? No, he don't sound like that. It's Mr. Microphone.

[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.060]
Oh, so Sonny's too embarrassed to call him now because he's made a fool of himself. He keeps

[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:32.480]
sticking at banana in his mouth in public and has been banned in most of South Florida as a result.

[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:38.280]
So now he's got Mr. Microphone call again. That did sound like him. How come he's so good on

[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:45.020]
this show and those things he does on air so lame? God. This is Mr. Microphone and it's the Sonny

[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:52.740]
Fox show with Ron Hershey and Sonny Fox. Oh, God. Give me a break, Sonny. That was Mr. Microphone.

[01:12:52.860 --> 01:13:00.560]
What is probably searching for an audience? Sooner or later, they all land over here, man. They

[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:07.060]
consumer credit law center. Speak of the devil. If you're one of the thousands of radio dead

[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:13.520]
meets out there, brother, sister, then you need the consumer credit law center. They can remove

[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:20.340]
those derogatory, disgusting, revolting bad things from a credit report and everybody deserves

[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:24.200]
a second chance. Even people in this business, except you know who next door at the coast,

[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.280]
who's probably had more chances than they ever ready. It takes about 90 to 120 days to correct

[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.280]
and they're going to eliminate those things from your credit bureau files. In fact, they go out

[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:38.580]
on T. That's right. It's 100% guaranteed. They're serviced to clear your records or you get your

[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:43.720]
money back. 400 bucks for a single five hundred dollars for a couple and you can even finance their

[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.400]
fee. How the hell do you like that? If you've had bankruptcies, bad debts, late credit card payments

[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:55.340]
for closures, IRS leans, chapter seven, chapter 11, chapter 182, whatever it is. Instead of letting

[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:59.480]
those sit around and running your credit by being on there for seven years, have them wiped away

[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:05.420]
with a consumer credit law center and get a fresh start. Call them today. 832-0130. Tell

[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:11.940]
a Mr. Microphone, told you to call. 832-0130. Have you taken a good look in your closet lately?

[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:17.240]
14. We have an open-line in Broward where Mr. Radooshbag was on and somebody just dropped off in

[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:22.580]
date. I can't get over that. Look at that. Now, I feel really depressed. We were doing so well,

[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:25.640]
you know. We started out a little slow, a little late back this morning and then they all got

[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:32.060]
lit up like somebody like little jagged a camera right under their butt. 751 WIOD and date and 524

[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:39.020]
in Broward. Cutleridge. Yes, sir. I have to follow Mr. Microphone. He was, that was Mr. Microphone.

[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:42.080]
That was his brother-in-law. Well, this is a cutleridge chronic that at least I had a problem.

[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:46.960]
Calling from death row. What is it? Cutleridge chronic. Yeah. I have a good telephone. So at least I got it.

[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.680]
You could fool a hell out of me, sir. You sound like you're calling from like the Roseanne bars, but.

[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.220]
Okay. He was talking about gangsters with badges. Yeah. Okay.

[01:14:55.940 --> 01:15:03.040]
Where you going? Okay. You know, the fraud lover call got me set off. I've been set off anyway,

[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.680]
but she hit it right on the head. You know, what was wrong with him and every ask his or

[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:13.800]
the likes like him is that they cater to the policies of Reagan Bush and all their fascist

[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:19.120]
crony. Yep. I mean, I mean, it's, you know, back in the 16s. I don't want to be old-fashioned,

[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:25.620]
but you are either part of the problem or part of the solution. And every political group,

[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:32.720]
they need their sons, their soldiers and good music there. Here we have state and local pigs,

[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:39.700]
IRS, and GK's us. Yep. You know, and not to get too far from it, but I have a six,

[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:46.780]
I have a case of federal court, but I had 20 to the money stolen from the amount of federal

[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:51.320]
government. Henry Barrow's got a case of federal court. Yep. Seagrums.

[01:15:53.680 --> 01:16:00.020]
And this is serious. I guess I can't get into the detail, but there were no drugs involved.

[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:05.180]
Yep. That's illegal. Right. So money. It was cash money on both the property.

[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:13.000]
And this is being, if the cash is being transported, we have received four units. It's been so

[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.300]
a fort for a year and a half. I still don't have my money to go in.

[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:21.440]
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'll be back.

[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:25.620]
So good luck to you, sir. Okay. Hang in there.

[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.900]
Okay. Going to backyard, you ain't that weed out of the ground right now, pal.

[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.940]
Or you're dead meat.

[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.140]
1216 at WIOD.

[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.620]
Well, I missed your microphone, Jr. Just kind of like set me off there. I wasn't expecting that,

[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.720]
you know, and I'm not them still like about only 20% recovered from this crud.

[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.460]
It's my Malaluka thing again. If she ever calls, if anybody calls me and starts

[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:59.000]
talking to China with that Malaluka crab man, I'm just going to jump right through the microphone,

[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:04.140]
Mr. Jupiter. Hello, Neil. Hello. How are you?

[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.620]
Happy Purim to you, sir. Okay. I'm going to go in post. I don't know what that is.

[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:10.420]
I bet they're having a lot of big Purim parties up there in Jupiter right now,

[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.080]
or probably right next door like right on the edge of Uranus. Right out in the farm there.

[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:17.480]
Yeah. All the Yiddlauch and the farm, man, are really doing it.

[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.960]
They're right on. Yes, sir. Listen, did you get your cable hooked up?

[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:27.080]
Ah, it wasn't. They did finally call me. I will say that last the Friday, I believe.

[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.320]
I haven't called them back. I figure if it took them six weeks to call me,

[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.680]
I'll wait about five or six and then give them a friendly.

[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.400]
They'll be billing you tomorrow, don't worry.

[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:37.800]
No, they already are billing me for my old address. So I'm not like stealing anything.

[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:40.460]
I have the exact same service. They just don't know that I've got it.

[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:43.920]
And they don't even know that I've moved because evidently they got lost in the translation

[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.300]
because they're too busy sending out bills. Yeah, really?

[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:53.120]
Well, I saw some on TV. They said they'd hook it up right away. 1-800-Cable-Me.

[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:56.960]
I thought I'd give you a call. Tom, Tom to call what 800-Cable-This?

[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.060]
Yeah, cable. Then well, that's too many letters.

[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.240]
Well, that's okay. It'll still get the message across.

[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.340]
That referee is Jerry Markbright.

[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:11.540]
No, no. Wrong. Markbright. I will bet you every dime that I have in my paycheck against 50 cents.

[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:12.940]
Well, his name is Markbright.

[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.600]
Well, you're a famous news guy there said Markham.

[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:20.020]
So you're saying Markbright now and it's Markbright.

[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.620]
Wrong. Jerry Markbright. I've been watching the National Football League, sir, for 36 years.

[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.360]
His name is Jerry Markbright. I can see his ugly face in front of me right now.

[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:33.280]
And I can see him emphatically punching out those arms.

[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.180]
Time out, TV, time out, right now. Trust me.

[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.560]
And his microphone's not working.

[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.180]
Right. Well, that's always true.

[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:44.780]
Right. Especially for that Jerry segment that holds the old and the way it's 14 pounds.

[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:46.900]
What does it irritate me? They take it away.

[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:48.840]
Replay.

[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:53.120]
That's a bunch of crap. We finally get something good so that at least once in a while we can get a call.

[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.280]
That's right. Not too often.

[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.560]
Well, they have a big game and we got one of those calls again.

[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:01.100]
I'm telling everyone I'm taking my helmet sack of rias out to J.R.S.

[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:02.500]
and my artillery and my tank.

[01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:04.460]
The M.L.B. Fumbling and yeah.

[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:05.600]
Yeah. Bad.

[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:09.100]
Peter Crenzer's a douchebag.

[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.400]
Okay. Going back to Rochester this week.

[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.020]
Really?

[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.720]
And he's going to eat white hot until his blood pressure goes through the road.

[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:18.640]
That'll do it, man. Just about two days of Donum Bob's and Vic and Irv's

[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.740]
and that'll do it. He'll be dead meat.

[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:20.140]
Yeah.

[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.240]
Well, have a great day, sir.

[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.780]
And give a big kiss on the lilacs.

[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.100]
I don't kiss him. See you later.

[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.500]
Okay. Oh, excuse me.

[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:27.940]
Haha.

[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.900]
Make a note of that, George.

[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:36.020]
We have an open line out of town.

[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.000]
I mean, he's called from Jupiter.

[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:37.900]
He don't want to spoil us.

[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:38.380]
Emma Jup there.

[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:39.840]
He got a lot of kin listening right now.

[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.620]
A lot of kin folk and farm folk and they don't like that kind of stuff.

[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.080]
You know what I mean?

[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.140]
Them folk.

[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.580]
Oh, what are we doing now?

[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:47.940]
Oh, we're doing Toyota Hollywood.

[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.120]
We like them folk, man, because they're great folk over there.

[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.340]
Toyota Hollywood calling all Toyota buyers potential or thinking about it.

[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:58.140]
Because it's a Toyota buyer's alert at Toyota of Hollywood.

[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:02.080]
Don't even think about buying a new Toyota until you check with the

[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.640]
bald old Irish Patrick Murray.

[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.840]
Happy St. Patty's Day and happy Purim Patrick.

[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:09.620]
You got to see the prices waiting for you right now on a all-new 92 Toyota.

[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:12.580]
For example, and these are like for real prices not just to come on.

[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.360]
And no tuxedo is by the way.

[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:15.680]
And no fat old Adijas.

[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.080]
A brand new 92 Toyota Corolla starting in only 8,499.

[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.100]
How about a sporty New Tercelle?

[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:24.460]
How about it starting in just 6175?

[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.400]
The all-new exciting camera in the 92 Camry by the way.

[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.320]
As a pretty damn neat car.

[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:31.200]
Henry just got one from just 12,199.

[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:36.300]
And the all-new 92 Toyota pickups below invoice this weekend only.

[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:40.360]
So if you shop price, no other dealer in the southeast is offering prices this low

[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.100]
and you know it.

[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:45.080]
Excellent prices for all trade-ins and outstanding financing waiting for you right now.

[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.680]
At Toyota of Hollywood on 441 between Tafton's Sheridan streets in Hollywood.

[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.760]
Just a couple of blocks down the street from the Hollywood twin city.

[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:54.860]
Attention South Florida flea market merger.

[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.020]
1227 at WID.

[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.300]
Welcome to our little party, ma'am.

[01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:58.960]
Whoever you are.

[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:01.460]
So nice to have you with us and see how agreeable we are sometimes.

[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.700]
Unless somebody calls up an axel like a psychotic bitch.

[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.920]
By the way, the Dr. Susan Block show I want to mention this again.

[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.100]
I'm no who left this but I'm pretty excited.

[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.220]
Can we look into this George?

[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.000]
Can we take our show on the road?

[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:12.380]
It says,

[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:18.600]
a makes Dr. Susan Block makes love to Orlando on WQBQ Radio.

[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.900]
Can we at least get some tapes of that?

[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:21.840]
Some audio effects?

[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:22.700]
Something.

[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:29.800]
And she's doing her series of four safe sex shows with Orlando I believe or in Orlando.

[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.760]
Well that's bad.

[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.120]
On the subjects of masturbation,

[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:37.720]
phone sex, making out and heavy petting and condoms.

[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:39.340]
Not necessarily in that order.

[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.580]
Okay 1228 let's go to Hollywood on the star line.

[01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:43.860]
Hi, how you doing Neil?

[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:44.820]
I'm doing it, man.

[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.300]
I want to wish you a heartfelt happy perum.

[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.160]
Do you want your mark?

[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:48.720]
Yeah.

[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.300]
I think you were talking about that.

[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:51.280]
You were talking about it.

[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.640]
I think it might be Jerry Panacoli.

[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:53.680]
The what?

[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.040]
The Jerry Panacoli and the Jerobo, yeah.

[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:56.940]
It could be him.

[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:57.300]
Right.

[01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:59.260]
I think it's a disgrace that they're...

[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:02.320]
It was kind of embarrassing when a Jerobo would run out on the field and get lost.

[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.280]
They'd delay the game for hours at a time.

[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:06.980]
Anyway, I think it's terrible that they remove that.

[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.740]
The instant replay, it's thanks.

[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.140]
Mark my words, sir.

[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.320]
Mark my words.

[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.620]
They're going to be real sorry, real fast.

[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:17.960]
Like in the first week of the season next year, they're going to be real sorry.

[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:18.780]
You're absolutely right.

[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.180]
A lot of bad calls last year.

[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:20.580]
Yeah.

[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:21.440]
So anyway.

[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.520]
Even with the replay, there were a lot of bad calls.

[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.060]
Can you imagine now it's going to be on Nightmare?

[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:26.760]
Terrible.

[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.380]
Anyway, I want to suck around on my first time listener, first time caller.

[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:31.520]
No, you're a young Neil.

[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.200]
No, you're not.

[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:33.360]
Yeah, have a nice life.

[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.320]
Boy, who you can.

[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:37.860]
What a sense of humor he's got.

[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.180]
1229 at WIOD.

[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:43.660]
Let's go home now because I got my check and we had a good lunch and the calls have been not too bad.

[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:48.520]
And we had Mr. Microphone and we had that first time young lady and not too bad today,

[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.340]
huh? For a Thursday in a crappy town.

[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.520]
Starlines open, star IOD.

[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.680]
Fort Lauderdale.

[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.580]
Good afternoon, sir.

[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.980]
Good afternoon to you, sir.

[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.660]
I saw the native bumper sticker, Neil.

[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:06.620]
That said, you've seen the insignia for the Japanese orange sun with the white background.

[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.220]
Yes, sir.

[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.740]
That just ain't all across it.

[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.020]
I love it.

[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:10.900]
Just ain't all.

[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.880]
Was it like on a Toyota or something?

[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:13.860]
No, it's on American cars.

[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:14.300]
Oh, okay.

[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.600]
Anyway, sorry Pat Murray, in the great sense of humor, folks.

[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:24.280]
Anyway, oh, by the way, there was a thing in the, Pat Buchanan had a one of his stupid press conferences

[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:28.160]
yesterday and his wife was up there on the podium and they said, are you going to get rid of the

[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.760]
the Mercedes and she got up there.

[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:31.660]
She said it's for sale.

[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:32.800]
Anybody want to make an offer?

[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:34.840]
Ha, ha, ha, not, you know?

[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:35.400]
Really?

[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:38.400]
Anyway, we said if you scraped a swastik off the windshield,

[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.680]
she'll like maybe like consider it.

[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:41.660]
Fashions, pigs.

[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.860]
No doubt about it.

[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:48.660]
Anyway, the reason I call, I think that the instant replay, I think they should give each coach two or

[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:50.720]
three chances to use it at their own discretion.

[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.000]
Right.

[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:55.440]
And the story, let's come up to revenue there advertising and everything they're going to lose.

[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:56.680]
No doubt.

[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.460]
You know, shortens again.

[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.720]
Once they find that out, man.

[01:23:59.140 --> 01:23:59.460]
No doubt.

[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:04.540]
Although I was reading a thing in the satellite TV week yesterday that the NFL,

[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:08.600]
because they made such a greedy, disgusting deal with the owners that they're like

[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:14.140]
extending it and it's like almost they're giving it to the networks for nothing for a couple of years.

[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:14.660]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.860]
Were they talking about pay-per-view now?

[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:17.940]
We're never going to have to forget it.

[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:18.760]
Never going to happen.

[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.300]
Never will fly.

[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:21.160]
Believe me, that'd be the way.

[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:23.060]
Depth now of the game if they try that crap.

[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:23.600]
That's back.

[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:27.960]
With about 80% of those games that are on Monday night, they couldn't pay us to watch them.

[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.460]
Anyway, if you can give me a little chill on my bones, I'm homesick.

[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:34.160]
Let's hear some dick pertin or some p-cale W or something.

[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:37.740]
Well, I think I'm having to relapse.

[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:40.600]
Well, what the hell ever happened to dick pertin by the way?

[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.740]
Kathy Payne and he asked Livingston call the other day and said that when dick was done on a

[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:49.080]
West Coast a couple of weeks ago he was trying to call on the 800 number and of course couldn't

[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.580]
get through, which I find hard to believe.

[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.660]
Because anybody can get through on our 800 live, but he's back up in Detroit,

[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:56.120]
making a lot of bucks.

[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.740]
Okay, smart, have a good day.

[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:05.780]
There you go.

[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:08.200]
Oh, whatever happened to my CKLW, Jingles.

[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:10.560]
Oh, you remember CKLW, sir?

[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:11.400]
You're losing it.

[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.020]
What?

[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.500]
Oh, yeah, I just believe me, I do.

[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.540]
Oh, I don't like that.

[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.460]
But Davies likes it.

[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:21.220]
It's nice and slow.

[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:26.540]
Yeah, okay, now we're doing it.

[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:29.000]
Right on the Edselford Expressway, sir.

[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.320]
Okay, thank you, sir.

[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:31.080]
Have a great day.

[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:31.460]
Ciao.

[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.060]
Bye-bye.

[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.940]
See you at the loose finder, Deli.

[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:35.600]
Not.

[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.680]
See at Skipper's Table for that used to be great.

[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:41.920]
There was a Deli, not a Deli, a Smorgas board place.

[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.160]
There were two of them one in Plymouth.

[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.440]
And the other one on, I think seven mile road in Detroit,

[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:49.640]
they were called Skipper's Table, Smorgas board.

[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.820]
And most Smorgas board places are like for old people.

[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.100]
I don't want to mention any down here.

[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.960]
They're like mostly out of business where they go in and they put their teeth in the glass

[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.420]
and it fizzes while they eat.

[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.160]
And the spaghetti tastes like the corn and the mashed potatoes taste like the meat loaf.

[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.040]
Now this was great.

[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:05.060]
Skipper's Table.

[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.920]
And you could go back like a hundred times

[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.340]
that I had a friend salesman as a matter of fact.

[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:11.220]
I shouldn't say that.

[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.920]
A radio salesperson from Albee in Michigan.

[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.040]
And before we go to the track at Hazel Park or Wolf Arena tonight,

[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:20.800]
we go over to Skipper's Table and eat about 400 pounds worth of food for like $3.99.

[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:23.540]
That was the best Skipper's Table man.

[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.860]
They don't make them like that anymore.

[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:26.720]
Plantation.

[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:27.740]
Hey Neil.

[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:28.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.440]
Now Luke is aren't in bloom now.

[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.080]
Oh.

[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.360]
And if the thing you got gets into your chest,

[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:36.480]
you're going to think you have bronchitis and pneumonia wrapped up into one.

[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:37.420]
What does that mean?

[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.360]
It means that you'll be coughing your brains out.

[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.320]
What do you mean the thing I got?

[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.120]
I got a head cold.

[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:43.680]
Well, don't let it drop down.

[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:44.860]
Don't let it.

[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:45.580]
How about my cold?

[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:46.480]
Tap that too.

[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:48.260]
Oh, no, it's like almost gone.

[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:48.960]
All right.

[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:49.760]
I think.

[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:51.940]
You're trying to talk me back into it, aren't you?

[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:52.240]
Yeah.

[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.120]
Misery loves comforting.

[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:53.620]
Why not?

[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:53.980]
Okay.

[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.340]
I'll work on it.

[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:55.940]
See you.

[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.860]
It's just so Godfather intensive today.

[01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:58.260]
Yes.

[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:02.380]
The only thing I've seen that's bigger than you, I feel is a day I walked up behind

[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:03.600]
Hank Goldberg at the track.

[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:06.420]
Okay.

[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:08.300]
Smart ass, man.

[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:08.820]
I'll tell you.

[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.100]
Which one have I got out?

[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.760]
I don't even know which one of these I got out.

[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:14.120]
I'm so damn Godfather intensive.

[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.120]
I got them all out.

[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:15.660]
Oh.

[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:17.180]
Number two.

[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:24.680]
I'll tell you when you're having a stressful, traumatic, awful day,

[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:28.140]
there's just something so soothing about this music.

[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.560]
I know about you, but it sure does it for me.

[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:31.900]
It just kind of calms me down.

[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.780]
So, like somebody is making me a musical offer that I can't refuse.

[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.420]
Let's do Miami.

[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:36.900]
Hello.

[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:38.720]
Miami.

[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.300]
Buenos tardes.

[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.160]
Ostelewego.

[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:43.380]
Ostelevista.

[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:44.240]
Osteeras.

[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:46.440]
Let's do a leisure city.

[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:47.680]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:48.320]
I'm doing it.

[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.240]
That's good.

[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:53.780]
Hey, I'm first off I want to clarify you on that replay.

[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.560]
Oh, I love it.

[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.020]
Go ahead.

[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:03.480]
Not only did the douchebag yet vote against the Giants also vote against it.

[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:05.440]
Not only them, but also the counterfeit bills.

[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:08.040]
All the New York State teams voted against it.

[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:08.960]
What the hell did they know?

[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:09.660]
Well, let's see.

[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:11.700]
Did the Giants get tried to pull a fast one?

[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:14.820]
Yeah, the Giants also because the Giants and the Jets were like back to back on the list.

[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:15.440]
I'm pretty sure.

[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:16.660]
Yeah, triple play there.

[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:17.580]
Yeah, screw them.

[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:20.640]
Did you have you seen any of this baby lollipop trial?

[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:22.420]
Baby lollipops.

[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:26.380]
First of all, the name of the trial just I mean, what the media does here,

[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:28.560]
I just I have a headache from thinking about it.

[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:33.660]
Yeah, well, have you seen that girl who's testifying for the state of Libya?

[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.020]
Well, a girl I guess whatever Olivia Gonzalez.

[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.820]
Yeah, you seen the sideburns on her, man.

[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:39.220]
Oh, yeah.

[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:39.740]
She looks like Elvis.

[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:44.740]
She looks like Luke Perry on Beverly Hills 902 164 3, 8.

[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.680]
Are those babies real or is that Charles Alfieri sideburned?

[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:48.920]
Right.

[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.660]
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.560]
Do you tell her to butcher up?

[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.600]
Only her proctologist knows for sure, sir.

[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.620]
Yeah, I want to ask you about this Buchanan thing.

[01:28:57.820 --> 01:28:57.920]
Who?

[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.260]
You know, not but Buchanan.

[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.140]
Buchanan, a guy who's trying to run president.

[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:03.740]
He can't be president.

[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:04.100]
He's a hymeric.

[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.260]
Yeah, hymeric.

[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.980]
He can't be president really, can't he?

[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:16.000]
I mean, didn't they pass a law after Roosevelt was president, Franklin Roosevelt,

[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:18.980]
that no more president with the same last name?

[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:23.200]
Yeah, they had Teddy and then and we already had a president name Buchanan.

[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:23.620]
Right.

[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:24.640]
So they can't use that.

[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:27.420]
Too bad because the Cubs were hoping to get Steve Wilson elected president

[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:29.720]
before they traded him the Dodgers and they just missed out.

[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:30.540]
They just pull away.

[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:31.340]
They're way to get rid of them though.

[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:31.760]
Yeah.

[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:33.200]
Well, listen, have a great day.

[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.860]
In fact, it would be a good way to get rid of Danny Jackson too,

[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:37.700]
but I guess that we got beat on that baby too.

[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:38.660]
Have a great life, sir.

[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:41.760]
Look at that two open lines in day.

[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:43.740]
That's a first and hours on this show.

[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.280]
Does that mean we're like coming screeching to a halt in the middle of lunch hour?

[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:46.800]
We hope not.

[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:51.200]
God, they just know how to stick it to you when you least expect your rate at 524.

[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:52.100]
No, what is it?

[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.260]
I don't even know what the number is.

[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.880]
751, I think it's setting into my lungs deep towards you.
