[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]
What is obsession with hockey?

[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.120]
Squirt's work?

[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.580]
Oh!

[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.200]
I am an embasson.

[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.740]
I am a

[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.080]
A

[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.080]

[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.080]

[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.100]
A

[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.640]
A

[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.640]

[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.700]
A

[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.180]
Yeah!

[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740]
What a day! I never thought I'd live to see this day.

[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.060]
1018!

[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.900]
At WIOD, I never thought I'd live to see that either.

[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.180]
What is that we got on there?

[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.040]
Look at that!

[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.160]
Okay, we have an open line out of Starline.

[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.500]
This is the momentous day.

[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.240]
Our CamillaSouse total is 55,094 dollars.

[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.800]
That 18 T CamillaSouse hotline for the entire big oozing state.

[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.180]
1-800-852-006.

[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.200]
Thanks to Heavenly Ham and PT Simone, by the way, our sales hole.

[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.020]
He's learned it fast.

[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.100]
Nice job at telling us about the food coming by the way, Pete.

[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.940]
Because we ate some Wayne Arnold's this morning, which we always love.

[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.680]
He brought for Ranieri and they saved this a little bit.

[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.520]
We ate that and then all of a sudden they hear, oh, guess what?

[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.000]
We got Heavenly Ham out front.

[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.640]
In fact, if there's anybody in the building, I don't want any of this to go to waste.

[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.300]
There's a big oozing, gigantic, delicious ham.

[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.000]
Those tremendous, heath bar crunch cookies and some chocolate chip cookies.

[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.940]
And I mean Heavenly Ham is just godly.

[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.340]
They are the most incredible stuff in the history of the human race.

[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.720]
And we got like 75,000 cases of snappled that just came in.

[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.320]
So this must be a big celebration tonight's the IOD Christmas party.

[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.340]
So it's a good idea the food came in early so everybody can pick out early in the day

[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.840]
and save open up a little cavity for later on tonight, like for the track.

[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.040]
Let's go to Fort Lauderdale, ho.

[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.280]
What's this obsession with hockey?

[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.600]
Ha ha ha! You're the first one I thought of!

[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.080]
Yeah.

[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.800]
What a guy.

[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.660]
Isn't that great?

[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.440]
Excellent.

[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.940]
Boy, this Wayne has Zenga.

[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.300]
It's like this man has taken it upon himself, like the mission of making this into like almost a real town.

[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.980]
Yeah.

[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.900]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.700]
One handed.

[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.280]
Yeah.

[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.800]
Right.

[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.020]
Single handedly.

[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.340]
That.

[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.960]
Well I knew you could relate to that.

[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.820]
Thank you very much.

[00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.280]
Okay.

[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.220]
We have an open line in Brad.

[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.620]
They're coming on glue with I'm telling you.

[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.920]
They're coming apart at the seams.

[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.720]
They're so excited.

[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.920]
And then those old women man, they call it on that telephone.

[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.740]
Ah, we don't need any more spots.

[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.080]
Go do a strawberry douche and get out of our face lady, okay?

[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.040]
Go find a life.

[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.680]
Go place a majong.

[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.880]
Get out of our damn lives already.

[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.300]
God.

[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.460]
Here's the shot.

[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.600]
That's all that he's worth.

[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.160]
Rances to the line.

[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.280]
Rances again.

[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.460]
Come again.

[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.480]
Take the shot.

[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.280]
Set it off.

[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.880]
Talk to the center.

[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.480]
The star.

[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.680]
Hey.

[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.220]
Talk to the star.

[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.860]
Talk to the bird.

[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.240]
So anyway, 1039 about your fat Chuck Myers excited.

[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.080]
He can go over there and see Mario.

[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.800]
And see his damn obnoxious penguins who never seemed to lose a game except to the Leafs by the way.

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.800]
Do mention that in passing.

[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.260]
Got to win one sooner or later.

[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.380]
Hi, Alia.

[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.540]
A. Niels.

[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.600]
Finally.

[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.800]
Is this Bill Hewitt?

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.920]
What's that?

[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.640]
Finally, we got hockey in Florida.

[00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.680]
And you know why, don't you?

[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.260]
Why not?

[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.160]
Because after years of desperately attempting to find the answer to the musical question is Bill Hewitt alive,

[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.180]
we found out this year on this show thanks to my persistence and my perspicacity.

[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.020]
He is still alive and that was what put us over the top in getting a hockey team plus Wayne has

[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.820]
Angus $50 million.

[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.700]
Well, we should call this Wayne's world instead of Miami.

[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.520]
That's sure.

[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.180]
That's it.

[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.800]
I want to call my two friends douchebags because they said they would not have hockey in Florida.

[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.260]
What a bunch of assholes.

[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.680]
Matt and Norm, you're a bunch of shot-filled douchebags.

[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.880]
We got hockey, brother.

[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.180]
No, no, no, no.

[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.880]
Okay.

[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.460]
Have a great day, Niels.

[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.340]
See, I have a great dissupting.

[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.240]
Where the hell is that Wayne's world card we got?

[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.620]
I'm just a mad man today.

[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.340]
Could have something to do with my blood sugar being 900 now after eight and two of those great cookies.

[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.100]
They got to stop bringing those by the way.

[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.320]
Those are so damn good.

[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.640]
Those are the best things in history.

[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.820]
Oh, man, from Heavenly Ham, I just mentioned again in passing.

[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.440]
Two open lines, indeed.

[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.600]
What's the matter in Dave County, huh?

[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.000]
I tell you what's the matter in Dave County.

[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.320]
They know that they're going to wind up, well, it's not a done deal.

[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.080]
But I still think Mr. Hizinghi is going to build his own arena up there by Joe Robbie Stam.

[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.120]
It's going to be like the Midoland's complex and then the heat will van moves from downtown

[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.460]
and the hockey team will play there.

[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.860]
And Miami, as usual, will be left holding the bag.

[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.640]
Let's go to where we going.

[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.960]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.620]
Did I just say that?

[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.100]
I don't know.

[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.820]
I'm wound up between the hockey and the sugar cookies.

[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.340]
I feel like Sandy Payton.

[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.800]
Sugar cookies, Michael.

[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.800]
Sugar cookies.

[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.300]

[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.300]
That's how I feel.

[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.320]
Almost.

[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.620]
Not that boring though.

[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.960]
Hollywood.

[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.640]
Hollywood, yes, sir.

[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.780]
My name is Ralph.

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.580]
Yes, Ralph.

[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.860]
I want to know something.

[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.200]
Yes.

[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.960]
Now, why does AM and PM, what does it stand for?

[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.820]
Are you listening to this show, Ralph?

[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.180]
Yes.

[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.540]
What the hell does that have to do with anything that's going on here today?

[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.200]
I want to know what AM and PM is.

[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.700]
What does that have to do with anything you're disgusting old fart?

[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.500]
About baseball, football.

[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.260]
About anything.

[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.120]
I've got a AM and PM.

[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.660]
What is this?

[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.740]
How about BM?

[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.440]
You know what BM stands for?

[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.900]
Go take a shot.

[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.640]
If it's possible and in your case unlikely, you idiot.

[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.680]
As soon as you hear that, we don't want old fart.

[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.400]
We have a special part of the day on WIOD for old fart like you.

[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.800]
It's called the Telepol on the Micronary Show.

[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.520]
Mike opens up about two minutes worth of time that he donates to every

[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.780]
crotchety disgusting old fart.

[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.800]
Who doesn't give a damn about it?

[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.960]
See, he's the epitome.

[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.940]
He don't care about the rest of us being in a great mood and have it a great day.

[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.360]
He's got his own agenda.

[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.900]
What is AM and PM?

[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.780]
I got you a BM over here, man.

[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.000]
It just came through the phone.

[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.940]
God would have fart.

[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.520]
God would have fart.

[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.220]
Here.

[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.620]
God would have fart.

[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.600]
God would have fart.

[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.960]
Mr. Asagi.

[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.160]
I would love to know what goes on inside that house when his cheerleader wife

[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.260]
is going to be reading.

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.260]
I don't know if they're reading the newspaper or the scriptures.

[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.980]
One or the other.

[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.880]
Rick Wiley.

[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.220]
Rick Wiley.

[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.180]
Rick Wiley.

[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.120]
Rick Wiley.

[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.240]

[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.680]
So I wonder what Rick is doing at the dining room tables and we speak right now.

[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.040]
Why is everybody picking on me just lighting up, man?

[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.120]
There is some heavy duty crap going on inside of that house.

[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.200]
I think we could make a soap opera.

[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.560]
It would make Chester Wiley a pale and a win significance.

[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.760]
I never said that anyway.

[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.680]
Did I?

[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.040]
Well, if I did, I forgot.

[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.360]
Rick Wiley is like some kind of a psychotic axiomordor in that house and his underwear in his newspaper.

[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.480]
That's not bad enough.

[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.020]
Rick Wiley.

[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.120]
Rick Wiley.

[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.260]
Rick Wiley.

[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.760]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.600]
Rick is discussing that right around the dining room table right now with his lovely cheerleading wife.

[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.980]
Why is everybody picking on me just lighting up, man?

[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:02.940]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.900]
I am an imbecile.

[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.380]
Why do some people get stoned and some people not?

[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.280]
1054 at WYOD Miami.

[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.680]
Hello, Neo.

[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.340]
I got a fucking my spinner.

[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.340]
Yeah, bet.

[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.520]
Hey, I thought that asshole wouldn't know a BM if you forced that him 10,000 prunes.

[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:24.800]
Right.

[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.360]
Anyway, how about them black, blue and silver Miami blades?

[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.560]
The Miami blades?

[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:30.160]
Yeah.

[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.440]
That is a pink flamingos for the screaming eagles for that matter.

[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.760]
No, we don't want no screaming eagles.

[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.660]
I want the screaming experience.

[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.660]
That might be good.

[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.220]
Screaming.

[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.300]
In honor of a shocking diome, I do the screaming queens.

[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:41.880]
All right.

[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.960]
The blades sounds good, right?

[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:44.620]
No.

[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.240]
No?

[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.580]
No, because there was, I think it was the Toledo blades as a minor league team.

[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.260]
That's the blades.

[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.160]
We don't want to have a minor league name to start out.

[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.440]
Why not?

[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.600]
We're a minor league town.

[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.800]
Can I say that?

[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.160]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.640]
Don't say that, even though it's true.

[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.000]
You wouldn't believe how I found out.

[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.400]
I'm listening to Rick and Puts, who are just like impenetrains.

[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:01.820]
Yeah.

[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.080]
And I decided to slip around a little bit.

[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.680]
And I hear Hank, and he's going, we'll never get hockey team because we'd have to build another arena.

[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.380]
But I'm going to boot by the thing.

[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.340]
And then some guy calls up, using all a bunch of big words and he doesn't really understand

[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.080]
from the arena.

[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:16.640]
Yeah.

[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.360]
And he says, we just got one.

[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.600]
And then Hank got to eat everything he just said right there in the air real quick.

[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.340]
And the story didn't really break for like another hour after that.

[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:27.660]
Wow.

[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.540]
Rick and Puts never did talk about it.

[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:29.860]
No.

[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.160]
And I'm not going to let up on his cigaretteo thing because he really pisses me off.

[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.380]
Of all the people in this market, he's the worst offender.

[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.900]
If he's not interested in just like the thing with when we had the breeders crown at Pompeno Park.

[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.060]
But I remember back in the years when they used to have the media race and he used to drive in the media race.

[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.100]
And he would make a big feature and we had to see Tony and Asalki.

[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.900]
And all of a sudden he was real interested in the harness racing, which he knew nothing about.

[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.900]
But we get the breeders crown and he gives us nothing.

[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.680]
And people are having to call up Bernie Rosen to go over there and whip him and beat him to give us like a little bit of coverage.

[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.540]
Because Tony is basically just a self-serving, self-promoting fool.

[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:04.220]
Blue hard.

[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:04.720]
Yeah.

[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.380]
All right.

[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.620]
And Tom to get his pants down from his damn armpits.

[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.000]
Yeah, what the hell are we supposed to watch for local news in the car?

[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.840]
Pizza hell out of me.

[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.420]
Yeah, that's pathetic.

[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:13.600]
Yeah.

[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.780]
Anyway, the blades.

[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:15.780]
Okay.

[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.100]
No.

[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.360]
See, how about the game blades?

[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.400]
Cool.

[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.020]
See ya.

[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:19.600]
Cool.

[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.140]
Two open lines.

[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.940]
And they're both in Dade County, the home of the new Miami hockey team.

[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.800]
Well, they're probably out partying like all day today.

[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.100]
They're probably stoned out of their mind.

[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.320]
Like any other Friday or any other day of the week.

[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.360]
7519-463-751-WI-OD.

[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.840]
Here's Tampa.

[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.260]
Hello.

[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.060]
Hey, Neil.

[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.400]
Yeah.

[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.840]
Speaking of incompetence on the airwaves down here, Ted Webb.

[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.240]
Joe Duskbag on FLA.

[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.600]
What a wicked web-weezed thing when we practiced to listen to FLA, yes?

[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.980]
He says yesterday on the radio, or the other day when Carl Barger died.

[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:56.460]
Yeah.

[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.360]
He says that for about six or seven seconds, he was actually looking for somebody to high five.

[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:03.860]
Hmm.

[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.460]
Duskbag.

[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.500]
Is that great.

[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.840]
That's about the 10th call we've had about some really grotesque, psychotic things that were said over there.

[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:12.880]
Nice.

[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.040]
I don't like them.

[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:14.420]
Yeah.

[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.600]
I was reading this magazine that comes out up here called Players Magazine.

[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.060]
Yeah.

[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.540]
And they're doing a feature this week.

[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.620]
They do a thing on radio.

[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.080]
And they talk about Bob De Carlo.

[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.100]
Bob De Carlo.

[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.540]
He says that you use his going home music.

[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.920]
He used to work with you.

[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.880]
I never worked with Bob De Carlo.

[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.260]
I was in trouble.

[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:36.860]
Well, that's what he said.

[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.240]
And they work with you down on Miami.

[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.180]
Oh, he's doing good.

[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:54.760]
Mr.

[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:02.660]
Maybe Thin D

[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.020]
D.O. There it is.

[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.220]
Touching. It is.

[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.440]
Have a good day, mate.

[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:08.960]
Not the call.

[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.580]
OK, thanks a lot, Pat.

[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.340]
Correct. See ya.

[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.200]
March shot is a piece of crap.

[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:15.920]
O.

[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:26.280]
Ellen Box was a normal man, with a nice home, a lovely family,

[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.100]
and a cushy job with his father-in-law's company.

[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.720]
Normal that is until just three weeks ago.

[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.080]
Hi, honey. How was your day?

[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.300]
Someone of an esoteric Monday, I feared,

[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.580]
will end up being buttoned on the list.

[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.580]
Let me see if I can't focus it in to the best of my ability.

[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.800]
Ellen Box is suffering from Bob Lasseter disease.

[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.900]
Are you feeling all right, Ellen?

[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.360]
Absolutely insane.

[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.040]
I see things that nobody else seems to see,

[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.760]
or at least cares to admit that they say.

[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.180]
Bob Lasseter disease attacks the central nervous system,

[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.680]
causing otherwise normal people to communicate like suicidal maniacs.

[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.560]
To hell with you today.

[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.220]
I don't want to talk to you.

[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.020]
What's more, Bob Lasseter disease is the one form of depression,

[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.760]
which is actually contagious.

[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.680]
God, just listing that voice, I want to jump off a building.

[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.920]
You're the lowest of the low, you're a snake, you're a scumbag.

[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.340]
Please send whatever you can today to post office box 1-800-

[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.280]
Devon Port, Iowa.

[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.780]
Honey, it's Friday night.

[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.900]
You know what that means.

[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.420]
Betching and mourning and screaming and hollering, please help.

[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.660]
What is obsession with hockey?

[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.820]
Oh, wait until you hear this fact, I just got it.

[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.680]
You're going to just pee in your pants when you hear this.

[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.520]
Neo Rodgers and big letters, hockey, hockey,

[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.100]
hockey, I'm sick of you talking about the world's most boring sport.

[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.640]
It will be a dismal failure, and the arena will be empty.

[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.240]
Why's it often talk about a popular sport like soccer?

[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.360]
Oh, God, give me a break.

[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.760]
These people were there's soccer.

[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:55.980]
Don't bet on it.

[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.580]
Yeah, right.

[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.240]
What I'd do with that is take your soccer ball and stick it with a moon don't shine.

[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.000]
And then we can get rid of the fight, Dell.

[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.000]
And then we can have hockey, night and Cuba.

[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.080]
Right, hockey, night and Cuba, right?

[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:06.980]
With the Havana Banana.

[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.300]
Jorge Mos, can only.

[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.800]
I'm sure there's a few goalies hidden down there.

[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.440]
Probably.

[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.100]
Maybe with the Haitians we can get a good goalie come in.

[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:14.700]
Possible?

[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.300]
OK, just looking out for some jobs down there.

[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:17.760]
OK.

[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:18.440]
Take it easy.

[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:18.940]
See ya.

[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.340]
Hi, boys and girls.

[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.980]
It's time for...

[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.940]
Pee-wee shopping tips, Valela.

[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.660]
Pee-wee shopping tips.

[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.280]
Today, we're going to talk about holiday shopping.

[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:32.040]
What do we?

[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.080]
What about the global recession?

[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.620]
Well, gloobie, the recession is beginning to peter out.

[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.200]
That's right.

[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.740]
If we all glad and spend a lot, we'll have this thing beat in no time.

[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.540]
So, this holiday season, by lots of cool stuff.

[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.260]
Wake, fake vomit and plastic dark poop.

[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.900]
Are my personal favorites?

[00:14:59.300 --> 00:14:59.760]
I don't.

[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.660]
No, those retoys.

[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.120]
If you want to help the economy, go get mommy's purse or daddy's wallet.

[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.040]
Grab a big stack of dollar bills and then shoot the entire ward.

[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.820]
So long, kids.

[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.660]
Johnny likes it.

[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:16.500]
It's hard.

[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.760]
Okay, 1116 and WIOD on a diabetic coma induced Friday.

[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:23.960]
This sales...

[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.940]
And this is exactly...

[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.780]
This goes back to what I've been talking about all week.

[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.040]
Out of control.

[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.060]
Out of control.

[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:30.840]
Sales department...

[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.480]
Just when you think they hit rock bottom, they find another level.

[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.080]
Pretty soon, they're going to like dig out from underneath

[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.320]
wherever they are and find China on the other end.

[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.680]
Like a little baby chick crawling out of an egg.

[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.780]
They're like dig through the ground and look up.

[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.620]
How so, man?

[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:45.480]
Unbelievable.

[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.200]
It's not even 1120 yet.

[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.880]
We've had three food deliveries already.

[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.620]
Thanks to Andalusia Bake Shop, we know your stuff is great.

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.960]
But if you people back in sales could coordinate because we can only have so many strokes

[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.140]
and so many bells, paulsy attacks and so many comas to keep you people in business back there.

[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.160]
Okay, it was all great, but there wasn't anybody in sales who told us about

[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.720]
any of this crap that was coming in today.

[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.900]
Okay, I mean about any of this great stuff that was coming in today.

[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.000]
Like I said, have some ham, Roger.

[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.740]
Well, no, seriously, it's too good to waste.

[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.360]
And like I said before, on the days when like George and I want lunch, period, that's it.

[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.140]
And they come in here with a couple of boxes of stuff.

[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.080]
Before the box even hits the counter in here, there are like 15 people like starving immigrants

[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.520]
lined up at the table.

[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.720]
On a day like today when we got more food than Carter's got pills

[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.960]
and we got all kinds of this beautiful big ham here

[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.440]
and we got all kinds of croissants and good stuff to make sandwiches and honey mustard.

[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.060]
We got a big for people who come in here and eat.

[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.480]
So thank God for a couple of real hazards like Steve Ziggler and Roger to be in here

[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.700]
and picking up the slack.

[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.960]
Lady in North Miami.

[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.060]
Hi, Neil.

[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:54.660]
How you doing?

[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.500]
Well, I'm telling you once again my favorite glitonality.

[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.100]
I know I'm not sucking around and I do a green about 20th of Gradle.

[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.280]
You want sucking?

[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.980]
You ever heard and seen the Dan Marino show?

[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:07.860]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.200]
It makes me sick.

[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.360]
Kissy, kissy, kissy, kissy.

[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.920]
The guy is really horrible.

[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.540]
I got a question for you.

[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:14.880]
Okay.

[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.000]
Tell me I'm wrong.

[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.140]
Do you know that Dan has to wear a body condom before he goes on that show?

[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:19.780]
Probably.

[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:20.960]
Yeah.

[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.700]
Don't tell me that they're going to put that insipid runnyory on until 10 o'clock

[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.280]
and kill me again.

[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.600]
Who said they're doing that?

[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:34.360]
Well, I heard something about you are not going to have the coming number 9 to 10.

[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.560]
Is this true?

[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.000]
Wait a minute.

[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:36.220]
Why?

[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.720]
I understood that being true.

[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.620]
No, no, no, no.

[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.480]
Will you listen to me?

[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.720]
That's an old tape and I was talking about when they had me coming in at 9.30

[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.160]
and doing that half hour live.

[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.140]
The 9 to 10 thing is solid until we put Howard Stern on it.

[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.200]
I mean, it's solid.

[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.300]
Well, thank God.

[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:53.840]
Yeah.

[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.640]
See, I want to tell you something.

[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.000]
If this company had any brains at all, they would have Hot 105,

[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.520]
which were taken over in a few days.

[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.560]
They'd have Howard Stern on the morning on Hot 105 faster than you can say douchebag.

[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:04.920]
Okay.

[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.720]
And make millions of dollars in corner of the whole market, AMFN, PM.

[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.400]
I mean, whatever you want, we have it and they're just too stupid to do that.

[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:12.960]
Probably.

[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.140]
And so they're going to let magic buy out Waxi.

[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.900]
That's the rumor and they're going to put Howard on the morning in Lauderdas Limbaugh

[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.220]
and who knows what they're going to do.

[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:19.860]
Oh my God.

[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.400]
That's the rumor.

[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.160]
Well, as long as I'm going to be able to keep hearing you.

[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.900]
See, and you know something, if this company put Howard on Hot 105 with Howard in the morning,

[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.500]
this is the only company in town that could do it without being abused by certain individual

[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.120]
morelust in town who would like to start writing to the FCC.

[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.240]
Uh-huh.

[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.980]
So you see if they would sit down and think about that and realize, yeah,

[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.200]
use a little bit of smarts, but no, they're not going to do that.

[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.160]
So to wind up with magic, uh, having Howard on and then there would be certain individuals

[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.320]
writing psychotic letters.

[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.620]
Oh, he said dickhead on the air and he said, let's be a dilatate and govern yourselves accordingly and all that crap.

[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.260]
God dammit.

[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.660]
This is supposed to be a free country.

[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:54.980]
Right.

[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.460]
Exactly.

[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.240]
But this is a bunch of garbage.

[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.280]
It's a bunch of shots.

[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.980]
I agree with you 100 percent.

[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.240]
Right.

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.480]
And you keep up the good will.

[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.980]
And you have a good weekend, dammit.

[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.700]
And you do this with us.

[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.140]
Okay.

[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:04.280]
Okay.

[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.520]
Yeah, when I love the hockey.

[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.280]
See ya.

[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:06.900]
Bye-bye.

[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:07.740]
Bye-bye now.

[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.500]
We have an open line today, the 751.

[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.220]
What if they ever consult with me about doing something that makes sense?

[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.300]
Because it usually costs money.

[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.200]
Oh, that kneel.

[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.240]
He wants us to spend money.

[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:19.580]
Oh.

[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.080]
Like in Tampa, God forbid.

[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.760]
What was ever the upshot shot of, well, I don't know what that word means anymore.

[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.460]
Is that a real word now, upshot?

[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.320]
I almost wanted to say it the other way around to like balance it out.

[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.960]
But what was the final deal with the Randy and SUN?

[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.580]
Are they coughing up a couple of bucks for her or what?

[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.760]
Because the day that Randy goes off SUN is the day that I take a long walk.

[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.040]
I'll tell you that like from here right downstairs to Gary Mills office to get my check.

[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.320]
Oh my, uh, fellow Hurricane fans down there at Romans.

[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.300]
They came to gonna kick some f**king ass in 93.

[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.460]
Don't forget it.

[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:02.640]
Oh Canada, you think that you're in love.

[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.120]
Oh.

[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.100]
You stole our all star game.

[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.080]
Cause your own sports really suck.

[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.820]
You've got dog sled runs.

[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.580]
You should lose with guns.

[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.500]
What a way to entertain.

[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.460]
And you fish for ice.

[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.080]
You think hockey's nice.

[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.160]
Cause it's playing without a brain.

[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.980]
Who can a dog?

[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.160]
Oh, nausea.

[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.840]
Give me my old star game.

[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.440]
I want it back now.

[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:44.180]
Cause baseball in Canada makes me a blow-chall.

[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.020]
1126 at WIO.

[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.720]
So do your friendly station for the 90s.

[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.820]
We have an open line in date.

[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.900]
751-9463.

[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.320]
I said to a sunny this morning, I said something about what station's gonna carry the hockey games?

[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.720]
Because QAM is already tied up with a heat.

[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.260]
And there'll be obviously a lot of conflict since they both are fall in winter sports.

[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.700]
And he said, maybe by that time WIOD will have the heat.

[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.480]
Now I have news for you, okay?

[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.120]
Not being an NBA fan.

[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:21.520]
If I had my druthers, if I had to choose between having an NBA basketball or hockey on the year at night on this station,

[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.060]
it's not even a contest, okay?

[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.500]
Forget it.

[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.280]
Let them have the heat over there.

[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.440]
The heat doesn't even show a thing on a Richter scale on QAM.

[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.620]
It doesn't even make like a little blip on the heart monitor.

[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:35.880]
South Miami.

[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:37.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.520]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.400]
Wait, it's to you.

[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.980]
I'm really happy about hockey and baseball and this town is starting to get something to get here.

[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.860]
We're starting to like a little hemorrhoid man which eventually grows into a gigantic grape.

[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.880]
We're starting to like just a little thing start to grow.

[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.280]
A little right in the tunnel somewhere.

[00:21:53.720 --> 00:22:02.720]
But also, the reason I call this because for a year I've been working with this douchebag and he always comes in and makes me turn off the radio and put on this noisy squeaky jazz stuff.

[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.540]
Oh, great.

[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.420]
Well, what is he, some kind of a pseudo intellectual snob?

[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.960]
Oh, he's very much, but guess what?

[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.420]
For the last week, I got him over a year now.

[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.560]
He's been listening to you and cracking up and enjoying it.

[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:14.920]
Really?

[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.820]
And he says he's going to hold it against me if I turn him into a kneeling.

[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.160]
He's going to hold it against you?

[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.380]
He's going to hold it against you.

[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:20.640]
He's going to hold it against you.

[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.800]
I'd run like hell.

[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.520]
Yeah, well, that's true too.

[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.180]
But mainly that's what I wanted to say, but I'm really proud and happy and have a good one.

[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.080]
Okay, and you too.

[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:29.400]
Bye-bye.

[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.140]
See ya. See, it's never too late for anybody.

[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.500]
If they give the show a chance, everybody be listening.

[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:33.860]
Okay?

[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.300]
And let me say a one more time since Cheryl is standing in the room.

[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.240]
If this company had any brains, we'd have Howard doing mornings on Hot 105

[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.260]
since this is the only station in the market he could be on without being abused by certain dictatorial individuals.

[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.340]
Doesn't that make a lot of sense to you?

[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.120]
We'd have it made in the shade.

[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.900]
We got like a built-in thing there, man.

[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.560]
But oh, no, we don't want to put that out because it costs money.

[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.240]
And we want Hot 105 to be another cash cow for the sisters.

[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.480]
We don't want to have any staff and all you people at Hot 105, by the way,

[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.880]
good luck to you and your future lives and careers, whatever they are,

[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.140]
because it sure won't be at this place.

[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.520]
They're blowing y'all out, y'all.

[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.880]
Here's you put around the starline.

[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:12.580]
They meal.

[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:12.980]
Yeah.

[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.460]
Hockey, good, winery, bad.

[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.540]
That guy in the morning is so pathetic.

[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.740]
All he talks about is getting his car washed and then it's raining on it.

[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.740]
It's from Tuesday to Thursday, he talks about his car getting washed and how it's going to rain.

[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.200]
And he says it all over and over again.

[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.720]
Who cares about his car wash?

[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.340]
Yeah, but haven't he ever heard him talk about when the birds fly over?

[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.140]
Okay, I got a quote what Mike said this morning.

[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.360]
He had his car washed by Spencer on Wednesday and a flock of Seagulls flew over and he said,

[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.840]
I'm getting a little tired of that crap, I can tell you right now.

[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.640]
Well, I tell you, I think he goes over his car all the time.

[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.440]
Well, hey, listen, have a great life, okay?

[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.860]
We know what, that's probably Jimmy Cephalo's boyfriend calling.

[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.060]
We have an open line in day, 751-1 on the starline at star IOD.

[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.120]
And we're doing it today.

[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:00.680]
I'll tell you that.

[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.340]
Here's Tallahassee, for example.

[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.080]
Hey, Palli.

[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.100]
How you doing, Sally?

[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:04.800]
Palli?

[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.260]
Tallah.

[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.840]
That guy was whiny.

[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:07.540]
Yeah.

[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.260]
I'm Palli, it was Cephalo's boyfriend just now.

[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.200]
Yeah, listen.

[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.480]
I have a shameless request, but I have a good reason for it.

[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:14.820]
Yeah.

[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.040]
Tomorrow I graduate.

[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:17.260]
Really?

[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:17.680]
Yes.

[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:18.360]
Nightingale.

[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.000]
About 35?

[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.140]
Tallahassee, Leon County Civic Center.

[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.760]
Graduate from what?

[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.220]
FSU?

[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:23.580]
Yes.

[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.120]
No.

[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.120]
Yeah, history.

[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.100]
Knock me down and kick me in the teeth, man.

[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.980]
Four and a half years, that's not bad.

[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.040]
And I'm doing it.

[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.960]
Yeah, with Mrs. Robinson probably.

[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.660]
Well, I heard a few other selected ladies.

[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.980]
But anyway, here's my request.

[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.480]
I want to hear a young Neil.

[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.320]
You haven't played it in years.

[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.780]
So in other words, you do want to graduate, is that what you're saying?

[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:45.860]
I want to graduate.

[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:46.280]
Yeah.

[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.460]
Then why did you do that?

[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.060]
Of all the cards, we must have, I would say, 3,000 cards in the studio.

[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:53.620]
Yeah.

[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.060]
Of all the ones you could have asked for, that's the one I absolutely will not play.

[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:57.500]
Why?

[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.020]
Because I don't, because it's boring.

[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.260]
It's tedious, man.

[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.360]
It's ponderous.

[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.840]
It's like Casey.

[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.720]
No, it's not like Casey.

[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.500]
It goes on and on and on.

[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.660]
But I want to tape it.

[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.240]
Is it on any of the Camilo's house stuff?

[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.580]
It's on the brand new Best of, as a matter of fact.

[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.440]
It's on this year's.

[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.500]
That should be an incentive since you're graduating

[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.260]
to a cut loose with 22 bucks.

[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:17.740]
All right.

[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.240]
I'll use some of my thousands of dollars I'm going to get.

[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.220]
Now, how about a second choice?

[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.080]
I got to go with the bridge tender.

[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.560]
How about young Neil?

[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.080]
Young Neil, I want young Neil.

[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.100]
Do you want the young Neil?

[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:33.520]
Yeah.

[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.840]
Well, it's the first time for everything.

[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:35.840]
Well, no, I don't do it.

[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.900]
Well, have a great day, man.

[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.520]
Don't be so defensive just because you're in Tallahassee.

[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.260]
You have a little sense.

[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.300]
You'd lighten up a little bit.

[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.560]
Yeah, just because you're up there with a bunch of Yahoo's.

[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:43.900]
Yeah.

[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.460]
I'm moving back to, you know, where?

[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.160]
Where?

[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.840]
I was waiting for your card there with Randy.

[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.720]
This guy, he wants to request, every card that we don't want to play,

[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.860]
he wants to program the damn show.

[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.580]
I don't know where the hell is the hell is the hell is the card?

[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:03.340]
Where the hell is the card?

[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:03.340]

[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.940]
It's not up there.

[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.260]
It's not there, George.

[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.800]
Where the hell is the card?

[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.460]
Oh, Jesus.

[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.080]
You must be the guy that comes in here every morning and pulls one card out.

[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.820]
And then you call me up and say, oh, I want to hear whatever one you pulled out of here.

[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.740]
It's like a conspiracy to drive me nuts.

[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.580]
Fire him.

[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.460]
Where the hell is it?

[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.200]
It's not here.

[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:23.800]
Well, I'm moving back there.

[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.840]
God, I could swear that the card was here yesterday.

[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:26.680]
Where?

[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:27.540]
There you go.

[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:28.700]
See you.

[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.140]
Good luck.

[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:29.820]
Wait, Neil.

[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:30.900]
Say goodbye, yes.

[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.400]
Wait my parents are driving up here right now.

[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.860]
I want to call them a bunch of...

[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:34.260]
Oh.

[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.200]
Gosh, I hope they give you some help.

[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.240]
Have a great time.

[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:37.860]
Take it, please.

[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.400]
See you.

[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.080]
God.

[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.060]
On and on and on and on and on and on.

[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.920]
He should be in at, uh, on and on and on.

[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.120]
Is what he should be in.

[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.980]
I think he's probably the goddamn founder and it is a bugging me for cards like...

[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:54.140]
What?

[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:59.960]
Now, back to the Neil Rogers program on 1240 WGBA.

[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.700]
Here again, America's youngest dog show host, six-year-old Neil Rogers.

[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.280]
Okay, I guess we're done with Neil.

[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.640]
And there's four minutes left in the hour.

[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.280]
Let's take some calls.

[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.060]
The police.

[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:16.740]
Hello.

[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.700]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.700]
How's it going?

[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:19.680]
Great.

[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.180]
That's good.

[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.100]
Russell, I can't film my subscription to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.

[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.340]
Uh, the good old DNC.

[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.260]
What an abortion that paper is.

[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.240]
Then I asked how many other people did likewise and they said, no, my business.

[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.100]
Yeah, well, they're real nice over there.

[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.400]
Okay, well, I just thought I'd let you know.

[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.980]
You're a fine American.

[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360]
Have a nice life.

[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:45.980]
Hello.

[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:46.600]
Hello.

[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.220]
I want to speak to Neil.

[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.360]
You got him.

[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.020]
Am I on?

[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.160]
Yeah.

[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.560]
Neil?

[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:54.840]
Yeah.

[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.800]
Neil, you're a stinky pink old glue sniffing bedwaters at a pansy.

[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.340]
They call.

[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.160]
This is the day so far.

[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.360]
Did he say pansy?

[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.200]
I want to see it off.

[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.980]
What a mong bring.

[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:15.980]
I run my bike 30 miles every Saturday to the show and this guy calls me named.

[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.860]
She's on you, sir.

[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.480]
She's on you.

[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:25.300]
By the way, have you seen some of those back boys at the new AMP?

[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.040]
No, what are you cackling about?

[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.020]
Hey, good.

[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.220]
This is my son.

[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:41.560]
A million producers in the world and they stick me in here with an egg.

[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.160]
Shit is my car.

[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.760]
Sonica Castle.

[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:49.360]
Hello.

[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.400]
Oh, Neil.

[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.940]
You're used to be such a nice boy.

[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.060]
And now you're so terrible.

[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.380]
Yeah, but you can't share it off.

[00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.960]
You can't share it off.

[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.340]
I don't need this.

[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.620]
It offers from other stations.

[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.860]
Patavia, Almira, Fredonia.

[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:19.660]
But instead I stay here and entertain you grotesque sub-human dutabag.

[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.780]
Unbelievable.

[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.060]
Geneva, hello.

[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.120]
Hello, is this Neil Rogers?

[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.520]
What kind of phone are you on, sir?

[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.100]
How's that again?

[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.800]
Do you have a dial phone or what?

[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.560]
No, I had to put it to the operator.

[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:39.380]
Let's...

[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:41.720]
Let's...

[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.600]
Let's not get into that.

[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.020]
Hey, I was listening to Joey Reynolds on WKBW last night.

[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.300]
Somebody asked you.

[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.800]
Did you hear what he's been saying about you?

[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.560]
No, I don't listen anymore.

[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.800]
He's a daughtering old man.

[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.940]
He claims he's only 40.

[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.980]
Yeah, right.

[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.580]
And Joey's being true and true.

[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.780]
Oh, shut up.

[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:04.800]
And you're pathetic.

[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.420]
And if you think he's bad now, what totally happened?

[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.460]
Oh, boy.

[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.680]
Okay, when we come back, maybe the egg will come out of his shell.

[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.620]
But I hope not.

[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.880]
Okay, did you get it, pal?

[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.080]
I sure hope so, because we're not playing it again till next year.

[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.880]
There we go.

[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.740]
I love it.

[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.720]
Instead of the old much too fast, we have the new very appropriately slow.

[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.460]
So we're never going to have an open line in Braw or again.

[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.680]
That's more their speed.

[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.900]
Now we're catching on.

[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.800]
Took a few years.

[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.140]
21 till noon at WIOD.

[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.800]
Oh, man, am I sick.

[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:48.940]
It was a good sick, though.

[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:50.480]
It was...

[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.340]
I felt so good coming in here this morning.

[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.940]
The hockey thing, and I felt like my ears are open.

[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.020]
I felt full of vinegar and the other stuff.

[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.180]
And then all this food started popping up all over the building.

[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.820]
And Pete D. Simone just came in here and shook my hand.

[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.880]
And apologized.

[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.840]
Yeah, come back in here, shake this, Pete.

[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.880]
Let's go to a poppano.

[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:11.200]
Hello.

[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:12.800]
Hello.

[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.220]
Yes.

[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.700]
I have three topics for you today.

[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.220]
Yes.

[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.020]
The hockey harness racing is a new key to race bike.

[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:21.600]
Yeah.

[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.880]
What do you think?

[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.520]
hockey, but could no till never have to leave.

[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.100]
They have their home sport here.

[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:27.640]
Yeah.

[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.360]
How about the harness racing?

[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:30.940]
Yeah.

[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.040]
No tax break.

[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:33.420]
We're gone.

[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.960]
That'll leave a lot of hope.

[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.080]
What are you doing?

[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.220]
Are you talking in shorthand?

[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:40.520]
Or are you...

[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.880]
This is the same guy that called as Jim Richie the other day.

[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:44.120]
That's right.

[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:44.560]
Yeah.

[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.380]
You're right.

[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:45.820]
Yeah.

[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.100]
Do the same more on you.

[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.840]
Just as boring today as you were the other day.

[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.460]
It's Joe Hartman again.

[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.440]
We have an open line in Broward 524.

[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.740]
So what's the story?

[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:55.820]
How come we haven't had a call?

[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.140]
You know, that's the thing that really frosts my can.

[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.300]
When I need somebody from poppano park to call in on that bat line

[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.020]
and let us know what the hell is really...

[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.700]
I mean, there's an article here old durus' quote of poppano may close

[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.880]
and the legislature hasn't done this and we don't have the tax break.

[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.080]
I mean, you know, we're just all sitting here holding the damn racing for.

[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.300]
We're holding a program waiting for Jeff Gregory to win another race.

[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.600]
And I don't think any of us can live that long.

[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.640]
Pembroke Pines.

[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.220]
Neil.

[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:22.620]
Yes.

[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.620]
Hey, I'm coming home yesterday here about the hockey looking front of me

[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.880]
on a bag of a tow truck, one of them French Canadian cars.

[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:30.620]
Oh, great.

[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.000]
Listen, I put on Richard Bay this morning.

[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.060]
He's all rained out.

[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.680]
Yeah, I heard they got some kind of a special on there.

[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.240]
What are they doing?

[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.360]
There are metal lands, parkways, underwater,

[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.820]
and Lloyd Lindsay Young stuck out in traffic

[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.800]
and telling everybody that it's raining and stuff.

[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:44.940]
Well, listen, I'm not exciting.

[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.900]
Yeah, and channel four you put on,

[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.180]
they don't tell you anything about hockey,

[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.960]
but they'll show you that it's raining in New York.

[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.060]
Well, listen, that's great.

[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.420]
And that it's snowing in Buffalo.

[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:52.700]
Yeah.

[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.880]
Like that's a bulletin.

[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.300]
How about Tony Cigreto, huh?

[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.220]
What an asshole, man.

[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.700]
I am so disgusted with him.

[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.260]
He's just a self-promoting clown.

[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.440]
Where did I get the...

[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:00.920]
Where did I get the...

[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.860]
You said it. Have a great day.

[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:02.240]

[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.360]
Okay, great day.

[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.040]
Here's a mobile in poppano.

[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:05.840]
How you doing?

[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.380]
Okay.

[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.280]
I went to the hockey game the other night and enjoyed the hell out of it.

[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:09.540]
Yeah?

[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.980]
You know what the best part was?

[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:15.060]
I don't know if anyone called it told you that in between the second and third period

[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.820]
they were having spectators come down and shoot the puck in the net.

[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:19.340]
Yeah.

[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.540]
And the like the...

[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.540]
I announcer for lack of a better term was Paul Castronoval.

[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:25.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.380]
And he had a resounding round of booze.

[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.140]
He was a mess.

[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:32.600]
That's the truth.

[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.960]
Anyway, I'm so people will verify it.

[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:35.760]
It was great.

[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.560]
I love it.

[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.600]
It was great.

[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.740]
What a puffed up piece of shot he is.

[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.020]
Yeah, but you know, Wayne Izinga is God.

[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.400]
We should have wrecked the monument to this guy if I can say that.

[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.000]
By the way, you know who's always talking about Paul Castronoval

[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.900]
like he's his big buddy and calling him on the air?

[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.360]
Joey.

[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.040]
Joey.

[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.100]
So what does that tell you?

[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.920]
Losers of a feather flock together.

[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.260]
Little Joey or Joey Reynolds?

[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:55.940]
Joey Reynolds.

[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.620]
Oh, well that's who cares.

[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.100]
Yeah.

[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.800]
Well anyway, I just wanted to pass that bit.

[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.480]
Well now you got something to look forward to.

[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.740]
You got like 80 or what is it?

[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.700]
81 games they play, 82 something like that.

[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.760]
You got like a whole flock load for the after.

[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:08.800]
You really want to know the truth.

[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.060]
I live in Cooper City.

[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.960]
I can't wait for them to build that new stadium up by Joe Robby.

[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.680]
You and me both.

[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.660]
You and me both.

[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:14.680]

[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.440]
That would be the greatest thing and then I might even become a heat fan.

[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:17.960]
That's right.

[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.960]
I pray to God to heat come with them because you know my amoea arena is great

[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.380]
but who the hell wants to go down there every day?

[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:24.820]
Right.

[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.760]
But I would go to Joe Robby every day.

[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.880]
In fact going in that area it's like kind of like playing Russian roulette with a gun

[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.200]
that's got all six bullets out.

[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.660]
Yeah, you don't have much of a chance.

[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.400]
Thanks Neil.

[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.220]
Have a great weekend.

[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.720]
I am an imbecile.

[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.420]
I just noticed something that in one of your interviews with John Candy I believe it looked like

[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.780]
an older interview you had less hair than you have today.

[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.140]
How do you explain that?

[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.860]
I don't wear a wig sir.

[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:47.880]
Paint your ball spot.

[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.080]
What ball spot?

[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.500]
You paint your ball spot.

[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.860]
I don't know what you're talking about sir my hair grows.

[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.500]
You paint your ball spot.

[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.820]
I don't have a ball spot.

[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.040]
How come you had less hair on the tape?

[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.740]
Maybe my hair grew.

[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.640]
Maybe I had a bad haircut that day.

[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.980]
By the way something.

[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.180]
What do you care?

[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.080]
Paint your ball spot.

[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:07.780]
I don't.

[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.080]
Do you paint your ball spot?

[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.360]
Paint your ball spot?

[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:11.200]
I'm sick.

[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.900]
Have you ever smoked pot?

[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.280]
I don't have the answer.

[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.720]
I used to know it and I don't know it.

[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.020]
There is a formula but I don't know what it is.

[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.280]
Okay, well he's going off the air pretty soon so I figure we better get as much of the

[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.660]
kingmeister as we can.

[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.180]
He's going to be on daytime but not in this market and not in too many markets.

[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.420]
Boy is he in a dream world huh?

[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.500]
We have an open line by the way I just mentioned in passing since we do have like 8000 lines

[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.340]
but there is one little blue line in that is not lit at the moment.

[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:43.300]
It's very disconcerting at 524 and I do want to mention that at the home show at the Beach

[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.760]
Convention Center we got our Camilla South WYOD booth in the main lobby with all our

[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:54.140]
best of tapes and CDs and t-shirts 6 to 10 tonight, noon to 10 tomorrow, noon to 930 Sunday

[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.820]
and Monday from 1 to 5 and 6 to 10 in the PM.

[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.700]
So tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and most of the day on Monday, you can go by the convention

[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.100]
center on the beach and make an ice donation to Camilla South and pick up your good stuff.

[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:13.580]
Okay and our 18 T Camilla South Hotline is working now all across the state 1-800-852-006.

[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:17.820]
We got 55,094 and counting and we're doing pretty damn well.

[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.540]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:19.800]
Hello.

[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:20.660]
Leo.

[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.020]
Yeah.

[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.280]
I got a name for our hockey team.

[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.560]
How about Miami Ice?

[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:25.840]
Okay great.

[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.100]
We have an open line.

[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.360]
Let's leave that to Norm Kent.

[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:28.780]
Okay.

[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.400]
I'm not going to spend four hours here today.

[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:30.700]
Wasted.

[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:31.780]
Oh God.

[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.220]
I mean, I just, I'm at a lack for words for these guys to get on the year and spend an entire

[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:36.580]
show.

[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.280]
Oh, we got some certificates here.

[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.460]
Let's give a certificate for the best name for the new hockey team and they spend like

[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:41.860]
hours.

[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.860]
Oh, I mean, that's such exciting radio.

[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.000]
It's enough to make me barf on my shoes.

[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:46.860]
Come on Norm.

[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.240]
God almighty.

[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.180]
He's surrounded by nothing but hate and homophobia and venom and psychosis on that station

[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:57.900]
and his best shot and I do mean shot is to come back and oh, let's name the new hockey

[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.400]
team.

[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.720]
Oh, please Norm, go to court and do a job for somebody who needs you.

[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.760]
Here's a mobile and beautiful Palm Beach.

[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.820]
Leo, what did you have to put in Randy's mouth to make your son like that?

[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.740]
I beg your pardon, sir.

[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.580]
You figure it out.

[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.140]
Okay.

[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:16.540]
That it?

[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:17.600]
That's it.

[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.220]
So help me.

[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:22.180]
Anybody that calls and suggests an aim for the hockey team, you're going to be gone so

[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:22.720]
fast.

[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.740]
That line.

[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.180]
What?

[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.440]
Norm can't.

[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.300]
Norm can't.

[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:27.580]
Yeah.

[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:28.160]
How good?

[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.380]
You don't have enough time on your own radio show?

[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:34.560]
Hey, listen, I'll give you $100 for Camille's house, but don't knock my Florida freeze.

[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.920]
I'm going to be there in the first few.

[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.800]
All freeze this, freeze this, my God.

[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.100]
You're on that station over there with all these right wing obnoxious homophobic asshole

[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.860]
geeks sitting around and playing grab ass with each other on a year all day and you're

[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.060]
on there.

[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.640]
Oh, what's the name for the hockey team?

[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.480]
Come on, Norm.

[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.940]
Hey, sometimes Neil, when they're, you know, when they're crushing, you just got to

[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.800]
laugh at them and stare in their face and come up with something funny.

[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.240]
The audience in the morning wants to be walking up to cheer, not bad.

[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.420]
I got news for you, Norm.

[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.700]
Your an audience ain't never going to wake up, okay?

[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.080]
Because in forest lawn, they're not waking up again.

[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:04.600]
Trust me.

[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.240]
Hey, I have 12 plus in my audience.

[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.920]
You got 95 plus.

[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.740]
All right, that, the donation to Camille's house just went down to 90.

[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.360]
It went up to 110 just for this call.

[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.500]
I'm telling you, once just to say something nice about me, just one.

[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.960]
I already said you're the best criminal attorney in the Eastern USA.

[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.080]
All right, I'll watch my East and USA.

[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:24.540]
You too.

[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.040]
Take care.

[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.300]
I will say something nice.

[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.400]
He's a great attorney and a good guy sometimes, but overgrown child.

[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.580]
I don't want to hear about your rotisserie baseball team.

[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.180]
I don't want to hear about your God.

[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.440]
I mean, talk about self-promoting about his sports memorabilia.

[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.580]
And I don't need to think you can even say Bailia or Bailia.

[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.400]
Can you say that?

[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.820]
I don't think so, especially if Alex is on the board.

[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.600]
Unless he wants another paid vacation.

[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:50.820]
Yeah.

[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.300]
Alex says I'll go for that.

[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.900]
Let's talk about a walking enus this afternoon.

[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.600]
And get another two-week vacation for $600, $700.

[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.760]
How much did you get?

[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.020]
Because it's a lot more than, George, $400.

[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:03.900]
See, I told you.

[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:04.720]
Told you.

[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.140]
Nine, nine, nine, nine.

[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.540]
He was on his Saturday morning at exactly 904.

[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:18.700]
But nothing could prepare me when I knocked on Riley's door.

[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.840]
He was drowsy, he was grubby, and in that need of a shave,

[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.940]
he was just about to put a cad in to the microwave.

[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.420]
I asked him to use the bathroom, and he said it didn't care.

[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.280]
He was reading the sun's ethanol, mean as underwear.

[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.960]
I looked above the toilet where the towels used to be.

[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.200]
And there was fix to crucifix a face for all to see.

[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.720]
I didn't seek salvation.

[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.680]
I had come to mold alone.

[00:39:52.900 --> 00:40:00.460]
But I found Jesus in Rick Riley's chalk.

[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.360]
Yes, brother, Rick, he changed my life on that dental day.

[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.560]
Cos by the time I washed my hands, I'd washed my sins away.

[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.140]
Now I'll learn to be intolerant.

[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.260]
I'll watch Ted Robertson, and I'll vote for Ted.

[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.120]
You can't believe it if he doesn't run.

[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.660]
I'll pretend to be a hipster.

[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.040]
But my liberal days are gone.

[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:34.200]
Cos I found Jesus in Rick Riley's chalk.

[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.460]
But...

[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.680]
Oh, God!

[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.140]
Okay, Miramar.

[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:50.880]
I just want to call you and just tell you how ridiculous I think you're always.

[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.100]
I don't know.

[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:59.740]
I guess basically the only reason I ever listened to it is just to hear your...

[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.040]
Disgusting little views on everything.

[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.660]
God, you sound like you're just losing it.

[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.100]
You're coming apart of the seams.

[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:11.500]
I mean, like today, for instance, you're talking about this ice hockey thing in South Florida.

[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.440]
About what?

[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.180]
Ice hockey.

[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.740]
No, we don't have to call it ice hockey.

[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.700]
We just call it hockey.

[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.120]
Everybody knows it's played on ice.

[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.360]
Oh, you're skitting on thing ice right now.

[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.340]
Why don't you grow up?

[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.640]
If you don't like it, nobody's going to force you to go.

[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.820]
But don't start here dictating what my show should be.

[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.840]
And whether we should like hockey or not, go find a life you asshole.

[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.860]
God, what a stupid punk, man.

[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.220]
Now that I've been elected president, I just don't have enough time to chase babes

[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.060]
and listen to Neil Rogers one to two hour party on day.

[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.960]
Are you kidding?

[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.460]
Last month alone, I spent $180 bucks on condoms.

[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.620]
If you're on the babepot roll, safe sex can be a major budget item.

[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.760]
That's why you need to feed e7 condoms cleaner.

[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.500]
With dd7, a pair of gobs and safety goggles,

[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.340]
you'll be able to use your condoms again and again,

[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:05.020]
cutting your monthly bill by 85%.

[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.460]
Hey, Harry, look what I found in the parking lot.

[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.600]
Geez, Harry, what do you want to pick up something like that for?

[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.640]
Are you kidding?

[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:16.120]
With a little dd7, I'll knock half a buck off my monthly condom bill.

[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.960]
Pass me those safety goggles, will you?

[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.320]
You're still a virgin, aren't you?

[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:19.660]
Yeah.

[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.700]
No, dd7 condom cleaner.

[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.620]
And for you really big guys, try new dd13.

[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.860]
107 at WIOD or dd4 for the people in this place.

[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.000]
Let's continue moving along, singing a song.

[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.500]
When we're getting those trends from Tampa,

[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.840]
they must be really bad this time, huh?

[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.840]
Like about a point eight.

[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.020]
See, the hurricane month is dropping off this time,

[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.980]
so there are no excuses if it's really bad.

[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.020]
It means it's just a death wish, it's hopeless.

[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.600]
And based on what my gut feelings are about that particular market,

[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:48.960]
I think it probably is.

[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:49.940]
I don't have a bone spot.

[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:54.520]
This week on MTV's Unplugged Junus for the Mellow Sounds of Megatef.

[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.560]
I want to suck your blood,

[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.580]
and eat your flesh,

[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:00.860]
and kill your family.

[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.080]
I love death.

[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.600]
You'll hear their biggest hits in our all-acoustic format.

[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.580]
I'm a leopard from hell,

[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.520]
who feeds on human skin,

[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.400]
murder and evil are my only friends.

[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.520]
Armageddon's your violent end,

[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:23.280]
die, die, die.

[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.060]
That's right, this Sunday,

[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.740]
here are the intimate sounds of Megatef on MTV's Unplugged.

[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.920]
Or as I say in England, up-chuck and die.

[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.600]
Meteorologist Bob Subbers,

[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.200]
actor at Forecast here.

[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.820]
New stop radio 610.

[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.680]
Come with you, my O.D.

[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.540]
We're doing it.

[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.080]
We're crawling up there in Tampa, man.

[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:47.960]
We just got the numbers.

[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.500]
Tom Velvita is like changing his underwear right now.

[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.860]
We're starting to creep up a little bit,

[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.500]
and the interesting part of it is,

[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:55.580]
on the pages I'm looking at,

[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.600]
FLA had a great trend, they went up,

[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.480]
and we went up.

[00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.560]
It's not the same audience.

[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.280]
I've told you that.

[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.240]
We're not interested in those old parts

[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.280]
who are looking for, you know,

[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.460]
the same old tired crap.

[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:06.360]
That's not what we want.

[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.720]
Now let's see, 25 to 54.

[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.700]
Overall, this is the whole day,

[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.100]
WSU went, goes from a 1-1 to a 1-4.

[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:15.600]
Mornings went down.

[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:16.640]
What does that tell you?

[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:17.720]
0.9 to a 0.6.

[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.760]
Middays from a 1-4 to a 1-8.

[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.140]
Wait till you hear nighttime.

[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.140]
Afternoon 1-2 to a 1-2 flat.

[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.820]
Night time, Randy.

[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.320]
I'm going to tell you something, Randy.

[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.240]
If you don't hit them for some serious money,

[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.860]
after this trend today, you're a wimp.

[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.580]
And I know you're not.

[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:37.600]
Night times 25 to 54 from a 0.9 to a 2-4.

[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.940]
The highest number of the day at night.

[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.140]
And that's incredible.

[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:45.560]
That's unbelievable.

[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:46.880]
Woo!

[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.020]
Man, 18 plus from a 1-5 to a 2.

[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.300]
The whole station of SUN.

[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.360]
Middays from a 2-1 to a 2-5.

[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.380]
Afternoons of 1-8 to a 2-3.

[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.220]
And nighttime from a 1-4 to a 2-8.

[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:03.660]
Oh!

[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:05.860]
Did I tell you?

[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.520]
I'm going to say something right now.

[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.180]
And I hope that Bob Green is listening.

[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.840]
I hope Bob Neil is listening.

[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.240]
I hope everybody, I hope Boy, Gary is listening.

[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.100]
And I hope the assholes, including Jeff Clark back in sales,

[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.040]
are listening, okay?

[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.580]
This garbage about getting the Miami heat on this radio station.

[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.180]
And all this other garbage at night.

[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.120]
You've got a goddess on there at night.

[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.480]
I'm not just joking about that.

[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:26.940]
This broad is great.

[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.820]
I mean, Boy, Gary stepped into a bucket of shot when he hired her.

[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.460]
It's just the greatest thing since sliced bread.

[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:32.540]
She's dynamite.

[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.140]
She's fun.

[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.220]
She's caught on.

[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:34.940]
She's a hit.

[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:36.080]
Like in the network.

[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:36.860]
Remember that?

[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.360]
He's a hit, damn it.

[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.060]
A big, big fat hooter hit.

[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.480]
And they want to clutter up the night.

[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.240]
Forget about all that sports, man.

[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.180]
It's a ton of work.

[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.080]
It's a loss.

[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.740]
It's not even a lost leader.

[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.740]
It's a lost loser.

[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.340]
Let QAM have it.

[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.500]
Let somebody else have it.

[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.960]
And stop with all this sports crap.

[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.380]
Make up your mind what you want to be.

[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:59.180]
If you want to be the entertainment station, man.

[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:03.020]
If you want this thing to fly, we can just kick smelly, gigantic butt.

[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.660]
But stop screwing up the thing with like with this game tonight.

[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.700]
Very university in the Miami.

[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.560]
Crowd of less than 2,000.

[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.120]
The game is on TV on Sunshine.

[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.460]
And we're carrying it on a radio because we get the

[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.960]
blackmailed in order to carry you in football.

[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.760]
We got to carry all this other stuff that nobody cares about.

[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.820]
Randy doesn't have really a show until Monday.

[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.060]
She'll be on after the game tonight.

[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.760]
And that should be like about 9 30 10 o'clock for like a brief hour hour and a quarter.

[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.600]
I hope during that period of time she takes these numbers.
