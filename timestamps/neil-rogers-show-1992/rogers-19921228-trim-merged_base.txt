[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220]
So Henry, which stuff and player really has the biggest red quiz, Henry?

[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.380]
Henry tells all today.

[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.420]
Used off radio 610, WIOD presents the Neil Roger Show.

[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.800]
And those out on mobility customers make it a free call by dialing star, IOD.

[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.300]
Now, the Neil Roger Show on new stock radio 610, WIOD.

[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.840]
Hey, Stion of bitches, look!

[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.500]
God!

[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.460]
Oh!

[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.880]
Pugh!

[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.700]
Miami has to offer the greatest football to you.

[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.680]
We take the ball from cold and cold and go like no less.

[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.620]
We're in the air, we're on the ground, we're always in control.

[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.620]
And when you say Miami, you're talking super.

[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.940]
Because we're the Miami dog ones.

[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.620]
Miami dog ones.

[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.980]
Miami dog ones number one.

[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.900]
Yes, we're the Miami dog ones.

[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.040]
Miami dog ones.

[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.860]
Miami dog ones number one.

[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.160]
It's all a big joke, right?

[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.180]
Just a joke, it's just a put-off.

[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.240]
It is played with our minds, right?

[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.420]
They're played with our brains.

[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.700]
Oh, so Henry said it might be Mark Clayton, but he'd have to recheck.

[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:43.500]
Now, Henry was telling me earlier in the wake of that story about Clayton opening up his big stupid mouth again that all those years he spent doing a post game interviews in the door for locker room, he knows.

[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.580]
He knows the hose, man.

[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.820]
So it's 1007 at WIOD after a just puke inducing.

[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.020]
Sunday, hope you had a great holiday, have a happy new year and a great life.

[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.400]
And we're in the playoffs, man, we're the champions.

[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.380]
Oh, God.

[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.260]
It's all a big joke.

[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.220]
It's just, it's got to be a joke, isn't it?

[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.240]
Isn't it a put-on?

[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.200]
Can't be for real.

[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.960]
We're the champions, we did it.

[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.520]
Dolphins won the AFC, we got to buy as in, buy, buy.

[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.760]
Rumor has it, the offense missed the plane to Boston over the weekend.

[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.700]
Thank God for Pete's story, Anavitch, man, that's our only hope.

[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.820]
And how about that dick McPherson, the coach of the Patriots?

[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.020]
I mean, you're like marching in the last seconds of regulation.

[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.340]
They got a chance to get a field goal that might win again.

[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.040]
They got that Charlie Bauman, who actually is a pretty damn good kicker and filled in for story, Anavitch when he was holding it out last year.

[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.960]
And what does he do?

[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.780]
He takes his like high school quarterback, drop back, man, and throw it.

[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.500]
That's it.

[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.320]
Drop way back there and let him sack your ass and take us out of field goal.

[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.600]
But thank you so much, dick, and best of luck in your new endeavors, whatever that might be.

[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.980]
God.

[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.600]
We're the champions.

[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.340]
We are, we're like, I can't believe it.

[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.200]
Just pathetic.

[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.020]
And then the bills last night, 27 or 3, the Houston taking a gigantic dive.

[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.140]
But hey, you never know, we might just go all the way.

[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.060]
We might just do it.

[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.560]
And what a joke that would be.

[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.840]
You can't complain about our offense.

[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.580]
We don't have it in.

[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.120]
How about those buck and ears, man?

[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.440]
Are they doing it or what?

[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.460]
Yeah.

[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.360]
Big, big, close out the season victory at the Fienist, no less, seven or three.

[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.360]
So anyway, it says Clayton Crude about Olsen incident.

[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.880]
Now, it's interesting if you read the Miami Herald, first of all, you're probably a troublemaker if you do.

[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.040]
And secondly, you don't get the real story.

[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.580]
The Herald had like a little blurb on this and it had nothing about the real essence of the story.

[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.180]
Because I guess there's such goody two shoes at the Herald and Barry Jackson's tubers he writing like column after column after column about WQ AM.

[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.860]
And just sucking around with Jimmy Cephalo and Joseph Gackie and Hank Goldberg.

[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.120]
Oh my God, it's so great that they don't have time to give you the real sports stories.

[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.740]
But in the Sun Sentinel, it says by Michael Mayo, who likes to write about radio hot head talk hosts,

[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:15.160]
Michael Mayo says after the dolphin, 16, 13 overtime, when Sunday, Mark Clayton made some crude remarks about former Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olsen,

[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.100]
a victim of sexual harassment in the Patriots locker room two years ago.

[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.280]
Clayton referred to Olsen as a Renquist watcher as he was getting dressed.

[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.140]
Well, it's just got a blank there.

[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.980]
Okay, but you know they want to say Renquist.

[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.720]
Clayton was upset that a locker room door was open allowing frigid air inside when he screamed to no one and prayed to him.

[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.060]
And so he said, well, in particular, closed the door and keep a Lisa Olsen outside.

[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.200]
Make sure to leave that.

[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.760]
Renquist watch her outside said big mark.

[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.920]
No female reporters were big mark were present at the time, but the locker room was filled with media from South Florida and the Boston area, etc.

[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.940]
So there you go, opening up his big fat stupid mouth.

[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.760]
One more time at a boy, Mark.

[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.160]
We love you.

[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.720]
Just keep catching the ball and shut up.

[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.160]
Our Camille, South total is 86 to 88.

[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.420]
Sorry, 88,630 bucks.

[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.820]
We're going to go over 90 before January, not bad.

[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.380]
We have till the 31st of January.

[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.460]
We got another month to go.

[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.740]
We'd like to get to 150, which would be our all time records going to be tough.

[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.540]
Gonna have to have like a big push.

[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.960]
Like on that AT&T Camille, South, South line number today, toll free.

[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.520]
1 800 852.

[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.760]
Oh, oh, oh, six.

[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.360]
My juicy man juicer.

[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.760]
Hey, I got a great glass apple juice.

[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.600]
One and then on the, yeah, and then it broke.

[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.980]
It's already broken.

[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.780]
It's already as useless as dried doggy do.

[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.720]
Although it does do a good job on dried doggy do man, delicious.

[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.480]
In fact, I put a banana in there.

[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.880]
I want to do apple banana juice.

[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.920]
This is a true story.

[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.140]
And I, because apple banana is great juice.

[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.460]
And banana.

[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.180]
Right out the back into the pulp thing.

[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.160]
Yeah, the whole thing right out the back.

[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.660]
No, I didn't put the peel in there just a banana.

[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.780]
And it spit the whole thing out of the back.

[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.360]
See the lesson and I learned a very hard, I'm gonna send that thing back.

[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.120]
It's a piece of crap.

[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.880]
Anything you see on TV is crap, okay?

[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.980]
Especially an infomercial.

[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.420]
If it was a good product, it would be in the stores.

[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.120]
They could sell it in the store.

[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.560]
But of course, when it's in the store, you can see it and put your hands on it and squeeze it and feel it.

[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.280]
And then you know it's a piece of plastic and a piece of crap and nobody would buy it.

[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.060]
So that's why they spend millions of dollars to sell millions of these products to suckers like me.

[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.140]
Like Ron Popeel with the spray it on here.

[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.440]
And with the vegematic, with little, a, four cent piece of plastic thing that's supposed to cut up your fruit.

[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.540]
It's all a bunch of crap.

[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.660]
So don't ever get sucked into buying anything off TV, okay?

[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.460]
I guess I can say that now that Buddy Bud sold his home shopping.

[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.280]
Now where he won't get upset.

[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.300]
Well, of course he will.

[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.860]
A bunch of crap.

[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.760]
It's garbage.

[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.780]
So I guess the deal with the juicer, at least that one is history.

[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.900]
Ed Till, man, I could do hours on Ed Till, all the Randy already did it Saturday.

[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.380]
I was in hysterics.

[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.960]
Saturday, she was, she came on.

[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.680]
No, let's see, that's right.

[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.720]
He was on Friday afternoon.

[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.720]
He is so bad and so terminal and so happy.

[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.680]
He's Mr. Rock and Roll of Talkos.

[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.720]
Well, hey, how about that priest and how about that little black kid, huh?

[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.520]
What do you think?

[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.480]
And how about that for my conferenture?

[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.240]
Should it be what?

[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.840]
What do you think?

[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.460]
And then some pseudonym intellectual asshole calls him up and somewhere along the line, the guy is sucking around like most callers are known to do.

[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.660]
And he says to Ed Till.

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.980]
Well, I could tell by your syntax that you were a very bright guy.

[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.380]
And Ed Till says, even a line that Joey wouldn't use.

[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.940]
He says, oh, syntax, do they have that in Florida too?

[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:43.900]
A syntax?

[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.420]
Oh, and I just about, he d'all over my shoes and my feet and my little toes.

[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.940]
I mean, just, and then he goes from that into a big thing.

[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.200]
Well, you know, in Illinois, we even have a tax on food and on milk.

[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.340]
How do you like that?

[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.340]
How do you like that?

[00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.460]
Oh, God.

[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.240]
Send him back and don't ever let him back here again.

[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.840]
In fact, I know the perfect place for Ed Till where he'd fit in like a glove.

[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.600]
Either at, he'd fit in perfect in FLA.

[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.180]
He'd be right up there, Ali, or...

[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.840]
WLASER, talk radio 890.

[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.660]
Perfect for them.

[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.140]
1013 on the IOD Network, George.

[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.100]

Time to blow your brains out, man.

[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:39.840]
You got it, Neil.

[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.780]
And let me tell you, I believe honestly,

[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.880]
that the dolphins are playing as well as anybody in the AFC.

[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.340]
And I couldn't think of it.

[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.440]
Neil.

[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:48.380]
Listen to that.

[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.200]
Neil.

[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:50.680]

[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:50.860]
Neil.

[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.100]

[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.200]
Neil.

[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.200]

[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.200]

[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.200]

[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.200]

[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:55.220]

[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:55.220]

[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:55.220]

[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:55.220]

[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.260]
I'm thinking of the feery second of that Pucke inducing

[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.640]
grotesque disgusting revolting, nauseating

[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.120]
and very careless juvenile performance yesterday with an offense

[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.500]
that like i said miss the plane entirely

[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.560]
and you got the balls to tell me that they're playing better ball than anybody

[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.520]
the fc

[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.360]
i didn't think better

[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.280]
i said i think

[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.860]
blowman that offense sucks those guys should go to rehab somewhere they make me

[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.620]
nauseous

[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.720]
they are pathetic

[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.640]
first play at the game or against the high school team in a quarterback hands

[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.660]
off to this like little league running back and he drops the ball on the ground

[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.040]
first play at the game and we got the ball on the eighteen yard line

[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.400]
and we stagger through our usual freeing out and have to count on story

[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.600]
and it's for a field goal right then and there

[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.800]
you knew it was gonna be a long

[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.520]
nauseating puke

[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.380]
inducing day

[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.860]
you have a look at it this way get out of here don't don't lie to yourself

[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.060]
i mean it's one thing a lie to me don't delude yourself and tell me that we're

[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:51.540]
doing this

[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.500]
we suck

[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.680]
well you have to

[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.780]
but pathetic

[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.160]
you know my point is that everybody needs to everybody else also stuck

[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.260]
how about that Houston game is last night exactly what about Kansas City how

[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.680]
about sandy a go you tell me that if we play if we would have played the game

[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.340]
we played last sunday night or yesterday against a reasonable team

[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.500]
keeping in mind not only were we playing the patriots yesterday but a battered

[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.860]
up patriots without half of their players with a fourth string quarterback who

[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.040]
didn't even know how to get out of high school

[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.900]
i mean come on

[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.080]
you know give me a break

[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.620]
this is an offensive line that's allowed sixty three sex this season and we got

[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.540]
to the quarterback twice during the entire game okay well nil will just have

[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.460]
that and a dick mcpherson wasn't an imbasil i didn't uh... throw away the

[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.780]
chance for the field going last two minutes we might never been any over time

[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.840]
i heard an interview with mcpherson apparently the quarterback was uh... not

[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.120]
supposed to do it he did right

[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.340]
but then any case

[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.580]
your least it a lot of

[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.240]
what does that have to do with anything

[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.760]
now i'm just changing the topic okay have a great day

[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.040]
we have an open line and date seven five one two and brown word five two four

[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.180]
and one on our world famous florida line

[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.200]
i mean these people in this town and you know support your teams whatever they are

[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.160]
go out there pay your hard-earned money

[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160]
be a fan but don't lie

[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.720]
like last week that punk hit on the roof of his life all this offense is great

[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.180]
every week i go to the game they're great how can you say these things because

[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.820]
they're true you idiot you imbasil you punk you

[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.980]
meet head

[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.700]
they ought to be a syntax

[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.320]
i can believe you said that when he said sent and he tried to make a bit out of

[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:25.540]
that

[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.100]
and then he had some of seventy two year old bag from boka

[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.760]
and it was obvious it was the only call on the board she's going on on on on

[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.520]
and then finally she says well i remember you from Chicago how's your mom and

[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:36.840]
dad

[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.800]
only got a minute got a minute uh... uh... got them and i'll call him right now get

[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.300]
him on the phone

[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:45.340]
i'll know the uh... meet loafers in the oven right now she hung up on him

[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.520]
that's how desperate was to milk that call

[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.600]
oh god where does by and and i'm going to just want to go on record it's almost

[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.080]
the new year so might as well get out of our system

[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.240]

beasley owns that and as the week is they are they must know something

[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.940]
because it's not this company

[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.380]
nothing is ever going to change they're still going to try to buy off your

[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.980]
allegiance with hockey tickets

[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.760]

[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.760]
place you don't want to eat and other than that forget it nothing will ever

[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.320]
change because they are enchanted with mediocrity they love boy giri they love

[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.380]

[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.800]
going to get our ass kicked we're going to be so far behind by come the third quarter

[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.520]
that won't make any difference what story and if it's does although if you remember a few

[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.800]
years ago we played candid city in the playoffs and they were supposed to blow us away

[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.360]
wait a minute that was two years ago and we happened to have a hell of a season two years ago

[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.660]
and that we gave him we beat him in overtime but i mean we had a good offense two years ago

[00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.680]
we could take the ball down the field and score this team couldn't score in your house

[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.780]
i'm telling you they're pathetic i'm embarrassed i was so angry during that game

[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:13.260]

[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:40.040]
calling mr weaver i have a problem with anybody who's not a fan of a team to sit back and i mean

[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:46.580]
ridiculously ripped the dolphin why good new phone i can't take the noise i can't handle it

[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:51.240]
so anyway i'm listening on radio and watching on tv i've got the sound time turned on on tv

[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.360]
and i'm listening to mr weaver i will say this man is just doing a hell of a good job

[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.820]
i do like mandatory on a games mr weaver on the other hand has not only lost it but i mean you

[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:06.320]
you couldn't find it with a search party that's how far gone he is they have the coin toss for the

[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.800]
over time to see who's gonna receive and who's gonna defend which goal like they do at the

[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.140]
beginning of the game they do it again to go and over time for the uninitiated out there and

[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.820]
we as usual call tails and its heads and we lose the toss so no England's gonna get the ball and

[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.940]
we're gonna defend uh whatever to help go with the wind at our back right so they go into their

[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:31.020]
three-minute break they come back and mr weaver is apple plectic he is all confused he says i don't

[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.560]
get it the patriots are defending the windows shifted around and they're they're going straight into

[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.960]
the wind i don't understand they picked a two to defend the goal that they're going to get the

[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.700]
wind is blowing right in their face i don't get it well guess what Rick when you win the coin toss

[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:51.280]
you don't get to get the ball and decide which goal you're gonna defend dummy i mean he went on

[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.720]
and on he was like psychotic he just couldn't understand why they made a major mistake in strategy

[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:03.640]
oh god is somebody gonna get that man some like a life or what here's a mobile in pop it

[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:09.580]
obiach how you doing now okay i'm a dolphin fan and i just want to say that i'm content no matter

[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:16.680]
what happens uh because i don't want to yeah that's near the kind of fan we like easy to please

[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:23.500]
very easy to please because um not only did buffalo not make it uh title they're not going to have

[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.040]
a chance to go to the super ball losing now they're all screwed up and again everybody is that

[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.120]
they're all defenses injured and kelly's injured and it couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of assholes

[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:37.000]
i love it i love it if they all broke their leg if they all i had serious not life threatening but

[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.260]
just short of it injury i'd be ecstatic well you you can look back and see that buffalo didn't

[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:48.080]
spend any money on a kicker because uh they were the one probably these other super balls yeah

[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.780]
and we did uh i say bring back scot norway just one more give one more chance wide right right

[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:59.000]
take care of me okay bye bye see you that's the kind of guy we like he is eat what line was that i

[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.600]

[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.420]

[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.940]
with that great banana bread couldn't we bob up there in the dining room let's do something really

[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:15.360]
great for you let's bring him some fruit here's a mobile in four-lotterdale how you doing pretty good

[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:22.560]
i was calling because of mandatius umand early in the game if you listen to a whole game on the radio

[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.880]
no i think i about the middle of the second quarter right turn on the radio the beginning of the game

[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.280]
you saw the game they follow the first plane in wing and we kick a field goal right we kick off

[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.440]
them the first play again that we stop them the backfield and they have a penalty new England does

[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:42.420]
right so man it's the he starts literally laughing on the air and he says this team is pathetic

[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:47.020]
they're a high school team they are they deserve to be on the field i wanted him to eat his

[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:52.240]
words well later he was saying directed you hear he said uh if if the team with this quarterback

[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.740]
what's his name Jeff Carlson if if he beats us i'm a monkey okay and then he was talking about

[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.700]
having to go to the monkey jungle or whatever i mean uh it just it was incredible and he all my

[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.480]
y'all we almost sent him to the monkey jungle today thank god for where he would have fit in well by

[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.560]
the way so anavitch has got how he didn't make the probe all as a kick i know isn't that ridiculous

[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:17.200]
that's okay we know we know which side our points are buttered on and uh there's one of

[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.160]
the same and we should mention also by the way that yesterday on the first field goal he kicked that

[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.980]
put him at a hundred is the all-time leading percentage field goal kicker in the history of the

[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:31.620]
NFL we just mentioned in passing the guy is incredible yeah he is incredible uh i was going to

[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.280]
save something i'll try to remember well that's good have a great week happy new year

[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.900]
that's my tactic and it works every time just to kind of deflect him because he probably

[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:47.280]
gonna say something about my syntax we have an open line at broward now is that till what is the

[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:52.120]
deal with him does anybody know i mean why was he down here because the rumor was he was auditioning

[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.120]
on the air but he kept talking about being on the air on the loop in chicago and having some tv

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:01.100]
show up there is he getting canned or is he gotten canned i mean what is the deal all about because if

[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.120]
you go on vacation unless you have no life at all you don't go and fill in for somebody on some

[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.940]
station unless you're auditioning for a job what is the deal with him other than he's bad and he's

[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:16.640]
like a pathetic he was like a cross between Doug karek and uh dicky farkel that's what he sounded like

[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.100]
and i heard by the way i heard night rhythms on saturday night they actually had a pretty good

[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:27.740]
show the other night it's about time well you know why no he just fell on the floor you know why

[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.800]
he had a pretty good show because you weren't talking about farting in those picking for three

[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.320]
whole four hours i mean a little bit of that is okay but you can only pick it till it starts bleeding

[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.960]
and boy did miche luis do a job on micry neary on saturday i was in the car i was standing up and

[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:47.800]
cheering while i was driving god what is on vacation as we grip him real good he's at the office

[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:54.400]

boring sleep inducing piece of crap and then a whole bunch of other people's oh man the best movie

[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:30.880]
in years you got to see it homestead oh hi Neil yes sir i just got back from my Hawaiian vacation

[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.960]
from my college year before i left right how was it here was great i had a wonderful time with

[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:41.720]
i would imagine especially on Maui wack a key with a little too crowded little crowded right just a

[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:48.800]
little too yeah i had a great time i got to watch the uh my army dolphins play football on tv and

[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.760]
it was embarrassing to be a dolphin film they were playing football i think you're being very kind

[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.420]
i didn't see i didn't see much but the uh but at least i got to see him over there but

[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:04.220]
everyone don't why are they so good or why are they not it was weird why are they not yeah that's

[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.000]
what i've been asking myself for most of the season why are they not we were eleven and five and

[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.160]
quite honestly uh oh i don't even want to talk about it we played maybe two really great games

[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.780]
all season and that was it well both the games actually was three games out there and not

[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.880]
them were any good no but they showed some great well you know something even here they still

[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:27.500]
suck too so i'm gonna get least you were having a good time right the uh i went over surfing on the

[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:32.820]
north shore at sunset beach uh it was like hit or miss but i took the the tourist pass for two

[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.460]
hundred dollars you can fly all around the islands for ten days as many times as you want

[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:42.020]
so i went over to kawaii but i've seen enough blue tarps to last me the rest of my life

[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.920]
and day uh and the trees are all back to normal over there yeah but i really didn't have a good

[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.780]
time and i can see now i'm gonna try to move back over there as fast as i can

[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.740]
because it's it's really as like paradise it is you're right especially on how cost of fortune

[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.020]
live there but if you can afford it that was the only hard part was went because post uh raise

[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:07.420]
and brand was eight dollars and sixty cents a box yeah so i knew this you don't have to eat a lot

[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.520]
of that just a small amount keeps you on the go for weeks yeah that's true that's just so anyway

[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.300]
i'm i'll be back here at least for two months i'm gonna try to get my things together and try to

[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.220]
move back there as fast as i can okay good luck all right see you later see you

this guy and he may be a really nice guy but his voice is so annoying and so

[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:03.280]
planned and so lacking in personality or anything i have never heard a voice like he's been

[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.900]
sucking down packed of tobacco for about 20 years as a matter of fact he wasn't a hall this morning

yeah whatever i have well why doesn't micha louis do the voices now for that stuff he's uh

[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.400]

[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.140]
person now i didn't have a as deep of voice but at least there was personality right i mean this guy

[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:36.200]
scares you have to pull off the side of the road and take a pro-zac after every every uh every time

[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.260]
you hear him do a commercial well i think the governor paid boy gary off he's in that pro-zac lobby

[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:31.540]
are you kidding me no and it was it was embarrassing because well i was given a car and it was an

[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:36.720]
older car so you know looking at the commercial where they say i'm blast the car and they put

[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:43.680]
this stuff on yeah i put it on and it looked like i put shoe polish on right and i kept rubbing

[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:47.100]
the best part of it is that if you don't look good on a car you can take the same thing put

[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:55.220]
on your ball spot well i kept rubbing and buffing it and in the car too and it wouldn't come off

[00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:02.660]
it looked like i put shoe polish on and then buff it off and i have a bone spot yeah because cars

[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:09.160]
uh the paint finish has a clear finish on it and uh this makes it look dull so you know you

[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:15.260]
put it on the whole car yeah and your your car still ends up looking like a dull piece of crap

[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:22.280]
shot yeah right and uh i got the the the the thing here the message for everybody and i'm very

[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:27.180]
serious any infomercial you ever see on tv immediately shut it off i mean it's okay if you

[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.480]
watch it for entertainment and laugh at it but do not even think about whipping out the credit card

[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.280]
of calling them i don't even understand the audience and these commercials i mean they're all on

[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.220]
drugs haven't just seen the expressions on their faces they're all on drugs and they're getting paid

[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:10.180]
what do you do with it you put it in your fish tank no no no no no you take this it

[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:18.200]
blue green algae yes you eat it well you can make it you can usually mix it in your juice

[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:25.040]

11 15 so the big story and i absolutely hope he never calls this station again you know Vincent

[00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:45.590]
when Chuck was on last week one day doing Rick and suds Vincent called in it was when i was

[00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:51.970]
driving home and i was thinking how long is this call gonna go on and Chuck let him go on and on

[00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:59.210]
and on and on it's the same chronic Vincent that calls every radio station in town and has been

[00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:04.130]
doing it for like 20 years and somewhere in a conversation besides boring stories about the

[00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:10.370]
racetrack is about how Larry King owes a money from my so here he was talking about how he made

[00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:18.090]
it in the star and i have it in my hand right now and the article as well december 29th the star

[00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:23.570]
Larry King vows to pay back victims he conned out of dollars lots of questions yeah

[00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:29.190]
and it's got the picture from the day and the picture from wio d from 20 years ago look at that

[00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:39.530]
hair look at that push oh god it says today he's a pal of presidents but in 1971 Larry King was a

[00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:44.270]
scam artist who used his radio job to fleece the gullible was a simple mistake great

[00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:52.430]
don't be 50 dollars talk show titan Larry King wants to shed the guilt left over from his wild days

[00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:59.310]
as a horse playing con man and pay back a small fortune to the men and women he built

[00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:05.650]
i'm sorry i let people down king now says i didn't have a lot of faith in myself i had an ego

[00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:11.370]
problem i had to spend money money went through my hands like water king who now chats with presidents

[00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:15.310]
and makes an estimated two and a half million a year has come a long way since his days is a

[00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:23.250]
mime radio host with a thriving sideline in swindles lots of question yeah in 1971 he was arrested

[00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:28.510]
for stealing five thousand dollars from mime business man lu wilson but served no time in jail

[00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:32.810]
because the statute of limitations had run out however he wasn't so lucky on a charge of writing

[00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:38.030]
rubber checks when the publicity of his guilty plea got him kicked off the air but before radio

[00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:44.810]
station wio d gave him the boot and forced him into bankruptcy king reaped big bucks from scams

[00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:50.950]
that traded on his local fame i call the president of a local bank and tell him i was thinking of

[00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:55.230]
doing a show on banking larry once revealed now all of this was baloney but the guy would be so

[00:51:55.230 --> 00:52:00.410]
enormously flattered we'd set up lunch couple of weeks later i'd call a guy back and say oh by the

[00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:05.070]
way i hate to bother you but my mother is quite ill and i need five thousand dollars for an operation

[00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:10.890]
can you tell me the best place to get alone that fast among those who would love to see their

[00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:15.990]
lost cash is seventy nine year old vincent malagny of mayami humed king in nineteen seventy three

[00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:21.390]
after he'd been kicked off the year i've been preparing a book called a losers game about how you

[00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:25.330]
can't win playing the horses says malagny who worked behind the high rollers window at highly

[00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:29.730]
racetrack i was showing the manuscript and some of the other clerks one day while larry was hanging

[00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:35.230]
around he was looking over my shoulder and said don't be sure to look at over my shoulder and said

[00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:40.070]
can i read that he looked at over it said this is a heck of a story tell you what i have a connection

[00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:44.610]
with double-day publishing give me your stories i'll rewrite them but king did nothing of the kind

[00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:50.230]
instead he squeezed two thousand dollars worth of small loans out of the older man who believed

[00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:57.370]
the king was his friend today the stiffed senior that's past tense needless to say in vincents case

[00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:04.030]
the stiffed senior estimates kingos in five thousand dollars including interest was a simple mistake

[00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:07.870]
and says he's still waiting i want my dove vincent says i'm not saying a clause

[00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:12.730]
and that's just one of the debts king says he wants to repay according to his attorney bob wolf

[00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:19.710]
i don't want to start an avalanche but the intent is the intent is that someday we hope to be

[00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:24.750]
reimbursing the people someday when hell is that someday going to be larry i'm i'm i'm i'm i don't know

[00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:31.430]
but some aren't keen to take up the offer mrs abner wolf whose late husband lost 34

[00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:36.630]
thousand dollars to king never wants to hear his disgusting putrid voice again

[00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:42.590]
he may be looking for more money worries the wary widow and it contemptuously you couldn't print

[00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:48.230]
what i think of larry king go me fifty dollars yeah so there it is in the star nice go

[00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:56.810]

[00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:14.090]
as a guilty conscience i'm the pope yeah he's something else i like we keep hearing us every

[00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:19.430]
few months we keep hearing this story i guess to get a more publicity about how uh someday he really

[00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:23.950]
wants to do it but uh... with they won't tell us when some day in other words uh after all these

[00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:28.550]
people croaked and i'll say oh jeeward and we were just going to do it tomorrow and uh... we just

[00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:33.730]
missed out well i love your show here in fort mires you're a lot better without that cuban broadsing

[00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:39.070]
in the background from six twenty you mentioned the movie shattered and after i saw that movie i

[00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:44.390]
tell people you know when you see the first five or ten minutes of that you should know the outcome

[00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:49.050]
of that movie but it's such a good movie it could draw you in so quickly i don't think i saw the first

[00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:54.450]
five or ten minutes i think where the car goes over the hill no i didn't see that oh go back

[00:56:54.450 --> 00:57:00.610]
i thought he was already in the hospital go back and see that from the very beginning and when you

[00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:05.890]
get to the end you say i should have known that i've seen that plot a dozen let me ask you one thing

[00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:11.010]
though yeah how is it that uh not only did they change his face but they changed his voice

[00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:17.970]
i i don't know something to think about isn't it yeah i do i guess we're all supposed to be naive

[00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:22.850]
and assume that if you have plastic surgery not only can they make you look exactly like somebody else

[00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:26.650]
but they can make you sound like somebody else well i guess you could say his injuries were so

[00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:34.750]
extensive his voice just got changed yeah right uh also and other things pick you up in at the first

[00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:40.410]

i am very sure okay do you want to hear my question i'm listening all right do you think there's

[00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:30.690]
any connection i'm a dolphin team the the fact that the coach has a restaurant and a bar and

broward what is that it's like a big vacuum there in the middle of our phone bank you don't

[00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:58.050]
think they could be messing around with the central office over there Miami shores again do you

[00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:03.870]
i do i'm confident i have no doubt see it didn't make any difference what kind of phone system we have

[01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:08.050]
because all the phones still go through that same place there and the guy over there hates us like

[01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:12.210]
poison and he sits in there like the boy in Holland with his finger on the die call day

[01:17:41.230 --> 01:17:43.550]
yes you've got to you've got to get this kind

[01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:47.010]
yes because my mom's gone through like a dozen of them

[01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:49.590]
yes and this is a commercial one

[01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:53.710]
yes it's called champion i already had one of those years ago

[01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:57.190]
and you didn't like it um i don't know i forget

[01:17:57.190 --> 01:18:00.650]
well she's got a new one it's all steel and it's

[01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:02.710]
horizontal instead of standing straight up

[01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:08.170]
yeah so it does always a lot easier horizontal in standing straight up

[01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:12.970]
and it does she says it does something that the enzymes don't break down as fast

[01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:17.290]
because it's horizontal yeah she must have forgotten to take her juice before you

[01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:17.930]
were born

[01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:23.330]

since the broward lines are open all day long anyway

[01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:36.070]

this right now I will never ever ever on this show as long as I'm here which could be almost to

[01:34:28.890 --> 01:34:36.270]
the end of this week listen to a call like that this this crap of calling it's so childish and

[01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:42.150]
so juvenile and so embarrassing if you don't like their show nobody's going to hold a gun to your

[01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:48.490]
head make them listen I like their show a lot I love Randy show love Randy show a lot and if you

[01:34:48.490 --> 01:34:52.410]
don't like that show or this show the best thing to do is find something else to do with your time

[01:34:52.410 --> 01:34:56.590]
okay but if you have a problem call them and tell them don't tell me I'm not interested in hearing

[01:34:56.590 --> 01:35:05.350]
about grow up cross brings yeah how you doing okay all right you're a mention about a juicer

[01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:10.770]
you're talking about I don't have the champion juicer you've been talking about yeah I use I've

[01:35:10.770 --> 01:35:16.550]
been using that about four years now and um well there is no better I'll tell you the difference

[01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:20.590]
like what he was talking about like in brands might with the panasonic the difference is the

[01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:26.910]
beginning on champion you've got a third horse power motor yeah okay that that probably weighs

[01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:31.890]
three times as much as the whole juicer he's talking about yeah so there's I've been using that

[01:35:31.890 --> 01:35:36.270]
about four times a day for a whole how come consumer reports rates the panasonic number one are

[01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:40.050]
they just full of crap they get paid off or something they probably don't rate these because like

[01:35:40.050 --> 01:35:46.830]
this juicer here retail for about between one eighty five to two twenty five and they're used mainly

[01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:51.390]
and natural food stores right yeah I used to have one years ago but then like most other things

[01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:55.710]
it went the way the way well there's one by like acne right it is very similar but the difference

[01:35:55.710 --> 01:36:00.870]
with the with the champion is you can close off where the the screen is where the juice comes

[01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:04.970]
so you can close that off they have a little thing for it never a little thing do a little thing

[01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:10.290]
there and what you can do is you can cut up fruits and stuff like apple stuff like that cut them up

[01:36:10.290 --> 01:36:15.530]
and run it through and it comes out like a yogurt and then you just freeze it and you can any of

[01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:19.630]
those can turn into a yogurt and where the other juicers don't have one yogurt I don't want yogurt

[01:36:19.630 --> 01:36:25.350]
I don't want puree I don't want I don't want his juice right why why why do you some everyday

[01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:29.010]
why I take like four and I don't want to have a thing that when I put a banana and it spits it

[01:36:29.010 --> 01:36:34.330]
out the back and like just waste the whole banana no no like with a with a like I want a thing

[01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:39.130]
everyday where I put in carrots celery a little bit of beef and a little bit of parsley like for

[01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:43.850]
potassium and you run it through there and it makes an attaste like just like a carrot drink

[01:36:44.410 --> 01:36:50.190]
and that's what I drink three four times a day and this champion juicer has such a huge they give

[01:36:50.190 --> 01:36:56.350]
you a 10 year warranty with it and I guess the one of the store that I go it's I didn't

[01:36:56.350 --> 01:37:01.990]
use to advertise the army navy store up on 441 and the army navy store I don't think so okay

[01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:08.730]
there's an army navy surplus you buy your juicer at the army navy surplus well right on 440

[01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:14.250]
probably get your produce there too right on 441 across the street these are probably fruits

[01:37:14.250 --> 01:37:21.810]
that were discarded by the military what he sells the champion juicer for cost yeah I don't know why

[01:37:21.810 --> 01:37:27.670]
but I bought it from him for $184 yeah and I don't know why he does that I guess maybe

[01:37:27.670 --> 01:37:33.550]
he could get business in there but he's had one eleven years and he's never had a problem with

[01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:38.190]
it and the difference is is that's a real that's like a commercial type juicer right they're not

[01:37:38.190 --> 01:37:44.570]
got these 49 59 89 dollars users I had one of those from bird eyes and it lasted me six weeks

[01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:48.710]
I took my Vitamix that I've had for years I took it yesterday and put the banana in there because

[01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:53.170]
my other one is broken that piece of crap that juice man too right and I cut up some apple I mean

[01:37:53.170 --> 01:37:56.350]
I sliced them up and I put them in there and the thing went around and around and the apple

[01:37:56.350 --> 01:38:01.290]
just like stuck in there didn't do anything well no on this champion juicer the way it's set up

[01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:05.590]
if you put apples it just everything goes through if you see the way it is and it runs

[01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:11.130]
and then all the pulp is held in the screen and all the juice runs through yeah and then

[01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:16.390]
then all you do is you take the head off so to speak and then you just clean it out when

[01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:23.670]
in doubt clean it out okay okay go with that thanks a lot have a great day boy so Adam says

[01:38:23.670 --> 01:38:29.170]
man he definitely is the one that's making a row with the carts in here 12 22 what you just got

[01:38:29.170 --> 01:38:35.630]
you saying that don't say stuff behind people's back and then deny it Adam 12 22 on the iod

[01:38:35.630 --> 01:38:43.890]
network here Chuck Meyer Joey Reynolds Tom Hopkins Giammandage and Randy Rose right here

[01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:54.930]
boy this is what a place 12 25 on your heartless and obnoxious radio station W IOD so

[01:38:54.930 --> 01:39:00.090]
Mitch Lewis our other production ace just stepped in here during the break to give me the

[01:39:00.090 --> 01:39:05.570]
exciting news that he's also being bounced out because they're bringing out hot 105 a bunch in

[01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:11.750]
here so I guess their this station is going to sound so bad that I have no words to describe it man

[01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:16.170]
it's going to sound like puke and this is the way they always do it but you've heard me talk about

[01:39:16.170 --> 01:39:21.110]
this for a four and a half years now there's no point even repeating it they just continue defying

[01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:27.350]
the odds continue baffling the experts by grasping defeat from the jaws of victory as only they can do

[01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:32.550]
and this is the same company by the way that put David Paul on your in Atlanta on a 50,000

[01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:39.270]
mod radio station unbelievable yeah Miami hello hello yes sir hey Neil how you doing pretty good

[01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:45.270]
listen Neil I got a question I got to ask you about that damn arena I just want to know like if

[01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:49.790]
you notice whenever he throws an interception he just kind of runs out of the way and directs the

[01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:54.370]
interceptor right into the end right what how do you explain for that well because he's polite

[01:39:54.930 --> 01:40:01.970]
let's go to a Tampa hello hello yes sir can you hear me yes okay friend of mine ask me a question why

[01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:08.310]
are you talking so loud okay friend of mine ask me a question yeah and it's a funny question

[01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:13.330]
but he says before I ask it he says I'm going to have to tell you that little suck on your subconscious

[01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:18.370]
till you find out and damn it be a bright so this is funny as hell but I'll pass it around you

[01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:24.870]
and anyone else is listening does Rush Limbaugh will you box assurance or jockey shorts I just

[01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:33.310]

[01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:51.890]
know what the more I think about it the funny rickets oh boy they are sure easy to please over

[01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:56.630]
there aren't they there's something piece of work lottery hill how you doing happy new year and

[01:40:56.630 --> 01:41:02.450]
the same to you okay I was in Houston on business and they gave us you know I watched the gang last

[01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:06.470]
night with all these people getting hurt right and I was in Houston and they gave us a tour of the

[01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:13.610]
Astridome and they took us down onto the field yeah I was in shock this thing is concrete with like a

[01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:19.750]
quarter inch of indoor outdoor carpeting with a flap over zippers they zipper it in in sections

[01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:26.110]
it's like playing flopp over there zipper yeah they got a flap over there but the point is if

[01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:31.790]
somebody's guys get hurt on the damn zipper when they slide on it yeah but other than that it is

[01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:38.910]
it is like playing in a school yard I split playing on concrete and and I don't know how these

[01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:45.710]
teams play indoors and and have these high-value players getting murdered and torn up on this

[01:41:45.710 --> 01:41:52.190]
Astridome it is it is really amazing that the well how many high-valued players did the oilers ever

[01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:56.950]
have they had you know roaring well you know and you want to handle all Campbell at the long time

[01:41:56.950 --> 01:42:02.230]

[01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:07.490]
defensive players in a good days they got busted up on that yeah and the Astridome never had any

[01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:13.930]
high-paid players well look around them right okay have a happy new year just I'm amazed that

[01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:19.310]
the teams who wouldn't want to protect their investment and have play on grass okay bye-bye see you

[01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:24.150]
I think our team is playing on grass I think they're smoking it heavy duty I mean like like they're

[01:42:24.150 --> 01:42:27.970]
rolling up the newspaper I heard they used the Boston Globe before the game yesterday in the locker

[01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:33.350]
room and just rolled up like five gigantic big ones and we're like passing it around before the game

[01:42:40.450 --> 01:42:45.370]
Malayklin into your radio I was out running around in Lakeland this morning in the car and I got

[01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:51.290]
back in the car and as I got in the car and turned on the radio I heard Captain Dave just the tail

[01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:56.710]
end of his call just the tail end yeah well what was going on what do you say what was going on

[01:42:56.710 --> 01:43:02.310]
well why did he call to Tommy that his mother had a champion juicer and he was tried to buy one

[01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:07.110]
and he drove up to Tallahassee and his he's up to Milton and his vet and how great the drive was

[01:43:07.110 --> 01:43:13.010]

figure out who he is and he's having his wife is having to have it a fair with a guy who turns out

[01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:32.570]

[01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:06.930]

[01:47:06.930 --> 01:47:14.210]
about the new verish in ocean side new jersey and started talking about his great syntax and Ed Till

[01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:11.450]
good luck to you see i know so many people in this business i mean most of them get screwed without

[01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:17.210]
anything positive happening but i do know a lot of people who get paid for not working like Larry

[01:56:17.210 --> 01:56:22.570]
Glick and Boston he got paid big bucks for not working for a whole year at whdh then the year

[01:56:22.570 --> 01:56:29.810]

[01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:35.690]
you're feeling well listen uh a couple of points i want to make one if you're looking for a good

[01:56:35.690 --> 01:56:40.390]
health food store i don't know about down to my amy but here in a pop-up the best ones are run by

[01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:47.430]
the seventh day advent oh huh because oh you know what i wanted to mention oh god somebody told

[01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:52.890]
me on thursday to go in the supermarket and get grillers you know that they fake

[01:56:52.890 --> 01:56:57.910]
I've heard of them yeah this don't ever don't ever get sucked into buying those okay

[01:56:57.910 --> 01:57:04.230]
no i they taste fine and then after i had two of them for lunch i look on the back of the package

[01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:10.150]
and i thought god these taste really great you know why they taste so great because 59% of the calories

[01:57:10.150 --> 01:57:15.970]
are from fat oh that's no good and each one of them i think has got like 14 or 15 grams of fat

[01:57:15.970 --> 01:57:22.290]
no good no good ridiculous it's all fat that's why it tastes so great and even slimy they're from

[01:57:22.290 --> 01:57:25.930]
a sera's that brought us that pizza last Thursday brought that big can of stuff i gave it away

[01:57:25.930 --> 01:57:31.250]
it has like 10 grams of fat per serving that's too way too much if you're going to have something

[01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:36.950]
with no meat and who the hell wants all that fat exactly but go contact some day then a church

[01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:40.070]
you don't have to go there for religious reasons just tell him you want to know where a good health

[01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:44.970]
food store is they generally have a lot of mom and pop type for the price of their reasonable

[01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:51.050]

[01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:37.050]
yeah yeah i got a friend that works at the classical station up there so i'm trying to get nobody will

[01:58:37.050 --> 01:58:41.390]
tell me the answer to the question and maybe he made no comment about it during those three

[01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:47.210]
embarrassing shows he did filling in here but why is a guy who allegedly is working on loop a

[01:58:47.210 --> 01:58:53.210]
m in Chicago is he nervous huh he's not he got canned he got replaced by a game dynamed eddish

[01:58:53.210 --> 01:59:00.510]
works who makes joey renoll sound like god the guy the guy in other words he got canned and he's

[01:59:00.510 --> 01:59:04.850]
down here pretending that he's still working up there because he does some fluency tv show he was

[01:59:04.850 --> 01:59:10.050]
down here auditioning on the year it's a cable access show that he does up there oh no

[01:59:13.210 --> 01:59:19.390]
bullshot bullshot alert bullshot alert boy gary once again voiced a pile a gigantic pile of

[01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:24.270]
bullshot through the uh transmitter right through the final tubes in our transmitter through the

[01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:29.370]
tower into the airwaves i think that the FCC ought to come down here and investigate it

[01:59:29.370 --> 01:59:33.750]
oh the guy to replace him up he's down here talking like he's a big personality up there and he's

[01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:40.330]
got canned again he gets canned everywhere he goes this guy he's pathetic he's nobody oh god

[01:59:40.330 --> 01:59:45.790]
he's below no bird isn't that amazing just replaced by eddish works who couldn't even talk

[01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:51.090]
because i'm wondering to myself how come a guy who's on such a successful station as bad as he is

[01:59:51.090 --> 01:59:56.250]
how come he's down here acting desperate like oh i'm filling in i'm sucking around i'm trying to

[01:59:56.250 --> 02:00:01.670]
find a life and he's on a his his remaining job is on a cable access channel up there

[02:00:01.670 --> 02:00:06.470]
yeah my friend Dennis says he is a laughing stock even the classical music stations won't put up

[02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:11.350]
with him oh god that's how bad he is well it would seem it would seem to me if i were a program

[02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:15.910]
director at a major market talk station it seems to me that i would make it my business to have

[02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:21.550]
known who ed till was because everybody else in a business soon as they hear the name they immediately

[02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:26.470]
wrote put the eb s test on and run for the hills that's what my friend Dennis that's a dentist

[02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:32.890]
do it well if it's ed's will guy and he says he's a joke he is so bad yeah he said that he has a

dog that can do a talk show better than ed's will yeah well i'm bringing in my dogs next holidays

i thought he said he would i thought i misunderstood i thought you were going to be here for a while

[02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:38.410]
until you got something else is that what you said i thought that's what you said

[02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:44.350]
and then he just walks in during the break there and it opens the door and says oh they're

[02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:48.670]
going to pay you for a little while well what's a little while like for the rest of the week

[02:03:50.010 --> 02:03:52.750]

[02:04:00.650 --> 02:04:06.830]
this is like a nut house now this is insanity the people with the talent are all going out

[02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:11.250]
and the people who like suck are coming in they're like lined up at the door okay where do we start

[02:04:11.250 --> 02:04:17.210]
sucking where is that card i got to find that card we're all just people where is that i mean

[02:04:17.210 --> 02:04:22.250]
never was there more a better appropriate data play it they're just blowing everybody out here

[02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:26.270]
whoever had any kind of talent at all and they're bringing in a bunch of dead heads a bunch of

[02:04:27.070 --> 02:04:33.030]
tomatons with this hot 105 crap so not only are a lot of hot 105 people going to be walking

[02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:40.610]
in the streets looking for a job desperate standing at the soup kitchen but some of the people inside

[02:04:40.610 --> 02:04:45.030]
here especially if they had any talent are going to be like long gone and especially if they ever

[02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:49.410]
opened up also no wonder he ripped the hell all or he didn't know it at the time about reneri

[02:04:49.410 --> 02:04:53.030]
it's a good thing he did last Saturday because i guess he won't get a chance to do it again

[02:04:53.530 --> 02:04:56.990]
i always said the show is still going to be on for a while but not the next two weeks so

[02:04:56.990 --> 02:05:01.850]
Mitch Lewis everybody in the audience who's like a regular who follows the goings on here the

[02:05:01.850 --> 02:05:07.770]
shenanigans add another name to the rapidly growing list Mitch Lewis bites the dust

[02:05:09.230 --> 02:05:13.390]
where the hell is that card don't tell me that card disappeared too wouldn't that be a strange

[02:05:13.390 --> 02:05:18.830]
coincidence huh wouldn't that i think we ought to have like a congressional investigation about

[02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:28.670]
that if it turns out that card disappeared too we'll find it 1257 and let's do a Miami hello

[02:14:47.630 --> 02:14:51.910]
there's just all kinds of crap going on here and there's nobody overseeing the operation and the

[02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:58.490]
natives are running the asylum I think somebody we're it's like Lee Harvey Oswald remember he said

[02:14:58.490 --> 02:15:04.270]
I'm calling for someone to come forward with assistance now anybody step forward step in here

[02:15:04.270 --> 02:15:11.610]
before they can totally sink the ship and they got this geek this fascist in high heels running

[02:15:11.610 --> 02:15:18.570]
around there in a hallway just just blowing them out of here like water through a suit here's the

[02:15:18.570 --> 02:15:25.670]
lady in Miami happy holidays to this is not a lady yes it is oh it is it's a lady

[02:15:36.190 --> 02:15:40.950]
quietly their feces a little bit better so they can win the playoffs in two weeks but my real

[02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:46.030]
reason for calling was I wanted to find out your wonderful holiday spirit if you could please play

[02:15:46.030 --> 02:15:56.890]

[02:16:01.330 --> 02:16:05.390]
I mean you put me on a spot here it's 116 I would love to play it all the way through because it'll

[02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:09.930]
kill some time and quite frankly after seeing what's going on in this place I'm getting in a real

[02:16:09.930 --> 02:16:15.050]
scorally mood and I'm beginning to wonder just exactly what's going on there in programming if a

[02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:20.170]
lot of this stuff isn't like an inside job you follow what I'm saying I certainly do now because

[02:16:20.170 --> 02:16:24.890]
there seems to be a lot of crap going down here and of course when people become insecure the first

[02:16:24.890 --> 02:16:30.690]
thing they do is start trying to solidify their base and some of the bassist crap I've ever seen

[02:16:30.690 --> 02:16:35.230]
is going on here there's entrails all over the place huh entrails all over the place you seem to be

[02:16:35.230 --> 02:16:39.710]
obsessed with entrails oh I don't know I love it but after watching the game yesterday I can

[02:16:39.710 --> 02:16:42.650]
understand it have a great new year thank you sir see you

[02:16:58.990 --> 02:17:00.590]
but it was you

[02:17:01.350 --> 02:17:01.550]
oh

[02:17:17.570 --> 02:17:17.570]

[02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:20.830]
I'm

[02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:34.250]
And she can't hear it's a week of night

[02:17:36.630 --> 02:17:40.950]
But no, love, taboo, you've been busy

[02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:46.710]
If I want to change mind, I'd want you, baby

[02:17:50.670 --> 02:17:55.610]
You were afraid, right?

[02:17:55.610 --> 02:17:57.030]
my strange

[02:17:59.210 --> 02:18:01.330]
How you little woman like that

[02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:04.210]
cheap, you like a small change

[02:18:05.090 --> 02:18:06.150]
I don't understand

[02:18:07.650 --> 02:18:10.350]
what you're looking to find

[02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:14.610]
The only thing that I've loved you

[02:18:14.610 --> 02:18:17.630]
is mess up the good man's mind

[02:18:17.630 --> 02:18:19.870]
Can you talk it out your face?

[02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:24.070]
Oh, the bitch is in the smile

[02:18:25.610 --> 02:18:27.470]
The lie is on the lips

[02:18:27.470 --> 02:18:29.970]
that you need to try

[02:18:33.150 --> 02:18:34.430]
Hey, look

[02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:37.910]
It's taking you all right

[02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:40.590]
The only good thing that goes out

[02:18:40.590 --> 02:18:43.230]
is that I'm standing aside

[02:18:45.290 --> 02:18:50.730]
Run, run, run, run

[02:18:50.730 --> 02:18:53.710]
Run, run, run

[02:18:53.710 --> 02:18:54.530]
Run, run, run

[02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:57.070]
Run, run, run, run

[02:19:03.610 --> 02:19:06.350]
Thanks a lot, AB, for screwing up the show here

[02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:08.750]
I can't believe this guy

[02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:10.530]
AB from Sarah's is here

[02:19:10.530 --> 02:19:11.530]
Don't, I don't understand

[02:19:11.530 --> 02:19:12.550]
Not that we're ungrateful

[02:19:12.550 --> 02:19:13.590]
but we already ate

[02:19:13.590 --> 02:19:16.690]
Are you just going to start showing up here indiscriminately with food?

[02:19:17.530 --> 02:19:17.630]
They

[02:19:18.390 --> 02:19:18.870]
They

[02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:19.830]
They what?

[02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.870]
They're family

[02:19:24.530 --> 02:19:25.730]
What's going on with this thing?

[02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:30.330]
The machine won't play anymore because of you

[02:19:30.330 --> 02:19:31.270]
You hear that?

[02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:39.530]
Look at that

[02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:41.350]
They're killing me, AB

[02:19:41.770 --> 02:19:42.970]
What's going on here?

[02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.470]
I'm sorry

[02:19:43.470 --> 02:19:44.030]
Huh?

[02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:45.410]
I didn't do that

[02:19:46.350 --> 02:19:48.650]
No, I don't want to hear that

[02:19:50.290 --> 02:19:51.730]
Just to be a nice guy

[02:19:51.730 --> 02:19:54.290]
I played that was going to play that all the way through for that nice lady

[02:19:54.290 --> 02:19:54.810]
That called

[02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:57.310]
Right, look at that

[02:19:57.310 --> 02:19:58.690]
The machine won't play it

[02:20:00.670 --> 02:20:02.230]
It won't play it

[02:20:07.650 --> 02:20:09.470]
Oh man, give us help

[02:20:09.470 --> 02:20:11.190]
Give us strength before we sink

[02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:13.550]
It's the Titanic calling it SOS

[02:20:14.970 --> 02:20:15.950]
What do you want, AB?

[02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.750]
What do you want?

[02:20:17.050 --> 02:20:18.070]

What the hell, you know, I have never seen anything like this in my life

[02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:36.390]
The whole world is, you just want you to lay yourself flat and prostitute yourself for everybody

[02:20:37.350 --> 02:20:37.750]
God

[02:20:39.070 --> 02:20:40.490]
The hell is going on here

[02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:41.970]
Walks and just walks in the door

[02:20:41.970 --> 02:20:44.830]

[02:20:44.830 --> 02:20:45.670]

[02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.370]
Okay

[02:23:52.970 --> 02:23:53.490]
Listen to me

[02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:56.030]
What did you think about yesterday's performance?

[02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:58.150]
Sir, are you listening to this show?

[02:23:58.490 --> 02:23:58.830]
Yes sir

[02:23:58.830 --> 02:23:59.810]
Have you heard what I said?

[02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:00.490]
Yes sir

[02:24:00.490 --> 02:24:03.410]
Now why would you call and ask me what did I think about yesterday's performance?

[02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:04.410]
What is there to think?

[02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:05.750]
What kind of a question is that?

[02:24:05.810 --> 02:24:07.630]
Sir, I want to talk about Bobby Humphrey

[02:24:07.630 --> 02:24:07.910]
Yeah

[02:24:08.410 --> 02:24:09.230]
What did you think?

[02:24:10.090 --> 02:24:12.410]
I think you're a goofball just like George said

[02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:14.170]
Only I think he was being really kind

[02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:18.630]
We have an open line at Broward 524 Hollywood. Hello

[02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:19.730]
Hey, how's it going?

[02:24:20.050 --> 02:24:20.690]
Oh great

[02:24:20.690 --> 02:24:23.730]
What in the world is going on at that station today?

[02:24:23.970 --> 02:24:26.550]
It's the end of the world as we know it sir

[02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:27.210]
Uh-huh

[02:24:27.210 --> 02:24:30.670]
There's no one in charge. The inmates are running the asylum

[02:24:30.670 --> 02:24:34.010]
They're blowing the good people out, the places turning inside out

[02:24:34.010 --> 02:24:36.450]
And just when things seem to be going real well

[02:24:36.450 --> 02:24:39.150]
This company knows how to turn it upside down

[02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:41.910]
Just in time to say happy holiday and up your ass

[02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:45.290]
Oh no, because I just, I called Mitch Saturday night on his show

[02:24:45.290 --> 02:24:48.830]
And we were ranking on uh, on uh, Reneerie

[02:24:48.830 --> 02:24:50.930]
And here at two days later boom

[02:24:50.930 --> 02:24:53.550]
Don't worry, Reneerie is going to get his too

[02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:57.370]
Huh, oh well, so what's going to happen now with night droppings?

[02:24:58.090 --> 02:24:59.090]
I beg your pardon?

[02:24:59.390 --> 02:25:00.030]
So what's going to happen?

[02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:02.570]
Oh who cares about what's going to happen with night droppings?

[02:25:02.690 --> 02:25:05.290]
Man, this guy is a great production guy and a great talent

[02:25:05.290 --> 02:25:08.570]
And did some of the greatest bits in the entire building here

[02:25:08.570 --> 02:25:09.050]
Right

[02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:12.310]
Oh man, I'm choking on his Sarah's pizza

[02:25:14.570 --> 02:25:15.450]
So what?

[02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:18.490]
That's a drive, yeah, he did, he did, he did some good stuff

[02:25:18.490 --> 02:25:18.790]
Yeah

[02:25:20.110 --> 02:25:21.150]
That's why he's out

[02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:22.330]
Uh-huh

[02:25:22.330 --> 02:25:25.290]
And they're bringing back the guy that he replaced when he came here

[02:25:25.290 --> 02:25:28.090]
They blew this guy out to put Mitch Lewis in here

[02:25:28.090 --> 02:25:30.130]
And now they're bringing him back because he was at how 105

[02:25:30.130 --> 02:25:30.850]
Oh

[02:25:32.350 --> 02:25:33.230]
Yeah, exactly

[02:25:33.230 --> 02:25:34.190]
Oh well

[02:25:35.330 --> 02:25:36.430]
What can I tell you?

[02:25:36.430 --> 02:25:41.430]
Yeah, let's just turn the whole radio station into boy Gary and his buddies

[02:25:41.430 --> 02:25:45.610]
We're going to have boy Kurt and Ed Till and bring back Dickey Farrell and Alex Bennett

[02:25:45.610 --> 02:25:49.470]
And all the Joey Reynolds and Bill Marshall and all the losers

[02:25:49.470 --> 02:25:53.350]
Let's put Meg Green on again a couple days on a weekend for like 10 hours at a crack

[02:25:53.350 --> 02:25:54.570]
Why not?

[02:25:55.350 --> 02:25:55.430]
Uh-uh

[02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:57.150]
All right, you have a good one

[02:25:57.150 --> 02:25:58.250]
Happy New Year sir

[02:25:58.250 --> 02:25:59.250]
All right, see you

[02:25:59.250 --> 02:26:03.370]
From all your friends at WYOD, those few of us who are still here

[02:26:04.450 --> 02:26:09.230]
Right, that's from George who wants to add his voice to the chorus of something

[02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:11.490]
The chorus of Grepses

[02:26:11.490 --> 02:26:16.370]
That AB from Sarah's and it's not his fault, he's not the, uh...

[02:26:17.290 --> 02:26:18.870]
He's not the head, the guy over there

[02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:20.150]
The head cheese

[02:26:20.830 --> 02:26:22.910]
But this has got to stop, okay?

[02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:26.310]
So I'm a vegetarian, all right, first of all, that the pie is very good

[02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:28.410]
It's also loaded with butter, man

[02:26:28.410 --> 02:26:30.890]
It's like fat, it's pure fat

[02:26:31.450 --> 02:26:35.570]
And that schmopper, which I gave to George, like I told you, that can I looked on the ingredients

[02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:39.290]
Ten grams of fat per serving, per serving

[02:26:40.050 --> 02:26:43.550]
And that's probably for a burger the size of a bird dropping, all right?

[02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:46.970]
Just loaded with pure fat, that's why it tastes so great

[02:26:46.970 --> 02:26:48.070]
So what's the big deal?

[02:26:48.190 --> 02:26:51.150]
The reason you don't want to eat meat, one of the main reason you don't want all that fat

[02:26:52.850 --> 02:26:57.070]
So I take some vegetable stuff and just load it with saturated fat

[02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:59.930]
And then say, oh, look, this is good for you, right?

[02:27:01.970 --> 02:27:04.110]
Boy, here's a mobile in Palm Beach

[02:27:04.110 --> 02:27:07.430]
Uh, you left out, uh, Randy Martin

[02:27:07.430 --> 02:27:09.730]
Randy Martin, let's bring her back again, yeah!

[02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:14.250]
Another boy, Gary Jim, Randy Martin, A, A

[02:27:14.250 --> 02:27:17.010]
Has a matter of facts, sir

[02:27:17.010 --> 02:27:20.550]
Oh, no, not Randy Martin again

[02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:21.350]
Oh!

[02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:23.530]
You are very fast on that path

[02:27:23.530 --> 02:27:25.070]
Yeah, I'm fast

[02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:26.690]
I'm gonna go up in Orlando last week

[02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:27.350]
She blows

[02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:31.150]
Well, she promised me to call and tell you that she did high

[02:27:31.150 --> 02:27:34.270]
That she wanted to come, she's gonna be in Miami, she wanted to stop by and say hi

[02:27:34.270 --> 02:27:35.430]
No, we don't want to see her

[02:27:35.430 --> 02:27:38.490]
Well, she says she was afraid that a butt pack didn't found out she'd get trouble

[02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:40.510]
Oh, she works for butt packsin'?

[02:27:40.510 --> 02:27:40.790]
Yeah, well he-

[02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:44.950]
Good, there is justice in the world, man, what a pair, what a match that is

[02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:48.350]
Uh-huh, well, yes, she bought the station, she was that

[02:27:48.350 --> 02:27:48.670]
Good

[02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:49.950]
He bought everybody's station

[02:27:49.950 --> 02:27:51.210]
Good, she'll be out

[02:27:51.210 --> 02:27:54.890]
But anyway, she says she definitely wanted to say hi to you, as she misses you

[02:27:54.890 --> 02:27:55.630]
And uh-

[02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:56.370]
Well, we don't miss her

[02:27:56.930 --> 02:27:58.470]
We miss her like hemorrhoids

[02:27:58.470 --> 02:28:01.130]
But you did want to know if you still have that card, so I guess the answer is yes

[02:28:01.130 --> 02:28:04.590]
Yeah, we got it, we got some other good ones for her too, but time doesn't permit

[02:28:04.590 --> 02:28:06.610]
Alright, I'll have her send her resume down

[02:28:06.610 --> 02:28:07.290]
Yeah, please

[02:28:07.290 --> 02:28:10.090]
Alright, maybe she can get a two-man gig with Ed Till

[02:28:10.090 --> 02:28:12.490]
Have a great life, happy new year

[02:28:12.890 --> 02:28:15.830]
Two open lines are both in Broward of course at 524

[02:28:16.850 --> 02:28:18.810]
This station is getting like Santa Barbara

[02:28:19.610 --> 02:28:23.830]
You know how they're going off very soon, like in a few weeks, so they're killing off all the characters and the cast?

[02:28:24.390 --> 02:28:26.030]
That's how WIOD is going

[02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:29.890]
I mean, Justin in the last few months, like the whole staff has turned over

[02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:32.890]
Turned over as in their grave

[02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:35.750]
Miami, hello

[02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:36.610]
Hello, Neil

[02:28:36.610 --> 02:28:37.990]
Welcome to WIO Dead

[02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:40.090]
First time caller

[02:28:40.090 --> 02:28:40.830]
Are you doing, sir?

[02:28:41.090 --> 02:28:42.310]
Alrighty, uh-

[02:28:42.910 --> 02:28:45.250]
Wanna see Dolphin's talk, but nothing else isn't there

[02:28:45.250 --> 02:28:47.570]
No, but it gets a little worse every week

[02:28:47.570 --> 02:28:49.290]
I mean, when you're playing a Sandlot team

[02:28:49.290 --> 02:28:52.190]
You expect at least you're gonna go out there and embarrass somebody

[02:28:52.190 --> 02:28:53.730]
And it's not expected to be yourself

[02:28:53.730 --> 02:28:55.930]
Well, that they do a good thing, doesn't that mean?

[02:28:56.170 --> 02:28:59.110]
Oh, yeah, I was physically ill during that game

[02:28:59.110 --> 02:29:02.170]
I was so sick I was just becoming nauseous

[02:29:02.170 --> 02:29:02.750]
N orcous

[02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:04.090]
Well, it makes two of us

[02:29:04.090 --> 02:29:06.490]
Yeah, why did it brighten up your day a little bit?

[02:29:06.610 --> 02:29:07.490]
Uh-uh

[02:29:07.490 --> 02:29:10.450]
Christmas Day, I'm at a friend's house having a little get-together

[02:29:10.450 --> 02:29:10.770]
Yeah

[02:29:10.770 --> 02:29:13.190]
Tell me, and Waxen, no sleeves looking good

[02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:14.230]
Guess who it is?

[02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:15.130]
Orlando

[02:29:15.610 --> 02:29:16.030]
No

[02:29:16.030 --> 02:29:21.530]
Orlando Waxen, there's Strut and his tight jeans and his boots and his cut-off sleeve shirt looking great

[02:29:21.530 --> 02:29:22.550]
Are you cereal?

[02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:23.090]
Serial

[02:29:23.090 --> 02:29:25.710]
Well, what kind of a place was this is if I have to answer?

[02:29:25.870 --> 02:29:27.490]
Oh, this is just a personal friend, uh-

[02:29:27.490 --> 02:29:28.230]
Yeah, yeah

[02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:29.550]
Have that we hang out together

[02:29:29.550 --> 02:29:30.330]
Yeah, I bet

[02:29:30.330 --> 02:29:30.790]
Yeah

[02:29:30.790 --> 02:29:32.550]
Orlando hangs out with a lot of people

[02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:36.170]
He was at the Dolphin game, but if long as Fat Riches in there, he'd be more happy to join you

[02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:36.850]
Yeah, I bet

[02:29:37.890 --> 02:29:41.730]
He better be there for the playoff game, we're gonna need more than Orlando, I'll tell you that

[02:29:41.730 --> 02:29:45.150]
Geez, he was ragging on me at night before they even played that

[02:29:45.150 --> 02:29:48.790]
Telling me how bad they were and they were gonna choke him, he was pretty close to it

[02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:50.330]
Yeah, they choked it

[02:29:50.330 --> 02:29:50.990]
They only did it

[02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:52.550]
Oh, he's got a lot of happy on that

[02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:53.630]
And the same to you

[02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:57.210]
I like it, I just want to call it over to you with a d-stag and I'm gonna show you now

[02:29:57.210 --> 02:29:58.790]
Okay, see ya

[02:29:58.790 --> 02:30:00.190]
Yeah, give Orlando a big kiss for it

[02:30:00.190 --> 02:30:00.570]
I will

[02:30:00.570 --> 02:30:02.610]
Okay, right on the pecs

[02:30:03.390 --> 02:30:14.750]
We have an open line at day 751-9463 on a very, very exciting happy holidays, happy New Year type of day from your friends at the Crap Station

[02:30:17.170 --> 02:30:22.230]
It's kind of like helpless, shouldn't we play that by Kim Weston? We should play helpless because it fits right in here

[02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:27.430]
It's like you're sitting here and just watching the whole world crumble around your very eyes

[02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:32.430]
Right Adam? Adam says so, he says he's not putting up with any more of this crap

[02:30:32.430 --> 02:30:36.950]
He's going in Boy Geary's office right now and kick his bad ass, that's what he said

[02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:43.330]
He said he's gonna go in there and just stick sharp objects into every part of his body

[02:30:43.330 --> 02:30:45.250]
He would do it in his brain, but he can't find it

[02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:49.190]
God, what a jackball, where did we find him?

[02:30:49.350 --> 02:30:53.730]
Did we conduct another nationwide search to find him and keep in mind, please eat that

[02:30:53.730 --> 02:30:58.110]
Get it out of here and eat it and enjoy it, it's good but it's full of fat and you're a skinny and young

[02:31:00.310 --> 02:31:01.130]
Tamara, hello

[02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:06.350]
Remember in God 5-3 he said, oh you're so skinny, you eat it

[02:31:06.350 --> 02:31:07.310]
Okay, holy, remember that?

[02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:08.990]
Yeah, look what it did to him

[02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:09.990]
So enjoy it Adam

[02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:12.110]
While you can, this is the only way we can get rid of Adam

[02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:13.170]
Yes sir

[02:31:13.970 --> 02:31:14.370]
Yes sir

[02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:15.270]
Yes?

[02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:16.350]
How you doing Neil?

[02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.850]
Great

[02:31:16.850 --> 02:31:19.250]
Listen, blackened is disgusting

[02:31:20.410 --> 02:31:20.810]
Grotesque?

[02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.630]
Obviously

[02:31:22.210 --> 02:31:22.610]
Nauseating?

[02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:23.490]
Nothing to occur

[02:31:23.490 --> 02:31:23.990]
Are you inducing?

[02:31:25.230 --> 02:31:31.350]
When the last time you've seen a reverse, a pitch, a sweep, anything

[02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:35.130]
Remember that flea flicker we had a couple of weeks ago that was our one trick play for the year

[02:31:35.130 --> 02:31:35.650]
We did that

[02:31:35.650 --> 02:31:37.750]
Oh and you know what really kills me?

[02:31:38.330 --> 02:31:43.850]
Fourth and two so twice in the Jets game on fourth and two we you know gambled and it was a touchdown

[02:31:43.850 --> 02:31:47.430]
So yesterday we have this real big drive going there late in the game

[02:31:47.430 --> 02:31:51.850]
It's fourth and about two and a half and what does he do he does the same thing again and it's incomplete

[02:31:51.850 --> 02:31:55.790]
He overthrows Jackson or whoever it was and it's incomplete and then would they get the ball?

[02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:59.350]
I mean how many times can you keep doing the same thing over it?

[02:31:59.450 --> 02:32:04.010]
Oh so you know the idea is well if it worked once or twice let's just do it every time on fourth down

[02:32:04.010 --> 02:32:09.310]
Don you need brain surgery man Gary Stevens you need a hemorrhidctomy in your forehead

[02:32:09.310 --> 02:32:10.410]
Yeah no kidding

[02:32:10.410 --> 02:32:11.010]
God incredible

[02:32:11.690 --> 02:32:16.350]
We got to have a boy Gary go over there and run that I think that's who's running the offense is boy Gary Stevens

[02:32:16.350 --> 02:32:17.710]
I believe it

[02:32:17.710 --> 02:32:18.910]
Definitely needs some help

[02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:19.590]
Oh man

[02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:19.970]
Oh man

[02:32:19.970 --> 02:32:26.330]
And Craig I went down today and I bought my shoes I have shoes and tickets but I didn't renew them like I was supposed to

[02:32:26.330 --> 02:32:28.650]
So I went down and got my playoff ticket

[02:32:28.650 --> 02:32:28.890]
Right

[02:32:28.890 --> 02:32:35.790]
And I had a couple of friends and we're making bets on what plays are going to be called this you know the next time that the dolphin's actually play

[02:32:36.310 --> 02:32:38.290]
And I bet you I come away with a lot of money

[02:32:38.290 --> 02:32:38.670]
Yeah

[02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:43.490]
It's incredible play after play the same repetitive third down body hump free thing

[02:32:43.490 --> 02:32:44.170]
It's just incredible

[02:32:44.170 --> 02:32:47.010]
Great into the middle of the line for about a half a yard in a clouded dust

[02:32:47.010 --> 02:32:47.670]
Incredible

[02:32:48.090 --> 02:32:50.570]
Well you got to love him anyway I love him

[02:32:50.570 --> 02:32:55.210]
Yeah you got to love him especially that Pete Stoyanovitch main you got to plant a big kiss on his foot

[02:32:55.210 --> 02:32:55.470]
Yeah

[02:32:55.970 --> 02:33:03.550]
Because if it wasn't if it wasn't for him do you realize what kind of a year would have been oh we were probably I mean forget it we'd be in the toilet bowl right now

[02:33:03.550 --> 02:33:06.590]
You got it anyway Neil you have a great holiday and you too

[02:33:06.590 --> 02:33:06.730]
And you too

[02:33:06.730 --> 02:33:07.730]
Same to you

[02:33:07.730 --> 02:33:08.110]
Take care

[02:33:08.110 --> 02:33:08.650]
Bye bye

[02:33:09.470 --> 02:33:12.330]
So I guess I'm packing up my CDs into a clock huh

[02:33:12.990 --> 02:33:19.590]
That's the thing everybody's packing up their stuff just in case here they have anything valuable laying around just pack it up and to put it in the car

[02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:21.830]
And be ready to leave on a moment's notice

[02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:32.890]
So I guess they're having their big hot 105 meet today maybe that's where it's all at because Cheryl said she was going down there today hot 105 to their place whatever they're doing over there

[02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:39.010]
Just another example of what goes on and of course now they're going to say well we don't have to worry about the coast

[02:33:39.010 --> 02:33:45.410]
We don't have to worry about IOD they're like they run themselves okay so now we're going to put all our energies into hot 105 and all those other people

[02:33:45.410 --> 02:33:51.330]
The ten or twelve of them who are left in the AM and FM they can just they're rot they can rot and hell we don't want to hear no crap from them

[02:33:52.030 --> 02:34:01.010]
Because we're too busy now trying to screw up a new radio station 137 on the IOD network plus an update on traffic and the current weather forecast

[02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:06.110]
141 what do you want Kathy?

[02:34:07.410 --> 02:34:07.850]
Kathy?

[02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:08.470]
Hi

[02:34:08.470 --> 02:34:09.430]
What do you want?

[02:34:09.570 --> 02:34:10.250]
What do I want?

[02:34:10.810 --> 02:34:11.870]
I just want to say hello

[02:34:11.870 --> 02:34:13.410]
Hi Kathy Livingston

[02:34:13.410 --> 02:34:16.470]
Happy New Year and Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah

[02:34:16.470 --> 02:34:16.790]
Yeah

[02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:23.350]
And I wrote you a letter around the time you were in the hospital with your gallbladder without it but I never mailed it

[02:34:23.350 --> 02:34:25.670]
Oh nice, I appreciate it very much Kathy

[02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:31.070]
I've thought about you a lot but it's time I've tried to call on the regular Broward line it's always busy

[02:34:31.070 --> 02:34:32.470]
So how's Dick Pertend doing?

[02:34:32.530 --> 02:34:38.270]
Well you know I was up to Detroit twice in the last year and I've been going up just for very brief little runs

[02:34:38.270 --> 02:34:41.130]
3 or 4 days and I haven't even called him

[02:34:41.130 --> 02:34:43.130]
When I lived in Detroit I used to have the runs all winter

[02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:45.490]
Has he called you lately?

[02:34:45.930 --> 02:34:52.450]
He called me back after the hurricane and they raised a quarter of a million dollars for us which made me feel that we're really cheap down here and very insufficient

[02:34:52.450 --> 02:34:53.810]
But uh...

[02:34:53.810 --> 02:34:54.390]
Is the station dead?

[02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:55.150]
Yeah

[02:34:55.150 --> 02:34:55.710]
Right

[02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:56.950]
Isn't that terrific?

[02:34:57.010 --> 02:34:57.270]
Yeah

[02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:58.130]
Wow

[02:34:58.130 --> 02:35:03.510]
And he signed that new contract for like an excessive a million a year or something like that and he's continuing to do it

[02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:04.730]
Yeah he is, he's great

[02:35:05.150 --> 02:35:06.150]
Well you're great too

[02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:10.810]
And I bet you they treat him with a little bit of respect up there plus he owns part of the station which doesn't hurt

[02:35:10.810 --> 02:35:11.730]
That helps a lot

[02:35:11.730 --> 02:35:17.030]
I'm going to come down one of these days to pick up my unbelievable t-shirt and get a Rick and Sudden

[02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:18.790]
Oh we got a whole month to go so don't rush Kathy

[02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:19.790]
Okay very good

[02:35:19.790 --> 02:35:23.250]
Well I figured if the bird could call on the bat line so can I

[02:35:23.950 --> 02:35:24.310]
Right?

[02:35:24.410 --> 02:35:25.510]
He doesn't call on the bat line

[02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:26.850]
Yeah George told me he did

[02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:29.710]
No he does not he calls on the out of town line

[02:35:29.710 --> 02:35:30.330]
Oh is that right?

[02:35:30.510 --> 02:35:32.550]
Why would he call that would cost him money on the bat line

[02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:37.550]
Well that's true I forgot about that well I can never get true when I try to call the regular station line

[02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:39.550]
So I had to resort back

[02:35:39.550 --> 02:35:43.550]
No times it tough for him over there he had to auction off the rest of his hair when he moved to Lakeland

[02:35:43.550 --> 02:35:45.350]
So he can't afford to long distance call

[02:35:45.350 --> 02:35:54.890]
I was thinking the only empathy he must have with the people who were fired or let go from WIOD is that fact

[02:35:54.890 --> 02:35:57.150]
Not what they did while they were there

[02:35:57.150 --> 02:35:59.910]
Well don't confuse him with the facts he gets very emotional

[02:35:59.910 --> 02:36:00.370]
I know

[02:36:00.370 --> 02:36:01.450]
I have a great new year Kathy

[02:36:01.450 --> 02:36:05.570]
Now be sure if you talk to Dick Purt and tell him we're on an ever for Myers now

[02:36:05.570 --> 02:36:09.390]
Yeah I'm sure he'll hear you but I will definitely love you by the high

[02:36:09.390 --> 02:36:13.510]
Open line on the star line there's suds Indian giver

[02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:14.310]
Indian killer

[02:36:14.310 --> 02:36:17.430]
Or something like that what do you call somebody who refuses a gift

[02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.510]
Huh?

[02:36:20.390 --> 02:36:22.390]
I brought it in for you and within life

[02:36:22.390 --> 02:36:23.150]
I already had it

[02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:25.210]
Well so what difference does that make you already had it

[02:36:25.210 --> 02:36:27.390]
You can never have too many star always good to have a spare

[02:36:27.390 --> 02:36:32.710]
When you wear the oxide off the first tape you have another one hanging around and maybe it's a letter box

[02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:37.670]
What movie did I watch over the weekend was it the shattered that started in letter box?

[02:36:37.850 --> 02:36:39.250]
No, what I don't was it that one?

[02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:45.390]
There was some movie it started in letter box and then thank God once the movie starts they open up the screen

[02:36:45.390 --> 02:36:52.830]
And you don't have to watch that God there is nothing more aggravating to me that sitting at home on a big 45 inch TV set

[02:36:52.830 --> 02:36:56.670]
And then have a summer letter box crap come on in you got like about a three inch picture

[02:36:58.010 --> 02:37:01.350]
It's about 700 inches across but it's only three inches high

[02:37:01.350 --> 02:37:04.590]
You got to like lay on the ground horizontal look at it the sideways

[02:37:06.250 --> 02:37:07.530]
Four-letter deal hello

[02:37:07.530 --> 02:37:09.190]
Hi Neil I have good news for you

[02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:15.770]
Yes I don't know if subways still sponsor a sponsor on your show but I went there and got a delicious sandwich today

[02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:20.590]
And they have their calendars with the discount coupons throughout the whole year

[02:37:20.590 --> 02:37:24.670]
And it's a dollar and they don't even take the money or ring it up it goes right to Camilla

[02:37:25.430 --> 02:37:28.910]
Well too bad that the Steve Perris didn't tell us anything about that

[02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:30.890]
Nice job on those carts by the way, Manny

[02:37:30.890 --> 02:37:34.970]
Well I was in that line I said Neil has got to know but I'm sure you know what I'm waiting about it

[02:37:34.970 --> 02:37:36.350]
No I know nothing about it

[02:37:36.350 --> 02:37:39.590]
Well this was at the store just on Brad Boulevard right in downtown

[02:37:40.530 --> 02:37:43.310]
But I don't know if all the stores are doing it but I have no idea

[02:37:43.310 --> 02:37:44.490]
I didn't want to know

[02:37:44.490 --> 02:37:52.590]
Yeah well there was something supposed to happen with them and Steve Perris our sales hole never got back to me and of course I'm sure he's not around because they're all on about a two week busman's holidays

[02:37:52.590 --> 02:37:54.650]
So you've got a lot of crap going on there

[02:37:54.650 --> 02:37:59.970]
We have you're hit a right on the head sir you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out we got a lot of crap going on here

[02:37:59.970 --> 02:38:01.450]
Not much else but a lot of crap

[02:38:01.450 --> 02:38:03.670]
Is the end of the year always swearing in your career?

[02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:09.210]
No no usually the end of the year is real quiet because nobody's around but this year there's a lot of crap you're right

[02:38:09.210 --> 02:38:09.750]
Unbelievable

[02:38:09.750 --> 02:38:10.690]
Yes it is

[02:38:10.690 --> 02:38:11.470]
I love you take care

[02:38:11.470 --> 02:38:12.230]
Have a great day

[02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:13.290]
Bye bye

[02:38:13.290 --> 02:38:18.950]
Like I said nice job on those carts man we have an open line and Broward

[02:38:25.250 --> 02:38:29.030]
Broward at 5249463 see what did I tell you?

[02:38:29.490 --> 02:38:37.410]
No question in my mind I mean a shot the stearver like from day one lots of hostility here today lots of psychosis

[02:38:37.410 --> 02:38:41.610]
Lots of games people play with Joe South and the spinners they're doing it

[02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:47.990]
Boy I sure wish I had that to play with that games people play with that fit in perfectly here or what?

[02:38:48.970 --> 02:38:50.330]
Here's Jack Miranda hello

[02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:52.370]
I don't wear a wig sir

[02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:56.910]
Okay let's go to always good to reinforce that just to make sure you know Hollywood

[02:38:57.390 --> 02:38:58.030]
Hey Neil

[02:38:58.030 --> 02:39:00.750]
Because if he did he probably would have borrowed the money to buy it yes

[02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:01.510]
Hey Neil

[02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:01.970]
Yes

[02:39:01.970 --> 02:39:07.670]
Haven't talked to you and says before your operation I called and suggested you become a vegetarian rather than have you gone better taken

[02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:11.630]
Well too late for that now it's not going to grow back but are you are you a serious vegetarian?

[02:39:12.090 --> 02:39:13.830]
What does that mean is serious

[02:39:13.830 --> 02:39:18.050]
Meaning a vegetarian vegetarian no animal at all no eggs no milk no cheese

[02:39:18.050 --> 02:39:22.250]
Well I wouldn't say no cheese I've had a little like hard cheese but that's it

[02:39:22.250 --> 02:39:22.610]
Perfect

[02:39:22.610 --> 02:39:25.430]
Now what are you laughing about that I mean that's not bad

[02:39:25.430 --> 02:39:25.990]
Okay

[02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:32.050]
I don't first of all I don't drink milk because you have to be an imbecile to feed milk to an adult you got to be an idiot

[02:39:32.050 --> 02:39:32.590]
Absolutely

[02:39:32.590 --> 02:39:36.770]
To drink milk and I don't eat a lot of dairy to begin with I don't eat cottage cheese

[02:39:36.770 --> 02:39:42.370]
I don't... so a little bit of hard cheese like on my pasta because you can have a lot of pasta when you're a vegetarian

[02:39:42.370 --> 02:39:46.550]
Which I love pasta with the right kind of sauces without the fat and all the crap and sugar in it

[02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.830]
Right

[02:39:46.830 --> 02:39:48.290]
And I think I'm doing pretty good

[02:39:48.290 --> 02:39:49.210]
Well another question

[02:39:49.210 --> 02:39:53.810]
I lost about six or seven pounds in the first week and I was feeling really great till I came in here today

[02:39:54.270 --> 02:39:57.530]
Another question I had was on the fat you're complaining about the fat?

[02:39:58.190 --> 02:40:03.190]
I'm not familiar with the product that you bought but just keep in mind that your body does need fat

[02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:06.790]
No I don't need that much fat I mean we're talking...

[02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:10.210]
59% of the calories are from fat, grillers

[02:40:10.210 --> 02:40:15.070]
I wouldn't buy those again in fact I got an extra pack I'm going to bring here an auction it off tomorrow to the highest bidder

[02:40:15.070 --> 02:40:16.690]
I wouldn't eat that crap again

[02:40:16.690 --> 02:40:21.050]
59% of the calories are from fat no way

[02:40:21.050 --> 02:40:21.430]
Okay

[02:40:21.430 --> 02:40:23.270]
Your body needs a little bit of fat

[02:40:23.270 --> 02:40:25.670]
But keep in mind that your body does need some fat

[02:40:25.670 --> 02:40:27.730]
Some fat that's right I don't know, huh?

[02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:28.750]
What?

[02:40:29.130 --> 02:40:30.010]
Vegetables and nuts

[02:40:30.010 --> 02:40:30.890]
I beg your pardon

[02:40:31.430 --> 02:40:32.750]
No animal fat at all

[02:40:32.750 --> 02:40:32.910]
Yeah

[02:40:33.430 --> 02:40:34.070]
So another thing

[02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:35.490]
Your body doesn't need animal fat

[02:40:35.490 --> 02:40:37.510]
No absolutely your body was never designed

[02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:40.530]
I don't know any horses... I don't know any horses who are eating animal fat

[02:40:40.530 --> 02:40:43.110]
No I look at the grills and the elephants and...

[02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:43.290]
Right

[02:40:43.810 --> 02:40:48.870]
But anyway as far as your champion juicer or if you get a champion, mine's 10 years old

[02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:49.190]
Yeah

[02:40:49.870 --> 02:40:51.970]
And they sell them at the unicorn for about 189

[02:40:51.970 --> 02:40:52.790]
Oh do they?

[02:40:53.250 --> 02:40:55.870]
And it's by far for a home unit

[02:40:55.870 --> 02:40:57.890]
I used mine commercially for a while too

[02:40:57.890 --> 02:41:01.230]
It's too slow commercially but for a home unit you can't beat it

[02:41:02.430 --> 02:41:05.650]
I bet you that's just like the one that I used to have I used to have a real good one

[02:41:05.650 --> 02:41:07.010]
Well it's all motor years ago

[02:41:07.010 --> 02:41:11.010]
All it is is a motor it looks like a wash machine motor

[02:41:11.010 --> 02:41:11.350]
Right

[02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:13.690]
And it has the unit that mounts on the front of it

[02:41:14.370 --> 02:41:15.850]
And you just can't wear it out

[02:41:15.850 --> 02:41:18.850]
Like I say mine's 10 years old and I used it for two years commercially

[02:41:21.350 --> 02:41:21.750]
So...

[02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:22.570]
I'll check it out

[02:41:22.570 --> 02:41:22.950]
Okay

[02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:23.650]
Thanks a lot

[02:41:23.650 --> 02:41:25.330]
Hey listen stay with it stay with the program

[02:41:25.330 --> 02:41:28.130]
I'm doing it this is not a lark this is not a...

[02:41:28.130 --> 02:41:30.130]
Because first of all it's not really that difficult

[02:41:30.130 --> 02:41:32.630]
I've never been a big meat lover to begin with

[02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:36.650]
I'm not a big steak lover I mean I... or nearly I'd have a steak maybe three times a year

[02:41:36.650 --> 02:41:38.070]
I'm just not that big in the meat

[02:41:38.530 --> 02:41:40.270]
My big thing is pasta

[02:41:40.850 --> 02:41:44.250]
And you don't have to like put the sausage in the meatballs and all that crap

[02:41:44.250 --> 02:41:46.570]
Because first of all in Italy they never heard of such a thing

[02:41:46.570 --> 02:41:49.550]
They don't they eat their... they're eat their pasta with very light sauces over there

[02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:52.850]
Well I used strictly raw tomatoes organic when I can get them

[02:41:52.850 --> 02:41:53.030]
Right

[02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:56.390]
And uh... based sweet basil and a little oregano

[02:41:56.390 --> 02:41:57.070]

Pete Townsett, the in my box set

[02:44:03.210 --> 02:44:06.450]
Ever since I was a young boy I've had these silver balls

[02:44:06.450 --> 02:44:08.550]
Beans rolled down and brightened

[02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:10.190]
Men always came to call

[02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:12.290]
They'd seen nothing like it

[02:44:12.290 --> 02:44:14.030]
And then it bounced off

[02:44:14.030 --> 02:44:15.770]
My name is Peter Townsett

[02:44:15.770 --> 02:44:18.210]
And I shall play a beans and ball

[02:44:18.730 --> 02:44:19.870]

153

[02:44:38.130 --> 02:44:39.010]
Everybody in this play

[02:44:39.010 --> 02:44:42.130]
You know why they're also emotional because they're looking they're watching that door

[02:44:42.130 --> 02:44:46.050]
And they're seeing bodies fly out of there like it's like a revolving door

[02:44:47.270 --> 02:44:50.330]
You know how you go into a bank and most banks the old-fashioned ones

[02:44:50.330 --> 02:44:52.410]
And the big bank buildings they all had the revolving door

[02:44:53.030 --> 02:44:54.330]
That's what this place is like

[02:44:54.330 --> 02:44:57.150]
Only they're going around on the out but they're not coming back in

[02:44:58.510 --> 02:45:02.690]
And so today all the hot shots I understand are at Hot 105

[02:45:02.690 --> 02:45:05.130]
As in hot shot 105

[02:45:05.130 --> 02:45:06.550]
That's what we're going to turn it into

[02:45:07.010 --> 02:45:07.990]
Emphasis on the shot

[02:45:08.610 --> 02:45:10.490]
They're all down there having their big meat

[02:45:10.490 --> 02:45:14.250]
And Jeff Clarks down there and maybe even Bob Greens in town and he's down there

[02:45:14.250 --> 02:45:15.230]
He don't come and see us

[02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:16.770]
No he's down there

[02:45:18.430 --> 02:45:20.990]
Probably giving some notices out to those folks down there saying

[02:45:20.990 --> 02:45:22.570]
Happy New Year and guess what?

[02:45:22.750 --> 02:45:23.170]
You're fired

[02:45:24.010 --> 02:45:28.110]
But good luck to you because we know it be no problem with your talents getting another job

[02:45:29.790 --> 02:45:31.410]
Boy oh boy what a

[02:45:31.410 --> 02:45:36.450]
Yeah and here we go again with this great FCC with Al Sykes and the Bush people

[02:45:36.450 --> 02:45:40.070]
This is like their last parting shot on the dot the eye

[02:45:40.730 --> 02:45:42.650]
They're big shot to the radio industry

[02:45:42.650 --> 02:45:46.890]
Don't say crap on the air we're going to find Howard in the infinity 80 trillion dollars

[02:45:47.370 --> 02:45:50.230]
Because we don't like Jesse Helms though like what he says on the air

[02:45:51.430 --> 02:45:54.810]
But go ahead and buy up like buy up all the stations in town

[02:45:54.810 --> 02:45:57.390]
That's okay and hire four people to run them all

[02:45:57.390 --> 02:45:58.590]
How would that be?

[02:45:59.450 --> 02:46:02.070]
See because that's how radio ownership people are

[02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:07.010]
If they could automate talk if they could find a way to automate what they they do it in a heartbeat

[02:46:08.490 --> 02:46:13.850]
I remember when I worked in West Palm and WJNO at that time the FM was slush

[02:46:14.350 --> 02:46:18.610]
Slush music with those some tape service you know used to come in on those big reels

[02:46:19.090 --> 02:46:21.850]
And now and I'll say in serosota when I worked at SPB

[02:46:21.850 --> 02:46:25.170]
And part of your duties was that like every hour or so

[02:46:25.170 --> 02:46:28.570]
You'd have to go in there and change the tapes on the automation machine

[02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:33.170]
Right change those tapes on the automation machine in other words

[02:46:33.170 --> 02:46:37.690]
They had a radio station running running commercials and money coming in and there wasn't nobody running it

[02:46:37.690 --> 02:46:41.290]
They had they had not a low payroll they had no payroll

[02:46:41.910 --> 02:46:47.050]
And that's what they're out for man is to hoard the airwaves and these assholes up there are worried about well

[02:46:47.050 --> 02:46:51.150]
These airwaves belong to the public and how it's saying douchebag right

[02:46:51.610 --> 02:46:57.070]
And in the meantime what you're doing is saying all these grave robbers out there that's okay the airwaves belong to the public

[02:46:57.070 --> 02:47:00.430]
But we'll let you buy them all up for a while till you can bleed all the money out of me can

[02:47:02.110 --> 02:47:03.550]
Here's a mobile in Haya-Lia

[02:47:04.010 --> 02:47:04.410]
Nail

[02:47:04.410 --> 02:47:05.130]

[02:47:05.130 --> 02:47:05.790]

Tremendous happy new year to you sir

[02:47:07.530 --> 02:47:09.070]

[02:47:10.510 --> 02:47:11.610]
And to yours two

[02:47:12.050 --> 02:47:12.450]
Listen

[02:47:12.450 --> 02:47:13.030]
Yes

[02:47:13.030 --> 02:47:14.230]
A couple questions

[02:47:14.230 --> 02:47:17.590]
Number one is hot one of five word change formats

[02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:18.830]
No I don't think so

[02:47:19.370 --> 02:47:21.370]
They're going to call it not so hot 105

[02:47:21.850 --> 02:47:26.070]
Because I was thinking this is this might be a good opportunity for you to go back to the FM

[02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:26.570]
Yeah

[02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:31.170]
How about news for if I change stations it won't be for this company okay do you get my drift?

[02:47:31.450 --> 02:47:31.690]
Wow

[02:47:31.690 --> 02:47:32.170]
Yeah

[02:47:32.170 --> 02:47:33.690]
And second of all

[02:47:33.690 --> 02:47:37.130]
Boy guy is a geek so when is um

[02:47:38.470 --> 02:47:38.930]
Yeah

[02:47:38.930 --> 02:47:44.270]
I mean how long is this company going to have this guy as a program director?

[02:47:44.270 --> 02:47:51.130]
You know something your guess is I this man is better than the ever-ready cat he's got like 900 lives and no matter how much

[02:47:51.130 --> 02:47:55.430]
Swill he puts on the ear no matter what he does no matter how many people in the building have like

[02:47:55.430 --> 02:47:58.190]
Voodoo dolls in him at home that they're sticking sharp objects in all day

[02:47:58.190 --> 02:48:02.710]
He's still managed to come out smelling like a rose. I don't I have no idea how

[02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:07.350]
Can't believe do you still have that card with hangover saying boy guy is a geek

[02:48:07.990 --> 02:48:10.610]
I wouldn't be at all surprised as a matter of fact

[02:48:10.610 --> 02:48:17.710]
I'll see you and maybe he did take it and he ate it and the card too I have a Hank Goldberg story that I've

[02:48:18.410 --> 02:48:25.710]
Well have a great day okay phone just to crap out what was he doing what did I miss because I wasn't what happened

[02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:31.890]
What happened he wasn't cut off yeah and what happened

[02:48:34.090 --> 02:48:38.770]
Yeah he's cut off all right you see the phone thing there he's cut off I got because I'm not going to listen to that phone

[02:48:38.770 --> 02:48:44.730]
Pukin okay I can't leave that answer and I was just looking for the card anyway it saved me from having to tell that story because

[02:48:44.730 --> 02:48:51.750]
I promised I wouldn't tell him but boy just another loud mouth the malcontent trouble making geek Hank you just never

[02:48:51.750 --> 02:48:58.310]
Steeleast your consistent here's a lady in Lauderdale by the sea do you think your balls Bob yes I do as a matter of fact

Pink and stand out the crowd Palm Springs North if you have the far or go ahead and far

[02:49:07.630 --> 02:49:13.210]
Let's go to Clearwater hello yeah nail they must be calling from hot 105 yes

[02:49:13.210 --> 02:49:19.530]
Yes I just like to tell you that I really enjoyed the comments on the juice machines and you had mentioned you had

[02:49:19.530 --> 02:49:25.930]
Owned several in the past no I don't say several I said I had the champion years years ago long time ago before it became

[02:49:25.930 --> 02:49:32.150]
Fashionable and chic and I have that Vitamix which is as useless as dog droppings and I got this juice man

[02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:39.310]
Too which I wouldn't wish on anybody well I've been working on yesterday and one thing I noticed was they all have a distance seems to be a very small

[02:49:39.310 --> 02:49:47.150]
Slide to put the thing down or the fruit or vegetable style yeah is that a slide normal for all of them a small slot yeah do you

[02:49:47.150 --> 02:49:52.070]
Have to chop everything up before you put it up to chop it up but you can't you can't put an apple hole in the juicer

[02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:58.090]
You have to slice it like into quarters which isn't you know even I can do that it's not a major undertaking as they say at let's go

[02:49:58.930 --> 02:50:06.910]
Okay, I envision you could just drop tomatoes and everything in these things and the one that I was looking at that drop tomatoes in a juicer yeah

[02:50:07.790 --> 02:50:12.950]
I guess there is such a thing as tomato juice I guess I don't know I never really thought about making tomato juice

[02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:18.930]
Oh yeah well you could slice it up and then of course you can buy that real spiffy knife that they sell on their on TV too on the infomercial

[02:50:18.930 --> 02:50:23.950]
Yeah well I can slice him with a vegematic and spray paint in black with Ron Popeel's hairspray

[02:50:24.790 --> 02:50:30.950]
I really enjoy your show just remember what I told you the entire audience do not ever buy anything off a TV infomercial

[02:50:31.690 --> 02:50:40.050]
If the product was any good it would be in the store and trust me when I tell you and it's and it's got it's guaranteed to be overpriced

[02:50:40.050 --> 02:50:44.550]
Because they have to charge you an arm and leg to make up for that enormous cost of the advertising they're doing

[02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:47.570]
Absolutely absolutely one other thing in your management

[02:50:47.570 --> 02:50:53.650]
Now to take that J.O. what's his name and stick him right in his juice man J. Nortich or Cordich whatever's name is

[02:50:53.650 --> 02:50:58.070]
Yeah I think your management is really sensitive on letting people go around this time of year

[02:50:58.070 --> 02:51:01.030]
Right at the holidays we're famous for doing that at least work in system

[02:51:01.030 --> 02:51:04.350]
Yeah most people at least have the courtesy or the least the feeling

[02:51:04.350 --> 02:51:09.590]
Not here we give a nice card it says it's from the sisters happy holidays you're fired and get out

[02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:10.790]
Sounds like a fun place to work

[02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:12.450]
It sure is have a great new year pal

[02:51:12.450 --> 02:51:13.270]
Happy new year to you

[02:51:13.270 --> 02:51:14.170]
See ya

[02:51:14.170 --> 02:51:18.790]
So Mark Clayton says that Lisa Olsen is a rank-waste watcher

[02:51:18.790 --> 02:51:21.510]
I just thought I'd mention that in case you missed the beginning of the show

[02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:25.610]
The article in the Sun Sentinel totally different from the covert article in the Harold

[02:51:26.690 --> 02:51:29.670]
This is South Florida's news traffic and weather station

[02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:30.270]
So watch this

[02:51:30.270 --> 02:51:35.530]
Use the radio's 610 WIOD by any Fort Lauderdale and the Palm Beaches

[02:51:36.590 --> 02:51:37.590]
You dummy
