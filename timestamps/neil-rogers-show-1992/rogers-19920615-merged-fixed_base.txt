[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.500]
New stock radio, 610 WIOD presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.400]
To get in touch and talk with Neil Dyle, 751 WIOD from day.

[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.380]
Inbrouwer, it's 524 WIOD.

[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.820]
Outside the real library, you code.

[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.320]
Don't free 1-800-944 WIOD.

[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.360]
And those hot mobility customers will make a free call by dialing star IOD.

[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.480]
The opinions expressed by the guest's toaster callers are not necessarily those of this station.

[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.020]
Now, here's Neil Rogers on News Dog Radio, 610 WIOD.

[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.420]
It might not be as bad as everyone says.

[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.480]
Springtime is here, so I'm cleaning my kitchen.

[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.740]
I have to mop under my fridge at there.

[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.680]
I sweep a big dust balls in a couple of magnets.

[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.060]
I'm always grossed out by the things under there.

[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.800]
The more that I clean well, the stuff thickets we eat up.

[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.340]
My grandma's old dancer, some green pizza crusts, a killer.

[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.920]
The hamster that I lost, we're back in the 60s.

[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.080]
He's decomposing and he's turning to dust.

[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.020]
And I don't clean down there.

[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.140]
It's time to get on made.

[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.420]
Got you passing rubber gloves.

[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.320]
So my hands don't smell that way.

[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.020]
And I don't want to clean down there.

[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.560]
It comes up, bugs my way.

[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.080]
Coming at me big and loud.

[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.020]
I hear the road just saying.

[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.600]
It's a lot of down here.

[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.660]
We like to sink and swell.

[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.200]
Drunk the food all the way.

[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.560]
There's saying no words for tell.

[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.660]
It's a lot of down here.

[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.540]
We like to sink and swell.

[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.300]
Drunk the food all the way.

[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580]
There's saying no words for tell.

[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.300]
It was his word.

[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.360]
Not his pedophile.

[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.420]
1007 at WIOD.

[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.700]
Happy Monday, man.

[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.360]
Hallelujah.

[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.860]
Oh, God.

[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.800]
That's all I can say.

[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.700]
Oh, God.

[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.940]
Right. Amen.

[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.780]
Let's all just sit around and pray a while.

[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.880]
How the hell did I make it?

[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.620]
How am I here?

[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.500]
And like the whole room is spinning before my eyes.

[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.300]
Where do I start?

[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.540]
Where do I start?

[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.640]
Who the hell needs calls?

[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.900]
Who the hell needs anything?

[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.700]
All we do have a mobile and four-letter deal.

[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.340]
Welcome back.

[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.500]
Did you like to be our first call on our day?

[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.800]
My first day on my black and blue wedding?

[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.740]
Welcome back.

[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.240]
Yeah.

[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.180]
We missed you.

[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.500]
I got a black and blue spot, the size of Montana.

[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.880]
Like a whole white size.

[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.440]
Am I all right?

[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.920]
Yeah, you took it easy at home.

[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.160]
Am I all right compared to what?

[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.460]
Compared to like Elvis?

[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.920]
Yeah, I feel better than he does.

[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.500]
That's great.

[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.720]
It's one to welcome you back.

[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.040]
We all make the temperature of the tens of thousands of other things.

[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.200]
Thank you so much.

[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.140]
And we're glad to have you back.

[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.080]
And have a great day.

[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.560]
Thank you.

[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.120]
Bye-bye.

[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.920]
Well, wasn't that nice, huh?

[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.580]
Speaking nice, thanks to the people of Ticket Defense teams.

[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.880]
That'd be a nice plant, Randy Malta, and all those guys.

[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.140]
People had called a race course.

[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.540]
That'd be a beautiful plant.

[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.760]
The people at Pompo Park sent me a huge fruit basket

[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.880]
from exotic gardens.

[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.380]
And the people of exotic gardens got so excited about that

[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.000]
that the drivers and the other people over there sent me a plant.

[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.420]
A really nice one too, which I appreciate.

[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.380]
So thanks to exotic gardens and whom I leave it out.

[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.120]
So I shouldn't have started doing this.

[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.860]
I shouldn't have started doing this.

[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.460]
Oh, this is embarrassing because they were like a whole bunch of crap.

[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.500]
I mean, nice stuff.

[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.580]
Oh, gee.

[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.420]
This is bad because I'm going to leave out about three or four people

[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.500]
that took the time to send me plants and stuff.

[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.180]
I mentioned colder, right?

[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.260]
Who did I leave out?

[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.060]
I should have made a little list, shouldn't I?

[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.960]
Crap.

[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.600]
Well, I'm looking up and down the log here.

[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.240]
Maybe it'll rekindle some memories.

[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.720]
Then I'll point out the ones who didn't say anything.

[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.920]
Yeah, thanks a lot to those people who didn't do a damn thing.

[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.040]
Like, of course, I could mention the management of this radio station.

[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.020]
I don't want to mention them.

[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.980]
That's my opinion.

[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.920]
I'm like Disney.

[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.200]
Yeah.

[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.440]
Not a card, not a call, not a letter, not a flower, not a pansy, not a anything.

[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.000]
Nothing.

[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480]
Are you alive?

[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.140]
Is there anything we can do?

[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.580]
Nothing.

[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.340]
Zero zippity, do da, nothing.

[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.340]
I know that most of you feel that I'm making it up that nobody in this audience can believe.

[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.740]
So it's heartless and mindless because I went through hell.

[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.400]
I mean, this has been a rough 10 days.

[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.260]
Everybody thought, eh, it's a piece of cake.

[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.840]
We heard that fat red shit, huh?

[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.320]
Yeah.

[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.480]
The only piece of cake that he was involved with is the one that they removed that they thought was his gallbladder,

[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.720]
which was a gigantic piece of that double chocolate cheesecake that he ate on the way home in the car a couple of years ago.

[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.500]
And by the way, Rich, I have real exciting news for you.

[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.820]
I was thinking about it over the weekend.

[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.720]
The black and blue, of course, takes several days when you're fat to raise to the surface, to the skin, so that you actually see it.

[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.520]
So my doctor was explaining to me over the weekend that it did.

[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.080]
There's about three inches of fat on me that has to,

[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.140]
so it was like a delayed reaction several days after the surgery.

[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.640]
All of a sudden you start getting this gigantic black and blue where you lost all this blood.

[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.220]
So Rich, in about six months, man, you're going to be like one huge, a black and blue whale.

[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.120]
They can put you in a sequerium, baby.

[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.040]
You're going to look great.

[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.940]
I know I let somebody out.

[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.920]
Damn, I mentioned ticket defense team.

[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.260]
And there were some other sponsors who sent plants because I had like about a half a dozen at least plants.

[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.600]
And the nice thing from Poppano Park and Calder.

[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.280]
And I keep mentioning the same ones over and over again because I can't remember who the other ones were.

[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.140]
Damn it.

[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.920]
God has had embarrassing.

[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.540]
But I should do remember who the ones who were conspicuous by their absence were.

[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.160]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.960]
Like 610 WIOD Cox Enterprises with their $5.2 billion.

[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.260]
I mean, I talked to George and Cheryl a couple of times, but that was like personal, basically.

[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.500]
I mean, that wasn't business.

[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.980]
Nothing.

[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.820]
Not a, not as there like anything we can do.

[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.200]
And thank God that Rick Riley let me on the ear last, what day was that?

[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.780]
Was it Monday?

[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.460]
When I was screaming, I'm never going to get out of here alive.

[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.640]
See, that was people think that they must think that that was like a joke, okay?

[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.440]
It wasn't a joke.

[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.420]
It was not a joke.

[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.840]
I believed at that point that I would never see the outside again.

[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.140]
It was like somebody in Auschwitz getting a phone line.

[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.200]
Please, let me speak to anybody.

[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.480]
Okay, put me on the air.

[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.140]
Oh, yes.

[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.280]
Even their show.

[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.560]
Anything.

[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.860]
Oh, how did I get out of there?

[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.500]
I had to practically fight my way out.

[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.280]
Let me just give a word of advice because I have lots to say today.

[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.240]
Okay, let me give a word of advice to everybody.

[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.820]
Any age in this audience do never, ever go into any hospital alone.

[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.220]
Bring Dr. Bob Mendelsen.

[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.420]
He used to say this all the time.

[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.480]
Bring somebody with you, preferably somebody big and push you like fat Richard, somebody like that.

[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:38.700]
Somebody with a big mouth, somebody will practically stand guard around the clock at your door to save your life and to fight your battles for you and to prevent them from just totally doing whatever they want to you, man.

[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.840]
They took enough blood out of me.

[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.360]
They could have a blood bank over there.

[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.840]
There should be a plaque on the wall at Mount Sinai, the Neorodger's blood bank.

[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.140]
I'm serious. They could have filled a bathtub with blood.

[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.420]
And in the meantime, they're saying, oh, your blood counts.

[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.880]
You're low. I can't understand why.

[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.140]
No, I can't either. Okay.

[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.660]
Take care. Have another gallon.

[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.320]
Here you go.

[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.140]
Oh, God.

[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.860]
They had big broad needles in the size of Vermont.

[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.180]
You could have filled up.

[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.420]
I thought they were like serving tomato juice.

[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.880]
And boy, the food. Don't give me started on that.

[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.000]
The best.

[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.640]
Mmm. Gourmet cuisine.

[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:13.280]
Yeah.

[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.380]
God.

[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.740]
Hey, attention. All Toyota Honda and Nissan owners.

Well, you can.

When you buy a new 92 Toyota only at Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:32.320]
It's true. Toyota of Hollywood is offering sticker price trade-ins on all 85-91 Toyota's Honda's and Nissan's.

[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.880]

[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.320]
Just run around inside.

[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.540]
Say, are you a sales person?

[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.880]

On 441 between tapped and Sheridan streets in Hollywood open late every night for your spending convenience.

[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.520]
The opinions expressed in this program and I'm necessarily those who extend WIOM beards, five years.

[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.160]
10, 16 at WIOMD. So I opened up my Sunsendle.

[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:35.460]
The first day I get home last Tuesday after I had fought my way out and screamed and demanded freedom from Mount Sinai Hospital.

[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:44.780]
And the first thing I see in Tuesday morning Sunsendles an article about the excessive mortality rate at many of our nation's hospitals including Jackson here in town by the way.

[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.740]
And that people are dying like flies and hospitals kind of a shock to me.

[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.960]
Yeah. And then yesterday morning I opened up the Sunsendle and what does the headline say on page 3a?

[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.920]
Oh, I did that wrong. What does the headline say on page 3a?

[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:06.760]
Surgeons botched new technique it says really shocked the crap out of me complications arise from procedure.

[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.440]
Oh, by the way, before I get into this, I do want to say this, Dr. Harold Unger and his son Steven, the younger hunger.

[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.720]
They're the ones who did my surgery. They're the best. They're the best in the country at this. He's done over 400 these.

[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:24.300]
Thank God. Lot of practice. So he's the best. Now if he's the best in he did this and I came out looking like this, what's going to happen if I would have had the worst?

[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.500]
Your great hero. I love you. Okay. You're just tremendous. But the thing is when you go in, they tell you nothing.

[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.460]
They tell you nothing. And let me just tell you this. I don't want anybody to get scared. I want anybody to get.

[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.520]
I want you to get scared. Crapless is what I want you to get.

[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.320]
Before you go into a hospital, let them play with your body. That's what I want you to get psychotic.

[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.560]
I want you to ask questions that haven't been invented yet.

[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:58.980]
Because they tell you absolutely not. Oh, yeah. Piece of cake for a little thing. No, boy. Whip that baby out. Sure. Piece of cake.

[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.440]
Uh-huh. Full of crap.

[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.280]
Just from the anesthesia alone, you can croak. Seriously, there's some people who just have like violent reactions.

[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:15.420]
Anesthesia general anesthesia is like a major major. Even if you have no surgery at all, I don't want to go into a big thing.

[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.860]
I'm not going to go into a doctor show here today, but I will. I will.

[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.240]
Because I have never felt so strongly about anything in my life, which I have left here at this point my life.

[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.520]
But there were many times in last week I thought not.

[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.100]
They were going to bring it instead of the best of Neil. The rest of Neil is what they were going to bring in like in a little box.

[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.260]
I mean the things that go on and then they start coming in and scaring the daylight Saudi.

[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:46.040]
And oh, geez, you might get pneumonia. Of course I was in a room where it was like 500 below zero is blowing a geol like a wind towel from the ceiling.

[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.460]
They bring the technicians know speak at the English. They bring them on a ladder three o'clock in the morning.

[00:11:50.560 --> 00:12:02.200]
They're up there, patching around on the ceiling. He pulls a big towel out of this thing. Somebody had shoved the towel up in his damn vet on the ceiling like a huge beach towel because the wind was blowing out there a hundred miles an hour.

[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.500]
But hey, you can't take deep breaths because it hurts every time you breathe after the surgery.

[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.740]
So you better get up and what move around because otherwise you're going to get pneumonia.

[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.960]
But the fact that we got it a hundred below zero and here we can't stop the wind. Hey little don't don't bother us. Don't be a nitpicker.

[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.520]
Okay. Don't be a troublemaker now.

[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.940]
Oh, you if I started now, it would be midnight.

[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:31.900]
Not today midnight like Thursday by the time I finished with a stories of everything in this experience, you cannot believe it.

[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:41.100]
You can't imagine in your wildest nightmares, all of the things that go on and then you tell the nerd, how can anybody sleep on those beds?

[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.660]
And the nurse says, oh, nobody sleeps in here. You can't sleep on that bed.

[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:54.520]
The only time you ever fall asleep in a hospital is when you are so physically worn out and so exhausted and you've lost so much blood and nutrients because the food nobody can touch.

[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.820]
My dog would laugh at it when you're just so tell you just collapse.

[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.540]
And then you wake up in this bizarre position, you know, think how the hell could I ever fall asleep like this only because you're so exhausted?

[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:11.220]
The hospital is not a place to heal. It's not a place to get better. It's not a place where it's a place to die.

[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:17.740]
It's a place to catch everything that's ever been invented and some germs and diseases that nobody can even identify yet.

[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.580]
That's what a hospital is. So anyway, the story says surgeons botched new technique.

[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.200]
Kind of caught my eye.

[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.200]
Complications arise from procedure to remove gallbladders it says New York, New York Times.

[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:42.700]
Surgeons who rushed to use a new technique to remove gallbladders without adequate training have botched many procedures New York State Health Officials and surgical experts say.

[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:53.720]
Since August of 1990, at least seven patients have died and 185 others have suffered serious or life threatening complications from the procedure.

[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:59.460]
Laperoscopic gallbladder surgery at 99 of New York States, 200 for this is just in New York.

[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:07.480]
Complications are being reported to the Department of the rate of three or four each week. Some patients have blood to death.

[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:16.940]
And others have needed several additional operations to repair and reconstruct organs and tissues damaged in the surgery.

[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:24.760]
Our frequent injury is to the common bile duct, the vital tube through which bile flows to the bowel to aid digestion.

[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:40.180]
And other patients, the bowel and urinary bladder were injured. To reduce the hazards, the health department issued guidelines on Friday specifying that surgeons must perform at least 15 Laperoscopies under supervision before a hospital may issue credentials permitting them to perform the operation independently.

[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.700]
That's said, or and so on.

[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:54.020]
The operation, this is the best, the last paragraph, the best part. The operation is often called bandaid surgery because it leaves a smaller scar than the traditional operation.

[00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:02.100]
And of course, by calling it bandaid surgery, it kind of in your mind minimizes the idea that this is serious, potentially life threatening surgery.

[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.840]
Right, of course, just a piece of cake, sure.

[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:11.020]
Here, let's just put like four bullet holes in your abdomen. You'll feel great in a couple of days. Man, no problem at all.

[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:30.720]
God, 1022 at WIOD. I can't really believe that I'm sitting here. I just cannot believe it. A week ago today, I would have bit anything that they would have had like just body parts scattered around the building out by the WS News tombstone out there in the front. There's just no way.

[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:47.740]
Anyway, let me tell you about a little gizmo that's really exciting called the Sony Data Discman, an electronic book reader that's capable of displaying thousands of pages of text and graphics stored on a removable disc and the unit is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Believe me when I tell you, and remarkably easy to use as well.

[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:59.360]
In fact, George has been a twang with this one all weekend long. He's been playing with it and looks worn out. The Sony Data Discman enables you to access an entire library worth of information right on the top of your desk or in your briefcase.

[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:10.660]
And the Data Discman is a reference source that puts a world of information right at your fingertips just a few of the titles available right now, the dictionary of American slang international wine guide Henry world travel translator,

[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:24.580]

[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:32.700]
The Sony Data Discman is a learning tool for school for business and pleasure, a whole world of information that can fit right in the palm of your hand in your pocket or your briefcase.

[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:40.840]
So see a Sony Data Discman today at your nearest brandsmart location and I'll say it again the Groilliers and cyclopedia is included free with every unit that you buy.

[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:04.160]
This was supposed to be spontaneous guys we don't need to hook up wireless mics and strap the bartenders down hold on just a second here.

[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:14.280]
Well, first owners are busy, huh? Okay, oh we can hear you good Marvin. Hey Marvin. Okay, we got a shot of tell him a shot of Quervo Gold. Okay, now you need to get a shot of Kaluah.

[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:28.100]
Oh, man, hey, make that two-gone drinkos.

[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:36.660]
Here we can judge this Monday afternoon on South Florida's news traffic and weather station news talk radio 6 stand W I O D.

[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.600]
Don't touch that dial coming up this afternoon at two. It's Rick Briley and S. C.O.M.A.N.

[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.180]
Join us then for Rick and S.O.M.A.

[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.680]
I just remember one of the people I left out Peter would absolutely travel. They said a beautiful plant. Thank you so much profusely

[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:58.660]
and I'm sure there were a couple of others that I left out. Okay, there's only one thing I want to say before I take this next call and that is...

[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.140]
I'll tell you what, that call you made Monday. You sounded scared crap.

[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:10.720]
Scared isn't the that's the understatement of the century. I was hoping remember when Lee Harvey Oswald,

[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:18.020]
you remember that thing where he was saying I'm requesting somebody to come forward and give me legal assistance like he was like alone and desperate

[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:24.460]
and anybody just somebody anywhere come forward and help my ass out of this because I'm a taxi. Right. Right.

[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:32.220]
And that's how I felt. Not how I felt how I was. You can't get... well you're of course calling to say that I told you so.

[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:37.840]
No. And you're right I should have been in retrospect if I would have drank the olive oil and the lemon juice.

[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.460]
The worst that could have happened would have been a couple of bad VMs. Okay, I mean that would have been the worst.

[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:50.100]
Well, anyway, I mean at least people will learn at least there will be somebody out there that will do it the right way because of all of this.

[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:56.840]
Or at least check it out. Yeah. Check it out. They don't give you a chance to ask anything. Okay, they have the pre-optidate before.

[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.300]
Yeah. And you go in and they make a little scratch on your arm, okay.

[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:08.420]
Would you listen to me? Yeah, go ahead. You're not listening. I'm listening. They make a little scratch on your arm to check the bleeding time how fast you heal. Yeah.

[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:15.740]
And it's supposed to be between three and nine minutes, three being the fastest and nine being the slowest acceptable if you're going to undergo surgery.

[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:24.800]
Nine minutes is you know how mine was nine minutes because I'm diabetic. I'm a very slow healer. People would diabetes heal very slowly.

[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:33.220]
Did they question that? So, huh? Did they question that? Well, they said, hey, it's close enough to us. It's close enough to nine, eleven, whatever was nine minutes.

[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:41.640]
What would kick me in the butt is do you remember the call from the surgeon who agreed that it would work in 85% of the case? The olive oil right.

[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:51.300]
You know, so. And as it turns out, because I didn't hear it, but my mother who spent two days at my house, which I didn't want to talk about, but my mother was telling me that somebody called on a Rick and Spud.

[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:58.460]
Somebody who was part of the operating thing at the hospital and they said some kid, he said that the Neal's gallbladder was like a white hot.

[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:06.200]
And then it had a bunch of small like a couple hundred real small stones that were about the size of tomato seeds. Well, tomato seeds are very small.

[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:17.060]
Yeah. So it seemed to see my concern with the olive oil was afraid I'd have some big ones in that I get one lodged in there and go, you know, and of course if it gets lodged, your gallbladder blows up like a balloon and like deadly.

[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:27.160]
Well, they replay the call that we talked about the forge, Kagan the two inch. Right. Well, it would all came out the end anyway. Yeah. But I'm glad you're all right.

[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:37.800]
I'm telling you this is just I can't describe it. I just can't believe that I survived this thing. I mean, everything from the if you could have seen, I wish we could have a live studio audience.

[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:50.880]
Alex Benner would have been proud when these two guys from the pulmonary unit come in these two clowns and they made a speech. My nurse almost passed out on the floor. She got so frightened from the speech about how they're taking an X ray.

[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:51.720]
Okay. Yeah.

[00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:03.980]
And they found like two little tiny marks on my lungs. Well, my doctor, Dr. Unger, who like I said, if I would listen to him the whole time, I'd have been a great shape because he's the only one who knows what the alley was talking about.

[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:15.880]
But you can't just have one doctor. You got like 85 different doctors. Okay. And they come in and they make a speech about well, you know, the surgery, you get blood and the thing. He gets loose in your legs and then a blood clots and they can come into your lungs.

[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:31.440]
And they made this alarming thing about pulmonary embolisms and how dangerous they are. And of course, that's not going to affect your blood pressure. Right. Now listen to me. They then then they start talking about angiograms. I said, listen, even a more unlike me knows what that is. There ain't no way I'm going to go into angiogram.

[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:38.300]
So they, well, the first thing we do, it's called a lung scan. Okay. So they take me down. I want you to listen to this very carefully. Okay.

[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:52.560]
Anybody in this audience, if anyone ever says they're going to do a lung scan on your body, call the police, call the FBI, call everybody you know and run some serious and run out of their screaming and yelling. They're trying to kill me.

[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.040]
Okay. They take me downstairs. They lie my fat body on. Now I'm trying to picture this. Will you in a blue smoke?

[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:06.420]
Yeah, it's blue smoke. I mean, one of those hospital gowns. That's the first thing they do is make sure you're running around almost naked so that you feel totally defensive.

[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:17.860]
Right. Exactly. So they take me down and lie me on this slab. And they take, I'm telling you, I know, I know I saw Mengele was one of the name of the doctors in this room. I'm serious.

[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:37.180]
And they take a hood like an SNM thing and they strap it around your head so serious so tight that it feels like your head is going to explode. Okay. I'm not making this up. You're laughing. This is serious. They then take the mouthpiece, which is like a breathing thing from from oxygen. Right.

[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:57.840]
And they put that over your mouth. Right. And then they say, don't worry about it. Are you claustrophobic at all? Well, I found out I was. They said, don't worry about it. This is pure oxygen. Just take deep breaths. Okay. Thank you so much. Sunny. Just send some nice stuff. Thank you, sir. So anyway, then they tell you to breathe well after the first 30 seconds.

[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:15.600]
You don't feel like you are breathing. Even though they tell you they give you a story while it's pure oxygen. You don't feel like you're breathing. You feel like you're smothering. I mean smothering and this thing on your head is so tight. And I just reached up and grabbed it off my head. I couldn't stand it. I thought it was going to lose my mind. Oh, no, not yet. Not yet. Just just keep breathing. Okay.

[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:26.500]
What don't they want you to see? And so we know it's not that you can't see. You can see. But but this thing is strapped from like your forehead around the back of your head. You can see.

[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:43.520]
It's just that you can't breathe. That's all and that your head is exploding. So now he puts it back. Then he puts it back on there again. And for about another 40 seconds to a minute. I guess I finally lasted long enough to get it done. And then I reached up. I just pulled it off again. I said no. I just.

[00:23:43.520 --> 00:24:13.140]
Then they take the thing and they put it over your head to take pictures of your lungs with some other thing and they lower it to the part where it's just about touching your body like like an MRI or something like that. And now you're lying there and you've just gone through this other real constrictive claustrophobic experience. And you just finished. And now that takes forever and they inject. Of course you got the little IV thing conveniently on your on your wrist. See. So any everybody comes. Oh, here. Let me stick some stuff in there. Okay. You don't have any idea what they're sticking in the IV. Oh, here. Let me put the needle in there.

[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:25.340]
And you're lying there to take. So the best part of the whole deal is then after this they take me in for ultrasound of my legs to check for blood clots, which ultrasound is fine. It's like they do on a gallbladder. That's a that's that is a piece of cake. That's painless.

[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:43.500]
Right. And the two women are in there and they're looking and find no problem at all. They're squeezing my legs. You see the blood. There's no blood clots in there. So I'm lying there. And now these two SNM pulmonary guys come in. Oh, man. The pictures are perfect. Dr. Unger was right. It was nothing. We do.

[00:24:43.500 --> 00:25:13.480]
Just was false alarm. And of course, see they can always say, well, you know, this pulmonary embolism can be fatal. So we're just covering the really covering their ass. But we're just making sure you know what I'm going to say? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Listen, when they get you in there, every test that's ever been invented every test that they ever thought of every machine that the hospital can afford to buy. You're helping to pay for. Okay. Because they're going to do everything on you that they can think of doing. But you know, something that kind of puts me up because after that I started turning everybody down.

[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:24.320]
I go back up. I'm back. I'm back. All over. You can wheel me around in there anyway. All my are you can wheel me all over the hospital. God. I have so many nice people are in Mount Sinai and so many nice looking people in her too.

[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:35.500]
Of course, my luck. I'm in there. You know, if I would have if the way even bother talking about it. You know what I'm saying? They would have lined up at the door. There's nothing I could do at that point. I'm like helpless. Oh.

[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:44.560]
There's really a lot of things. No. Thank God. Catheter. Yeah. Give me. Bray. Usually after anesthesia, you have a hard time, you know, moving.

[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:56.140]
No, I just had a little bottle. Oh, you were lucky. Yeah. Okay. And boy, how do you feel? How do I feel right now? Yeah. Just a little week. Yeah. You ought to see the giant black and blue.

[00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:03.360]
I'm showing it to everybody in the building who's got a strong enough stomach to look. I've got the black and blue. I'd say a third of my whole right side is dark purple.

[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:33.340]
Let me ask you a question. This is what I don't understand. Yes. Normally when you get gallbladder taxes because the stones are large. No, not necessarily. So the smaller ones get logs. They fit right over the opening. I understand. Okay. I was only here. You're going to be all right. I guess. I guess as far as I know, unless there are any more surprises coming, unless the doctor, the, the pill. Oh, and then I didn't even tell you the best part. I haven't even gotten to the best part of the story. Okay. Let's see.

[00:26:34.540 --> 00:27:03.320]
I finally forced my way out begging and pleading. I'm on a phone at four in the morning. I mean, you go in that hospital. You just the minutes are like hours and the hours are like centuries. And you're so uncomfortable and the temperature. And there's like this gas. They switched me to another room because the wind tunnel in the first room. They couldn't stop. They put me in another room. Seriously. And it was like either too hot or too cold. But no matter what the temperature was, there was like poison gas coming from the ceiling. Okay. I felt like I was at Auschwitz. I'm telling you. I kept saying I'm like in a concentration. I'm like, I'm going to go out and get a drink. I'm going to go out and get a drink. I'm going to go out and get a drink. I'm going to go out and get a drink. I'm going to go out and get a drink. I'm going to go out and get a drink. I'm going to go

[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:33.300]
out and get a drink. I'm going to go out and get a drink. I'm going to go out and get a drink. I'm on a phone at four in the morning. I'm in a concentration camp. I'm nauseous all the time just

[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.360]
infection. He gives me a prescription for a horse-pill penicillum. It's called

[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.140]
augmentant, 500 milligrams, three at a. Do you know how much 500 milligrams of

[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.580]
anything is? The pills are like elephant droppings. That's how big they are.

[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:50.060]
Well, that night, guess what? I'm allergic. I find out, which I never knew before. I

[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:54.540]
start itching. You ever have poison ivy? From my hands, my back, I'm breaking out

[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.720]
in the hives. I went through seven, eight hours of the worst living hell in the

[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:04.480]
history of the human race, augmentant. How do you like that? So in other words,

[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.860]
no matter what was going on, none of it had anything had to do with my gallbladder.

[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.580]
Did you follow what I'm saying? I was going through all these other pulmonary

[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.120]
embolisms. You're bleeding to death inside. You've got like screaming hives. It was a

[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.680]
pleasant week. But you took the time to call Rick and Fud. Yeah. Have a good... Well,

[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.540]
wait a minute. How much have you lost? What do you mean by that? I mean, through all this trauma,

[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.600]
you had to lose some weight. No, no, I weigh exactly the same. You're kidding. No, I'm not

[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.840]
kidding. Well, they pump your sofa full of crap. It takes like seven years just to get the

[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.160]
chemicals out of your body. Anyway, did you get to keep any of the stones? Good day.

[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:48.300]
1037 at WIOD. Hey, now I can go with Arnold's all the time, okay? I'm serious. Once you get

[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.060]
your gallbladder out, man, you can enjoy the great stuff from Arnold's Royal Castle. Like,

[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.340]
round the clock, nonstop, those great Neely burgers and those fantastic Rochester white

[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.440]
hots. In those great, uh, bratwurst from Don and Bob's, you just can't beat it as the

[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.760]
tradition lives on. And Wayne Arnold's Royal Castle. I've been doing it since 1980. As a

[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.580]
matter of fact, Wayne has been there for over 25 years, just working up a sweat right over

[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.220]
the... Well, not right over the grill, but at least a good distance. And the castle burgers

[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:17.920]
are made with blue ribbon ground beef, grilled sweet onions, pickle chip, your choice of toppings,

[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.240]
birch beer and the frosted mugs just like they did years ago. And the famous Rochester

[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.120]
at our White Hots in Red Hots with Wayne's own homemade Italian meat sauce that he jumps

[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:30.480]
up and down on with his big fat feet guaranteed the best coffee ever made with the same recipe

[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.640]
of blends used by the old original Royal Castle. And the Neely burger made with hotel cut

[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.040]
layered bacon and topped with hot melted American cheese. You'll love everything on a menu,

[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:43.380]
including, of course, the great breakfast that you can have 24 hours a day. And come in

[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.600]
this month and help celebrate the anniversary at Wayne Arnold's with the delicious free frosted

[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.740]
mug of birch beer with all food orders. You can't beat that with a stick. They're open 24

[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:56.520]
hours a day, seven days a week. Never closed, even on Chavuas. Wayne Arnold's Royal Castle,

[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:02.060]
just a block west of I-95 and 125th Street, 1 2490 Northwest 7th Avenue, in North Miami.

[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.700]
Never a hassle at Wayne Arnold's Royal Castle.

[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.820]
Out of the news update from the award winning 610 WIOD News, it comes up at the top of the

[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.060]
hour.

[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.960]
It's the Radio 610.

[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.960]
New from Heavily House, it's here at last, the Hipper scripture that speaks to today's

[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.180]
team.

[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:28.140]
It's the team Bible God Word, God Word, from us.

[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:33.580]
Yes, for your favorite Bible stories. The creation and God said excellent and love.

[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.720]
It was excellent. The fall of Adam and Eve.

[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:43.140]
Even Moses and the burning bush. I have a turn command for you.

[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:43.860]
No way.

[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:44.820]
Ways.

[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:50.260]
The team Bible also includes the top 10 songs of all time.

[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:55.500]
Yay, though I walked through the shadow of the Valley of Death. Wow, like serious

[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.260]
bummer.

[00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:01.120]
And you'll get the totally bodacious New Testament. Let it's the dude who's without sin.

[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.160]
Casper Stump.

[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:09.060]
So fast in your Bible belts and get your teen on the road to total salvation.

[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.080]
We're not worthy. We're not worthy.

[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.140]
The team Bible.

[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.060]
The good luck that cops are too.

[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.720]
Acknowledged party on 1042 WIOD. Here's a lady mobile in P-Rine.

[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:21.640]
I told you.

[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.580]
You're right.

[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.420]
I told you.

[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:23.780]
Yeah.

[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.500]
And definitely don't take drugs. I don't believe you let him give you drugs.

[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:28.800]
What do you mean by that?

[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.680]
Because they would have to when you took drugs.

[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.500]
Yeah. But you should know it's the.

[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.480]
I'm your my friend. I would have told you don't tell me.

[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.500]
Lady drug pusher. She knows better than anybody what she's doing to the public.

[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.880]
Don't take those things.

[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:43.800]
First of all, when you're in there, when you're in that hospital, when you get the anesthesia,

[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.540]
God only knows what they're pumping into your body.

[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:46.940]
Okay.

[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.420]
And you take days and days for all that stuff to work its way out.

[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:56.400]
And you have like gas inside every part, every bone, every rib.

[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.420]
I mean, just all over every time you move, it's like an internal fart.

[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.400]
I mean, it's just unbelievable.

[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.240]
And then you have that little IV on the wrist.

[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.600]
So like I said before, they keep coming along and just jab and stuff in there.

[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.420]
You don't know what they're putting in there.

[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.680]
That's part of being an earth.

[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.560]
And so finally, I just started saying no.

[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.800]
Well, get back up after this horrible lungs scan, which I thought was going to be the last moments of my life.

[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.040]
Okay. Can you ever imagine? Can you even envision a procedure like this?

[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.400]
I'm back up in a room within five minutes. There's two nurses in there.

[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.200]
Oh, guess what? We're both here to get blood.

[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.900]
One wants blood from the artery and the other from the vein.

[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.240]
I said, guess what? You're both leaving.

[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.580]
Okay. And I'm serious.

[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.920]
And after that, I started kicking everybody out.

[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.860]
I became the biggest pain in the ass.

[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.400]
They probably ever had in that hospital.

[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.940]
And that's my advice to everybody.

[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.200]
If you're in there alone, just make a nuisance of yourself.

[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:47.820]
Just make yourself the biggest pain in the ass and scream and carry on until they finally just can't handle it anymore.

[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.980]
Could you leave at 4 in the morning, really?

[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.140]
No, I was going to.

[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.280]
And I doctor rung her on the phone, convinced me to stay until seven.

[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.120]
And I somehow miraculously fell asleep.

[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.340]
I have no idea how.

[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.280]
And I wake up at seven. He comes in about 715.

[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.000]
He checks me over. You're okay.

[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.200]
And he signs me out. I'm discharged.

[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:12.180]
Okay. I'm waiting for them to come and take this little ivy thing out of my wrist so I can get there a lot of there and drive myself home.

[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.920]
Now about 20 minutes goes by and here, Dr. Furman, the Israeli pill doctor from across the street.

[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.100]
My other doctor in there, he appears at the door and I said, oh, my life is a worth a crap now.

[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.460]
Okay. I'm never getting out of here.

[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:32.040]
And on, he shows me the thing on the little page. Dr. Runger wrote, patient discharged upon approval of Dr. Furman.

[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.820]
So in other words, when he approves, I can get out.

[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:40.800]
And then he does take the time to mark me the two prescriptions, the one of which was for the penicillin that nearly turned my life into a living hell.

[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.040]
Lucky it didn't die. Have you ever taken a drug?

[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.400]
Have you ever taken a drug you're allergic to?

[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:56.640]
Never. I don't take drugs. If you can imagine, I'm serious. If you can imagine, your hands are so, are itching so bad and so red that you want to rub the skin off of them.

[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.180]
It's like having poison ivy only multiplied time 100.

[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:07.300]
And now hives are breaking out in huge blotches all over every part of your body on your ass, on your side, on your back.

[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:12.660]
And it's just, it's, and then even in fact at five in the morning, I had fall asleep for about 20 minutes.

[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:19.400]
I wake up and I feel a nodule on the side of my, the bridge of my nose, the size of a peanut on the bridge of my nose.

[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.740]
And you paid a hundred bucks for that prescription.

[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:27.080]
Two and a half bucks a tablet. Okay. Two and a half bucks a pill. Augmentin.

[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:27.680]
Exactly.

[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:33.220]
And I've taken other kinds of penicillin before. So there's no general rule of thumb if you're allergic to penicillin.

[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:33.920]
Never take it.

[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.240]
Oh man.

[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.680]
Never take it. You can die. I mean, you can have respiratory failure.

[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:44.060]
Yeah. And you know another thing that goes on since you're a pill pusher, you know, it's something that should be illegal.

[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:52.700]
You notice when you get your prescription, you almost never, ever get the package insert that tells you the contract.

[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.820]
Never. We don't want you to read that.

[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:59.480]
No, when you're not creating indications and all the side effects and all of a sudden, like, you know, sudden death, little minor things like that.

[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.900]
You never get that. You just get the nice little plastic bottle from the pharmacist, a little thing on it.

[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.260]
They too calm me.

[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.100]
Right. Exactly.

[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:12.580]
There should be a law in the state of Florida that there must be a package insert with every prescription or they can't sell it to you.

[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.520]
That should be the law in this goddamn state.

[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.060]
No way. Let's not get carried away.

[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:20.100]
Yeah. Right. Yeah. So you don't care. You have no conscience. You're slaughtering people.

[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.460]
I told you not to go in the hospital. I warned you. I told you not to do it.

[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:32.660]
You were right. And I kept thinking about that while I was in there. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that I really, most of the time felt I would never get out of there alive.

[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:40.860]
You're laughing, but I'm telling you I really believe that because the stuff that was going on was so ungodly, I can't even describe it to you.

[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.600]
I used to be a nurse of all.

[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:48.780]
How can you recover, first of all, when you're in a room where the air is like poison, okay?

[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:54.600]
It is so it is so unsafe to breathe to every breath. It's like you're breathing noxious fumes.

[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:59.380]
Just think of it. Thousands of sick people in this place breathing on the same recycling that they made.

[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:06.360]
Reading every cure and every disease that's ever been invented. And then secondly, the food is such a lack of anything edible there.

[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.280]
My dogs would have turned their nose. The amount that I ate now, fat rich finally smuggled me in a cheeseburger the other.

[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:19.180]
Seriously, it was from the cafeteria and it was just a mediocre cheeseburger, but it tasted like the greatest thing I'd ever eaten in my life.

[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.100]
It was just a miracle. A miracle.

[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.780]
Oh, God.

[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:28.520]
Yeah, that's what I said. I can't get over it. I just can't believe it. The people are so foolish.

[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:35.700]
And then I was at the track over the weekend at Pompano and a woman comes up to me to tell me stories about her poor husband that nearly bled to death in the hospital.

[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:41.020]
I went in for something relatively minor in a butchery to him up in the stuff that went on just incredible. It's unbelievable.

[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.800]
You were right. You were right. I know. I know.

[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.860]
I know. So why kind of call me a bitch. You tell him to sit on it.

[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:49.980]
Right. Sit on this.

[00:36:50.180 --> 00:37:01.420]
Right. Have a great day. Bye. Bye. Bye. She was right. 1047 at WIOD. We have an open line indeed. 751 and 2 and Broward. See that hasn't changed. Well, it's Monday.

[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:09.200]
Just try to keep in perspective. Okay. 524 WIOD 2 open lines and Broward. Let's not get carried away and show that we cared too much.

[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.640]
Okay. Let's not overreact here this morning because obviously we don't give a crap at all. These people are like our management here.

[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.480]
Okay. Totally indifferent to human suffering or anything.

[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.060]
Can you really believe that I still can't get over that?

[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:28.280]
I was in a hospital for four and a half days. I was like went through a major. I mean, this was like a serious nasty.

[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:38.520]
Maybe life threatening thing. Far worse than I ever dreamed. Not a phone call. Not a card. Not a bunch of twinkies. Not a not a plant.

[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.740]
Not a thing. Like I mean, they had sure knew where I was. They know my address.

[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:49.380]
I mean, they sure knew my phone number enough to have George call me and bug me about some commercial damn thing.

[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.140]
You know, here I'm lying there at home like wondering if I'm ever going to live again.

[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:58.280]
If my skin is ever going to stop itching and I'm ever going to be able to have one day of comfort again in my pathetic meaningless life.

[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:04.740]
Nothing from the powers that be here at Cox Broadcasting. You are we don't give a crap station. Okay.

[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.920]
Just totally absolutely insensitive to anything.

[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:17.680]
This fall joint is for another exciting season of dolphins and hurricanes. Football action right here on South Florida's sports station.

[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:28.280]
Danny Jackson is God. Yeah. 10. 52. A W I O D. Here's a little Joey on the phone. Another dispenser of killing drugs.

[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:35.980]
Glad to have you back there, Uncle. Yeah. Another guy who's making a whole life occupation of dispensing killer drugs to mankind.

[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:42.860]
I never said they killed anybody. They do. Well, that's because you took the wrong one. You're destroying the human race.

[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:50.100]
There are every this whole society's all hung up about street drugs and cocaine and pot and this one and that one and a hashish.

[00:38:50.100 --> 00:39:06.260]
You know, all this other crap I got news for you. There are more people dying every day in this country and more people hooked on these obnoxious disgusting highly destructive prescription drugs than all the people put together who are doing so called recreational drugs.

[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:17.540]
Okay. We got a drug problem in this country. All right. And it's from people like you and the Felden lady and all you doctors out there who are putting all these people on these prescription drugs have a nice life. Mike.

[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:25.980]
But I am making good money off. What is it? My Breneary just walked out. I want to say have a nice life before I mean you never know. You might not see him again. Yeah.

[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.640]
I told you at least I'm making money off it. Yeah, that's good. Well, at least you're a good American capitalist. We like that.

[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:43.000]
Like the medical profession they make money off of people suffering and I think that's great. Well, the doctors are the worst. And if you don't suffer already, they'll make sure that you will before you're through.

[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:55.740]
You still shooting up some prescription they gave you. I'm not shooting up anything. Okay. Oh, yeah. I'm going to go home and take some augmenting again. I'll take some here on the ear tomorrow, put on a real floor show for the audience.

[00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:07.620]
I'll bring some in and pass it around everybody. I just want to make sure you're doing. Do you know what that is augmenting? No, it's a form of penicillin. Do you know how much 500 milligrams of anything is a lot?

[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:17.060]
500 milligrams is like an elephant pill. It's like a whale pill. It's like a bowling ball. Okay. You have to shovel it down with a shoe horn. Okay.

[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:31.780]
500 milligrams three times a day. And by the time I got to the fifth one, my wrists were itching like I should have slid him. And by the time I finished the sixth one, my whole body was doing Saint Vitas dance dance on this doctor.

[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.660]
Oh, but I haven't 20 to 20. Wait till I tell you the best part of the story. All right.

[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:46.700]
So I get up in the morning. I mean, I say get up after maybe 20 minutes sleep. And I'm just through agony the whole night. And I put in a call to the pill doctors answering service. Okay.

[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:56.000]
And he calls me back a little while later. I had left the message that I had a bad reaction to one of the prescriptions he prescribed. That was a rash. Huh? That was a rash.

[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:14.800]
Listen to me. He calls and says, Neil, what happened? You got a rash? You know what that's like? That's like asking some of people in the in the Holocaust if they had a headache. That's what did I get a rash? Okay. And then he says, Oh, what a shame because you know, all those blood tests came back negative. In other words, I didn't have any infection.

[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:25.980]
I didn't have any bacteria. He said, I was going to call you yesterday and tell you to discontinue it. He was going to we never got around to it. But he was going to call me and tell me to discontinue taking it because again, just like the last one,

[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:41.520]
long scan and all this other invasive crap, it was unnecessary. It was just panic, panic city. They're also scared, crapless, that something's going to happen to you, that they're going to get a malpractice suit, that they wind up doing a thousand million different things to you that you don't need to be done in the first place.

[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:51.920]
And just using your body like a goddamn chemistry said like an experiment. Yeah, right. Right. Like a bad trip. What?

[00:41:54.380 --> 00:42:07.040]
Yeah, right. Just search your conscience, Joey. Me? Yeah. I have no guilt whatsoever. Just search your conscience for the damage that you're doing to the human race at their expense. Okay.

[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:18.080]
Just remember a sucker's born every minute. Exactly. See you later. Bye. 1056 and WIOD. Yeah. Isn't that a great line? I was going to call you yesterday. All the tests came back negative.

[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:37.980]
I was going to call you and tell you to discontinue it. Didn't get around to it. So isn't it great that you got this great experience because look at look at the good part of it. I found out that I'm allergic to some forms of pedestal and if he would have called me and I wouldn't have had a lot taken enough of them for that to set in, I would have never found that out. So next time could have been like death. Thanks a lot, Doc.

[00:42:39.880 --> 00:43:03.180]
Here's the one of our good friends. Yes, the cockamoon lady. I'm very happy to be alive. Yes. I'm glad to hear everything. All right. No, yeah, it's great. I called you twice, but I called him. I spoke to George twice to find out how you were getting along.

[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:33.160]
Can you believe that the powers that be in this place never even called to see if there was anything that I needed or that they could do or how I was doing nothing? Can you believe that? That's mean when I was in the hospital. I brought more like a funeral power. Yeah. Well, I got a lot of flowers, but not from these people here. Yeah. No. All they do is squeeze and manipulate and use you till every last drain of blood is left. And I got news. I haven't got much left for him. Yeah. Well, take care.

[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:48.120]
I made sure I flashed my black and blue all over the place in this building today so they could all see it. You know, because the first thing that comes to your mind is, oh, Jesus, taking a whole week off now. This was supposed to be a one or two day day. You know, and of course, right away, they think you're screwing off. You know what I'm saying? Right.

[00:43:48.420 --> 00:44:00.940]
Right. Well, don't look for yourself. Make it so well. Right. And screw them. Everything will be all right. Okay. Take care, dear. Have a great day. Thank you. And don't forget. Cockamoon. Right.

[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:19.340]
1058 at W. I. We have an open line in the center. No, look at that. They're smoking now. Here's Coral Springs. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yeah. How you doing? I'm doing great. I've been listening to you now. Let's get off this hospital. So, yeah, right. Let's say just show to suit your convenience. Sir, what is it you would like to talk about?

[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:36.240]
Well, I've been listening to you for about five months now. And I'm talking to my friend yesterday. Actually a couple days ago. Yeah. And he's telling me all about your show. You know, listen to it for about three years now. He loves you. He loves you. And he told me something about you. I didn't think it was true. I'm going to ask you. Yeah.

[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:48.000]
Neil, are you a homosexual? Oh, God. Let me ask you something. You suffer from like penis envy, sir, or something like that. Listen, you're all bisexual. You just lost a listen. You're flaming.

[00:44:48.740 --> 00:45:01.700]
Okay. That's good. Here's a good. Yeah. Let's get off this hospital stuff and talk about faggots. Okay. There you go. You probably work in a hospital. You spying this little wimp. God almighty, little pencil needle thing.

[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:17.540]
We can't say dick because we're not sure that's his name, right? Where could have been? Right. That could have been his name. Anyway, we have what do we got? Henry Burrow with the 11 o'clock W.I.O.D. News. Henry's like nauseous. He thought Henry's not here.

[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:36.680]
What are you talking about? Henry's not here. I'm Henry. God, Henry, you've butched up dramatically since I left. Like I said, good old Elaine is here. Elaine, who's a schmoozing around with all the politicians and brow to try to make herself a star. And we got Rick and Spud with open phones from two to six this afternoon.

[00:45:50.200 --> 00:46:17.520]
You had to see me. It's about time with Sputum. Have we sold up those new divisions that are sucking our bottom line dry? Sir, as I may have mentioned before, Oklahoma and Nebraska are not divisions. They're states. They're part of the union. Union. Don't ever use that word in this office. Sorry. What? A sorry. Sir, that's better. Now what else is going on? Well, the Saudis call up. They want to know if we could restore their F 16 service. Those deadbeat siloest mutians. They won't be buzzing any kids.

[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:45.860]
The camels until they settle up with the counts receivable. President, I'm here to see you. Good. Send them in. What is it? What's your doing here? It's on Constitucia. Well, that's a pretty big word for a man in a cheap suit, fellow. I called you idiotine here to tell you I'm streamlining the government. So you're all fired. Crazy. Crazy. I'm going to save this country of fortune by having all our laws made in Mexico.

[00:46:45.860 --> 00:47:15.840]
Let's go. LAmero, six a W.I.O Day, a port of lane. She looks like she's been through six operations. Then she, she looks bad. Let's burn out badly. Here's the lady in Tamarack. Hi, Neil. Yes, ma'am. I am so glad to hear your bitch in moment on the radio. It's so good to have you back. Yeah. I'm not. I haven't been able to listen every day. But I assume today's the

[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.040]
for state or back since the operation

[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:19.980]
that's right

[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:22.320]
well i just wanted to try it

[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.560]
they play the same crappy tapes that they always do you know

[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:29.740]
uh... the world at the trial i didn't with i didn't look that's what it was

[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.020]
but only in a only in a bushly market like this could get away with doing that

[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:37.420]
but slap it about the tapes on the air every time the host isn't there it's

[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:38.160]
it's a joke

[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:42.140]
it was that too because i think i think i've put i always look on i think i've

[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:45.720]
was on fighting it was the word about the l.a. stuff and i thought all man

[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.640]
that was timely

[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:52.180]
but i wanted to tell you that i'm not sure the date i think was like monday or

[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:52.960]
two-day

[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.820]
rick uh... you call brick and suds monday

[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.140]
on monday ok money and

[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.140]
you sounded

[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.880]
obviously very desperate frantic

[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.400]
that's the word frantic and it was weird because to me i didn't listen to the

[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.400]
whole i've listened to a lot of rick and such that they would say normally don't

[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.820]
but the next day when it came on i turned it on case

[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.900]
i told my husband i said i can't believe this

[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.780]
i said it's like

[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.960]
nailed to appear it's like the pull up the radio police that

[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.720]
rick and suds are not allowed to talk to him anymore

[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.320]
and he's in limbo

[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.360]
and i never heard anything the right well i don't understand what do you mean by

[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:29.800]
that

[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.440]
well they talk to you but then

[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.760]
the car waiting came on the said doctor runger

[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.200]
all right

[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:37.800]
right

[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.420]
you call waiting

[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.300]
but uh...

[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:44.340]
uh... then yeah you know you know that's the interesting thing he he sent these

[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:48.480]
two a pulmonary guys in who made this speech about pulmonary embolisms and

[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.440]
blood clots in the lung

[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.260]
and got me just scared to death and then the nurse almost passed out on the floor

[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.020]
and then

[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.520]
the two guys said well we're going to go talk to the doctor about it and the

[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.020]
see what he says and i'm waiting and i'm waiting and i'm asking the nurses

[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.800]
where is the doctor up he's gone

[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:06.620]
is gone and that's why when he came back on air i said i cannot believe you left

[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.660]
at this particular point i can't and he was just phoning at the mouth that they

[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:14.540]
had come in and said these things he was ready to uh... attack them with a syringe

[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.480]
well you know that's what goes on in the hospital they run around with scalpel

[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.680]
and syringes chasing each other up and out of hallway

[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:24.320]
i'm sorry about that everything seems really disconnected uh... when you're in

[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.320]
the hospital nothing

[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:30.420]
they've got your disconnected from reality and the thing i do i'm not exaggerating

[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.380]
when i say this i don't want to be an alarmist

[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.700]
but i've been enough you know i haven't spent a lot of time in the hospital but i

[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:38.660]
have friends who have been so i've been in a lot of hospitals and the one thing

[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:42.440]
that's a constant no matter how good they're supposed to be is that you can't

[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:48.280]
read the air it's either too hot or too cold and it says this nauseating

[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.220]
sickening smell that every breath you take makes you the puke from it just

[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:55.420]
how can you get better in that kind of environment

[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.660]
that's a stuff they want to floor with

[00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:58.600]
oh

[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.980]
you could be called red soap when i was red soap

[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:06.780]
i was a hospital volunteer and we used to wash the floor as red so far

[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:11.040]
i want to tell you something years years ago i was in Baptist hospital okay for two days

[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:15.560]
i had mono which by the way they couldn't diagnose they kept asking me about very very

[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.800]
and about all these exotic and my carapractor came and he asked do they take a mono spot test

[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.600]
and they said oh no we never thought of that well guess what i had mono okay

[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.340]
i was run down so i was in there for two days and the second day i started bitching because

[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:32.220]
it was so hot and there i couldn't breathe so they send the guy in there with his little

[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:36.340]
ladder there's always some guy who knows bigot in glazy comes with a ladder and luckily the

[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:40.860]
vent was just off to the side of the bed not directly over it uh-huh he gets up on the ladder he

[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:46.440]
pulls this vent off the ceiling and about four thousand years of crap of gray

[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:50.880]
all like dead rats i mean all just starts falling out and he's choking

[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:55.820]
you know and i think that the people in every room are breathing this crap in

[00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:01.140]
and this is what hospitals are like yeah well it's just like the government i think of

[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:06.700]
bureaucracy it's from the same way or he's based on money yeah right exactly that i was really

this town that I no matter what anybody tells me I know that I'm right okay no heart it would

[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:30.900]
make any difference if I was having open having open heart surgery right on the countertop here

[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:37.860]
ah we're busy okay hey good luck there we have an open line on the star line star io d and one

[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:55.140]
antenna yeah nioe yeah glad you're back thank you so much did you happen to have a private room

[00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:02.260]
when you were there yes okay cuz I had a routine mile gram about two weeks ago you had a one

[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:10.160]
a routine mile gram mile gram right that's like that like a spinal tap oh and that you know when

[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:15.720]
when you hear the word routine a bell should go off there is no such thing as a routine procedure

[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:20.900]
in a hospital right it's like routine surgery there's no such thing right because they said well

[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:31.380]
we'll have to keep you 24 hours to do observations on you yeah so as I was at the build up to build the

[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:36.940]
thing do you have a living well and would you like to be a organ donor and all these uh quite yeah

[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.820]
right that's our thinking builds up a lot of confidence right right and uh the doctor was great though

[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:46.360]
as he was doing the procedure because oh i've done a thousand of these he goes whatever you do

[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:51.940]
don't bend over because uh if you bend over the well don't ever bend over in the hospital

[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:59.120]
as you bend over the die that they inject in your body happens to go to your brain no won't do

[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:05.600]
anything but cause a massive headache oh so as I was there I was in my room after the procedure was

[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:14.020]
done and I was paging the nurse and uh now nurses are okay but these aids that they have uh that don't

[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:19.900]
speak any English are uh probably about your worst no speaking English right we had quite a

[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:24.300]
bit of that in Mount Sinai there were several people no speaking English and uh don't confuse me with

[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:30.520]
the fact of stuff like that well because I had to take a leak and and my jug was down by the bed

[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:37.200]
so I bent over yeah and the die went to my head oh this massive headache so the nurse finally

[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:43.760]
came in after I got this jug and uh I go listen I got a very massive headache can you get me

[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:48.740]
anything any hard drug the hardest thing you got and you know just something to get rid of this

[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:54.260]
why she was leaving the room she met this other aid and they start speaking some different language

[00:56:54.260 --> 00:57:00.880]
and just took her time an hour later here she comes back with uh whatever she had by that time I was

[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:07.300]
you know exhausted a hospital is not a place to get well no and uh I just want and it's also not

[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:11.080]
a place to have like a major accident in the room because it was one night I pressed the button

[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:16.800]
about three different times and uh no response and I can as I was lying it was nothing earth shaking

[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:21.200]
but it was something I needed either like a percussette that kept doping me up with for pain or whatever

[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.560]
that's what I have yeah and uh it just nothing happened and I kept thinking to myself what would

[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:29.960]
have happened if I would have fallen out of the bed and be having like some massive horrendous

[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:35.180]
uh coronary or something right now because nobody was responding now was your percussette uh 500

[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:40.680]
milligrams I don't know well anything I'm hoping a milligrams I think is too much yeah they have to

[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:46.380]
be inserted manually after that bit but anyway I just want to tell you I'm glad you're back and

[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:54.380]

[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.760]
all the video and they could have put something together good but instead of that it was crap

[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:03.900]
terrible yes you should just watch cub games now speaking of crap my bad luck they had

[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:09.220]
g in on a cable over at Mount Sinai no see you saw those game oh even the night they won the double

[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.980]
header from the cardinals they went on till the wee hours of the morning and it was the most

[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.980]
terminal and the most aggravating and they couldn't hit the ball out of the infield and it was just

[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:22.920]
went on and on and on and I was lying there like cock-eyed like propped up in that bed and I had

[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:28.280]
these awful migraines behind if you ever had a headache behind your eyes yes those are the worst

[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:33.640]

[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.220]
the next night we lost the four run later yeah yeah yeah I think that was the first night I was

[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:54.320]
home as a matter what night was that was that Tuesday I think it was Tuesday yeah that was the

[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.120]
first night I was home and we get we all of a sudden against tukesbury who by the way is going

[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:02.580]

[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.980]

[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:13.900]
it's in the toilet yeah and that's where I went a mad rush or four in a row now so listen I got

[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:18.540]
these gigantic horse pills I'd like you to try there like 7000 milligrams take one every five

[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:22.400]
minutes and let's see if you can survive it okay my little boy takes augmenting and they're big

[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:32.160]
pills for him he takes augmenting he has taken a oo oh god the pill doctors man these people are

[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:41.460]
murderers you're murderers remember I how long have you been listening have I been listening to me

[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:47.560]
to you yeah a long time back when I used to have guests yeah do you remember Henry Rothblatt

[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:53.800]
the great attorney Henry Rothblatt the criminal attorney who just absolutely was psychotic

[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:59.100]
about the medical profession and he used to come on doctor doctor he used to scream it he was

[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:04.360]
just great and the sad part about Henry is that he developed this melanoma on his wrist he got a

[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:10.460]
like a cancerous tumor wow and he was so crazy about doctors because he had represented many of them

[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:13.740]
over the years and seen the way that they had butchered up people all the horrible things they didn't

[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:18.020]
right and he just absolutely refused to trust any doctor and so the thing went up his arm and

[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:24.080]
into his brain and like in no time he was dead right does that so if you don't allow them to do it

[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.540]
to and if you're paranoid and you don't get any treatment then it's just as bad so it's brutal

[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:34.720]
it's just unbelievable on that note did you hear about Frank the guy that played Frank he had AIDS

[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:41.080]
he had he died he died yeah well how come we we just got through a couple of months ago do you

[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:46.680]
remember when we reading it on the year about how he had some kidney and he was taking treatments

[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:50.380]
he was going to have to take dialysis he was getting all that weight back and it was all a bunch

[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:56.380]
of crap and he had AIDS and he died that's it why you know what really bothers me why is it when

[01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:02.880]
somebody has AIDS they have to go to such great lengths to cover it up right why is that why is that

[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.900]
so that somebody's going to think that they were gay well who the hell cares he's dead now anyway

[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:14.120]
what their hands is it made that's right god that's what I say too unbelievable but he died last

[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:19.640]
week I think it was Tuesday I wonder if Robert Reed had AIDS I don't know what did Robert Reed

[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:24.540]
die from by the way maybe what AIDS I think it was I think it was well see there you go

[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:44.140]
stall going oh God oh God oh God I don't know who it was here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale hello

[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:51.660]
Neil yes my name is when and it's when Lynn Lynn yeah how you doing Lynn and I've been listening to

[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:56.480]
you for a while first there was a force listener because my husband listened to you right we have a

[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.100]
lot of people I better held it held it seriously held at gunpoint first to listen every day to the show

[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:06.360]
but I listen to you now because I I like your opinion you have some nice opinions and I agree with

[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:11.800]
a lot of them right I've been listening to you since you got back from the hospital yes and I

[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:16.040]
listened to Rick and said why you were in the hospital yes I'm not saying that this works for

[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:22.060]
everybody but I've recently within the last eight months had someone who went into the holistic

[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:27.400]
medicine with the juicing and the exercising things like that right and now I've gotten into it

[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.880]
and there's a book that I want to send you it's called juicing for life it's called the juicing man

[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:39.860]
no juicing for life and is that by Gary Null no uh Sherry Calbum and Marie well you sound so

[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:44.460]
defensive about this I happen to believe in that okay that doesn't mean I does mean I do it but

[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:49.260]
I happen to be a big believer in that kind of thing okay well that makes that makes it I know that

[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:53.840]
every day that we're on his planet we are being poisoned and we're just absolutely uh being

[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.560]
decimated it's a miracle we can get up in the morning absolutely I don't even bother going to

[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:04.680]
a hospital anymore it's like forget it I don't want to go there I won't go there I told I when I

[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.880]
got out of there I told the doctor there are only two ways you'll ever get me in any hospital again

[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:14.600]
either in a coma or in a box that's I'm I'm not joking those are the only two ways I will ever

[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.920]
go into a hospital again and I was I was listening to you earlier while I was on hold and you were

[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:24.640]
talking about body cleansing well there's a juice that you can drink that just like takes that and

[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:30.920]
it just like gets rid of like everything you know it takes everything bad it was it's rid of everything

[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:37.360]
yeah it's rid of everything but it it cleans out your system that's a body cleanser there's

[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:43.040]
one for cleansing your blood and it's let me cleansing your blood I don't have any of that

[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:49.320]
no I think I have blood I don't have any blood so Lynn I have no blood left you know they kept

[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:54.640]
coming in for more by solicin check the dipstick there you'll find zero there's none left there is

[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.200]
none left you've taken every drop I've got and in the meantime one of the first things they had

[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:04.280]
me just going crazy about was one of the doctors had me convinced that I was suffering in massive

[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:08.940]
internal bleeding because my blood count was so low okay now that's always a pleasant thing and

[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:13.400]
I said to Dr. Runger I says well what happens if you are having internal bleeding he said well

[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.220]
then we have to go open you up again now stop and think I'm lying there in this weakened condition

[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:23.280]
where I'm already terrified that I'm on that store and I'm being told well maybe if you're bleeding

[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:28.140]
inside we might have to open you up again which means of course more anesthetic and like we start

[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:32.940]
all over again and I said well when would you do that he said oh well we would only do that to

[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:40.720]
save your life oh and I'm thinking oh geez this sounds really promising now see I got into

[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.700]
this juicing thing and trying to go total vegetarian I'm not saying that it works for everybody

[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:50.840]
but it works for me and I got into it from a lady that I do health but that I did health keeping

[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:56.960]
for and when she went in to have her son five years ago the anesthesia would just cut off the

[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:03.600]
oxygen to her brain so therefore it cut off the oxygen to the brain and let her you know to

[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:11.120]
whether she couldn't walk and she had a speech him you know problem yeah so she got tired after

[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:15.480]
three years of going to medical doctors and nothing was happened well send me the book then I'll

[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:20.520]
send you the book Neil I appreciate it and let's hope we can get you away from them freaking

[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:27.560]
a hospital okay all right thanks a lot thanks thank you here's a lady from outside I hi Neil hi

[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:33.760]
last week we came to visit you a couple of nurses and restrieth therapists right you remember

[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.280]
a whole bunch of people came to visit especially after I came on the year with Rick Riley there were

[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:42.760]
all these people Eddie Morgan was there all the PR people and everybody that came in the room I said

[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:49.220]
the same thing I said I'm not going to get out of here alive but I did well surprise and you got

[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:56.120]
out alive because of the good medical nursing care oh yeah okay come on Neil what's the poem I

[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.460]
don't understand what went wrong do you understand what went wrong what does that mean it just

[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:07.000]
sound like neurotic about it yeah neurotic it was a lovely experience it was the first the best

[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.940]
defense is always being informed yeah and and that's one of the scary things but being hospitalized

[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:17.460]
hospitalized that people just don't understand medicine so every little thing that week obviously

[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:21.880]
takes a granted when people are coming in and making speeches that maybe you're going to have blood

[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:26.000]
clots in your lungs and you might be on the verge of death every minute or that maybe you're suffering

[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.080]
massive internal bleeding and then maybe you're going to bleed to death or we're going to have to

[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.900]
open you up to save your life it isn't really conducive to feeling that too secured you know what I'm

[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:40.160]
saying hey maybe there's there might just be something wrong going on here well okay so you

[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:47.320]
have to be calm and ask questions right right like what the hell is going on here Neil we were

[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:53.260]
very concerned about you yeah yeah there are a lot listen there are a lot of really wonder I'm

[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:57.520]
not I'm not just saying this because I said it before a lot of super people there at Mount Sinai I'm

[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:03.180]
really mean that including some of the nurses and a lot of the people in every facet there's

[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:06.860]
a lot of great people there but that's got nothing to do with everything else I'm talking about

[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:10.420]
oh what I mean you could have the greatest people in the world but if there are people who are like

[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:15.420]
you know scaring the crap out of you and you're suffering such anxiety and you can't breathe the

[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.380]
air and that you're inhaling of fumes that make you feel nauseous all the time it's not conducive

[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:27.520]
to getting well well I don't really understand what exactly went wrong no what you know what exactly

[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:34.120]
happened to you but yeah just seem that you got overly nervous right right right right well

[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:39.320]
just like you know that we're glad that you're home feeling better and back at work thanks

[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:46.940]
and please come back soon yeah see ya just pray that I don't and I'm sure they all are

[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.660]
they're good they're just kissing the ground but I'm out of there and hope that I never return hey listen

[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:56.220]
I'm just telling it like it is okay then I'm just I have no axe to grind I have no reason to say

[01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:00.180]
things that didn't happen or I'm just telling it exactly what happened and it's a major

[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:07.600]
can-dale air conditioning has a service that I'm telling you every hospital I don't want to

[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:14.220]
be required to do this like on a very regular basis it's called the biotech duct sanitizing

[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:19.120]
system and hospitals and laboratories good ones that is have been doing this for years why

[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.000]
because viruses and other indoor pollutants can originate right inside those air duct sanitizing

[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.340]
is now considered essential I mean if you're just laying there or sitting around the house and

[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:34.760]
you're inhaling around the clock all that crap man it's going to make you sick as hell and

[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.700]
sanitizing should be performed only by licensed air conditioning contractors people who know

[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.920]

[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.520]
hi Neil i'm so glad that you made it back alive

[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:25.540]
yeah just barely by the edge of my thing i hear y'all can empathize with you 14

[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:29.660]
months ago i went into the hospital to have a baby and good lord

[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:34.360]
between nurse ratchet and the doctor that barely made it there for the delivery

[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:39.820]
yeah i was ready to crawl out the window and go home and do it myself right it was awful

[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:44.700]
it was such an experience in such a nice hospital i mean the view is great but who the hell

[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:49.100]
cares right well when you're on the way out it's always nice to have a good view

[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.020]
uh... i have always said that

[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:58.100]
but um... it was quite an experience and i vowed never to go back again unless i was in a box

[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:03.060]
good and not able to tell you that i with all due respect to any hospitals and there are a lot of

[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:08.200]
good people and conscientious people the best way to deal with hospitals is to stay out that's

[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:13.420]
the best way safest way don't ever go in don't ever go in unless it's to visit and make sure you don't

[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:17.560]
end over right you have your temperature taken and they'll and they'll go to the other side

[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.480]
i got a great little story for it one of the nurses she wasn't the regular nurse but she was like

[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:25.640]
whatever maybe she works like one day a week she came in one evening and she was going to take

[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:31.580]
my temperature and they had two different thermometers sitting inside those little things on the tray

[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:38.660]
and she kind of looked at my face and then she kind of looked uh... you know and uh... she looked

[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.380]
at their thermometers she said well like which one is what i said both of them are like oral okay

[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:46.980]

[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:55.080]

[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:07.020]
me the feeling is mutual it's just the idea that i mean here they knew certainly that i was

[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:11.280]
undergoing a really tough time because sharel was over there to visit and i mean you know i was

[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.040]
like talking to people who work here like george and sharel but as they certainly had to be aware

[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:23.720]
this was a horrendous experience not a card not a note not a flower not up your ass not anything

[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:27.720]
let me tell you something i heard i don't listen to rick and so it's often but i heard that

[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:32.680]
what you made and i couldn't believe it i didn't even know it was you until after you hung up and

[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:37.860]
he started talking about i didn't recognize your voice i was i was so desperate that once i knew

[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:42.660]
i was on the air i was just gonna blurred out anything that i could just to get the message across

[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:47.940]
because i really i really believed at that time that i would never get out and after that phone call

[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:53.640]
which needless to say word spreads fast all the PR people in a hospital started showing up people

[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.860]
who haven't even been invented yet i mean they were pouring into that room and no matter who they

[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:02.600]
were the first thing i would say when they would how you do mr. Rogers i would say i am never

[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:08.040]
going to get out of here alive that's what you must have said it four times and i i believe

[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:12.640]
that i i swear to you i really believed it have you heard have you heard the call

[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.620]
have they played the call for you at all do we still have that you got it you got to listen to you

[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:21.320]
it doesn't even sound like you i didn't know it was you it was me and i've been listening to you for

[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:26.000]
years i had no idea who it was until after they made comment i mean i was practically in tears

[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.860]
because the stuff that was going on was just so incredible and they just had me convinced that i

[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:34.800]
was gonna die and they sent me for this long skin and they strapped this thing around my head

[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.860]
and it just seemed like they were using me as some kind of a guinea pig i felt like i was in

[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:45.500]
Auschwitz or something well now you're back and alive and yeah i'm doing it you sound better

[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:37.340]
to get a phone call from somebody in the position of authority in this place who gives a flying crap

[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.280]
i must be i must be dreaming there must be it must have been from the anesthesia i must still

[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:49.760]
been hallucinating the whole time i was in there speaking of hallucinogens i almost thought that we

[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:56.760]
had a call from ponytail you know there's another guy absolutely not a word not a card not a pizza

[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.340]
that would have been great you know what i would have done for a slice of pizza when i was in that

place oh god what that would have done to my whole system you'll find the world's best pizza at

the pizza loft everyone is cooked to order never made conveyor belt style everything over there at

[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:16.980]
the pizza trough is made with tender care and love and they put a whole bunch of crap in it

[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:22.120]
Italian specialties like their award-winning lasagna and stuffed shells and manacotti and baked

[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:26.960]
ziti in their famous eggplant parmesan and that great fugaza pizza which is some really unique

[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:32.300]
stuff made with those great spicy onions and special spicy sauce you've never tasted anything like

[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:36.400]
it in your life if you have any kind of a party coming up they'll cater it for you for as little

[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:41.640]
as four bucks per person and because Jeff wants to retire at a very early age and go fishing with

[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:45.700]
all the dolphins every day they never close i mean every holiday no matter what it is they're going

[01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:49.680]

piping hot and ready when you get there two six six fifty one eleven and if you're really

[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:03.800]
nice to Jeff I'll even let you die in the prestigious neo-rodgers dining room two six six five one one

[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:09.300]
one for the pizza loft upstairs at sixty-ninth and flagler in Miami just east of the Palmetto express

[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:15.120]
way the opinions expressed in this program are not necessarily those of six n w i would be rich

[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:21.000]
right okay there's our disclaimer that we play every thirty seconds because the management of the

[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.140]
station thinks the show is gross and they want to make sure that you understand they have

[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:30.600]
nothing to do with it what are you eating now god just eating and eating and eating and eating and

[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:35.840]
eating what the hell is it since since you came in here today you haven't stopped eating you just

[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.980]
you started out with sunny very early and what happened to the other sandwich you wait in both

[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:48.580]
you wait two sandwiches they brought across here what was that corn beef see why is that necessary

[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:52.480]
i mean i appreciate it but if you're going to bring me a sandwich why does it have to have

[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:58.040]
thirty pounds of meat in it okay why does it have to be so big that only false teeth will go

[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:02.260]
around it you have to be able to remove your teeth from your mouth to get them around the sandwich

[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:12.540]
what is that prove why does anybody need so much meat right exactly nobody needs all that meat

[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.940]
so what is it now you're reading after two what chicken all it's the company lunch day okay

[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:23.080]

[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:04.180]
fill the time they don't and they can get away with it they don't care not one time not one time

[01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:11.160]
during the week was there any uh you know during that time was there any uh update or anything well

[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:15.600]
that's really very frustrating well that's very nice isn't it it's very well it actually was

[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:20.120]
frustrating isn't that interesting that i had to call in from the hospital and beg to get a

[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:24.100]
oh and you want to hear that you want to hear the best part i call in marvin here's another thing

[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:28.680]
that goes on in this station i call i had talked to rick off the year at about a quarter to two

[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:32.720]
okay because i was really frantic i really felt like somebody needed to know i wanted to get out of

[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:38.240]
there so i call in about ten minutes after two and as usual and i don't know what the bad

[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:43.140]
line number is i forgotten it long ago i call in on a regular call in line day line right and

[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:48.460]
the same old crap with marvin w i o d please hold and he puts me on hold i don't even get a chance i'm

[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:54.320]
i'm like uh uh marvin it's me but no chance i'm on hold and i'm sitting listening to the pre-delay or

[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:59.460]
whatever i mean i just can't believe what goes on in this radio station if you had like a life and

[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:03.760]
death emergency and you didn't know the bad line and you called up and you wanted to talk to

[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:08.020]
somebody off the year at please hold and you're seeing their listening to a motivator whatever

[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:12.620]
this i mean what kind of crap is that well i always think in earlier when you when you said you

[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:18.340]
hadn't heard from disney or any of those other guys i i think of my position i think of most other

[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:23.720]
people um who are employed by someone if i were to have gone through the same thing that you did

[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:28.540]
you know damn well that i hear from my employer you know you know what really cracks me up you remember

[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:33.320]
when they were squeezing the nine through the ten half hour out of me and the rationale was because

[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:39.200]
i was so important to w-i-o-d that it was just essential for me to do that extra half hour even though

[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:43.540]
it was yeah i was so important i was important enough to get the extra half hour out so i could

[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:48.400]
boost the ratings up and and and bolster up that pathetic hour in there but i'm not important

[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:52.820]
enough that even like a phone call like a like sign you know how far it is from here to mount

[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:57.800]
sign i do you know how far it is i mean w-i-o-d is in north bay village on the you can't

[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:02.120]
he cause way out here mount sign our hospital as you could throw a rock from here to where it is i'm

[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:08.520]
i-e beach okay now pox on them they should you know quite honestly they should be embarrassed to

[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:14.140]
cry to pass you in the hall for the next exactly no lenient let them let them pass this

[01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:20.120]

[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:43.360]
stairs like the good old days with the green apple oh and let me tell you the best story okay

[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:47.460]
see you think that you've heard all the stories i got millions of stories and each one of them is true

[01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:55.980]
i want you to listen to this very carefully George you were a witness the day before i go in for

[01:52:55.980 --> 01:53:00.800]
my surgery was a thursday right a week ago thursday do you remember jim can't find the remedy

[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:06.680]
came in here and brought me a little special gift that day remember those chocolates remember that

[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:13.440]
that little box from the nut place up there and he says to me he says don't worry this has no sugar

[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:20.360]
in it's not regular chocolate and also it doesn't have any sorbitol okay now keep in mind this is

[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.640]
the day before i'm going to go in for my surgery in which case you want to be in your struggles you

[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:28.620]
certainly don't want to be in a weakened condition you don't want to have the green apple quick

[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:33.320]
step all afternoon evening on the day before you go in for your surgery feeling like you have no

[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:38.420]
energy in your body well guess what it may not have been sorbitol but it was some tall

[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:44.360]
to make the short and the tall and the long of it because from about an hour after i got home

[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:52.980]
that afternoon until until i can remember i had an experience though which you can't even begin

[01:53:53.860 --> 01:54:01.300]
to imagine okay from those candies they opened my body up like somebody had stuck gigantic like a

[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:08.180]
pitchfork in my colon so thanks a lot jim can't find the remedy for making me like i was in a panic

[01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:12.020]
i thought oh geez i sure hope at least this ends before i have to go in for the surgery which i

[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:20.720]
had to do the first thing the next morning oh man thanks a lot remedy man you guys back there

[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:25.720]
continue to be the best they are just they're indescribable they're just continuing to play with

[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:30.260]
my life and my body just leave me alone do not bring me anymore food do not bring me anymore

[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:34.440]
anything just stay away from my face and stay away from my life and go out there and write a bunch

[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:40.220]
of bogus contracts and leave us alone is what i say that's a good pastrami sandwich from

[01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:44.820]
Sundays this morning and the soup was great only too much so i took like all the excess meat off

[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:49.220]
there and i got about a pound and a half extra why do places do that can you explain to me why any

[01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:53.700]
like some of the deli type places that i want to mention their names and they have the big sandwiches

[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:58.840]
and they're like there's like four times more meat than there needs to be like oh look while

[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:03.040]
we're giving you for your money okay that's why the sandwiches like nine ninety five i don't want to

[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:08.360]
pay ten dollars for a sandwich okay how about give me a sandwich for like three ninety five and give

[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:13.660]
me like a third or a half of all that meat i don't need all that meat nobody in the world needs all

[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:21.000]
that meat you're poisoning us you're tearing our kiscus out with those gigantic obnoxious self-indulgent

[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:27.480]
concoctions why why are you doing that to us and as far as norm kent is concerned let me say it again

[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:08.160]
i think i even heard grandma Moses farting a couple times on that show yeah the fact that we're

[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:11.900]
going to be taking excerpts at that for the next tape yeah really this is your chronic dead

[01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:18.220]

[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:22.040]
to everybody who sent cards there were like jillions of cards and notes and stuff and that was very

[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:27.580]
nice totally more than i got from this place yeah that's really a pauling man i'm gonna keep

[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:32.080]
mentioning it for about a week till i get it out of my system i mean i grant you it's not a big deal

[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:37.260]
but it's just it's just common sense it's just common courtesy if the janitor had a hang nail

[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:41.580]
was in a hospital for two days they would send him a card not as much as a phone call nothing

[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:47.180]
i know nothing and especially you would think after last monday when i made that frantic call when

[01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:51.760]
i was right i'm not joking i really was desperate i was praying somebody would just come over

[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:55.940]
there and kind of run interference to save me from what they were trying to do to me over there

[01:58:55.940 --> 01:59:00.640]
well maybe they'll think about it now yeah hey i want to breath i'll let you know when to exhale

[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:07.040]
hey hey how big and how many were there man i didn't uh i have no idea all they didn't tell

[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:10.820]
rick and suds have better idea because they evidently got a call from somebody who was uh

[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:15.100]
some kid who was in on a procedure over there you know somebody in oh r they have like a squirt by

[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:19.540]

[01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:23.740]

[01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:27.480]

all this artsy farcee it's stuff you throw away it's direct but this was great and i really

[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:16.080]
appreciated that but what i started to mention is that Alan's great personal friend George Steinbrenner

[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:20.320]
thought he was going to muscle his way back in and get permission to start poaching around with the

[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:25.200]
Yankees again next year and low and behold at the very last moment comes to find out that all these

[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:29.160]
people are ready to step forward and testify that he was like already involved when he wasn't

[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:34.240]
supposed to be and like not so fast fey if fey Vincent isn't the worst commissioner of baseball

[02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:38.440]
in history of the game i'd sure like to know who was i'll tell you that he is at a

[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:45.540]
scratch he is a disgrace never trust a man named fey i'll tell you that right now a little piece

[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:55.700]
of personal advice do not trust anybody named fey boca and nail yes sir i want to know the day

[02:05:55.700 --> 02:06:01.540]
that article from your times about the botz doctor's botz surgery it was in yesterday's son sent

[02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:08.220]
old page three a thanks to my sister was in the hospital for a cold water yeah and the same

[02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:15.400]
thing happens if puncture long oh my respirator punctured her long puncture yeah right through it

[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:26.440]
and so what happened we almost lost are you cereal yeah jazzy piece of cake and now it's in

[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:37.260]
credible okay good luck yeah see ya that was the best call we've had in years on this show that

[02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:42.120]
was great i like his style we have an open see in spite of all adversity you just have to look

[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:45.760]
at the good things in life that's what they say in the hospital when you're lying there in a pool

[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:49.860]
of your own blood we have an open line on the out of town line like lunches only minutes away

[02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:55.400]
that's always a good thing i mean the stuff that they bring you i wouldn't see i haven't even

[02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:58.880]
scratched the surface i didn't mention about the morning that the blood test results showed my

[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:05.180]
blood sugar was 300 which is very high and they were bringing me like apple juice and ice cream and

[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:08.600]
of course i'm diabetic so that made all the sense in the world let's see if we can't get it up to

[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:12.940]
maybe 500 and then put them into a diabetic coma just to make it perfect that would be a good idea

[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:17.420]
and of course my panic doctor i don't want to mention which one that was but doctor panic across

[02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:21.880]
the street oh yeah bye bye he's giving me insulin i said i don't want insulin don't you understand i

[02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:29.180]
don't take insulin now just one time okay i mean he goes into such a panic and that see that's

[02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:34.200]
what i like is that good calm reassuring bedside manner like hey you're gonna die that that's

[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:38.760]
that's what i like seriously that's just exactly what you need when you're lying there helpless

[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:43.920]
in the hospital and like your whole life is flashing before you are your eyes you need somebody

[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:50.440]
who is absolutely overreact and gets you crazy i mean even in high anxiety mel Brooks never saw

[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:54.800]
anything like what i'm standing i'm not you you're laughing i'm not exaggerating oh you're bleeding

[02:07:54.800 --> 02:08:01.960]

you know you guys are making these sandwiches it's not that we don't appreciate it but it just

[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:29.040]
isn't necessary to overdo the amount of meat too much meat is a killer believe me

[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:33.880]

You made the town for your business.

[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:12.300]
like that.

[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:13.700]
He's reaching.

[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:15.820]
It's really stupid.

[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:19.680]
107 here at WIOD on a really stupid Monday, man.

[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:20.720]
And we're just kind of enjoying it.

[02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:22.120]
I don't see any sign of Rick and Sudzi.

[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:23.520]
Are they like in the building today?

[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:26.160]
Because I did notice that on,

[02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:28.640]
was it last Friday, they weren't in Mexico again?

[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:30.140]
What is that?

[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:31.240]
What is that all about?

[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:31.940]
They're never here.

[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:35.100]
And I see Reneerie is doing this Friday,

[02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:36.500]
gonna be in the Bahamas again,

[02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:37.640]
plunging his brains out,

[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:39.340]
drinking up a storm.

[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:41.460]
Here's a lady in plantation.

[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:42.360]
Hi, Neil.

[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:42.800]
Hi.

[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:44.780]
I'm glad you made it back in one piece.

[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:45.820]
Well, thanks so much.

[02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:47.440]
In at least a couple of pieces anyway.

[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:47.840]
All right.

[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:50.280]
I can't believe the management in that place.

[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:52.220]
What a...

[02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:53.120]
That is disgusting.

[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:54.200]
Believe it.

[02:13:54.500 --> 02:13:55.040]
Believe it.

[02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:55.980]
I can't believe it.

[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:57.260]
Yeah, they may not be good,

[02:13:57.300 --> 02:13:58.220]
but they're consistent.

[02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:00.820]
They're consistently indifferent toward anything.

[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:02.280]
God, that is...

[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:03.880]
It was no excuse for that.

[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:05.380]
Now you understand.

[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:06.860]
Now you understand when they were,

[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:08.580]
they had me doing the 9-3-10.

[02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:09.760]
And I said to them,

[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:10.780]
it's too much stress,

[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.100]
and I can't do this.

[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:13.300]
And I'm just telling you,

[02:14:13.340 --> 02:14:14.320]
I'm trying to explain to you,

[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:17.460]
you follow, they don't relate to that.

[02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:19.240]
They don't comprehend anything on a...

[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:19.700]
They don't want to use you.

[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:20.000]
Right.

[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:22.700]
They do not comprehend anything on a human level.

[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:24.180]
They're not capable of doing it.

[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:24.700]
Unbelievable.

[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:26.760]
Neil, you couldn't make enough money.

[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:27.820]
Believe me.

[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:28.100]
Right.

[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:30.720]
Bunch of creeps.

[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:30.940]
Yeah.

[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:34.300]
Anyway, you mentioned before,

[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:36.300]
confessions of a medical heretic.

[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:37.720]
Dr. Robert Mendelsson.

[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:40.820]
Well, I was in the car driving home Saturday night,

[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:42.660]
and it happened to have a radio accident.

[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.340]
And I tuned in to WIO.

[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:45.400]
Well, I'm sure he was none,

[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:46.600]
because he's been dead for a couple.

[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:47.620]
He was on, boy.

[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:49.380]
That was a miracle.

[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:51.380]
Mitch Lewis, I guess it is.

[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:52.220]
Mitch Lewis.

[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:54.840]
Had this doctor on last hour of the year.

[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:55.800]
That's true.

[02:14:55.800 --> 02:14:57.160]
You have to get a tape of that show.

[02:14:57.460 --> 02:14:58.600]
Listen to the last hour.

[02:14:58.880 --> 02:14:59.360]
Who was it?

[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:01.380]
Some doctor from California,

[02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:04.540]
who was saying exactly what you said,

[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:05.680]
verbatim, worked for,

[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:05.880]
and the word,

[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:07.300]
that these medications,

[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:09.100]
that these doctors are prescribing,

[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:10.000]
are killing you.

[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:10.540]
They are.

[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:13.400]
And that you never have any reason

[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:14.300]
to go to a hospital,

[02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:16.340]
except if you're bleeding to death,

[02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:17.660]
or you have a broken bone.

[02:15:17.980 --> 02:15:18.620]
Right, emergency.

[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:20.220]
It's the only reason to go.

[02:15:20.380 --> 02:15:23.040]
That hospitals are the worst place for sick people.

[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:25.340]
Anybody who walks in,

[02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:27.600]
likely will be carried out.

[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:30.440]
Well, hopefully I'll never have the chance

[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:32.360]
to go to a hospital or a doctor again.

[02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:33.020]
Don't do it.

[02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:33.620]
I'm not.

[02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:35.580]
You have to take care of yourself

[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:38.220]
and just drink plenty of juice.

[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:40.560]
Did you see the thing on 60 minutes last night?

[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:41.680]
No, I missed it.

[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:42.820]
They had a thing on 60 minutes

[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:44.720]
about the California medical board

[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.240]
and about how they absolutely refused

[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:47.740]
to take away any doctor's license.

[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.200]
And they had this one doctor,

[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:50.920]
Bob's, who has been convicted of murder

[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:52.920]
and butchering up all these other people.

[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:54.760]
And he's still got a license to practice

[02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:56.500]
and his asses in jail for murder.

[02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:00.100]
I think doctors are the lowest form of life.

[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:00.760]
Yeah.

[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:03.220]
Some of them, most of them I should say

[02:16:03.220 --> 02:16:06.160]
are only up for the money and their lifestyles.

[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:09.000]
I mean, suck everything you can out of the public.

[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.580]
I mean, the public is so stupid.

[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:12.460]
The public has been so brainwashed.

[02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:13.180]
Brainwashed.

[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:14.900]
That's what Bob Mendelson used to write about.

[02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:16.620]
About about the, you know, about was like a temple.

[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:19.300]
When you go in and the doctors were in the white smock

[02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:21.480]
just like the priest wears his outfit in the robot.

[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:21.600]

[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:24.140]
It's just power that they wheeled over you.

[02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:26.240]
And people were so like they're in the white one.

[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:27.700]
Dr. Sydney Singer is the name.

[02:16:27.820 --> 02:16:28.760]
George was a doing that show.

[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:29.540]
Finger, Dr. Singer.

[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:31.160]
He's the one I was on with the night rhythms.

[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:31.840]
Excellent.

[02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:33.660]
I mean, I could have listened for hours.

[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:37.080]
But everything you said, Neil, is so true.

[02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:39.280]
And all these senior citizens down here

[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:42.060]
who are hooked on like 75 different prescription drugs

[02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:44.040]
that are interacting with each other

[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:46.040]
and got them all spaced out and got them.

[02:16:46.100 --> 02:16:48.800]
They got a pill to get up in the morning and a pill to go to bed at night

[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:51.440]
and a pill to be able to sleep and a pill to be able to have a BM

[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:53.880]
and a pill to be able to, I mean, it's just unbelievable.

[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.840]
People just refuse to listen.

[02:16:57.020 --> 02:16:58.320]
They just want to go to the doctor,

[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:01.300]
give them their money, let the doctor give them a prescription,

[02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:06.000]
come home and, oh, you know, my advice is get a second opinion

[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.300]
and a third opinion and then.

[02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:09.400]
Forget about opinion and then still be skeptical.

[02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:10.660]
Stay away from doctors.

[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:11.220]
Period.

[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:11.640]
Right.

[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:15.600]
Like I said, the only the only reason to visit a hospital or a doctor

[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:17.900]
is if you're bleeding to death or you have a broken bones.

[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:18.200]
Right.

[02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:20.440]
And if you want to win in, I think that's it.

[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:20.680]
Yeah.

[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:21.120]
Okay.

[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:21.800]
Have a great day.

[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:22.460]
Take care.

[02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:22.720]
Good luck.

[02:17:22.940 --> 02:17:23.060]
Right.

[02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:23.440]
You too.

[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:26.040]

we had the race from Greenwood on Saturday in Toronto,

[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:51.320]

[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:53.320]
bad, the Hanover, whatever that horse with Rod Allen,

[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:55.760]

[02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:11.740]
Which has nothing to do with anything.

[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:12.200]

Getting it to me took a mallet and gave a big a hawk on your

[02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:10.660]
stomach all of a sudden the few days later you'd be black and

[02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:14.220]
blue too and if you were fat it takes days for that to work

[02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:17.160]
its way through the layers of fat is what he explained to me.

[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:20.220]
I just showed Cheryl my beautiful black and blue side and

[02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:25.160]

your back I was on vacation and found out when I came back

[02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:45.320]
that you were in the hospital yeah well I was only supposed to

[02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:48.400]
be there for a day or two at the most this is a little you

[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:51.020]
know they give you a song and a dance it's a very minor

[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:53.880]
procedure it's a piece of cake they make the four little

[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:57.400]
incisions they snip it out a lot of people walk out they go home

[02:20:57.400 --> 02:21:00.280]
the same day or the next day but guess what not everybody's

[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:04.300]
the same well I hate the birch your bubble they already do

[02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:08.700]
three years ago I had mine yanked out yeah the old fashioned

[02:21:08.700 --> 02:21:13.280]
way yeah that's not close well my stone for too big to crush

[02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:19.040]
yeah and so they had to take it out manually so ten days in the

[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:25.040]
hospital all days I can't imagine that ten days I can't imagine

[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:27.280]
that and I can't imagine the bill either that must be like

[02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:30.760]
fifty thousand dollars easy seventeen thousand seven hundred

[02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:33.680]
and thirty two dollars that's all that's not much that was just

[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:38.400]
the hospital must be the low rent history anyway I still can't

[02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:42.700]
eat at Arnold's it still kills me really drives me insane I can't

[02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:47.820]
eat that can eat pizza why drive my stomach crazy how long ago

[02:21:47.820 --> 02:21:50.980]
was it out three years ago and they tell me they tell me I have

[02:21:50.980 --> 02:21:55.960]
post-gall butter syndrome it's only supposed to last up to six

[02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:59.320]
months after you had it yanked out yeah I'm working on three

[02:21:59.320 --> 02:22:02.600]
years and I still have it oh man wouldn't that be something

[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:04.760]
after you have it out and then you still got problems with all

[02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:07.560]
that stuff right I still I'm the biggest thing is cinnamon

[02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:12.180]
can eat anything with I love cinnamon I do too can eat

[02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:17.260]
cinnamon rolls can eat anything with cinnamon in it so so don't

[02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:20.940]
be surprised if you don't have some problems because they warned me

[02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:24.440]
I haven't had I have well see I don't read I'm so incoherent that I

[02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:27.640]
really don't know if I have problems eating things can I I got to

[02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:29.800]
tell you a little thing I don't want to sound like a hypochondripe

[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:31.880]
but you know after you have something in your body that you're

[02:22:31.880 --> 02:22:35.740]
allergic to right until it gets out of your system when you eat

[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:39.380]
even if the problem has subsided when you eat it starts like a

[02:22:39.380 --> 02:22:41.980]
chemical reaction in your body again yeah and the and the

[02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:46.100]
allergy starts up again so on Wednesday or whatever day it was

[02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:48.800]
Wednesday night I went through this horror with this penicillin was

[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:52.380]
allergic to in the rash and the screaming scratching and the

[02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:57.060]
hives so the Thursday it had subsided pretty well by lunch

[02:22:57.060 --> 02:23:01.300]
time I had lunch and about 20 minutes after lunch all of a sudden

[02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:04.820]
it starts again yeah and I thought oh this can't be happening

[02:23:04.820 --> 02:23:08.680]
to me so I took a benedrill and by the way Cheryl thank you Cheryl

[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:12.280]
suggested I take a benedrill she had called me because benedrill is

[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:15.080]
for allergies and I even thought about it and I love benedrill it

[02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:19.040]
works very well on me so 20 20 minutes after it all the itching went

[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:23.140]
away six hours later I have dinner Thursday night and about a

[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:26.200]
half hour after dinner it starts it comes back like the very

[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:30.060]
first night I mean with a vengeance the reason that happens

[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:33.560]
that way is it's really not a chemical reaction actually when

[02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:38.000]
you eat your body heat increases yeah when your body heat increases

[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:42.340]
to get rid of the food in your system it also helps that allergic

[02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:45.280]
reaction that you had to heat up again and cause the

[02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:49.340]
still in your system yeah so anyway I took two benedrill and 20

[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:52.600]
minutes later I was not only over the itching but I was already in

[02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:56.860]
the sack and sleeping like a child so I say how do you for

[02:23:56.860 --> 02:24:00.720]
benedrill well anyway I'm still suffering me I still have

[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:05.820]
problems and I still have the potting problems I run to the

[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:09.080]
bathroom as soon as I've eaten something anything are you serious

[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:14.680]

124 W I O D that should explain why he looks that way here's

[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:50.100]
bokeh hello yeah I think your phone needs the phone

[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:56.280]
doctor the worst awful but I tell you the

[02:25:56.280 --> 02:26:01.260]
most public situation the person to be placed in true I had

[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:05.880]
a leg operated out a while back and they're willing you down

[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:09.020]
to the operating room and I was waiting in the hallway on the

[02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:13.080]
journey and they put me in the wrong operating room and they

[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:18.740]
started propping me for heart surgery and I pay and then

[02:26:18.740 --> 02:26:23.760]
come find out the person is putting the IV in my arm with a

[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:28.000]
student and I almost got a pin question to five

[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.880]
hey listen you got to learn somewhere yeah but I just wanted

[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:37.580]
it say you know where glad to have you back and I tell you

[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:40.760]
those doctors and those hospitals better to stay out on a

[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:44.340]
straight than being there amen okay thank you pal have a great

[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:48.200]
life 125 what I do with that article I throw it out let me

[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:50.300]
again in case you missed the earlier part of the show

[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:54.700]
recommend in the sunset on page 3 a yesterday reprinted from

[02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:58.880]
the New York Times news service surgeons botched new

[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:02.900]
technique is the headline complications arise from procedure

[02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:06.300]
to remove gallbladders and the first paragraph says surgeons

[02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:09.360]
who rushed to use a new technique to remove gallbladders

[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:13.020]
that's laparoscopic surgery which is what I had without

[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:18.060]
adequate training have botched many procedures so I think a

[02:27:18.060 --> 02:27:21.640]
real good idea before the anesthesiologist sticks that

[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:25.280]
needle in the IV would be to look up at the surgeon and say

[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:28.980]
uh... by the way how many of these have you done before and if

[02:27:28.980 --> 02:27:31.560]
he kind of smiles and nervously laughs at all well this is the

[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:32.520]
first one

[02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:37.960]
I would like jump up off that table screaming and thrashing all

[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:40.700]
that equipment around and take and just start stabbing people

[02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:42.160]
with needles and going crazy

[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:48.200]
it's you're like a prisoner you're like you're like a guinea pig

[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:51.820]
you're like a guinea pig in a laboratory and you're lying there

[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:55.160]
firstly the first thing they do is you go in and they have a

[02:27:55.160 --> 02:27:58.320]
little cubicle and you take off all your clothes and you fold

[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:00.460]
them all up and put them with all your positions in a little

[02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:04.000]
plastic bag and that big kind of a companies you around

[02:28:04.780 --> 02:28:06.580]
like into the ground if necessary

[02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:10.080]
and then you go into little cubicle and you put on the

[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:14.260]
shmata you put on this little ridiculous gown wide open in the

[02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:18.200]
back don't drop the soap and then they put you also put this

[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:21.920]
little silly uh... it's like a shower cap on your head

[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:25.500]
okay and now you come out and you lay down on a table and they put

[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:28.840]
the little bag like at the end of the table and you're lying

[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:33.220]
there and then they stick the IV into your wrist and they start

[02:28:33.220 --> 02:28:36.160]
explaining to you and the anesthesiologist who by the way was a

[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:38.040]
very nice girl extremely nice

[02:28:39.020 --> 02:28:41.240]
what do they what do they call those uh...

[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:44.100]
uh... they're like trainees what do they call those

[02:28:44.100 --> 02:28:48.740]
interns not known and not interns there's a uh... uh... well whatever the

[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:50.900]
how they call them they're like learning okay

[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:54.300]
and then they had some other guy to all you know we both listen to your

[02:28:54.300 --> 02:28:57.860]
show and we love you now this first thing we do apprentice now not

[02:28:57.860 --> 02:29:00.840]
a print of the sorcerer is apprentice right and this first

[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:04.280]
of injection we're going to give you this first drug this first

[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:07.120]
powerful mind-honoring chemical we're going to give you

[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:11.320]
is going to like help you forget what's going on now

[02:29:11.880 --> 02:29:14.960]
which naturally you can imagine right off the bat they want you to

[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:18.340]
forget everything they don't want you to remember any of it just in case

[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:23.300]
because you'll notice that the majority of the time what seems to be over

[02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:27.560]
just kind of overriding everything else it's called covering your ass

[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:31.280]
that's what they want to do against malpractice against lawsuits

[02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:37.240]
and i want to say this to every doctor and everybody in that profession

[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:41.500]
out there in the whole wide world don't believe to us about the malpractice

[02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:44.520]
insurance rates because there's only one group of people that brought that

[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:48.320]
on and that's the butchers out there who are killing people every day that's

[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:48.560]
why

[02:29:49.320 --> 02:29:53.160]
like the guy in california who's on uh... who's uh... in jail for murdering

[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:56.680]
people in butchering everybody up and still got a license to practice just in

[02:29:56.680 --> 02:29:58.760]
case he should uh... break out

[02:29:58.760 --> 02:29:59.400]
a resident

[02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:03.800]
a resident right a resident that's a very nice word isn't a resident

[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:08.840]
which means like uh... amateur hour you know hey uh... here how do we do this

[02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:09.740]
and i know

[02:30:10.260 --> 02:30:12.140]
here's the the a van lady

[02:30:12.140 --> 02:30:13.680]

sudden you go out and start getting fat and uh... now

[02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:49.240]
operation as an excuse i don't want to mention a certain fat friend by name

[02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:52.980]
as an excuse to start shoveling it down again because they want to fill up

[02:30:52.980 --> 02:30:55.080]
that vacuum where the uh... bladder used to be

[02:30:55.080 --> 02:30:58.780]

[02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:52.500]

[02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:02.020]
north by me beach hello

[02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:04.160]

well it's your loss okay would have been a great call believe me

[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.220]
there's a lady in candle

[02:33:11.220 --> 02:33:14.980]
i know i have been in and out of the car all morning so i don't know if

[02:33:14.980 --> 02:33:16.880]
somebody's mentioned this before but if you see that

[02:33:17.300 --> 02:33:19.480]
william hurt movie called the doctor no

[02:33:19.480 --> 02:33:23.460]
all you have to see it now it's it's on the it's making the rounds is not it

[02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:26.060]
i thought video i thought i'm video a couple weeks ago yeah

[02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:28.140]
it's about the zero smarts doctor

[02:33:28.740 --> 02:33:31.940]
who is real flipping with his patients and all of a sudden he's got a medical

[02:33:31.940 --> 02:33:34.160]
problem and he has to go under the night good

[02:33:34.700 --> 02:33:38.100]
and we see how he's created and it's a real eye opener yeah

[02:33:38.100 --> 02:33:41.640]
so i have to what you've explained you know i think you would really get a

[02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:45.300]
kick off the you know wouldn't you think that it's like a common sense bedside

[02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:45.780]
manner

[02:33:45.780 --> 02:33:50.480]
oh yeah would be to keep people as calm and as confident as possible without

[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:52.140]
getting them hysterical about me

[02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:56.640]
in addition to which before you go undergo any kind of surgery why is it that

[02:33:56.640 --> 02:33:59.640]
you have to sign all these consent forms and release forms

[02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:03.380]
but they don't have to tell you anything right don't tell you about any of

[02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:06.020]
these possibilities who is his why when they start uh...

[02:34:06.020 --> 02:34:09.480]
the screaming in the hospital you start panicking because nobody ever told

[02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:10.420]
you about this

[02:34:11.220 --> 02:34:14.640]
and if you don't take deep breaths you're gonna get pneumonia so you got to get

[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:17.260]
up and walk around of course if you get up and walk around then you're

[02:34:17.260 --> 02:34:20.440]
gonna like probably start bleeding inside and then about well maybe you're

[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:24.000]
gonna have like pulmonary uh... throttles and baleism so you're gonna have

[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.060]
blood clots in your lungs where does this all come from i mean nobody ever gives

[02:34:28.060 --> 02:34:29.680]
you a clue on these things can happen

[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:33.600]
what killed me is the way they treat you like six foot six year olds you have to

[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:37.100]
mission go to the bathroom got to wear those stupid clothes at the end of the

[02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:40.620]
movie he's teaching a bunch of interns and at the end of the movie they have to

[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:44.600]
get into the the backless gowns and be patient know how it how it feel

[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:48.100]
yeah well bob Mendelssohn used to say that that's one of the one of the reasons

[02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:51.940]
they do that is to put you on the defensive and and give them as much power

[02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:55.280]
over you as possible uh... so that you feel like you're walking around almost

[02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:59.440]
stark naked all the time and you do i i've only been in the hospital for child

[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:02.820]
birth but believe me that was enough i don't ever want to do that again

[02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:05.280]

out what we were going to use for copy okay i mean forget it don't bother them back there with copy

[02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:55.700]

somebody want to pay might want to pay money for okay god forbid that we actually follow through

[02:43:01.280 --> 02:43:05.500]

[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:38.040]
all morning about uh you're talking about hospitals yeah but you were talking about a particular

[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:43.740]
situation when you go to a hospital and uh you know to do some sort of a surgical procedure and you go

[02:43:43.740 --> 02:43:49.380]
there and you're admitted and everything but got prepared that you get there on an emergency which is

[02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:54.380]
not noticeable and what i mean is that i have to be taken i mean i drove myself to the hospital

[02:43:54.380 --> 02:43:59.740]
right i was having a kidney stone right now you know when you're passing a kidney stone oh i've

[02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:04.720]
heard it's the worst in having a baby the worst thing in the world that's right now i got to you

[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:10.680]
know i was having a cold sweats and everything but you know i i drove myself to the hospital because i

[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:17.120]
i i didn't want it to get in there in an ambulance right so i got to the hospital and you know when

[02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:21.580]
you get to the emergency room unless you're bleeding to death you're going to sit there and wait till

[02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:26.880]
health freezes over that's right so the you know this lady said to me okay have a seat so i said

[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:32.480]
lady i'm not going to have a seat right because you know if you don't that you you don't take me in

[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:38.380]
and you give me some demo some morphine or whatever it is i'm going to go into a hysterical

[02:44:38.380 --> 02:44:43.680]
frenzy and i'm going to break this goddamn emergency room good for you that's a way to do it and

[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:49.260]
well they did it but you know afterwards i was laying down half naked as you said on a

[02:44:49.260 --> 02:44:56.280]
stretcher in the emergency room and i was just i mean cold up with pain and nobody paid attention

[02:44:56.280 --> 02:45:05.300]

[02:45:06.660 --> 02:45:12.240]
he said he was feeling like crap okay i didn't say crap but i get the message okay

[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:19.000]
we can't say crap on a year sir because we live in a juvenile fascist state where words are

[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:23.300]
like weapons okay so we have to keep bleeping stuff out and act like a bunch of children

[02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:28.880]
but that's america for you okay sir and i agree with you i agree with what you said sir and i'm

[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:33.780]
glad that you have the courage to stand up for yourself that's what people ought to do people are so

[02:51:44.860 --> 02:51:49.740]
telling me more and more stories sucking around in desperation uh he finally told me that once

[02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:53.980]
