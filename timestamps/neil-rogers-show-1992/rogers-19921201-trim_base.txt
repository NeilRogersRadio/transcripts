[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello.

[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.960]
You know pretty good. What do you think about that upsell last night? What the football

[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.420]
cares about that game? I mean it's who cares about that game? You're not very

[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.680]
sports oriented. Are you? What do you mean by that? I mean obviously if you don't care about

[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.380]
a Monday. So in other words, if I'm into sports, I got to watch every damn football game

[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.100]
no matter how crappy the teams are like to see Seattle Seahawks. That's a good point.

[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.040]
So I'm not interested in the Seahawks or Denver but no. See, let me tell you something.

[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.480]
It's funny. Listen to me. Now that's a bunch of crap. Okay, let me tell you something.

[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.200]
Years ago up until about maybe six, seven years ago, I was a fanatic in just about every

[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.040]
sport and I would watch every Sunday football game that was on everyone.

[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.400]
One o'clock game, the four o'clock game, the Monday night game and now because expansion

[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.700]
has diluted professional sports to a point, I just can't do it unless a team is playing

[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.400]
that I'm interested in. I can't watch it. I just can't do it. I can't get no interest

[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.020]
in it because you got a lot of minor league teams. You got so many marginal crappy teams.

[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.580]
It's not professional sports. It's a bunch of overpaid punks. It's almost political.

[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.360]
Seattle's a joke. So they pulled off an obstacle. Well, big deal. So the cool speed buffalo

[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.760]
and they beat us. What does that mean? They're still crappy teams. Okay. When you say us,

[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.080]
who's us? Is that your referring to the money, 1000? Yeah. Okay. We have to speak to

[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.560]
yourself because we're not all thousand fans here in Miami. Yeah. You know what I'm saying?

[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.840]
So what is that prove? So in other words, I have to clarify when I live in Miami for 17 years,

[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.140]
I have to clarify who I'm talking about. Absolutely. When we only have one professional

[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.540]
football team, I have to clarify. Blow it out your ass, pal. How fast is your pizza

[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.240]
delivered? Did you have problems on your last day? All right. I'll talk to the waiter.

[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.480]
Well, all they got in the menu is fish. Okay. We'll go somewhere else. Oh, and ride

[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.160]
in a dumb car of yours. I'll call a cab. Such a weeny wheel. If your love life is at

[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.780]
a dead end, it's time to call the Jeff Dahmer dating service. When you date a Dahmer

[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.980]
girl, you'll know she meets Jeff's high standards. No annoying attitude. No bad manners.

[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.260]
No pulse. Yes, go to the movies and restaurants you like. Talk about yourself without interruption.

[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.880]
And at the end of the evening, never be rejected again. They're unique. They're available.

[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.500]
And they're dead. Call the Jeff Dahmer dating service. We'll dig up a date for you.

[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.360]
What's Richard Bay got on today on W.O.R. He's got like a hate monger show. He's got

[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.780]
on the a clansman with a hood. He's got on a guy who's screaming about the influx of

[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.840]
Russian immigrants into New York and some asshole woman on the phone carrying on about

[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.420]
the Russians are obnoxious and rude and they walk into you on the street and bap bap bap

[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.020]
bap bap bap bap I think that attacking any group of people like that is disgusting.

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.960]
On W.O.R. maybe on Channel 7.

[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.680]
Show's on both face to nation and meet the press this person that they were both doing

[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.420]
the same topic. What a coincidence. It's like one time in Newsweek come out with the

[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.440]
same thing on a front cover and it's not like something you'd expect it to be. When

[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.860]
they both have a picture of like Rex Reed on a front or something like that. How to

[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.260]
know where. And this was a thing about the religious right and how they're trying to take

[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.740]
over the Republican Party and the war between the the religious right and the moderate Republicans

[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.060]
and yada yada yada and all this other crap and we've got these so called Christian.

[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.240]
What are they called themselves? They Christian coalition and Pat Robertson and all these

[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.460]
other faking see the thing that bothers me about the rest of you folks and after the election

[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.320]
you think people might feel a little more emancipated and have like a little looser tongue

[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.240]
and feel free to speak their mind. But like to think what shine had O'Connor and the

[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.920]
Pope and all this other crap that's going on in the world in the name of organized and

[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.120]
disorganized religion. It's just oh no she shouldn't have said that well why the hell not.

[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.940]
Why the hell can't somebody open up their mouth and say what's really going on. Everybody

[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.940]
wishes somebody would open their mouth back in the 30s and 40s while millions of innocent people

[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.900]
were being exterminated and gas to death but oh no everybody is now we didn't know nothing.

[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.920]
We know nothing over here right nobody knows from nothing just keep your mouth shut and go with

[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.320]
the program in lunchtime big hand just hit the little hand so I'm just going to sit here and talk

[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.980]
about Camilla's house for the next two hours. Well maybe not for two hours but lady did have a

[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.620]
point the Camilla's house is a shelter in Miami for the homeless they've been here for years and

[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.860]
years and it gets screwed around again now the city is trying to flaunt the will of the judge who

[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.420]
said they ordered them that the homeless have a right in public places to at least exist like to

[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.120]
be there and like wash up and sleep and just to breathe the air and the city says well screw

[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.320]
them we don't care what the judge says we're going to appeal it and and their usual heartless obnoxious

[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.200]
cruel manner since this isn't something ethnic that they can exploit for votes and since the

[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.700]
homeless have no constituency so they say screw on and as I said the other day Camilla's house

[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.460]
doesn't just bring in people and put them on a cot they try they feed and clothe but they try to

[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.020]
rehabilitate people they take care of their medical needs they try to put them back on her feed and

[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.620]
and get them started in life again which is what it's all about because most rational people in

[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.380]
spite of the loud ass limbaugh's and the other propaganda this and they hate filassals of this world

[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.340]
most people don't want to be sleeping on the streets with their children or by themselves or with

[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.140]
anybody else okay and that's why I've tried for years to help Camilla's house they have a

[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.560]
multi-million dollar budget and we raise in the used to be in the tens of thousands last year was

[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.200]
147 thousand and hopefully this year we can come close to 150 or 200 thousand it should be a lot

[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.540]
more it should be much more than that if every person who listens to this station during the week

[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.080]
at this time of the year gave a dollar that would be over 300 thousand right there that's to

[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.100]
queue with this radio station during dolphin season I mean we're out there at the Euler game

[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.220]
a week ago Sunday with the tailgate party and we had a seem like a great response we raised $4,700

[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.320]
there's six sixty eight thousand people there how is that possible okay and like I said year after

[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.640]
year I've been doing this for years now four or five percent and very often it's the same four or

[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.560]
five percent year after year they're the ones who cough up some bucks and who care and the other

[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.120]
ninety five percent you couldn't get a dime out of them if their lives depended on it and like I

[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.540]
also said before there is a segment of that audience I understand people who don't have the

[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:16.140]
bucks can't afford to dime what one what I'm not going one what what it's a Camilla's house guy

[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.780]
hello yeah yes sir yes sir a new yeah this is like somebody that can mille house is

[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.200]
helped you to some about what Camilla's house does yes I was on the street and on drugs and

[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.220]
Camilla's house helped me and you know the people that are afraid of the homeless that put them

[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.940]
in and able to the Camilla's house does help them and rehabilitate them and if they would put

[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.720]
money into Camilla's house they could help more people get off the street and it would be less

[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.500]
crime but I was in big crime when I was in droves but thanks to Camilla's house I'm not

[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.680]
into crime anymore and I'm working there's been Camilla's house has helped a lot of people great

[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.660]
thank you I appreciate it I want to call and tell you that good luck thanks okay

[00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.760]
oh there's an unsolicited testimony a lot of the blue out of nowhere and it's real easy to say well

[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.860]
these people are all wine always they're all mentally ill and they want to live in a street don't

[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.480]
feed me that crap that's just an excuse used by people who don't care who would never give a dime

[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.240]
by people who just like to look the other way who want to you know just sweep the problem out of

[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.060]
the carpet siphon them off somewhere else and stick them under a bridge somewhere and just pretend

[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.900]
it's not there and all this debate going on about well should we help the people in Somalia

[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:28.320]
should we do this I don't think that as long as people have a breath or an ounce of energy that

[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.340]
we should allow people anywhere in the world to be starving to death but especially people in

[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:38.740]
our own country that's what really frost my ass how to help him we just go to sleep and I

[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.760]
would any kind of conscience if you don't like make some kind of an effort plantation on the

[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:49.740]
starline yeah were you trying to say you didn't like the fc what before 25 minutes ago when I first

[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.500]
called you were saying things about the fcc sounded like you didn't like them no they're my

[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.540]
favorites yeah hey just remember one thing 25 years ago George Carlin first did his seven

[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:05.280]
there dirty words the routine and nothing has changed what what does that mean what do you think it

[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.920]
means nothing has changed no something has changed they made it a lot more restrictive than that it

[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.580]
used to be the seven dirty words now they've come up with this vague ambiguous crap of sexual

[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.700]
activity and the excretory activity and they just make it up as they go along so that they

[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.140]
nothing is getting better no it's getting worse after 12 years of Reagan and Bush it's got a lot

[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.700]
worse and then the thing we can look forward to is that on the 20th of January Alan Sykes and a

[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.340]
lot of these other repressive right wing assholes who are nothing more than lackeys of Jesse

[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.740]
Helms and the religious right they're going to be unemployed well you're being overly optimistic I

[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.560]
think because we have democratic administrations in between in the last 25 years and it's made no

[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:46.500]
different of course Carter I guess was more religious but still nothing changes Carter was

[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.320]
important sir he was the most important president we've had in many many years don't try to

[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.940]
compare Jimmy Carter with Bill whatever his name is of course he was important he was a president

[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.700]
well I forgot George okay Clinton is like could be a Clinton avenue in Rochester what is it

[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:09.100]
what I said have a great day okay here's oh man it's one thing to be a little

[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.660]

[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.600]

[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.100]
hack the noise of the Oak and Shelby road fast down all the way down to 8.30

[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.360]
well I think you're expecting a little bit too much no you want them to cover more than one

[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:04.540]
road at a time oh this is how you think of God who I'm talking about oh my good I think you've

[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:09.440]
lost I think you lost your grip on reality I did thank you for correcting you out of

[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.220]
touch with the real world the as seen through the eyes of Joe Brennan and Mike what's my name

[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:19.560]
Paxton yeah uh-huh and no plain do you think we'll ever get a washing again or do they have a

[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.160]
lesson I think well it's been a tough you know tough economic times they just kind of

[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.300]
afford to gas him up but someday when they get him up in the air again they won't have to keep

[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:32.240]
saying well we just had a tip on the IOD a bat line see if we didn't have our list he's calling

[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.840]
and they wouldn't have any idea what was going on oh no kidding I thought maybe they were stealth

[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.340]
and they couldn't find them because they were invisible yeah that is still they're flying underground

[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:46.080]

certainly got a point let them hell it then they're kill them there's a mobile in Palm Beach

[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.620]
one of our two exciting calls on the board morning Neil can't hear you here you go great phone

[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.940]
you listen I guess hard shot won't be going to the mouth and actual like you uh yeah probably not

[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.000]
hey uh did you hear what he wrote that to say no you're not gonna believe it yeah because I

[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.600]
channel seven this morning as I was going out he said he said I'll be willing to bet that she didn't say

[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.900]
those things yeah don't bet on it Pete have a great day pad your terminal anyway there's a guy

[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.200]
he's trying to do a show you hear this guy he's trying to do stick I don't want to get into a racial

[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.680]
thing but I will anyway because I'm very disturbed there's like a double standard that goes on and

[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.620]
I find it very very disheartening although I see sunny coming in with our lunch now so I feel a

[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:40.260]
little bit better the story about that grotesque thing in Kissimmee where the pickup truck pulled

[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.540]
those people off the road the three white guys who were and and it's remember he had to call

[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.240]
what day did that happen Monday or Tuesday well whatever day it happened we had to call from

[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.820]
Tampa from on that area and evidently the newspapers and the news people over there have

[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:59.020]
come with the story accurately and they understand the real just of the story and in watching the

[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.120]
news and reading the papers I looked at the whole I scoured the front section the heraldus morning

[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.180]
there isn't the word about it on the front page of the sun sentler's a little blurb and then inside

[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:14.020]
like way inside the A section there is an article thank you sunny uh three held in car jacking

[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:19.520]
double slaying and it's rewritten from the Orlando Sentinel and it's a little teeny article here

[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.040]
and I this isn't that a major story that poor people get dragged out of a car and the three guys

[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.240]
are forced to lay down on the ground and two of them are shot and killed and one guy pretends

[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.160]
plays dead and is lucky to get away with his life that's not a major story seems to me that it is

[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:42.540]
and uh talks about three Polk County men associated with a game called the jack boys have been

[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.100]
charged and a car jacking that ended in two executions style slaying and an Oceola County pasture

[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:53.900]
and then toward the end of the story tanny George your friend clifton one of the guys who was killed

[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.940]
was forced to watch the executions and then released on harm the three shooting victims were white

[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.140]
George who is black was released by the killers who are also black and the collar we had the other

[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.940]
day said the deal was this was like retribution because she was dating one of these guys who

[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:13.320]
was a white guy and the three black guys came along and decided to uh pay a little visit now if

[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.580]
it would have been the other way around okay see that's what really bothers me about everything

[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:24.720]
that goes on in this society we've gone so far to one extreme now that i just i didn't make any

[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.380]
sense to me if the story would have been exactly the other way around and the three victims would have

[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.360]
been black and the guys who did the shooting were white and if she would have been a white girl

[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.040]
dating a black guy what would that have been called and wouldn't that be like a major story now

[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.400]
and wouldn't be like on the on the verge of having an nervous breakdown about it but for some reason

[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.340]
the media in this state and at least in this area seems to be helped that on suppressing this

[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.160]
story i mean there's an aspect of this story that for some reason hasn't met the i yet unless i'm

[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:58.600]
missing something and i just guarantee you the my bottom dime to donuts that if uh the situation

[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.600]
were reversed this would be like a big front page story and there would be people having an

[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.620]
nervous breakdown about it so it's in a local section in a herald three arrested in car jacky

[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:14.960]
slayings what do they say okay i just want to go through a real fast it charges our connection with

[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.980]
the car jacky and pull county on saturday we know the story they were forced to address and

[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:25.060]
lifeline on the ground while the robber search the truck we have confessions from all three of them

[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.300]
basically they're saying that one of the victims identified one of the suspects and called it by

[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.260]
name and therefore thought he would knew he knew who they were and would tell on them

[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:42.980]
uh it doesn't say anything in this article anything about the uh race of any of the people

[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.700]
unless i'm missing something i'm looking at it and there were some very obnoxious uh racial

[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.920]
undertones to this story but i guess because this was an anti-white thing i guess it's not news i

[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:03.240]
don't i don't get it and i'm not trying to look i'm the last thing we need is to to stir up a

[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:10.440]
but hey who the hell am i to talk let's go to the no-name lady how you done good morning how are you

[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:17.000]
i'm okay i got i got a radio now so i'm a standing citizen in my office who loves you Neil let me

[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.260]
his radio well isn't that nice yes Michael if you're out there and you're probably on list so we

[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.500]
don't have to tie up one of our lines although i'll be honest with it this time of the year tying

[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.440]
up one of our lines would make no difference believe me probably wouldn't idiot that other guy

[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.980]
i tell you it's true what you say you know if those guys were were black the ones that were killed

[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.960]
you would have hear all this bunch of stuff yeah would have been looked upon as another uh

[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.260]
southern lynching exactly but they don't want to talk about it see they only talk about it when it's

[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:52.900]
what what kind of what kind of crap is that oh that's the way it's not acceptable to me of course not

[00:15:52.900 --> 00:16:00.360]
i was listening to the tv lesson and i was hearing about howard yeah the way they is it true that the

[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.420]
fcc find his company three hundred thousand dollars three hundred and uh six forty six or something

[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.040]
like that some grotesque amount yeah what uh sure did you see that guy that uh is the one that's

[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.180]
really the one that writes the fcc no i haven't seen i haven't seen this geek there's always one

[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.280]
geek out there that comes out of nowhere you know what he does he sits there and he transcribes

[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.780]
everything that they say on the show boy that sure sounds familiar i mean this man needs to get

[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.000]
alive mm-hmm he's got nothing else to do and you should see him he looks like a hippie see let

[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.940]
me tell you something when the fcc accepts complaints from individuals who already obviously have

[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:38.120]
an axe to grind with a station or a personality or whatever it is uh there there how can there be any

[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.280]
credence there how can there be any credibility to it and this the commission has just been waiting

[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.520]
these right wing fascists up there in Washington just been waiting to seize upon the opportunity for

[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.140]
somebody to come along like this so they can uh try to stifle howard's stirring that howard's great

[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.060]
because howard doesn't let himself down he will not be conquered he is great i love howard

[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.020]
he reminds me of you yeah oh yeah he does howard works for people who uh don't take any crap
