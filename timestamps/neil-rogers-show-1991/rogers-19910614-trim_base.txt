[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]
We take a trip to Whiskeyville to visit Jimmy Mad Dog Whiskey,

[00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.480]
frontier dumb little kid.

[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.540]
Jimmy Mad Dog Whiskey's father,

[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.360]
doggy daddy Whiskey.

[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.500]
One of the teachers' boy lesson,

[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.840]
because he was doing a lot of stupid things.

[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.860]
One summer's day he gave him $5.

[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.640]
He said, now, go out on the town

[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.740]
and buy $5 worth of what's what.

[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.580]
Jimmy Mad Dog Whiskey didn't even think to ask him what what what was

[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.300]
and just took the $5 and took off.

[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.780]
Soon he came to a department store and he walked in.

[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.200]
He says, excuse me sir, I like to buy $5 worth of what's what.

[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.700]
And he said, what's what?

[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.780]
He said, listen kid, if you don't know what you want,

[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.980]
just get out of here so he left.

[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.300]
Walked into a pharmacy.

[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.540]
He said, excuse me, Mr. Pharmacist,

[00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.940]
but I like to buy $5 worth of what's what.

[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.180]
He said, what?

[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.020]
He said, what's what?

[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.040]
He said, listen little kid,

[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.840]
if you don't know what you want,

[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.820]
just get the heck out of here.

[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.980]
So you left.

[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.420]
Went to a grocery store.

[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.400]
Excuse me, Mr. Grocer.

[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.280]
But I got $5 here, I want to buy $5 worth of what's what.

[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.480]
And I said, what?

[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.320]
He said, what's what?

[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.580]
He says, ah, this dumb little kid.

[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.620]
He says, I'm going to have some fun with this little kid.

[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.740]
He says, hey, little boy, why don't you go across the street there.

[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.460]
There's a bravo across the street.

[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.580]
So go over there, they probably got what's what.

[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.980]
So Jimmy Mad Dog whiskey frontier dumb little kid

[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.820]
takes his $5 and walks across the street

[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.540]
to the bravo.

[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.080]
Now I sign a door.

[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.060]
A woman opens a door.

[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.100]
Completely naked.

[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.660]
And Jimmy Mad Dog whiskey never saw a woman's private parts before.

[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.500]
He says, what's that?

[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.640]
And she said, what's what?

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.400]
He said, that's great.

[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.400]
Give me $5 worth.

[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.400]
$108 at WIOD.

[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.800]
Your news weather traffic sports

[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.440]
and screwed up station.

[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.660]
Today's the last day on the Palm Beach Line.

[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.060]
Look at that, there's a call on there already.

[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.020]
They must be getting nervous.

[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.280]
Starting Monday, 1-800-944-WI-D.

[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.000]
toll free for all of Florida outside of Dayton, Broward.

[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.700]
Anybody outside 305?

[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.260]
Have that exciting?

[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.380]
Man, I'm getting excited about it.

[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.200]
And all, another edition of

[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.740]
What is today?

[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.880]
What is Ed McMahon, where vice president?

[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.600]
Welcome back to Nightline.

[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.900]
I'm Ted Couple.

[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.240]
President Bush?

[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.740]
Yes.

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.760]
Which nations do you see as our most favorite trading partners

[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.180]
during the next decade?

[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.060]
Well, that'd be the Chinese.

[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.640]
Chinese.

[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.700]
The Japanese.

[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.580]
The Japanese.

[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.060]
The Japanese.

[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.060]
Perhaps the Russians.

[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.120]
The Russians.

[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.300]
It's not a joke.

[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.520]
And now knock it off.

[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.780]
Vice president, McMahon.

[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.920]
You planned a run for president in 96

[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.320]
despite the cold reception of your fellow party members.

[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.200]
How cold was it?

[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.240]
I got it out, Ed.

[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.720]
President Bush, getting back to the 92 election,

[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.860]
many people feel a better running mate for 92

[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.080]
would be General Norman Schwarzkoff.

[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.840]
Well, some of you.

[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.020]
I'm not a star.

[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.220]
You see it, Ed?

[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.640]
I might give him a fair.

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.520]
Ooh, a fair.

[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.460]
Why not give me a fair?

[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.660]
But join us next time when we last.

[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.320]
What if Jay Leno were the surgeon general?

[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.960]
Oh, yeah, sure.

[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.260]
Go ahead.

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.040]
Smoke all you want.

[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.580]
They'll make more.

[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.260]
We're next, we ask.

[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.840]
What is...

[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.200]
Jay Leno is about as funny as Cancer the Tonail.

[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.280]
I'll tell you, 10-15.

[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.400]
I wonder Letterman's pissed off.

[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.400]
We have an open line in day, 751,

[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.680]
2 in Broward, of course, 524, and at Starline, at Star IOD.

[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.900]
Smiley B, chill out.

[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.920]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.160]
Neil, I heard on Monday, 103-C, Paul Castronov,

[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.280]
with the positive news.

[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.420]
Please, please, forget about Paul Castronov,

[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.880]
and nobody gives two flying craps about him, okay?

[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.800]
Forget about him.

[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.360]
Well, you know, I've heard...

[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.400]
This man, since the day he came to town,

[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.420]
it's all he talks about is Neo Rodgers this,

[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.880]
and he...

[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.020]
He's just like the people on Lightball Radio.

[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.480]
You'll figure if they talk about me and up,

[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.320]
they're going to get some attention,

[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.180]
somebody might listen,

[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.220]
forget about him, okay?

[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.200]
Well, you know, I mean...

[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.700]
Desperate.

[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.880]
Desperate, yeah.

[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.220]
It's for worthy cause.

[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:19.840]
Desperate.

[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.460]
Don't...

[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.040]
Tom to blow it out of zero, okay sir.

[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.800]
It's for pubicosis.

[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.320]
Yeah.

[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.800]
Baby's born with pubic hair.

[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.200]
Yeah.

[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.020]
Well, you know, I figured...

[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.140]
You know, you're...

[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.680]
How much do you pay you to make this call, sir?

[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.880]
No, I didn't pay me any.

[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.360]
50 bucks.

[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.460]
I heard it on the radio.

[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.060]
You heard it on the radio,

[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.000]
you were listening to she?

[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.140]
Yeah.

[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.000]
Oh boy, you really need mental health.

[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.820]
Well, I figured, man, you could take him.

[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.960]
Sir, have a great weekend.

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.480]
Wait, can I call somebody douchebag?

[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.780]
You're gonna have to do it fast cause you're digging a whole deeper than the Grand Canyon, sir.

[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.380]
Well, I'd like to call my friend Diego.

[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.020]
I know he's listening to a douchebag,

[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.520]
but douchebag's too good for him.

[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.060]
So I'm gonna...

[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.360]
Well, I just want to leave him on for a second.

[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.120]
I can see how far he will go.

[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.540]
Ha ha ha ha!

[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.120]
Oh, good job pal.

[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.580]
Excellent.

[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.760]
Just for our friends in Palm Beach.

[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.100]
Times run it out.

[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.840]
W-I-O-D.

[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.760]
Hey, Neil.

[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.860]
The deadline line.

[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.700]
No, I wanted to get on it before you yank it.

[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.160]
Yeah.

[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.700]
How about the line?

[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.320]
Well, that too.

[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.880]
Just being the last day.

[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.360]
Yeah.

[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.400]
You're starting a new thing on Monday, right?

[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.040]
We're starting a 1-800-944-W-I-D on Monday

[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.680]
for everybody outside Dayton,

[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.560]
Brow and outside the 305 area code.

[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.560]
Well, somebody else in Palm Beach County

[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.180]
is starting something new Monday, man.

[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.320]
Well, isn't that great?

[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.680]
Uh, Boone tells me that

[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.720]
PBR is going to be relaying the light bulb.

[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.220]
Yeah.

[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.920]
Mom, we're real excited about that.

[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.380]
Yeah.

[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.580]
I mean, the thing that we can hear you

[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.380]
all the way up to Orlando.

[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.200]
Jan O'Neill needs a relay transmitter up in Fero.

[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.680]
And now, light bulb needs a PBR in Palm Beach.

[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.560]
Jan O'Neill has also got a relay thing in North Broward somewhere.

[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.080]
Oh, they still have that one?

[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.980]
I think, yeah.

[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.920]
But the one that they've got in zero isn't even on the same frequency.

[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.920]
You've got to tune up.

[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.380]
Well, neither is light bulb going to be there.

[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.420]
They're going to be all over the dial.

[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.820]
They're going to be all over the dial on low-powered 5-Watt radio stations.

[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.620]
I like them.

[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.920]
So what we're going to do, we're going to put a relay...

[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.040]
Mark.

[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.580]
Okay.

[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.800]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.360]
No, no.

[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.880]
No matter what I say, he's just rambling and rambling.

[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.140]
Like I said the other day, we're going to put a little repeater tower

[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.440]
on the top of every tall building on every street corner

[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.520]
from here to Jacksonville.

[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.500]
And we're going to be everywhere.

[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.640]
Randy Gandhi.

[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.480]
He's a Randy Gandhi.

What happens when Stevie Wonder tries to shave himself?

[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.900]
1027, we have an open line on the star line.

[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.980]
It's star IOD for some peculiar reason.

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.140]
And let's go to Hollywood.

[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:03.500]
Hello.

[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.220]
I'm a Bucko fan and an IC man, even when we lose.

[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:08.840]
Yeah.

[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:09.920]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:10.840]
Good luck to you, sir.

[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.680]
Good luck to me.

[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.060]
Yeah, you got the scoot out of one last night, but...

[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.600]
Well, that's OK.

[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.780]
Hey, what about the penguins did it?

[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.060]
Now the pirates are going to do it.

[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.360]
They've got a long time to go, yeah, but it's still possible.

[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.460]
What do you think?

[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.400]
What do I think about what?

[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.400]
I think it's possible and then the steal is two.

[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.040]
Yeah, anything's possible.

[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.000]
And also the Pittsburgh NBA team might win next year, too.

[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.580]
Oh, the...the Pisces.

[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.040]
Yeah.

[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.520]
Hey, Neil, I want to talk about Jim and Kathy.

[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.660]
Just a couple of douchebags.

[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.100]
OK.

[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:42.740]
Pompano.

[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:43.500]
Hello.

[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.600]
Hello.

[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:45.500]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.160]
Good morning.

[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:48.460]
Yes.

[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.760]
It is a good morning, though.

[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.700]
So far, right up until this moment.

[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.940]
Well, we still have it decided it was going to be good morning yet or not.

[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.360]
I'm sitting here, baby, sitting in my air conditioner.

[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.740]
Wedding to the air conditioning man to come.

[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.040]
You're not related to that guy from Chicago, who called, are you?

[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.020]
Excuse me.

[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.680]
I say, I hope you're having a good time.

[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.600]
I'm not related to that guy from Chicago.

[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.440]
Uh-huh.

[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.400]
Uh-uh.

[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:09.840]
You're numbered.

[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.000]
You want to 800 numbers going to be available when?

[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.720]
Monday, 10 a.m.

[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.660]
Well, I'm going to stay here all day.

[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.780]
Easter and daylight time.

[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.380]
I'm going to stick a girl on you from Birmingham, Alabama.

[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.280]
It has no life.

[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:19.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.180]
But she's a good kid.

[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.840]
Uh-huh.

[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.420]
Hey, I was listening to you.

[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.180]
I think it was yesterday.

[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:25.460]
Where is she?

[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.000]
First of all, it's only good from the rest of the state of Florida, so good luck to her.

[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.680]
Oh, it doesn't work out of the state?

[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.300]
No.

[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.260]
Oh, she has to go off with me.

[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.500]
In fact, we specifically made sure it wouldn't work in Alabama.

[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.060]
All right.

[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.120]
Or Tennessee.

[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.180]
Or Tennessee.

[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.500]
Or a lot of the, yeah, right.

[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.480]
Hey, you're going to be out to the miracle place tonight.

[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.360]
Yeah.

[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.300]
Is it possible to get near you?

[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.920]
What does that mean?

[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:50.820]
What does that mean?

[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.700]
Is it, you know, I've been with you since the war.

[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.960]
I have not given up since the war.

[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.920]
I like to show.

[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.760]
I'm listening to you show.

[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:57.580]
I'm a driver.

[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.040]
I listen to you show every day.

[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.060]
I get very, very good to go.

[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.240]
Well, that's what we do out there.

[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.740]
We have a table set up and we sign our stupid pictures

[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.520]
and write little dumb things on there and give out bumper stickers.

[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.620]
And we can say, it's all about.

[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.620]
Well, I still want.

[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.740]
That's what it's, that's what we're there for.

[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.160]
I was listening to you yesterday.

[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.660]
I believe it was yesterday, where you told the gentleman

[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.800]
that he could take an orange and...

[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:18.940]
Yeah.

[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.980]
In a certain place?

[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.420]
Uh-huh.

[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.020]
Sir, take a gigantic orange, okay?

[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.880]
Pedal it and stick it up your ass.

[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.200]
Pedal it and stick it up your ass.

[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.460]
Stick it up your ass.

[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:28.980]
Stick it up your ass.

[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.420]
That was great.

[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.440]
He was great.

[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.480]
He's still working on it.

[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.720]
He's still working on it.

[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.120]
He's still peeling it.

[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.400]
He must have a bigger, it must be a California orange.

[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:37.780]
Uh-huh.

[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.980]
Well, he got confused.

[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.360]
He got something a little bit bigger.

[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.380]
Great fruit.

[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.500]
No, I don't know.

[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.820]
I think it was a pumpkin.

[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.420]
Pumpkin.

[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.580]
I already needed it.

[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.220]
Um, I'm out of material.

[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:49.880]
Okay.

[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.260]
I'd like to say that Donald, my good friend that commercial friend,

[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.260]

[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.740]
Okay.

[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.400]
And say goodbye.

[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.340]
Say goodbye.

[00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.340]
Say goodbye.

[00:10:59.660 --> 00:10:59.980]
Say goodbye.

[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:00.240]
Goodbye.

[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.100]
Oh, man.

[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:03.660]
Woo!

[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.060]
10-30 on Yahoo Radio.

[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.400]
We're doing it, boy.

[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.420]
We're picking it.

[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.820]
Uh, Coral Gables.

[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.120]
Hello.

[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.100]
Uh, can I stop the nail, please?

[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.280]
Well, who do you think this is?

[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.340]
Nail?

[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.960]
No, this is George.

[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.500]
What's happening, Nail?

[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.640]
What's up?

[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.020]
This is Tony and Coral Gables.

[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:23.660]
Hey, Tony.

[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.020]
Uh, let me process my car by saying I'm a spanic, you know.

[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:27.560]
Uh-huh.

[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.900]
Um, and?

[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.180]
Well, I don't want to frost you a little bit.

[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:38.120]
I get an idea for a name for the baseball team.

[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:38.540]
Tony?

[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:39.720]
Yeah.

[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:40.560]
Adios.

[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.140]
10-33 at WIOD.

[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.360]
We have one open line in day 751.

[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.120]
I'm telling you, there must be something in the water in this town.

[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.600]
Because it's not like isolated.

[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.240]
It's like the whole town gets it.

[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.480]
Like, we'll get like 10 in a row and they'll all be just like that.

[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.960]
Two open lines in Broward.

[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.380]
Hey, listen, we're going to hit the carts real heavy today.

[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.740]
I got to hold pile of stuff here.

[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.920]
Let's, uh, let's break one of these out and see how these, how these were on the machine.

[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.980]
There's a whole bunch of these.

[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.760]
This is how Brookshire, New York.

[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.780]
The recent heat wave brought on by global warming has had various disastrous effects.

[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.460]
This just in from Hollywood.

[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.020]
Michael Jackson has melted.

[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.380]
Officials at the scene report finding a lump of plastic next to a whimpering chimpanzee.

[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.460]
Now, because all things plastic are in danger of melting,

[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:39.020]
fire officials are now installing extra smoke alarms on the set of live with Regis and Cathily.

[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.820]
I'm Tom Brookshire.

[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.460]
Say cool, everyone.

[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.060]
Miami Lakes.

[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.100]
Young Mr. Rogers.

[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:48.560]
Yeah.

[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.800]
Once for, uh, what is your stand on lifeguys?

[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.700]
Stand on this, sir.

[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.540]
We have an open line in day 751 WIOD West Palm Beach.

[00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.460]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:58.840]
Okay.

[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.640]
Palm Beach Post is more important.

[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.840]
Oh, I got to tell you, I'm going to take a nap.

[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]
Palm Beach Post.

[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.260]
We're like, like the last couple of days, it's always here about as the damn Palm Beach Post.

[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.880]
Get rid of it.

[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.120]
Don't do it again, sir.

[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:12.580]
Okay.

[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.000]
Don't even put it in your bird cage.

[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.520]
I just got some quotes from Steve Kane here.

[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.340]
Oh, that's even worse.

[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.260]
I don't care.

[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.480]
Nobody cares.

[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.440]
Nobody cares about a little 250 watt station with a bunch of little amateur hour people playing radio.

[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.600]
It's with dead air with a bunch of, it's just pathetic.

[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.760]
It's embarrassing.

[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.380]
I'm sorry.

[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.580]
Don't do it again.

[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.820]
Now, you know why we're taking that line away.

[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:43.340]
See, those people up in Palm Beach, their idea, they really believe that they're the hub of the market

[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.700]
and the rest of the world revolves around them.

[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.440]
They're kind of like the sun and the rest of us are on Uranus.

[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.920]
And they really believe that.

[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.280]
So they think when they talk about talk radio, oh, Jay and old, you hear what the leaf outland in the day?

[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.580]
You hear what, whoever I don't even know, what else is on?

[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.400]
Mike Miller, who nobody here cares.

[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.280]
It'll be like somebody from some little station on the edge of Long Island calling it a WABC.

[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.680]
Oh, you hear what Eddie Rock and Foust did today?

[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.700]
Nobody cares.

[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.120]
Nobody ever heard of him, okay?

[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.000]
Nobody cares.

[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:22.940]
So that's another good reason to be getting rid of, we'll have, even when a line does ring, at least most of the time I assume it will not be from Palm Beach,

[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.500]
which can only be a big improvement.

[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.080]
Palm Beach.

[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.640]
Hello, Neil.

[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.020]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.220]
Will we be able to hear you anymore?

[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.520]
Why not?

[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.040]
Well, you said you were going taking it out.

[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.280]
I'm not taking it out, especially during this call. I'm putting it away, believe me.

[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.240]
Oh.

[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.440]
What do you mean?

[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.360]
Well, I thought you said we weren't going to be able to hear you.

[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.240]
I didn't, that's not at all what I said.

[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.120]
We're taking the Palm Beach phone.

[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.100]
I want to speak to Lordeus.

[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.600]
This is Marlene from Channel 7.

[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.580]
We're taking the what?

[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.680]
Who is that?

[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.620]
Marlene from Channel 7 calling Lordeus Acevito at the Herald.

[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.480]
We're taking this phone line out, replacing it with a 1-800 number, but that does got nothing to do with the reception on the radio.

[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.460]
Oh, you'll be on Monday, then.

[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.200]
You bet.

[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.200]
Okay.

[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.480]
I'll be on Monday, Tuesday, and for a couple more days, and I'm going on vacation.

[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:17.500]
Oh.

[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.640]
And then I'll be on on tape, and I'll still be on.

[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.060]
I've been listening. I listen to you all the time.

[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.400]
Well, bless you.

[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.480]
And I miss you.

[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.520]
You're not going to miss me. I'm not going to be gone. I'm going to be here every day.

[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.300]
All right.

[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.160]
Did you, you got it now?

[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:32.700]
Yes.

[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.240]
Okay.

[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.180]
Bye.

[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.660]
Oh, help, help.

[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.740]
The water in the White House.

[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.500]
For a while, it was suspect.

[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.680]
Then it was tested and found to be pure.

[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.840]
In fact, the purest water on the planet, introducing...

[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.920]
Habit to spring.

[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.200]
100% refreshing.

[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.220]
And the taste.

[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.400]
It's good. It's good.

[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.500]
And read my lips.

[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.440]
No side effects.

[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.620]
Listen to what your fellow Americans are saying about clean, pure, capital springs.

[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.600]
Last week, thirsty.

[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.020]
Did the prudent thing?

[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.600]
Tried capital springs.

[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.680]
It's good.

[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.840]
So good.

[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.740]
Made my eyes bug out.

[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.420]
Tried other bottle of water.

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.320]
Bad.

[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.500]
Capital springs.

[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:21.500]
Good.

[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.920]
Why capital springs?

[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:29.500]
Because research shows 68% of Americans will swallow anything that comes out of the White House.

[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.420]
100% pure?

[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.440]
No side effects.

[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.820]
Capital springs.

[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.260]
The trickle down treat for your thirst.

[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.380]
Capital springs.

[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.200]
World's purest age to oh.

[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:44.580]
Drink this.

[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.260]
1107 at WIOD.

[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.920]
We have an open line on the star.

[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.600]
I'm starting to kind of like a wake-up alert.

[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.780]
Maybe they're in the same thing.

[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.980]
Maybe it just went around town.

[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:52.640]
Is that possible?

[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.460]
Maybe they all woke up at 2.30 also.

[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.040]
And watch the weather channel.

[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.460]
Pompano.

[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:01.420]
Pompano.

[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.060]
I'm about to just cut them off.

[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:03.400]
You know?

[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.000]
I like misfired there.

[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.820]
Well, too bad.

[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:06.600]
Call us back.

[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.720]
Probably nothing to say anyway.

[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:08.840]
Coconut Creek.

[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:09.860]
Hello.

[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.020]
Neil?

[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:11.460]
Yeah.

[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.260]
How you doing?

[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.120]
I'm doing okay.

[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.620]
Listen, you were rapping yesterday about that stairway to heaven, you know, gig.

[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:18.480]
Yeah.

[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.300]
It's infectious.

[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.180]
It's as good as a lady.

[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.240]
And can I have another request?

[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.460]
Season or the Docks June.

[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:26.420]
Yeah.

[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.460]
What do you mean another request?

[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.720]
Yeah, well, it's not a request.

[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.000]
You know that part you have of a list of.

[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.980]
Why don't you just list off?

[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.980]
About 400 of them.

[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.680]
Yeah, Larry King.

[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.940]
He says lowly $50.

[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.200]
Is that low me $50 or low me $50?

[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.000]
Low me $50.

[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.760]
Well, I have to listen to it again as a matter of fact.

[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.600]
Low me $50.

[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.080]
You just talk about no life.

[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.560]
Yeah.

[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.480]
Well, get a hold of yourself, sir.

[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:53.760]
No life at all.

[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:54.960]
Man.

[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.760]
Pember Pines.

[00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.420]
Now.

[00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:58.960]
Yeah.

[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.460]
The ultimate of ultimate scumbag pick reports you could imagine.

[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:03.940]
Yeah.

[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.220]
I know you don't read the slum sentinel, but this one you have to pick up and get.

[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.460]
Club Nick.

[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:16.400]
As you need to buy bread that is unlearned.

[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:16.660]
Yeah.

[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:17.740]
Club Nick.

[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.560]
How ready you read it?

[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:18.900]
Did you?

[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.400]
What do you think of this guy $52,000 in tax for years money?

[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:23.800]
Yeah.

[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.960]
Is this guy unbelievable?

[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:32.120]
You know something, sir, we can sit here like they do on a certain other very low-powered station in Beliac about Sheriff Nick from now until the end of time

[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.520]
was one of my least favorite people in the history of my life.

[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.700]
And you know something isn't going to do a bit of good.

[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:42.040]
He's still going to run from now until the cows come home and he'll still win overwhelmingly every time they love him.

[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.800]
You know what they are in Broward?

[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.500]
The more they love him, the more right wing they are, the more they love him.

[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.560]
He's just an institution.

[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.080]
He's just like the emperor.

[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:54.080]
You know the one quote that I love that I love that's why they had to spend all that money because the emperor had no clothes.

[00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:02.780]
The one quote I love the best in this is the finance director Michael Woodruff told the reporter the allowances to be used for whatever an employee wanted for.

[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.240]
I'll probably spend it on clothes for me and my wife.

[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.700]
So just think about that.

[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.520]
You know we're only just spending $500 for him and his wife.

[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.880]
I like to have the $500 for me and my wife, huh?

[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:13.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.340]
Or whatever, even for a good time and wriggling for next couple of days, right?

[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:17.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.200]
But he's doing it again.

[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.260]
Uncle Neil, I got to tell you.

[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.920]
If he isn't the scum, it's the pigs of pigs.

[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.520]
And all you BSO pigs out there listening, I know you love Neil.

[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.600]
You got scumbag boss.

[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.160]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.260]
Neil, enjoy yourself and wriggle and have a good time.

[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.200]
Let me $50.

[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.240]
Are you Lusty's news department?

[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.520]
A bunch of big fat slabs and they are sitting around trying to figure out a great way to disrupt the show again.

[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.140]
Now that the war is over.

[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.820]
And we have another space shuttle landing coming up.

[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:56.020]
Which I know everybody in this audience is sitting right on the edge of their seat waiting for that.

[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.300]
Oh!

[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:56.640]
Yeah.

[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.420]
Can't wait.

[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.800]
I mean we only have a space shuttle landing like about every half an hour now, right?

[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.940]
Like it's a real big novelty.

[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:11.360]
And the only reason they want to have it on the air is in the rare unlikely chance the sucker is going to crash.

[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.080]
You know that.

[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.480]
Because that's the mentality of news people exploiting human tragedy.

[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.480]
They only wish they'd been at that golf tournament yesterday with a...

[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:20.720]
...a...

[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.320]
...head and microphone.

[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.360]
Listening to the groaning and moaning of those people as they were getting shocked from the sky.

[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.520]
They would have loved it.

[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.960]
And so coming up in 22 minutes and 55 seconds but who's counting at 1137.

[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:41.780]
We have the landing of the space shuttle interrupting this important prestigious highly rated meaningful show.

[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:50.740]
Now this show is about the only thing that gives any continuity to the lives of millions of people all throughout this godforsaken wasteland in which we live.

[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:56.000]
And I will grant you the cause here today have been like about a minus six on a scale of 4,000 but who the hell cares?

[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:04.000]
So we wind up again getting a screwed because this isn't your micrinerineel Rogers Rick and Sardshank Goldberg station.

[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.920]
This is your news weather and ponderous boring traffic and crap station.

[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:15.980]
So every time the president farts we have to interrupt the program so everybody in the audience can get a good whiff.

[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.120]
Okay, that's basically what this radio station thinks you people listen for.

[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:20.680]
Okay.

[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.240]
Now quite frankly I could sit here and just you know how long we don't have a lot of time to screw around with that thing.

[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.220]
We got like a lot of stuff on here where we're going to get every spot in.

[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:32.940]
Okay.

[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.100]
I don't care if we have to play them back to back for half an hour.

[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:45.760]
We're not losing any revenue because of some stupid bogus decision by some big fat pirates fan in the newsroom that we're going to put on this stupid space shuttle landing.

[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.980]
Here's a lady in Miramar.

[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.200]
Hi Neil.

[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.780]
Do you want to hear about the space shuttle land?

[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.620]
No, not at all.

[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.140]
I guarantee you there is is there anybody out there wants to hear it land?

[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.420]
Oh yeah well him no matter what I'd say he'd say the opposite.

[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:01.700]
Yeah.

[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.680]
How are you?

[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.260]
I'm okay.

[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.080]
I'm pissed.

[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.020]
I'm sick of this.

[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:11.540]
I mean if there was something meaningful going on naturally we want to be at first with the news you know put it right on of course.

[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.080]
Well I have something very meaningful to do.

[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.640]
But let's get serious with the space shuttle landing for the four millionth time.

[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.160]
Oh god.

[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:20.820]
I'm sorry.

[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.500]
Neil I have to tell you I'm involved with medical sales and I cover both the Hollywood and Holland Delay.

[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.940]
Well give me some doggy downers over here right away.

[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:36.360]
Well I think it's very frustrating to be driving around and you have to make appointments with physicians and we have these

[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:44.080]
Helen Dale drivers that really and honestly I have this is the only gripe I have with them that they really shouldn't be driving.

[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.180]
I was at a stoplight yesterday the light turned green.

[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.880]
I beeped the horn a couple times.

[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.340]
No the light didn't turn green the the person in the car in front of you did.

[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.480]
You do that or a dark shade of purple because they've been dead for 30 years.

[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:04.480]
Well it was ridiculous I you know I blew a horn you know once and I'm waiting and the light still green and traffic is going on the side of me

[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:11.640]
and I'm behind him and I'm waiting and I'm waiting and he didn't move and it's annoying and it goes on every day every day.

[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.160]
Constantly.

[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.060]
I'm on the road.

[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.600]
I never ending source of consternation.

[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:22.800]
Well I really think that they should take a look at restricting the licenses of individuals over the age of 70.

[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.540]
I don't think that all of them have.

[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.820]
Get them off the road.

[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.680]
Get them off of it.

[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.460]
Absolutely it's it's except my mother.

[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.420]
My mother can go to the store once in a while but other than that get all the rest of them off the road.

[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.160]
At least during rush hour you know it's it's it's it's.

[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.740]
Oh there's that juicy fruit spot again.

[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:39.460]
Oh boy.

[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.060]
Have you seen that spot?

[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:41.920]
No I haven't.

[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.820]
Well it'll cheer you up a little bit.

[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.620]
Well I think Sunny Rosenberg's on the phone right now.

[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.600]
Good luck.

[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:49.320]
Thank you.

[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:49.760]
See ya.

[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.840]
I feel better now that juicy fruit spot just came on.

[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.500]
Oh boy.

[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.820]
We have an open line and day 751.

[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.880]
Who the hell carry is there?

[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.120]
Let's go through and find out.

[00:23:59.260 --> 00:23:59.780]
Hope Sound.

[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.480]
Yeah now.

[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.880]
Do you want to hear the space shuttle land?

[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:03.760]
No sir.

[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:04.620]
All right hold on a second.

[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.220]
Lady in Pembroke Park.

[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:06.860]
Do you want to hear it?

[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:07.320]
No.

[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.560]
Okay hold on.

[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.060]
Miami you want to hear it?

[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:11.840]
Miami.

[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:12.820]
Hello.

[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.080]
Hello.

[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.540]
Do you want to hear the space shuttle land?

[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.000]
Hell no.

[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:16.440]
Okay.

[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.460]
Dear Field.

[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.520]
Do you want to hear it?

[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.100]
No.

[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:21.660]
Okay.

[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:21.660]

[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.700]
Who's thinking about it?

[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.480]
Lady in Hollywood.

[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.320]
Do you want to hear it?

[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.120]
No I don't.

[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:26.320]
No.

[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:26.720]
Okay.

[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:27.720]
Starline.

[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.400]
Do you want to hear it?

[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.540]
No not today.

[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.140]
Okay.

[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.580]
Oh Polaki.

[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.420]
Do you want to hear it?

[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:34.800]
No.

[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.200]
Do you want to hear it?

[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:36.500]

[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:37.720]
Okay.

[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.180]
That's 8 out of 8.

[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.740]
We just took our own goddamn telephone here.

[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:48.540]
And there is nobody anywhere in this audience that wants to hear the stupid space shuttle land.

[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:48.900]
Okay.

[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.060]
Is there anybody out there wants to hear it?

[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:52.480]
Uh-huh.

[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:52.860]
Yeah.

[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:53.740]
He's the one.

[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.560]
Right now it's 22 till noon at WIOD.

[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.220]
Time for that space shuttle landing.

[00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.480]
Thank you Neil.

[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.160]
This is Elena Tour in the 610 WIOD News Center.

[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.720]
The space shuttle Columbia is preparing to land an Edwards Air Force base.

[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:11.280]
And just about a minute we now join Mutuals Joe Walsh and Carrie Moran for live coverage of the shuttle landing.

[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.720]
The sharp contrast against the cliffs now just a few feet off the landing line.

[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.740]
It's coming in just a few feet now from touchdown.

[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.960]
Looking very good, very steady.

[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.620]
Knows edging down.

[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.860]
Tires just a few feet off and there's the puffs of white smoke.

[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.120]

[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.880]
Touchdowns of rear.

[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:32.920]
Oh!

[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.120]
Tires of the shuttle.

[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.160]
Come back to Earth.

[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.200]
Knows now easing down very, very gently, very slowly.

[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.080]
And they are down.

[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.380]
Knows gear touchdown.

[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.140]
This is Elena Tour in the 610 WIOD News Center.

[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:50.940]
There you have it.

[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.680]
A perfect landing for the shuttle Columbia.

[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.580]
We will now return to the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.200]
All right! Good job!

[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.600]
It's 20 till noon.

[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.100]
Let's see.

[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.000]
We went in to 38.

[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:06.320]
That was the most insipid minute and 40 seconds in the history of radio.

[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.860]
I hope that somebody sends the time capsule to the Smithsonian Institute of Broadcasting in Washington.

[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.320]
That was the most incredible waste of time.

[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.320]
We couldn't have read that off the wire on the news.

[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.800]
Okay, 20 till 12.

[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:19.620]
Let's go to Deerfield.

[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:19.960]
Hello.

[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.460]
Hi, Neil. How you doing?

[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.260]
Yeah, this is Dave from Deerfield.

[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:24.800]
Yeah, Dave.

[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.440]
I've been holding on the first time call a long time listener.

[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:29.780]
Yeah?

[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:30.800]
Nothing said, huh?

[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:31.780]
Well, I'm just...

[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.460]
You know, there's so much stuff going on here, Dave.

[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.260]
Don't feel like we're not happy to have you.

[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.360]
We're delighted to have you.

[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.600]
Well, it's nice talking to you.

[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.080]
I've been listening to your show since the war started.

[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.720]
And I just happened to hear the landing too.

[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:43.800]
And it was a waste of time.

[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:44.240]
Yeah.

[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.460]
You know, they ought to put you on.

[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.540]
Made you wait for an extra two minutes for nothing.

[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.660]
I know. Isn't that cool?

[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.600]
Eric Combs, the wheels are...

[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.600]
They're a little puff of smoke.

[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.700]
There it is.

[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.020]
Oh, boy. Look at that.

[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.520]
So what we're going to be doing, we're going to take like three, four hours every day

[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.440]
because I know people are into these landing.

[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.760]
You ever drive by the airport and see like the people that sit, the rubber neckers who sit around.

[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:03.560]
Yeah.

[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.860]
On the tops of their cars, watching the plane's land.

[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.060]
And of course, a lot of those people would pretend that they're aficionados of a vehicle.

[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.320]
And the thing is, they're all just sitting out there waiting for a plane to crash.

[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.400]
They want to see it live.

[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.560]
I wish they would crash and they'd have something to watch.

[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.340]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.440]
Just as long as nobody we know is on it.

[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:20.340]
Well, my boss told me to come.

[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.180]
Thank you, Sunny, Jr.

[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.920]
Hey, my boss told me to call you because the friend of mine that I work with,

[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.100]
he's a major douchebag and I just wanted to relay that to you.

[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:28.660]
Well, who is he?

[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.560]
His name is Brad.

[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.180]
Oh, yeah. Serious douchebag.

[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:31.860]
Yes, he is.

[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.480]
Well, you did a great job, sir.

[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.600]
Thank you. Nice talking to you.

[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.120]
Have a good life.

[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:35.660]
Have a good day.

[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.660]
Okay. Have something good.

[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.900]
We've got a good salad here from Sunny's right now.

[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.460]
1144, we have an open line on the starline, star IOD.

[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.900]
And let's go to Opalaka.

[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:45.780]
Hello.

[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.180]
Neil Rogers Radio, 610 WIO.

[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:49.640]
How you doing?

[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:50.140]
Okay.

[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:55.240]
Well, do you hear that crushing numbing tone of depression slipping to the Elaine's voice there

[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.900]
when it landed on us, turning and...

[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:57.720]
Yeah.

[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.040]
Well, she was depressed that it didn't crash because all news people are the same.

[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.500]
They're all a bunch of sadistic bastards.

[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.080]
They're so lazy.

[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:04.720]
Yeah.

[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.120]
I can't, I mean...

[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.880]
I hope the pirates go on a streak and lose the next 45 in a row just to get there.

[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.880]
They make me sick.

[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.360]
And I'll say it again, I've never seen Chuck Byron Bob Veal together.

[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:15.760]
Yeah.

[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:16.960]
Wow.

[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.220]
See that, Neil?

[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:18.560]
Fat.

[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.200]
You'll be up there.

[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:19.720]
Is that triple?

[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:24.940]
What triple A, B, C, or double A, or what kind of baseball is it up there?

[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:25.880]
Pompano.

[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.360]
D cup.

[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.180]
I don't know, I really don't know.

[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:29.920]
That's why I'm asking.

[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:30.420]
A.

[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.920]
It's just triple A, 1A.

[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:32.340]
A.

[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.600]
And 2A is better and 3A is like next to the pros, right?

[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.300]
3A is about like if your foot's the size of a walrus.

[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.060]
Have a good time, Pat.

[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.440]
1153, I have got.

[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.720]
These things just, they fall into the door.

[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.180]
I have no idea where this came from.

[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:55.400]
This is screening procedures for phone calls on talk shows on WIOD, another intercepted memo

[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.320]
that just, I found it on the floor out in the hallway during the break, incredible.

[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.200]
Did you read this yet?

[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.280]
Oh, man.

[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.600]
I'll save the best part for later.

[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.220]
But let's go to page 4.

[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.560]
Sequencing callers.

[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.840]
Let me get to the best part.

[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.340]
Remember no old sounding callers get on a year unless they qualify.

[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.720]
In other words, if they got a lot of money and they want to send us some of it.

[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.840]
Callers should be appraised just before going on the year.

[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.880]
Pepp them up, get them ready.

[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.460]
Whipp them into shape.

[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.120]
Pepp them up, George.

[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:33.660]
Come on.

[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.080]
Get with it.

[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:42.440]
In those rare instances when calls are few and far between, go back and check on the few calls that are on hold.

[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.860]
Assure them that they'll be on the year soon, like sometime between now and next you will us.

[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.020]
The first call of the hour sets the temp for the rest of the hour.

[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.060]
It should be the best possible caller.

[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.500]
The first call after each break is also important.

[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.000]
Pick the best one and go with it.

[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:03.360]
Which one?

[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.040]
What's Palm Beach?

[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:04.360]
Hello.

[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.780]
Yes, this is Papi.

[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.080]
Oh, yeah, good.

[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.260]
You all pepped up now.

[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:08.560]
Papi.

[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.080]
All right.

[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.100]
Wipp them into shape, George.

[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:12.600]
Adaboy.

[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:18.560]
Listen, the next time they have a landing, what you got to do is get Joe and Sally to do a pre-landing show.

[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:18.960]
Yeah.

[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.160]
That way you'll hang onto the audience and they can do two hours before the plane lands.

[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:23.600]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.700]
While they're still drafting.

[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.860]
Speaking of Joe, is he still in California?

[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:27.600]
Beats me.

[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.600]
I can't believe they sent him out there just to get an announcement on the, uh,

[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.600]
I gotta tell you something.

[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.820]
This radio station, I hate to say this.

[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.780]
We lose more money on this sports department.

[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:42.260]
They fleeced them out of more bogus trips, out of more, although they did do a great job tonight.

[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.340]
I mean, that was good.

[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:47.980]
But I mean, just it's most of the time they go on all these bogus and basketball games in Hawaii.

[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:48.380]
Yeah.

[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.760]
And in Colorado Springs and plays that haven't been invented yet.

[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.120]
I mean, they probably spend millions of dollars every year on crap for the sports department here.

[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.680]
They're just a shocking mind bog.

[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.520]
I mean, he's only going to gain probably about five minutes ahead of everybody else when they make the announcement anyway.

[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.880]
Well, he could be in the studio.

[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.420]
We want to be on top of it.

[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:05.760]
Okay.

[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.660]
Are he sure?

[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.300]
Are he probably in the hallway right now?

[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.600]
I spoke to Elaine just before that space shuttle.

[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.060]
They went a little screaming match and all.

[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.560]
She says, I want to be on top of it.

[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.220]
And the George came running out in the hall.

[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.920]
Don't make these decisions.

[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.740]
Is that Disney?

[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:19.740]
No, Disney.

[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.040]
He's not even here today.

[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.520]
He's on another, uh, he's on another busman's holiday.

[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:24.700]
Him too?

[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.560]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.740]
On the other six day vacation.

[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.220]
Well, all I can say is Disney's a douchebag.

[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:31.760]
Okay.

[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:32.980]
And I'm out of material.

[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:33.740]
See you.

[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:35.520]
1156.

[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:36.840]
Now, let's see.

[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.720]
We only got time for one or two calls before the top of the hour.

[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.380]
What do you do then?

[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.980]
It says, don't ever feel obligated to take the calls in the order in which they come.

[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.160]
Finally, remember, this is showbiz.

[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.620]
You're ultimately the person who can make or break a good talent, George.

[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.480]
Give him or her the absolute best selection of callers.

[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.680]
And we all win.

[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:57.360]
Right?

[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.020]
Uh-huh.

[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:00.800]
It's 1156.

[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.840]
Well, I feel a lot better.

[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.560]
Maybe I don't think I had anything to do with it.

[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.560]
But, um, I guess we all felt that way the first hour and a half.

[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.660]
Till that space shuttle landing.

[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.540]
That's what got me awake.

[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.580]
That got my juices flowing.

[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.100]
Highly up.

[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.160]
A meal.

[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:14.520]
Yeah.

[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.840]
But it'll speak to you, sir.

[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.220]
Likewise.

[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.900]
George came on the line there to try and pet me up.

[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:19.840]
But I don't think it worked.

[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:20.320]
It didn't work.

[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:20.840]
It's obvious.

[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.280]
Well, we'll do the best we can.

[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:23.640]
Yeah.

[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:24.660]
That would do it.

[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.060]
Hey, uh, you know what, you know what the part of it that did it for me?

[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:27.640]
Which one?

[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.760]
That was what did it.

[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.480]
Oh, you land it.

[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.600]
It laying at the nose.

[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.360]
When she, when they put Elaine's nose on that runway, man, people were going nuts.

[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.520]
Even the people from CNN were in shock.

[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:45.320]
Any or another request or anything, but I want to hear the, uh, sent the Frank Sinatra, Nancy Reagan bit.

[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.060]
Okay.

[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:46.680]
Okay.

[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.100]
As they say in junior high school, sir, you got it.

[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.740]
And I believe you're God.

[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:51.600]
Yep.

[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:57.320]
And I want to call my sister Carmen and my brother Ray, psychotic, neurotic douchebag.

[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:57.720]
Okay.

[00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:58.720]
Those are the best kind.

[00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.680]
Let's see you.

[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.080]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:00.440]
All right.

[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.340]
Well, you want to see your Frankie Panky.

[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.680]
Now, where the hell am I going to find that?

[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.480]
Is it back on that thing there now?

[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.520]
Is it up on that thing up there?

[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.220]
Could be.

[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.840]
It might be.

[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.560]
It is.

[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.780]
Where the hell up there?

[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.000]
Sir, I got news for you.

[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.400]
I hope you got a lot of hernia insurance.

[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:24.680]
Bio Records presents Old Blue Eyes on an unauthorized new album called Frankie Panky.

[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.040]
When I'm around there, she just can't say no.

[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.620]
That's why the first lady has a trim.

[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.620]
Yes, Frank Sinatra is back.

[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.840]
And this time he's in the Lincoln bedroom.

[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.780]
And now your end is near.

[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:49.980]
And so I draw the bedroom curtain.

[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.320]
Frank Sinatra, the legend, the latch.

[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.320]
Run and then seek, run and then seek.

[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.200]
One was snapped while the others and seek.

[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.600]
This album is so hot even the regains are smoking.

[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:11.700]
To be, to be, to be, to be.

[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.600]
You'll get bitchcraft.

[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.180]
It was a very good rare.

[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.440]
And of course.

[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.740]
And then you go and spoil it all by marrying someone stupid like run Reagan.

[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.820]
Let me see your moon.

[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.300]
And let me send away the guards.

[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.380]
You'll get a check out of Frankie Panky, available now on busybody records and tapes.

[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:40.480]
I did her my way.

[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.520]
159 at W.I.D.

[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.580]
Well, must have been an exciting night for Mike last night.

[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:55.460]
You see how Kami looks today, relaxed, just not the usual hyper over emotional, overstimulated jackass that usually is.

[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.200]
Very calm like he finally got lucky, okay?

[00:34:58.900 --> 00:34:59.920]
Check his hand, George.

[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.500]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.580]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.560]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:30.560]

[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:30.620]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:30.620]

[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:30.680]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:30.800]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:30.860]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:30.860]

[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:30.860]

[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:32.940]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:33.300]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.360]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.340]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:38.340]

[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:40.780]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.140]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.240]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:46.460]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:51.400]
I'm so tired.

[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.060]
Freeze out of the way.

[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.260]
N-O-L-Y.

[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.380]
and that's what I was thinking

[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:01.380]

[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.500]
many of the old sounding callers

[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.940]
on the air less they qualify

[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.220]
you know something

[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.220]
I didn't realize that but Steve

[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.480]
Zimmerman or a brilliant engineer

[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.620]
with the shiny head

[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.260]
Steve has already put the new

[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.520]
thing on here and it's we got

[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.500]
a little card on there that

[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.580]
temporarily it's another

[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.340]
Palm Beach line is still working

[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.960]
now but it's like temporary in other words you've been reduced from permanent to

[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.340]
like just uh...

[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.400]
barely hang on

[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.700]
will remain active till early monday morning when the eight hundred number takes

[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.000]
over boys that can be can you imagine how that's gonna broaden the right then

[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.680]
will probably have to like five more sheets

[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:39.180]
of instructions on how to screen the calls for our dot oboe bird aboard ops

[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.240]
for example

[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.860]
callers should sound young and energetic all right let's go to four-letter hello

[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:46.960]
on the old

[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.120]
now you don't qualify

[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.120]
he sounded young

[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.200]
not too old

[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.100]
too old sir

[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:57.100]
and also he violated the b no speaker phones are bad lines you hear a

[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.020]
muffled that was

[00:36:58.620 --> 00:36:59.360]
no deal

[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.160]
no way sir not on our not according to our new procedures

[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.560]
their point must be articulated in a concise manner

[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.300]
no multi-part questions long rambling questions or long preambles

[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.920]
in other words get to the point

[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:13.960]
and

[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.000]
you know i'm saying

[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.240]
so probably an easy way

[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.360]
and easy way to determine if they qualify for that part of our criteria would

[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.520]
be to ask them much of the exactly

[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.540]
no callers over now here's an interesting one no callers over sixty five

[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.180]
on less they've vehemently disagree with the host or guest that sounds like

[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.000]
the contrive kind of thing they do on the light bulb

[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.760]
or express an absolutely outrageous opinion

[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:45.440]
callers between the age of twenty five and sixty four are optimal callers under

[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.780]
eighteen must be extraordinarily articulate

[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.640]
never air more than one caller eighteen

[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.140]
what never air more than one caller under eighteen in a row

[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.560]
who the hell is he think he's kidding

[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.400]
now how do we know how old they are in other words you have to guess that

[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.420]
we don't ask them how old they are do we

[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.080]
he not even listening to me

[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.540]
in the pain that

[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.800]
is it like what he's screening

[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.320]
uh...

[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:14.840]
uh...

[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:16.540]
uh...

[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.480]
how do we know how all they are we don't ask them how old they are

[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.220]
we might ask them their shoe size but we don't ask a so what is this all

[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.640]
the stupid thing about the ages

[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:32.380]

i don't come from a baseball town

[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:28.280]
let me ask you question when you buy a season ticket they give you a break

[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:29.480]
course

[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.040]
more casino football you know twenty eight months with a night you go to sixteen

[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.760]
well that's because there's only a limited number of games they got to give you

[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.600]
a break in baseball probably not much

[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.140]
you know that percentage they give you are

[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:39.560]
no

[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.400]

the other night with your little buddy costus

[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:01.580]
no

[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.560]
that was the most incredible thing i've ever seen you mean the one where he said

[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.840]
about michael jordan's mother and father and it was his wife

[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.120]

[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:13.980]

for a happy tall rock around the locker room

[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:21.120]
and he does and he does have his nose up all the super jocks but so i guess it

[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.780]
kind of fits

[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.300]
no problem as little as he is running around sticking his nose and everybody's

[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.640]
business but i couldn't believe that when he when he when he says you know

[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.100]
here's michael jordan sitting with his mother and michael says that's my wife

[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.380]
and he looks at her

[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.740]
and says oh it must be the hat i mean let's insult the bitch twice yeah right

[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.540]
believeable

[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.020]
i could believe it

[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.740]
