[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.300]
Well, I drive up to Tonsamay, do truck in coast to coast.

[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.720]
I like my rig, I like the rule, but it's not what I love most.

[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.340]
There's a gal I'll left in Fresco, a sweet young fine name rose,

[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.980]
and the best dang fine about her. She lets me wear her clothes.

[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.000]
Well, I'm proud to be country transvestite.

[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.780]
And I love the world, the girls close all day.

[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.040]
Homemade!

[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.320]
Lazy bra, a frilly blast, a silken negligent.

[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.840]
Now I'm still a macho tough guy in a hoop you'll understand.

[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.640]
I was born with a big black mustache and a six back in my hand.

[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.200]
But when I go out for a moment, I do it well for twins.

[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.800]
All worse, strapless evening gown and a nose gay on my wrist.

[00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.740]
Yes, I'm proud to be country transvestite.

[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.880]
And I love the world, the girls close all day.

[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.060]
Homemade!

[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.740]
I close my lips, tease my heart and sleep and lost a ring.

[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.280]
Now I like the way I'm living. Don't just be by my clothes.

[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.740]
I'm an old mercant, he man, I love legs, can he hold?

[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.340]
So don't look at me funny or I'll punch out your lines.

[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.160]
And the last thing you'll remember is a trucker in fishnet tides.

[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.680]
Yes, I'm proud to be country transvestite.

[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.780]
Travestite!

[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.780]
And I love the world, the girls close all day.

[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.000]
Homemade!

[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.540]
Painted lips, padded hips, my shaved legs on display.

[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.220]
Yes, I'm proud to be country transvestite.

[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.800]
And I love the world, the girls close all day.

[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.360]
Stouled in muse, something views, well it sends us all my way.

[00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.100]
Yes, I'm proud to be country transvestite.

[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.760]
But I guess the planet holds on here and hope I don't get a run.

[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.160]
You know, I hate that, I hate that. You know when you chip your nail?

[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.500]
Nothing's like so far, it's just terrible.

[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.900]
I would take some of it, but it's not me.

[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.560]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.860]
I could use a bubble bath, I really could.

[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.280]
And I'm going to go to the shop, I am.

[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.840]
I wasn't starting to play that because I see Randy as playing a thing tonight.

[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.640]
Cut your music, why do they have such fanatical fans?

[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.060]
She asks, I'm sure you're very concerned about that.

[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.600]
Guests include the program director of Kiss Radio.

[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.720]
As in Kiss this, the Nashville Network and interviews with Marie Osmond,

[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.200]
Larry Gattlin and Genie C. Riley, and many more.

[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.540]
Ooh boy, maybe Randy's going back to Kiss.

[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.880]
You wake up in the morning early,

[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.660]
Wake up in the morning and listen to a man nearly the king in the morning.

[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.640]
He's so funny.

[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.980]
He's the righteous who he's good.

[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.000]
But the day they ride way they baby,

[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.460]
with the doctor's data on the radio.

[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.980]
Me, he's the king in the morning,

[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.920]
nothing me says to the morning.

[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.000]
He's got the music news, it's fuzzy weather baby.

[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.280]
He has to keep a person all together.

[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.560]
Me, he's the king in the morning,

[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.060]
nothing nice and wake up in the sunshine.

[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.280]
Me, he's the king in the morning.

[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.780]
Hey, I'm maybe you got to go to work.

[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.500]
Me, he's the king.

[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500]
So if you've got a listen to something,

[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.740]
no.

[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.740]
Oh, oh, wait a minute.

[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.800]
How are you going to let it go?

[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.780]
Finally, the baby has returned to the dance floor.

[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.200]
Oh, I don't care what my father says.

[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.020]
I want you to hold me.

[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.660]
But now she's got a brand new partner.

[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.820]
Be quiet, can't you see I'm trying to use the phone?

[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.120]
Yes, it's Jennifer Gray and Pee Wee Herman.

[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.120]
Together again for the first time in nerdy dancing.

[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.620]
Hey Jennifer, what?

[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.560]
How about my big shoes on?

[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.660]
I know.

[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.720]
Oh, you stepped on my budget, jerk.

[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.320]
I know you are, but what am I?

[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.520]
Pee Wee, you always got to be so obnoxious?

[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.660]
Obnoxious.

[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.840]
Hey, that's the word of a dance.

[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.400]
No more than a movie.

[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.340]
It's an excuse to release another soundtrack album.

[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.740]
That's so funny at the back of the last nerdy dancing.

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.480]
Now, showing it a playhouse near you will cry.

[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.420]
T-Race is a different, more of one of these things.

[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.520]
Different, more of one.

[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.360]
Okay, that's a good point.

[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.140]
Come, drop me down the street.

[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.940]
Bigger, they use these markers.

[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.260]
Cos' they got real bad things.

[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.760]
Hey, hey, but old monkeys.

[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.660]
The children don't run as old.

[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.520]
They say we smell candy funky.

[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.800]
And they're all stupid and grown.

[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.680]
We make money from reels.

[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.860]
And I keep a baby.

[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.680]
But I just wanna stay home.

[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.020]
Fix a nice dresser team with no women.

[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.120]
Hey, hey, but old monkeys.

[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.540]
And here all who's in our hair.

[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.740]
This week, here on the TV.

[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.720]
Next week, America.

[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.320]
You gotta enjoy that gildonism.

[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.940]
It's the mug.

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.740]
Day morning meal, rudges show.

[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.280]
I'm set before.

[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.320]
Okay, that's great.

[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.520]
1118 at WID.

[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.420]
You know you're still there?

[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.020]
Yeah.

[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.700]
What happened?

[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.380]
I don't know.

[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.920]
You thought I was West Palm or something.

[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.940]
Well, where are you?

[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.260]
Boca, I said.

[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.200]
Well, it's close enough.

[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.240]
Yeah, what ever happened to stand major?

[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.100]
Whatever happened to him, he's alive and well in plantation.

[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.740]
And life goes on.

[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.160]
Is he working at a station?

[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.780]
For Mike Wayman, I gotta sign a little autograph here.

[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.140]
When you're a big star, when you weigh 450 pounds.

[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.780]
I heard that last night.

[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.320]
The only station you'll see stand at is probably Amico over there.

[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.040]
I'm Brad Boulevard.

[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.340]
But he's doing okay.

[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.940]
I heard you were mentioned on Larry King.

[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.780]
Yeah, you didn't hear the tape?

[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.760]
No, I heard it like around 450 pounds.

[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.700]
But we have it on tape.

[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.300]
Do you wanna hear it?

[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.020]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.000]
Now, will you hold on?

[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.500]
Yeah, sure.

[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.600]
Then you can come back and come.

[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.460]
I'll put you on hold again.

[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.640]
You're probably used to it by now.

[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.960]
Hold on a second.

[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.640]
Ashford and Simpson locked.

[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.140]
Well, I've done that twice.

[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.100]
That's three mistakes.

[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.820]
That's for that old bitch that called before.

[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.920]
Have a great life, Mike.

[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.040]
And, uh, butch up a little.

[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.780]
He's your Rogers.

[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.260]
Oh, he must be jealous.

[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.660]
He's jealous, eh?

[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.440]
I guess.

[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.700]
You know what they did today?

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.240]
They said anybody here in Miami who's owed money

[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.280]
by Larry King turned your headlight on.

[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.660]
I'll tell you what, I look like this whole damn town

[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.620]
was going to the funeral.

[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.620]
I get, he's, I feel sorry for Neil.

[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.800]
Oh, yeah?

[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.320]
Yeah, well, if you knew the whole story, he said.

[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.560]
But, yeah, he doesn't make a lot of money.

[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.260]
And he's been in that market a long time.

[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.360]
And he really would rather, probably, he'd rather write on his horses.

[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.220]
So he gets kind of sad.

[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.640]
But he's been jealous the long time.

[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.720]
I haven't seen him in, uh, what is this 1990?

[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:42.240]
The last time I saw him was in 1970.

[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.740]
I saw him in 1970.

[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:48.940]

[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.980]
And then he called me the day that he admitted he was a homosexual

[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.340]
on the year he called me to thank me because I had had

[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.420]
Sergeant Maclubick on the air the night before.

[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.380]
And he had heard Sergeant Maclubick.

[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.680]
His name is Matt Lovitch.

[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.520]
Matt Lovitch Larry.

[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.680]
Since passed on with AIDS, uh, encouraged people

[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.580]
who were homosexuals to come out of the closet.

[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.000]
And Neil had heard the show and came out of the closet the next day.

[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.980]
On his own radio show and then called me to thank me for having Maclubick on.

[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.580]
And it's the last time I've ever seen him or schooled him to him.

[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.200]
And then I've heard some people like yourself saying he does this.

[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.520]
But I feel very sorry for people who are kind of caught in that local web of jealousy.

[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.700]
And I've heard he weighed like 400 pounds.

[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.660]
But I haven't seen him.

[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.240]
You know, the last time I saw him I'd say weighed 350.

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.020]
Okay, that's it.

[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.780]
Now, are you a homosexual now?

[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.480]
Uh, today.

[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.240]
Oh, this is Mr. Radio?

[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.080]
Oh, my God.

[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.780]
We went to the Wondery Hang-On so long.

[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.880]
That's Mr. Radio.

[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.400]
21 after 11 at W.O.D.

[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.580]
And we have an open line in Broward, 524, 9463.

[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.900]
Maybe pansy would be a live up to that.

[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.100]
We have an open line at Palm Beach, 655.

[00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.920]
I can't believe it.

[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.280]
Now, listen, you always call from Daytona.

[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:02.920]
He wasn't called from Maboka.

[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.120]
He called from Daytona Beach and lied about it.

[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.780]
You make a sick Mr. Radio, okay?

[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.740]
Get some seats, dear.

[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.980]
Get the party on the beach.

[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.500]
What's the matter, dear?

[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.280]
Oh, Grandpa.

[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.780]
Men can be such...

[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.980]
Oh, oh, here, honey.

[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.760]
Why don't you try some of this nice hot Luther Campbell suit?

[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.400]
Luther Campbell suit?

[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.000]
But Grandpa, we just had two live stews last night.

[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.700]
I know, but this is...

[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.160]
What is different, that song?

[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.020]
It's got the whole alphabet in it.

[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.960]
See the little letters?

[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.800]
Hey, you're right.

[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.860]
Look, there's an F.

[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.520]
And a U.

[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.440]
Get the nut.

[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.340]
Try it, honey.

[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.520]
Now, it's completely tasteless.

[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.180]
Why would anyone eat this?

[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.020]
Why?

[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.520]
It'll be so hungry, that's why.

[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.700]
Luther Campbell's funky suits.

[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.600]
Homey Cooked Tays So Vunky.

[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.600]
You'll be tempted to eat it with a poop.

[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.220]
No, I won't let you shut now.

[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.640]
I'll say it for you.

[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.800]
Mmm, bad, mmm, bad.

[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.280]
Luther Campbell's the star.

[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.660]
Oh, word.

[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.760]
Okay, 1126.

[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.040]
Wow, we're doing it.

[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.960]
Let's just put that on Endos loop and go home.

[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.880]
Let's try Tamarack.

[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.440]
Neil.

[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.300]
I was at Pompo-no last night making my weekly donation.

[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.040]
Yeah.

[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.500]
And I ended up with a spa report.

[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.980]
I think week is my word at Pompo-no this year.

[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.140]
That's W-E-A-K.

[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.120]
I've been real week.

[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.300]
I haven't even come close this year.

[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.220]
I just don't know the screen reader banana.

[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.180]
Do you remember hidden stale raceway?

[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.480]
I've never been there, but a new hamstring, man.

[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.620]
Yeah, rocking ham.

[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.180]
I've been there many, many a time.

[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.660]
There's Pugboy and Bucky Day.

[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.960]
Bucky Day, that's right.

[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.080]
In a desperate drive.

[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.320]
Bobby Huntress.

[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.340]
Do you remember General Washington?

[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.820]
There's Beckwith.

[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.480]
What was his name?

[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:52.860]
What?

[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.640]
No, Beckwith.

[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.040]
There was Ted Wing.

[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.740]
Ted Wing, Alex Winger.

[00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.300]
Uh, where we go?

[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.760]
Do you know how much the audience hates this when we do it?

[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.700]
That's why I like to do it.

[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.960]
How about Steve Warrington?

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.360]
It's called, Steve Warrington's good.

[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.000]
He's that whole warrington family man.

[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.880]
They can drive a horse.

[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.420]
How about, you know what Larry King said?

[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.040]
I'd rather be riding the harness horse.

[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.720]
That's what Larry said.

[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.580]
How about, um, Green Mountain raceway?

[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.380]
In Vermont.

[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.800]
Longsons closed, innit?

[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.360]
Roamson, Scalhegan.

[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.180]
What?

[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.060]
Scalhegan downs in Maine.

[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.180]
No, I'd never been to Maine.

[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.620]
They got those great tracks like Cumberland and Scarborough.

[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.000]
Right, they do a, uh, 235 mile up there.

[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.440]
Yeah.

[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.500]
The, uh, but I have a spire report for you.

[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.080]
Okay.

[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.040]
Alan Finkelson's son.

[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:35.700]
Mike.

[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:41.200]
Fell off of a golf cart while working in valley parking.

[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.760]
Might knock some sense into him.

[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.000]
No, it knocked money into his pocket.

[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.320]
He's on work as compensation.

[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.160]
When was this?

[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.680]
Uh, it happened last week.

[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.220]
I saw him at the track left.

[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:51.960]
You saw him?

[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:52.600]
Yes.

[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:53.560]
Saw.

[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.120]
Yeah.

[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.860]
And he was complaining about the fact that he can't go back to work in valley parking.

[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.140]
Mike's always complaining because he never, he hasn't cashed a ticket in 20 years.

[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.460]
No, he hasn't.

[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.280]
I can't find the Hank Goldberg cart, isn't that enough to really may have frost your ass a little bit?

[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.360]
How about a Pine Hollow Stood Fond?

[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.240]
Is that frost you?

[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.120]
Who?

[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.960]
Pine Hollow Stood Fond.

[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.600]
Don't know it.

[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.180]
Martin Finder.

[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.240]
Yeah.

[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.720]
Harold Dancer Jr.

[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.240]
Yeah.

[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.340]
Dr. J.

[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.200]
Dr. J.

[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.840]
I just thought I'd sneak him in there.

[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:28.660]
Okay.

[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:37.640]
I would like to take this opportunity to call two of my friends, Oscar and Joey, who will be playing rocket ball this afternoon.

[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.140]
Yeah.

[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:38.900]
Dooshbags.

[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:39.640]
Okay.

[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.600]
And I look forward to seeing you with the track.

[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.400]
I'm coming up tonight.

[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.660]
I'm coming up there tonight.

[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.020]
I'm playing El Ambaro.

[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.180]
Stay the hell away from me.

[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.500]
Okay.

[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.120]
Go away.

[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:47.820]
But I go down here.

[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.280]
Thanks for your money for Camilla's house.

[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:50.200]
Now just stay away.

[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.500]
Don't come anywhere near me.

[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.920]
Just to stay up there at your little table.

[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.520]
And Shmoos with Alan, the assistant major, de up there and leave me alone.

[00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.520]
Hey, I got a great idea of why.

[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.440]
He's like a kisser that all I got to do is see him.

[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.140]
And immediately I just can't pick my nose.

[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.060]
Why don't you have a race up there for Camilla's house dinner?

[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.680]
Well, I'm going to talk to Alan tonight.

[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.000]
A Finkelson tonight is about doing something for Camilla's house.

[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.500]
You're all well.

[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.980]
We'll all make donations and go up there and get a night of racing.

[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.800]
I got news for her.

[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.020]
They could build their whole new building with the I've left at Pompoon, already this season.

[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.700]
Don't be left at Pompoon, though.

[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.020]
You bet.

[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.200]
What about wheeling downs?

[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.220]
Good luck.

[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:23.860]
Good bye.

[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:24.360]
See you.

[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.200]
Another hyalya call?

[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.080]
Hello there.

[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:27.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.360]
Five hours of sports talk.

[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.100]
All right.

[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:31.740]
Here we go.

[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.360]
In other words, you haven't even heard what Hans is going to do yet.

[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.780]
You're already passing judgment.

[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.820]
Which is right next to passing gas.

[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.780]
Is he going to stay on sports talk now?

[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:40.340]
Or is he just...

[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:40.520]
No.

[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.980]
Well, I find his own show and he never appears there anymore.

[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.800]
Well, I wouldn't say he'd never appear there, but he's not going to be on that show.

[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.640]
Okay.

[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.720]
He's got his own thing.

[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.240]
They got their thing and he's got his thing and never the twang shall meet.

[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.100]
You're going to make him promise not to talk sports.

[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.140]
No, he's going to talk some sports, but he's a well-rounded guy.

[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.380]
And if you've seen him lately, I know what I'm talking about.

[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.040]
I'm very around.

[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.080]
Now, Hans is a fun guy.

[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.620]
He'll develop a thing.

[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.980]
Oh, speaking of Steve, you'll never guess who is New Best.

[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.260]
Well, let me ask you this question before.

[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.620]
I don't want to try to sway you, but who'd you rather hear from me to a level?

[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.960]
Randy Martin or Hank Goldberg?

[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.220]
Stan Major.

[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:14.680]
Okay.

[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:15.500]
Okay.

[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.120]
Now, what is it about the Steve?

[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.960]
His New Best Buddy in the World.

[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.280]
Besides Rick Ciderman?

[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.460]
Alex Bennett.

[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:22.360]
Yeah.

[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.760]
Yeah, they met up there and while they share this one contempt, you know, anybody who's hostile

[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.160]
toward me is Steve's Best Buddy.

[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.280]
That's his whole thing in life.

[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.620]
Rick Ciderman and Bob Coons, and Ellis Ruben.

[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.580]
That's the only guy that he knows that I like and it likes me as Norm Kent.

[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.360]
And that's his new motivation for why he's out to get Rick Riley.

[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:42.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.320]
He's available.

[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.360]
You know, I'll be honest.

[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.260]
Did I punch him up at all yesterday?

[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.860]
I think for about 30 seconds on a way home.

[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.320]
And what was he doing yesterday?

[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:52.960]
Open phone.

[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.920]
I don't remember what it was, but whatever it was, it was so terminal.

[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.900]
I just punched it out.

[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.180]
I told you the novelty wears off very fast, okay?

[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.580]
Now, now he's grasping at the fact that Rick Riley stole Alex Bennett's job.

[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.120]
Yeah.

[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:05.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:10.220]
Well, he stole somebody's job over there at FTL.

[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.480]
He brought in fact, he did it in the most devious way of all.

[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.960]
He brought in his own sponsors and he blew somebody out.

[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.920]
Whoever was doing midday because they moved Mike Roberts up to 10 to 2.

[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.080]
So somebody got blown out to make room for him.

[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.380]
But he's still making $250 a year.

[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:22.960]
At least.

[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.620]
Maybe half a million.

[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.420]
That's what he said.

[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.160]
I said, how's it doing working on commission?

[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.800]
Hey, you said, let's say you make $250,000 a year.

[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.680]
Oh, God.

[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.780]
Well, you can't teach an old dog new tricks, sir.

[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.480]
That's true.

[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.460]
Have a great life.

[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:37.900]
Brut load.

[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.280]
11.40 cents.

[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.820]
11.47 at WIOD being a mobile in Miami.

[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.280]
Hello.

[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:48.900]
Hello, Neil.

[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.400]
How are you?

[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:49.780]
Great.

[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.020]
I have a couple of spy reports.

[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:51.640]
Okay.

[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:58.200]
I was up on the I-75 and just caught some Steve King yesterday, his big five to six hour.

[00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:58.640]
Yeah.

[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.800]
He comes back from the news and he's screaming to his, I guess, his producer, whoever, he was screaming.

[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.960]
He said, what are you looking at me that way?

[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.240]
You could hear every other word Steve was saying apparently his mic cord was being disconnected or something

[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.540]
Hmm, and he was just yelling you know maybe they're tying Steve cords again

[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.240]
Yeah, and he just they are another technical difficulty

[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.920]
It was a major well good luck to him a little. It's a real bush league operation

[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.360]
But the guys got to make a living. He's got a family to support

[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:29.840]
He's got to go out there and sell those spots and beg everybody to support his sponsors and the plead and and I was I don't mind supporting Steve

[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.780]
Spots is but I don't think leather Weinstein is what I'm ready for yet

[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.800]
No, not yet, not yet. You know, I won't enjoy it in supporting those

[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.740]
Well actually any of Steve's sponsors actually

[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:46.060]
But and then I was listening to Rick and sides and he had a a guy talking about pirated music and Evan call

[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.800]
Who did Evan one of their own Evan? I got to apologize to Evan

[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.940]
He was over at the remote at specs on Wednesday, and I didn't recognize him

[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.960]
He's got this funky little go teen out and he looks so bizarre

[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.840]
Well, he had what you up Evan? Yeah, he said

[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.680]
He's an assistant manager at a record store and being in the industry

[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.680]
He knew quite a bit of what they were talking about I didn't pay for the beer. I'm glad you found that one

[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.800]
You isn't at great. Why feel a lot better now?

[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.460]

Before we let that finish can I ask a simple question what the hell were they thinking about when they put that man on a year here?

[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.920]

What's not working? What about when I'm doing wrong here?

[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.440]
Well I have to stop that and figure it out. Figure it out and stop that

[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.480]
That's all overwhelming. All right we get some calls

[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.920]

[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.060]
Daniel

[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.980]
How listen I turn those Steve Caves to hear what he sounds like yesterday

[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.380]
And the first color guess who it was

[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.260]
No, I heard Gilbert

[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.780]
Oh no

[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.680]
Yes, they're sucking up to them saying how great they are how happy they are to the back now

[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.020]
I want to tell you something if I always told you about watch out for the chronics

[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.240]
There are a bunch of phony but suckers and they fly around like butterfly

[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.600]
I create like a bumblebee they flip from one perch to another

[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.000]
I hope they're pollinating everywhere those two of the biggest phonies

[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.440]
They were on with Rick and suds in the beginning doing their little uh joint at the hip routine on the phone

[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.720]
And sucking around with them and then they came over here and they ruined our Wednesday lunches

[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.600]
And now they're all of a sudden sucking around over there. Yeah, they were they were basher Rick and suds two things

[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.280]
They called them Steve Kane Jr. or whatever

[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:50.100]
Unbelivable Steve Kane said yesterday is that he told everybody well who was listen one person

[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.920]
That uh you really oh I guess you must have been the one

[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:58.360]
He said that you really don't like Rick and suds you just give him positive things

[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.640]
Well, you know, it's really interesting that he makes those things up because I have never I haven't spoken

[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.440]
To Steve since they came here. I've the only time I've spoken to him right here on the air

[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.880]
I've never said that. It's totally untrue and it's another if he if he said that which all I have is your word

[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.680]
It's another one of his lies just like just like the thing about the Disney telling us we can't put any callers on who'd mention his name

[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.700]
Steve, why do you make up so much BS? Let's let's send Steve a big shovel, okay?

[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.520]
I'll say what he said he said if

[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:30.380]
If somebody asked you and you were to answer honestly on a scale of one to ten you being a ten how

[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.540]
Rick and suds are doing and you were to be totally honest you would say no more than a one

[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.040]
Oh, yeah, that's when they got a four seven in the last book

[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.020]
What was Steve's last number here a three five with some very embarrassing demographics?

[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:47.100]
I know Steve Kane is listening. He is totally boring and that'll be the last time I ever listen to that

[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:53.040]
Now you'll turn it on again. No, I swear I won't know Rick and suds are great. I agree with that. Okay. Okay

[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:58.800]
But just keep making it up Steve just keep desperately flailing around trying to cause that big controversy because

[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.700]
It just ain't happening. I mean like I said I wish him all the luck in the world and I his his success or lack of it

[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.300]
It is gonna have nothing to do with Rick and suds or this station

[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.620]
I mean the only thing this station has got to do with it is we've given him more promotion than over there

[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.480]
Which is nothing because they haven't got two nickels to rub together at FTL

[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.000]
But that's about it. So we certainly can't blame us for we've given him a big send-off

[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.640]
But uh jeez you got to make your own thing you got to do your own show

[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.120]
You can't try to siphon off from the rest of the world forever. You have to uh stat in your own two feet be a man

[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.600]
Like Marlon Brando said and we still want to know what the Helenos about it United States

[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.140]
Has no quarrel with the Iraqi people

[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.760]
Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator and with his aggression

[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.940]
Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait

[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.400]
Just the way it's going to be

[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.280]
Up to his head and blow away this key

[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.280]
We want you to be on fire to my head

[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.960]
And get down where I'm going to stand

[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.160]
And I'm going to stand

[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.640]
And I'll be the champion in the city

[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.540]
And he's going to pay

[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.740]
Saddam Hussein

[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.900]
Saddam Hussein

[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.540]
Double table one

[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:02.140]
And the cubs get out of the top of the eight and still leave

[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:07.340]
For the three okay, that was a meds game. I just mentioned that okay here. He calm down

[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.480]

He went in the back for a break there. Yeah, instead of playing the horses he rode up

[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.240]
Mm-hmm

[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.720]
Well, I don't tell you that was a good idea. Wish it was down there to put my life on yesterday

[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:36.340]
I'm never to do with that. Oh, no, but it was a good idea. Yeah. Well, we're gonna do it. Yeah, good enough. Have a great life

[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.080]
Wow

[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:45.700]
109 at W.I.O.D. What is all that stuff? Do we have any mail by the way? Plantation. Hi Neil. Hi

[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.620]
Who is my anniversary of the day? So I called Rick and Sud show and they said

[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:55.980]
I was trying to decide between the melting pot and the armadillo cafe. Yeah, Rick said go to the melting pot

[00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:00.040]
I think it's because he lives in Coral Springs. Mm-hmm. And Sud says go to

[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:07.680]
Armadillo and I heard Armadillo on your show so we decided to go to the armadillo and it was outstanding. It's outrageous

[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:14.440]
Oh, it's great. It's our guess mix. It was a good night. What'd you have? I had the seafood Diablo

[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.560]
Mm-hmm

[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.840]
And it was outstanding and we had the black and white soup

[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.920]
And we had my husband had the yellow tail snapper

[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.020]
Mm-hmm. Oh

[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:33.400]
It's terrible to go there because it's one of those deserts. Did you have the desert? No, I didn't have any room for dinner. We had that mocha crembrouli. Oh

[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.020]
man

[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:41.940]
I couldn't I could not force another thing and we had the the nachos before I had in the soup and then we had the appetizers and that was funny

[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.760]
I gave you lots of food. That would

[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:49.300]
But no way I couldn't eat all that. I want to go back and try salad and dessert. Well, try that when you try

[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.940]
dessert try that mocha crembrouli. It's got like a real thick crust on it

[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:57.520]
In fact next week maran's gonna go out and put some of that crust from the mocha crembrouli and somebody's pants

[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.000]
But it's tremendous

[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.420]
But don't tell Rick. I won

[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.880]
Because I just want him to know that such has a better suggestion. Some other

[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.480]
What are both great? Yeah, but I live close

[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.580]
Being in plantation Armadillo was closer and I was not disappointed at all

[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.420]
From the outside you'd never in a million years you would never know was anything there

[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.680]
It's just like that kind of Yahoo Davy

[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.300]
Hickley like I need to go get some muffler parts

[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.120]
Right, right while you're pulling up your horse up to the hitch and post

[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.020]
That's right. This I'd heard Randy mentioned last night that

[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.320]
She could get a memo about how much was collected for come know this

[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.520]
It's actually set on the air how much you had collected great well good for her

[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.200]
Yeah, she's getting her peas and cheese down

[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.880]
We're working extra hard on it because she'll probably be over there pretty soon. So

[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.560]
We're doing our best. Oh, Neil. It'll be fun to have Hank though. Yeah

[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.600]
But I like to read the article about Rick and the

[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.200]
I've just been perusing. Yes. I just been

[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.460]
Picking little spots and realize what a nice guy he was who said that the Harold

[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.960]
He talked about it. I mean he has some some personal things in it. Oh no, and that respect the out, but don't let it fool you

[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:12.060]
But I do agree that he has gotten a little bit less of a homer listening to him on the radio can be

[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.460]
While he's uh suds is gonna loan him his compass

[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:22.120]
Which direction should he go exactly where is that ball have a great weekend thank okay 114

[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.560]

Can walk in more classics in a row on 97 GTR you don't play the man in cisterns

[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:39.200]
Oh, man, there's some heavy-duty stuff in there and here's one that doesn't even have a label on it. It's probably blank

[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:47.420]
Get ready with your finger on that button for loaded-elf Florida. Hello. Hello Larry first time caller. Hi listening on WIOD 16

[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:52.520]
My means my my old station. Yeah, your old station two two things

[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.980]
I wanted to get your comments on Neil Rogers both professionally and personally

[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.840]
Well, I got to tell you this

[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.440]
This is people will never believe this this cart hasn't even got a label on it

[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:08.120]
And I had no idea what it was. It's in the bottom of the thing. There were all this GTR stuff and there it is

[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:15.580]
It's almost like a an old man and also how would you go about getting into talk radio and I'll hang up in with someone called earlier

[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.140]
I haven't heard Neil in years

[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.300]
I have no idea

[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:24.020]
I remember the time when I remember the time when he came on the air and came out of the closet

[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:28.620]
Yeah, and then I left my army shortly after that. I have not heard him since

[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.780]
He does a kind of shock value kind of it's not my kind of I'm told he does it a shock value

[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.520]
He showed it, you know, what can I say next to shock you and that's not my kind of speed

[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.500]
As a workable. I haven't heard him in

[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.540]

I know it's a holiday and president Bush is vacationing and Kenny bunk port main enjoying the day off from the White House

Daniel, are you doing you'll never guess who's on the phone now

[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.780]
This is pretty a heavy duty pretty heavy

[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:57.800]
First of all, you're shouting okay, we can hear you I know you're emotional and you're trying to flex your muscles

[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:03.220]
You do want to be yeah, I know how it is, but just relax take a deep breath. We got lots of time

[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:10.240]
Okay, okay, let's just aimalyze the entire situation now and fight it exactly if you guys are as disloyal and uh, I just

[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.100]
Like to say one thing you saw it. I didn't call Ian call by himself alone

[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.960]
You know, I didn't know about you know by himself alone

[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:17.640]
What?

[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.860]
Wait a minute hold on a second. What line is out quick?

[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.240]
She's gone oh

[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.380]
She's gone that was the old bag she hung up

[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.800]
Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. Yeah, well like I said I denied calling I never called Ian call yeah

[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.240]
So I thought I'm sorry

[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:40.060]
I'm just gonna go. Yeah, but weren't you on with me with Ian a couple of weeks ago with news broke that mr

[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.200]
Pain was coming back on the year

[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:49.520]
And you were saying oh boy, we are so ecstatic and boys are gonna be great. Those guys are okay

[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:55.120]
But we're all right and weren't you the same guys that came on with them in the beginning when they first came on in the afternoon and

[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.960]
sucking around a calm together and I mean, I don't understand what kind of

[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.020]
Loyalties you guys have got

[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:14.180]
You know this is incredible. This is even suds of standing there with his mouth down to his to the thing down there and the other of it can't believe you

[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:21.120]
How can you call guys on the area go on about how great they are and become a little superstar? You're like a radio butterfly

[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.160]
You're like a butterfly

[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.300]
I

[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:30.020]
Don't know I have nothing to say no, that's not an answer

[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:34.200]
Well, no, Calvin but you know, but I know it won't be easy. What is it?

[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.440]
Well, I was in a Steve Steve came before I can start to come on. Yeah, and then I was never can stop

[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.660]
But I always been listening to you. No, no

[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:44.240]
Don't say oh you sound like Steve you're sucking around me and that's not gonna work

[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.300]
That doesn't play with me though, but we're not discussing me. We know this show is great. Okay

[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.260]
Bottom line is two to six in the afternoon. You've got your choice

[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:58.740]
You can let's have some fun with Rick and suds or you can listen to a man making a living on the air self-promoting with

[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:03.980]
85 minute breaks and traffic and the trying to figure out how to get out that little room and if you want that's fine

[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.840]
But I don't understand why one day so these guys are great and you're having a great time and the next day

[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.520]
You're like sucking around is that what you want to be known for all your life is sucking around?

[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.520]
Come on

[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.540]
Stand up for yourself. Don't be such a wimp just because he has got you

[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:26.920]
You know in a submissive kind of an attitude. Why do I do like Steve Kane? I mean that's a thing. What do you like about?

[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:35.220]
Fun, how about that show Tuesday the four-hour funeral for my or Kahanie on air? Do you listen to that show?

[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.360]
I didn't listen to that one. Why not?

[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:43.000]
Do you know listen to it? Oh, would you have listened to it? Oh?

[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:48.020]
Not really. Oh, why not? Oh

[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.860]
And what's going on?

[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.840]
Conversation with you. I'm not trying to sell one way or the other because to each its own if whatever makes you happy

[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.760]
What about when Alice Rubin is gonna be on with is that gonna be fun?

[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:08.480]
What about when Rick Cyderman is what you've heard all those guests a million times if you're a Steve Kane listener, haven't you?

[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.940]
The last word that's what I'm saying absence makes the parts grow fonder

[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:21.220]
But

[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.100]
Great all the time well

[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:28.420]
Why didn't when we just take have a telephoto collection and take up the money and then you know maybe can do a show

[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.080]
You're waffling Kelvin I know

[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:41.280]
Well, I'm frustrated. I you should be flustered Rick Riley is wounded

[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:47.100]
He's heard. He's a sensitive emotional basket case already and you guys are like butterflies

[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:53.700]
One day they're great now Steve's great and if like some real famous person like John McHugh comes on the afternoon on QA

[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.140]
And you'll be gone. I'm saying you're great

[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.980]
Why don't you want you?

[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:03.660]
No, definitely not I think the least you can do like Monday's the holidays come over here and take your clothes off in the studio

[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.580]
The least you can do to make up for it

[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:14.360]
Okay, okay, see you. Let's try Fort Lauderdale. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay? I heard a room. I want to know if it's true

[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:20.580]
Yeah, I heard you are a baguette. Is that true? What a baguette pansy? Oh

[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:25.280]
Ian is on the phone. How you doing? Yeah, oh boy you guys are just out of control

[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:30.060]
You need to get like a life transplant YouTube. I want to tell you Rick Riley and sudscova

[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.980]
I'd like to come to your house and beat the crap out of you with a two by four

[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.100]
Kelvin needs to bridge up a little bit. Yeah, well, that was a wimpy call

[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:40.420]
I mean what at least admit that you guys are butterflies and you're insincere and you're like

[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.100]
Suck around everybody

[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.620]
Mostly each other markets up 30 points. I would never fly away from you Neil

[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.280]
See you're doing the same thing. He was doing I'm not impressed by that

[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:56.600]
That's the that's the oldest chronic talk radio tank thick in the world of suck around with the host

[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.560]
It I see through that see you're not talking to Alex Bennett now

[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:05.220]
But it's the truth. I never spoke to Alex Bennett. Yeah, right, but if you would have you oh Alex

[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.420]
You're the greatest can we come down to be in your live studio audience?

[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.720]
Oh, can we come down and suck around eat your food and ruin your show? Of course he didn't need any help

[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:19.880]
No, but okay, well you won't believe it, but I don't believe you already because when you preface the statement by saying you won't believe me

[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.800]
It's pretty obvious that you're full of it. Well because you don't believe me so I

[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.740]
Preface it. Well, what's what's the philonia statement?

[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:31.920]
I know it's to see that you know, I was I mean I'm listening to you and Steve can originally that's how we knew Steve

[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.120]
Came before what does that have to do with Rick and putt?

[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:38.320]
No, it's really nothing to do with it. I mean, I don't have nothing against him. I don't really care about him either

[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:44.740]
But the point is see you both are missing the point if you were just like kind of like casual callers

[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.980]
And you were part of the vast audience out there the passing parade that would be one thing

[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.000]
But I have a good memory, okay?

[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:57.340]
And I remember back in the beginning when these guys first came on a station the two of you always intend them like joined at the thing

[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:03.260]
We're always on the phone just heaving you're inating all over them and just carrying on and oh, I mean you were just

[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.020]
It was just phenomenal

[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.320]
It was mind-boggling and then all of a sudden the first day Mr

[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.860]
A contrived ego comes back on you. Oh boy, we they're okay

[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:16.340]
But boy he's really and then I ask your pal or what's so great? What do you enjoy? Did you hear this?

[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:20.260]
Oh, no, well, I can't listen on that day and oh no if I heard this will probably be boring

[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:25.180]
Yeah, say on your doing is you're just I don't know what you're doing. What are you doing?

[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:31.700]
What do you want to be trouble makers is that I don't want to be trouble makers a trouble maker try to get Rick Rally's blood pressure up

[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.680]
And cause him to have some kind of a cardiovascular accident sir

[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.900]
At least he's got a nice car though play some good music today Johnny. What is it?

[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.600]
At least he's got a nice car to go home in now

[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:45.320]
Rick I'm not kicking you out of here, but it's time to go on the air Johnny dork. There he goes over to the coast

[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:49.200]
Right he took a big deal breath a big thing of helium before I went over there

[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.400]
Okay, it's 82 along the coast I can hear right now. He's gonna be great today and always last day

[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.960]
I want to tell you no, no don't try to change the subject

[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:03.680]
We still have about a minute to go here. I want you to try to explain to these poor guys why you are turn coat

[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.540]
I mean no reason you're like you're like the

[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.660]
Angus Allen of radio or was it Ethan Allen or Ethan?

[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.620]
Whatever his name was no, I'm not like I mean anything like a Gilbert

[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.920]
I'm not even close. I listen to you your turn coat. I listen to you

[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:24.600]
Rick and sir in Steve's can't or see people I've ever listen on a.m. Radio. Yeah, well that is still not responding to our question

[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.840]
Well, I mean, I mean why did I turn on him? Is that what the question was? Yeah?

[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.880]
No reason really I still was listening to them so Steve can't came back. Yeah, well

[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.820]
That's really it. Did you like did you like the myer connoissell?

[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:42.360]
No, that was that day I didn't listen. Are you gonna listen when Ellis Rubin is on actually?

[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:48.180]
I think Ellis Rubin's kind of you like Rick Siderman. I don't even know who that is. Oh, I mean, I know you how about Reverend

[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:52.700]
Reverend eunuch Polis I actually like I told him yesterday. I'm like you run lady into that

[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.500]
That's kind of I know the British are into that tea in the afternoon

[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.920]
Well, I don't know. Yeah, I think you guys are kind of like

[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.440]
Spend a real club maybe go up to a new Hampshire or something for the weekend together

[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:12.560]
We wait for me kind of cozy up over in front of a warm fire and discuss this under less pressure when you're away from all the

[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:17.020]
Immediate pressures of this radio market and kind of gets your thing together

[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.120]
You know, like in January, I might be going up to University of Maryland. Oh promise

[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.260]
I'm gonna be depressed there. How about I could listen to you every day?

[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:28.000]
Well, you can pick up FTL up there. I'm sure have a great weekend in

[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:33.380]
You're full of it. Okay. Oh, okay. Wow. Boy a couple of radio phoneies there

[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:36.400]
They're not full in any of you folks. You're a lot too sharp for that, right?
