[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780]
Yes, yes, yes, I'm wondering if you're talking about

[00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.500]
the biggest about orange and boats that you talked about earlier about what

[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.320]
biggest cars and boats. Now we're talking about bridges over the

[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.460]
causeway not the ones in your mouth. I don't have any my friend. Okay. Okay.

[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.660]
Yeah. Come down.

[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.780]
So take a deep breath.

[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.200]
Danny,

[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.100]
was it regulated by the United States Corps of Engineers?

[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.160]
That didn't you?

[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.620]
No.

[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.980]
Well, it is. All bridges over Navigable Waterways.

[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.360]
See if I knew that I wouldn't have been asking.

[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.840]
But I said if I knew the answer to the question I wouldn't have asked it in the first place.

[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.520]
Okay. Well, I'm saying sure is that the United States Corps of Engineers are the ones that regulate bridges over

[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.960]
Navigable Waterways.

[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.660]
Over one?

[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.740]
Navigable Waterways.

[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.580]
Yes, sir. Okay.

[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.200]
Okay.

[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.640]
Yeah.

[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.460]
So it's up to them to decide what time the bridge should not be

[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.160]
open to the marine traffic.

[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.260]
Yes. And what time should they not be open to marine traffic, sir?

[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.020]
I'm telling you that they come up with a time.

[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.360]
Well, what is the time?

[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.160]
I believe it's at rush hour times, sir,

[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.500]
that they are not open to marine traffic. Other than that, they are open to marine traffic.

[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.320]
So in other words, any slump with a boat can come along and back up traffic for two months.

[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.100]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.300]
Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crappers there?

[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.260]
That is not a communist bunch of craps.

[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.900]
Sounds like some kind of the end-of-the-all fascist commie Pico, uh,

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.600]
who got a chance to build a high-speed B.O. to one boat.

[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.600]
Right. Exactly.

[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.100]
But a boat is going to stop for five thousand cars.

[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.140]
Is that it?

[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.940]
No, I think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one jackass in his boat.

[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.180]
I think that's what they ought to do.

[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.560]
Man, you better know your laws, Mr. Because you should go.

[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.260]
That's right.

[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.040]
I suppose you want the man-briggs closed to both sides of get a hurricane too.

[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.540]
I want the bridges closed period, okay?

[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.360]
I want them closed.

[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.220]
I want the bridge tenter to go home and watch your MTV and get the hell out of our lives.

[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.460]
In other words, I want those bridges closed.

[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.260]
Let them use the Julia Tuttle, okay?

[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.960]
You know, I'm not a man-of-the-all.

[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.080]
I'm not a man-of-the-all.

[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.160]
I think they ought to go on a George Washington bridge and jump all of bridge tenders.

[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.960]
How do you like that, sir?

[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.860]
Well, I don't know about you, but you shot like some stupid idiotic jerk.

[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.620]
Stupid stupid stupid idiotic jerk.

[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.360]
Stupid idiotic jerk.

[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.880]
My Amy, hello.

[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.880]
Oh, you caught me changing ears.

[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.220]
Well, excuse me.

[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.060]
Sorry, one of my earphones...

[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.360]
It's like catching a Lynette or changing noses.

[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.700]
Well, I'm one of those closet-nailies.

[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.820]
I'd say I drag you out of the closet.

[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.680]
Come out, come out wherever you are.

[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.900]
When clients come into my office, I lower the radio.

[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.840]
I don't want them to hear.

[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.840]

[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.220]

Portland's ass last night 13 to one in a regional it wasn't last night it was yesterday afternoon but

[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.480]

[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.460]
losers bracket which would be another afternoon game we wouldn't carry so we got real lucky they won

[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.300]
and that means we will carry it because it starts at 6 30 we'll have the pregame at 6 20 speaking of

[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:18.920]
yeah I think they should just make the bridges bigger that's what that's what my dentist said

[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:26.200]
I think that's all the problems yeah how come well you're you're up in Palm Beach right yeah well

[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.860]
how come we have some bridges like down here we have the McCart one on McCartus got a bridge on it

[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.940]
like the jute total cause way and they don't have any bridge on there because they build it high

[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.400]
enough so that even the tallest of boats even the queen Mary can flip under there I was exactly

[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.060]
well like the lake worth bridge going off to Lake worth beach yeah the thing so high it never goes

[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.500]
up exactly and then the one going into Palm Beach it's so short it goes it goes up for a little

[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:54.940]
robot yeah you know it drives me nuts but anyway well you know we have so many pathetic geriatric old

we have an open line in date county 75194637 by his Laura gone for the day or something is she gone

[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.260]
because I want to do something with that card I did that spot much to my she grin and dismayed that

[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:29.040]
I didn't want to do to make Jeff Clark campus since he's such a miserable creep and I guess we could

[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.400]
put it in there I'll give it to him during the news break see what we're gonna do with it I don't

[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.460]
like putting stuff in there because I don't want to mess up their beautiful cards howland beach

[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:42.580]
hey Neil how you doing okay we think out of belly was pointing at when he got thrown out of a game

[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:47.520]
the other night he had a giant booger on his nose and he kept saying to the umpire here jump on

[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.040]
this pal he got him laughing right before he got thrown out which umpire is that that's a Ripley

[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.460]
Steve Ripley he did look like he was taking it and I think he kept telling him believe it or not

[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.500]
you see had that look of disbelief on his face too like what are you saying did you see that was

[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.860]
really interesting see the look on the place yeah I like delta belly he's okay in my book yeah

[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.680]
I thought he could have done a good job but he's no Jim S.U. and man this guy he's a mr. Ra Ra he's

[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.420]
up and down pacing that dug out clapping his hands waving his cap he's okay he's 40 years young

[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:24.440]
yeah he looks about 60 by the way 60 Neil live around bokeh or a tone and I don't think I've

[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.560]
ever spoke to anybody who's ever got a book from arbitrage yeah well this last trend where I'm

[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.100]
going to personally conduct an investigation I'm hiring Don Corleone Jr. and Luca Bratzi and we're

[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.080]
going to find out what the hell is going on over I think Luca passes a mountain I think where they put

[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.100]
they where they get in fact I'd like to talk to somebody who's ever had one and find out where

[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.880]
they mailed them to because they don't mail them to Beltsville they mail them to somewhere here

[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.580]
I've never seen one and then somebody here in some computer place gets their hands on them and they

[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:57.380]
feed the they feed it into a computer here and then it goes up to Beltsville and they do the final

[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:03.040]
whatever they do with it up there they sit on it and stop it around but the only got one more

[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.700]
question now because I remember when the birch report when I was on i and z at night yeah and we

[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.400]
discovered that the birch report which does their things by phone and also on WS news I had these

[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.540]
gigantic numbers in arbitrage and a birch was always like very low and we discovered that there

[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.180]
were a bunch of Cuban high school girls who used to do the research and make the phone calls

[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.460]
yeah and like if somebody because naturally my name for many years has been like poison in

[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.700]
certain segments of the Cuban community uh they would mention my name they wouldn't put it down

[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:35.460]
or they'd put some other station yeah so these tend to be some very bizarre in other words when

[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:40.900]
your whole livelihood is in the hands of a few very peculiar people you have to start wondering you know

[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:47.940]
funny name arbitrage yeah something sinister in it I got a friend of mine who's uh going through

[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:53.320]
withdrawal is major warning and uh you're getting a lot of women calling you today I think that's

[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.820]
wonderful maybe they could give them some hands you haven't hints on what I don't know he's just

[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.980]

[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:18.800]

[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.580]

[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:03.040]
like me my any okay listen i couldn't believe that great sports department couldn't

[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.240]
muster up enough cloud to do the u.m. game yesterday that has nothing to do with the sports

[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.400]
departments here that has to do with our upper level management that had too many spots on that

[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.260]
we didn't want to lose the revenue on we can't afford to put it on the sports department you

[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.960]
can be sure is always ready at a moment's notice to preempt anything on the station why not

[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.740]
layla sports part but he's pretty comatized because i think there's still more in the death of

[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:31.140]
we everone one eighteen and w.w.w.i.o.d. we have an open line in date seven five one nine four six three seven

[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.420]
whatever that means.

[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.700]
Thank you very much.

[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.060]
Neil, is it true you used to announce the Xbox games down here?

[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.160]
The West Palm Expose, yes sir.

[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.320]
Right, I'm going to go to a game tonight.

[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.680]
Hope to have a good time.

[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.160]
Wish you were there to announce.

[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.160]
No, not me.

[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.100]
Okay, well hey, on another thing, the Cubs last night.

[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.700]
When you could pull a squeeze off twice,

[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.300]
you'd want any. You're doing it.

[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.100]
When you can squeeze it twice to one inning, you're really doing it.

[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.100]
That's what Mark Grace is.

[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.680]
Really? I was, I didn't think that there a new manager would pull that up.

[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.140]
Well, he's pulling it off anything off he can get, sir.

[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.720]
He's pulling out all the stops. It's now or never.

[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.480]
As long as it produces victory,

[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.920]
I'm not standing and I'm taking a weapon. We suck.

[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.320]
Well, I think here also is in the same coma that Don Zimmer was in.

[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.920]
I mean, he just isn't making any moves.

[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.540]
I thought they'd for sure pinch run for a sorone there.

[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.840]
And not only did he not pinch run for him,

[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.680]
but then he tried to run him on a hit and run.

[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.920]
And he got thrown out by like 75 yards.

[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.280]
It was just amazing.

[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.880]
No, he had to slide in the first and won.

[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.780]
I don't know if it was a fifth inning or something to get on base.

[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.760]
Yeah, that was great. That belly flop slide into first.

[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.680]
That was outstanding.

[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.340]
It was even better when Hojo was picked off base.

[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.380]
And then he made it back to first and two pitches later.

[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.360]
They tried running him. He got thrown out by 5,000 paces.

[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:07.640]
Great.

[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.480]
Hey, listen, Neil, I'm closing.

[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.940]
I'd like to call a couple of friends on my dish bag.

[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:12.780]
I'm sure you would.

[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.120]
Okay, Don Nelson and Robert Connor, your tremendous dish bag.

[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.580]
Okay. Have a nice weekend.

[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.100]
Have a nice life. 20 episodes.

[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.120]
Hello.

[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.900]
Having noticed that people are still having the right to fencing driving courses

[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.060]
have absolutely no effect.

[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.680]
Sheriffs and constables constantly warn them.

[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.940]
But people are still having rags because their birds won't stop them.

[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:51.160]
Do you realize that people are still having rags they've been told not to?

[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.280]
Could it be that they are deaf when you see them changing lanes?

[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.860]
You will know that they're deranged by the rate of velocity.

[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.080]
Do you understand me?

[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.460]
Hello, love. Hello, officer.

[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.940]
People are still having rags.

[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.380]
Detectors keep on chirping.

[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.280]
Nothing makes them stop.

[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.080]
Their breaks are not working.

[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.360]
People are still having rags.

[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.220]
They've been going on for quite a while.

[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.680]
Perhaps it's not their vehicle.

[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.640]
So they know they'll go in style.

[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.380]
Hello.

[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.700]
People are still having rags.

[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.960]
Still having rags.

[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.460]
Eat your heart out, Johnny.

[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:56.840]
Johnny, I wish he could play that in the coast about four or five times this afternoon.

[00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:58.900]
Right, Ron?

[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.020]
Is this the A1?

[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.500]
Anyone believe service?

[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.520]
Yes, I'm trying to get a hold of you all morning.

[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.480]
This is Don.

[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:14.460]
This is Don I'm over at WGAR and I have a friend here with me that would like to...

[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.140]
That has a couple of questions he'd like to ask you.

[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.000]
Do you know anything about ammunition or do you sell ammunition?

[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.100]
We sell ammunition.

[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:22.680]
I...

[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.080]
What he wants is a silver bullet.

[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.000]
A silver coated bullet.

[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.020]
Actually, what it is.

[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.160]
Yeah, thank you.

[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.960]
Winchester, he says, makes it.

[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.300]
Okay, good job, Ron.

[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.480]
I can't understand it, but it's great, Don I'm a...

[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.120]
Hollywood, hello.

[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.160]
Clicking line?

[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.000]
Is it clicking?

[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.160]
Oh, it is.

[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.900]
Okay, that's the first one all day.

[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.780]
Who will not want you to go away for a long holiday weekend without one good click?

[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.380]
Open line on a clicking line 524WID, Gulf Stream.

[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.020]
Nail.

[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.020]
What's going on?

[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:55.580]
How you doing?

[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.620]
Hey, what are those Larry, those Larry, Lou Jack tapes?

[00:30:58.860 --> 00:30:59.000]
Yeah.

[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.760]
I don't know, they're pretty weak, man.

[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.100]
I think.

[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.340]
Larry, Lou Jack is pretty weak.

[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.520]
I don't know.

[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.700]
Larry, Lou Jack?

[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.520]
Isn't that guy, it sounds like he's forcing that laughter, I don't know.

[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.820]
Yeah, it sounds like the bird.

[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:11.960]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:12.880]
Pretty weak.

[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.180]
He's great.

[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.480]
Anyway, Cup Game was, you see the Cup Game last night?

[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.640]
Not bad, I like that squeeze, that double squeeze.

[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.120]
He squeezed it, we sweated out, squeezed it out.

[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:23.880]
That's what we did.

[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:24.640]
I like that.

[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.380]
Jim Essien's doing it.

[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.420]
Doug descends of his God, 3 and 2, and he laid it down there, man, under pressure,

[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.480]
here comes Dunston and boy, he just had to get it down, or he did it.

[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.280]
Classic.

[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.140]
And Paul Austin Mocker is God.

[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.780]
Well, I think Lynn Russell is God.

[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.340]
Yeah, okay.

[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.860]
Anyway, I just like to say that I'm...

[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.320]
I don't know, Tom Denver, but he sounds like some kind of idiotic jerk.

[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.380]
And no further talking.

[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.960]
Have a great life, pal.

[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.880]
Now, we're up to our long distance dedication.

[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.280]
And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand.

[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.400]
Whether we have kids or pets or neither.

[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:01.840]
Hey!

[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.100]
It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio, and here's what he writes.

[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.940]
Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere,

[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.960]
and it'll meet a lot if you play it.

[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.440]
Recently, there was a death in our family.

[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.260]
He was a little dog named Snuckles, but he was most certainly a part of...

[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.060]
Let's come start again.

[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.300]
From coming out of the record.

[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.540]
Play the record, okay?

[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:26.520]
Please.

[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.980]
See, when you come out of those uptempo damn numbers, man,

[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.940]
is impossible to make those transitions.

[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.260]
And then you gotta go into somebody dying.

[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.340]
You know, they do this to me all the time.

[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.640]
I don't know what the hell they do it for, but damn it.

[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.320]
If we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it.

[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.400]
Is down on the phone, okay?

[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.540]
I want a damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a...

[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.200]
...being uptempo record every time I do a damn deaf dedication.

[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:01.120]
Now, make it, and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week.

[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.780]
It's a God-last-damn-time.

[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.020]
I want somebody who's a fucking brain to not come out of a damn record.

[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.640]
That's uptempo, and I gotta talk about a fucking tour of dying.

[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.060]
Boy, this is imponderous, man.

[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.920]
Ponderous, imponderous.

[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.960]
Well, hello.

[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.040]
Hi there.

[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.480]
I'm your new neighbor.

[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.680]
I'm an entertaining guest, and I seem to have run out of coffee.

[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.820]
Well, come in.

[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.600]
With boulders, coffee, be too good for your gas.

[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.840]
Oh, that would be just perfect.

[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.020]
How could I ever repay you?

[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.480]
Oh, I don't think I'm something.

[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.060]
Well, have a nice party.

[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.080]
Hey, you a nice new neighbor yet?

[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.820]
Oh, I just popped in for coffee.

[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.700]
Bulgeers coffee for those budding relationships.

[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:52.920]
Thank you, Scott.

[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.480]
138, isn't it something to hear his voice again?

[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.340]
I think I'm getting a sore throat just from hearing it.

[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.640]
North Miami Beach.

[00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.640]
And now what's going on?

[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:00.360]
How you doing, sir?

[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.560]
Pretty good, but you're happy or we can write around the corner.

[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.140]
No, I'm not.

[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.400]
I got to be here on Monday.

[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.380]
Everybody, we just get screwed over so bad.

[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.360]
Are you working Monday, Johnny?

[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:08.660]
Dark?

[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.680]
Even Johnny, dark has to play that slush on the holidays, sir.

[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:12.360]
How do you like that?

[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:12.740]
Wow.

[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.400]
And he's threatening to boycott.

[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.620]
He's so pissed off about it.

[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.660]
But he needs the money to bet.

[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.580]
Well, we, uh, we...

[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:19.900]
I hope Fleetwood Grover is listening.

[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.280]
Johnny said if he's got to work Monday, he's walking out.

[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.160]
And we'll be right behind him.

[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.320]
About 400 yards.

[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.900]
Well, I'm kind of curious.

[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.960]
Did you hear anything about that new dice movie?

[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.620]
Did I hear you ask?

[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.880]
Somebody went down there and saw it at that one theater.

[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.900]
Said it was pretty good.

[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.440]
Who was?

[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.660]
You saw it?

[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.060]
No, I haven't seen it yet.

[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.020]
Oh, well, he said it was good.

[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.060]
Of course, that doesn't mean anything.

[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.500]
I think he was a relative, but...

[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:42.460]
Maybe he was Johnny, dark.

[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:43.940]
Yeah, I doubt it.

[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.400]
That's a little too racy for Johnny.

[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.240]
So what else is going on up there?

[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.300]
That's about it.

[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.500]
Everybody's bailing out of here.

[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.540]
They're closing up the whole place and nailing the board shut on the outside

[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.880]
and they'll all go in home for a long busman's holiday.

[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.400]
That's it.

[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.420]
Sounds good.

[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:58.740]
Yeah.

[00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.220]
Okay.

[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.200]
Okay, touch the way there.

[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:00.600]
See ya.

[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.080]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.380]
Hey, nail.

[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.000]
Well, I got a story for you.

[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:06.860]
Okay, we're ready.

[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.640]
We can handle it.

[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:07.920]
Good.

[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:15.900]
Down at the beach last Friday, walking down on the beach, it's about A1A and East Las Olas

[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.060]
in front of the elbow room.

[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:17.760]
A1A?

[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.480]
Oh, the elbow room.

[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.840]
A1A, your gay one way, yes.

[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.360]
Yes.

[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.300]
You know, right down the bottom of the building tomorrow.

[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.780]
Anyways, right in front of life, I'm walking along.

[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:26.760]
And what do I see?

[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.560]
I see two women and gorgeous women, not roof roofs, but, you know,

[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.020]
sunbathing their breasts.

[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.500]
And I just want to know with all the morality and everything that these people preach, you know,

[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:47.440]
no nude dancing in the bars and serving alcohol and Niknovaro and his stormtroopers, where the hell are they?

[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.680]
And they want that family.

[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.180]
I know what everybody is.

[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.180]
You know, and they want that, it's going to be a family thing, kill spring break.

[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.140]
Can't have none of that.

[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.660]
Well, we want families out there nude on the beach.

[00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.360]
That's what we want.

[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.700]
The family that nude bathes together, sticks together.

[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.240]
Yeah.

[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.520]
That's a new motto on the beach.

[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.280]
You know, I would be a Cub fan, but I'm a San Francisco fan.

[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.280]
I like thickening losers.

[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.160]
Oh, man, you must be, you know, what do you sound depressed?

[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.140]
12 and 20, what is it?

[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:13.900]
12 and 28?

[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.700]
There's 16 games under 500.

[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.200]
I don't understand it.

[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.180]
They got Matt Williams and Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell.

[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.540]
I mean, they should just be an awesome run-making machine.

[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.920]
They have no pitching, but...

[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.260]
The best baseball I ever saw was, well, the Cubs lost.

[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.360]
One they had, one for the pennant, like two or three years ago,

[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.260]
one to seven games, and they were just...

[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.620]
You think that the Cubs, you know, one team was out, and they just...

[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.840]
Everyone just kept coming back.

[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:37.440]
You remember that?

[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.840]
Didn't go to seven games.

[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.340]
I did go to seven games.

[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:39.520]
I did go to seven games.

[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:39.560]
I did go to seven games.

[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:39.860]
I did go to seven games.

[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.520]
I did go to seven games.

[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.780]
I did go to seven games.

[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.420]
I did go to seven games.

[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.420]
We only won one game.

[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.120]
No.

[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:48.780]
Yes!

[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.720]
I'm coming here to the one they played.

[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.220]
Oh, sir, you're talking to a man who lives and dies with the Cubs

[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.400]
and you're suggesting I don't know what I'm talking about.

[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.020]
We won, we split quick.

[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.680]
We split the two games in Chicago, and then the Giants won three straight in San Francisco.

[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.060]
We lost in five games, sir.

[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:05.900]
Oh.

[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.620]
Well, it wasn't good, anyways, I mean, uh...

[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.540]
Well, obviously you were really into it, deeply.

[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.060]
Have a great life, pal.

[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:12.460]
Bye.

[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.040]
Wow.

[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.900]
Talk about people who are confused.

[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.600]
I guess it was those boobs he saw on the beach that got to him.

[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.740]
We have an open-line at Broward 524WYOD.

[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.860]
Here's a lady in plantation.

[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:22.900]
Hi, Neil.

[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:23.380]
Hi.

[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.660]
I'm getting ready for Memorial Day here.

[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:31.640]
I have my potato salad cooking, and I made the hamburgers, and I just wanted to relate

[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.660]
to you the Crap's Capital of the World I've just come back from.

[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:35.780]
The one?

[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.140]
The Crap's Capital of the World.

[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.600]
Oh, the Crap?

[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.960]
I thought you said the Crap Capital.

[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.240]
What could be called that, too?

[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:48.300]
I have never had such a smell as when you go through the big Mickey World.

[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.640]
You go from ride to ride, and there's all different flavors everywhere.

[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:58.660]
It tells me, out of my mind, I guess when it's dark, they just decided to time.

[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.300]
I don't understand.

[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.280]
I'm missing something somewhere.

[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:03.840]
Crap.

[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.240]
Crap's?

[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:06.720]
No.

[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.880]
You know, where's the card?

[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.560]
Oh, well, listen, let's get laid on a Friday.

[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.600]
You want sharp material for me?

[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:18.620]
I don't get it.

[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.680]
Well, I just, yes.

[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.020]
That's all I heard while I was up there.

[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.280]
Oh, in other words, you're saying all the little kids on the rides are having little kids?

[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.120]
Oh, little kids?

[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.500]
All the old people.

[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.640]
All the old people.

[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.360]
There were German people there, English people over here.

[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.180]
And they...

[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.640]
Oh, well, there's nothing worse than a German fart.

[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:36.560]
That's the other thing.

[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:36.860]
That's the other thing.

[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:37.520]
That's the other thing.

[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:37.880]
That's the other thing.

[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:38.660]
That's the other thing.

[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:38.740]
Exactly.

[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.120]
And they have that.

[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:40.700]
That's the other thing.

[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.480]
Well, they serve all their different food.

[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:47.240]
And then you go on one ride, I guess everybody thinks that since you can't see on the ride,

[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.460]
they can just go ahead and let go.

[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:49.980]
Yeah.

[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.620]
Well, they can't see each other, so they have to have some kind of a signal.

[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:53.960]
Oh, I'm telling you.

[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.020]
It's all first if you ever go there.

[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:56.580]
Okay.

[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.180]
Bring the mask.

[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:57.760]
Alrighty.

[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.940]
I'll borrow that nose clip from Tonya Cruz.

[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.740]
You have a good weekend.

[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.240]
You too.

[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:03.680]
Bye-bye.

[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:19.320]
Hey, have you ever gone into a polling booth and pulled the lever and later realized it wasn't the only lever that got pulled?

[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.640]
I feel like mine's getting yanked just about all the time.

[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.700]
Let me tell you about it.

[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.440]
Pushes in the wide house.

[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.040]
I think I'm going to puke.

[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.760]
Tax is going up again.

[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.320]
You should have voted for the two.

[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:32.700]
Oh!

[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.040]
We read his lips.

[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.940]
The message got through.

[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.660]
When Bush talks it's just a more pool number two.

[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.000]
Wow!

[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.000]
Lying in the wide house.

[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.120]
Yeah.

[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.580]
Lying in the wide house.

[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.220]
Oh, George, you stopped playing us for such fools.

[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.240]
Cause everybody knows that mine ain't the way to move.

[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.220]
Oh, he's giving out my money to places near and far.

[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:02.940]
Gas tax just went up.

[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.800]
I can't afford to drive my car.

[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.300]
His pony is quail and a guy named Dick.

[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.000]
Well, I don't trust no one named after my Richard.

[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.540]
Lying in the wide house.

[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:18.200]
He was lying in the wide house.

[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:22.820]
Oh, Uncle George, you stopped playing us for such fools.

[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:28.160]
Cause everybody knows that mine ain't the way to move.

[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:29.080]

[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.020]
Lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying.

[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:38.320]
Yeah.

[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.440]
And then quail still the vice president.

[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.540]
152 at WIOD.

[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.760]
Miami, Buenos dias.

[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.300]
How you doing?

[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:47.940]
All right.

[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.960]
I'm going to first time car a long time listener.

[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:50.560]
Great.

[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.600]
I got a good question for you.

[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:53.820]
That hockey game last night was amazing.

[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.400]
Too bad I didn't see it.

[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:57.800]
Yeah, but you missed a good game.

[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.660]
Then whatever happened to that guy who caught up with the bridges cart?

[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.820]
I just played it within the last hour.

[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.940]
Oh, I just got home from school, so I didn't know.

[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.540]
Oh my God, are you cereal?

[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:08.880]
Yeah.

[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.960]
You got home just a little sooner you would have had it.

[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.460]
And a car too.

[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.180]
Hey, I got a question for you.

[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.520]
Maybe you could settle a bet for me and my buddy.

[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.380]
It's how it's turned really bald or is that a real haircut?

[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.340]
That's Elaineette Tours here.

[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.500]
So Elaineette Tours here?

[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.280]
And her old nose.

[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:24.300]
And her old nose, huh?

[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:24.540]

[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.520]
So he's bald than a...

[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.180]
Bald than a cue ball, sir.

[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:28.800]
All right.

[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.680]
Have a great life.

[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.360]
All right, have a good weekend.

[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:30.820]
See ya.

[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.180]
See ya.

[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.060]
What a guy.

[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:32.780]
Good guy.

[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.000]
Bad call but a good guy.

[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.600]
Excellent guy.

[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.660]
153 at WIOD.

[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:37.700]
We have an open-line in date.

[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.200]
You'll never get on, but you might be lucky enough to hold over for Rick and CERPACO.

[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:41.760]
What's his name?

[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.440]
Sebastian.

[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.660]
Don't tell me.

[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.160]
Skuball.

[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.060]
Skuball.

[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:49.740]
Cellborn.

[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:50.840]
Melborn.

[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.100]
Rick and Selby.

[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.400]
Dick and Selby coming up from two to six.

[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.960]
Here's a lady in Hollywood who's not there anymore.

[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.580]
What a bitch.

[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:01.980]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.860]
Here's a pay phone in North Miami Beach.

[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:05.100]
Hello.

[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.420]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:06.900]
Okay.

[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:07.780]
How you like that?

[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:08.980]
What is it?

[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.140]
I just want to make this short.

[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:10.780]
How are you?

[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.680]
I'm Robert Sticker and autographed picture of you and Rick and CERPACO.

[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:20.780]
You said probably like a stamp-seller of the rest large mineral envelope to WIOD, Miami-33141,

[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.140]
and put in there exactly what you want and we'll set it to you.

[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.760]
Okay, thank you.

[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.620]
And if you're really put enough postage on there, we'll send you one of Elaine's Spirnos' too.

[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:29.660]
Okay.

[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:30.620]
Go cards.

[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.360]
See ya.

[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.240]
Go cards.

[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.020]
Yeah, go cards.

[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.440]
I think they're playing the meds.

[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.480]
Beat the crap out of them.

[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:35.980]
Hello.

[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:36.660]
Neil.

[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:37.160]
Yeah.

[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.260]
I've called to say goodbye.

[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.300]
Where you going, sir?

[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:40.840]
Beltsville, Maryland.

[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:41.800]
Would you believe it?

[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.380]
Oh, boy.

[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.700]
Well, I'll write it in my diary.

[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.920]
I've lived here for 23 years.

[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.780]
I only speak English and I'm getting the hell out.

[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.020]
Well, you're going to the wrong place.

[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.580]
They don't like talking to people like you.

[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.240]
Well, hey.

[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.100]
What can you say?

[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.760]
You're not going to Beltsville, Maryland.

[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:57.660]
I swear to God.

[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.800]
What the hell are you going to do there?

[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.080]
I've got a job and I'm going to school out there.

[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.760]
There's no such place.

[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.640]
Come on.

[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.680]
I swear to God.

[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.080]
Really?

[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:05.760]
Yes.

[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.480]
Well, put a good word in for us.

[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.920]
Tell them we're still on the air up there.

[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.020]
I think they're losing something.

[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.880]
Well, I think you're going to call down when the ratings come out.

[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.660]
And if they're not good, I mean, I've seen the buildings when I've been up there.

[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:16.120]
Yeah.

[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:16.540]
Yeah.

[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.040]
Hey, a little gasoline goes a long way.

[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.120]
A little Vaseline.

[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.660]
I think they already slipped that to us to be honest with you.

[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.040]
Well, have a great life up there.

[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:25.880]
Give us a call sometime.

[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:26.280]
Collect.

[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.440]
We'd like hearing from Beltsville.

[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:27.920]
Oh, hey.

[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:28.480]
I'll call.

[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.340]
You know, I've been listening to you for five years and I'm really going to miss you.

[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:31.700]
Yeah.

[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.880]
Well, that's our problem.

[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.180]
The whole audience moved out of town.

[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.220]
We finally discovered it.

[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:35.560]
They're all getting out of town.

[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:35.860]
I think so.

[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.480]
I think you need to learn Spanish, Neil.

[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:37.960]
Steve.

[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.580]
How a good one.

[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.420]
As in, see this.

[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:40.900]
Okay.

[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:41.640]
See you later.

[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.740]
156 and WI.

[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.520]
Is that possible?

[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.640]
I mean, we've been trying to convince everybody for all these years about what a God forsaken the depressing

[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.120]
dank toilet this is.

[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.060]
Maybe finally one day they said, you know what?

[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:53.540]
He's right.

[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.140]
Let's get the hell out of here.

[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.360]
They're all gone.

[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:56.940]
They're gone.

[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.320]
And I do notice we're getting a hell of a lot more out of town cause lately too.

[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.540]
London and Paris and Beltsville and you name it.

[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.420]
We're getting a cheek to walk in New York.

[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:08.640]
Miami.

[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.420]
Is this the wrong call?

[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:12.780]
I think I just did Miami.

[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:14.480]
Boca on the star line.

[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.060]
Hello.

[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:15.800]
Hey, Neil.

[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:16.200]
Yeah.

[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:16.800]
How you doing?

[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:17.380]
Great.

[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:18.460]
What?

[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:19.640]
Sensational.

[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:20.480]
Hey, there you go.

[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.120]
Fabulous.

[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:22.160]
How's that?

[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:23.720]
What's up?

[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.640]
Not much.

[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.900]
Just calling in and say hello.

[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:26.580]
Okay.

[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.540]
See how it's going there.

[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.000]
Yeah.

[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.780]
And other than that, that's about it.

[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.820]
First time I'm calling in.

[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.680]
Well, how was it?

[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.440]
How was what?

[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:34.420]
The call.

[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.640]
How was the experience?

[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:37.740]
Come on.

[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.460]
Get with it.

[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.720]
On your end.

[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:42.400]
Huh?

[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.680]
I say, have a great weekend.

[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:44.340]
All right.

[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.880]
I'd like to call a couple of people with douchebags.

[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.360]
That's why.

[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.080]
Now, why didn't you just say that at the beginning?

[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.980]
Instead of making a fool of yourself and pretending that you had a reason for calling and asking how

[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:52.840]
you're doing.

[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.120]
You're not going to say something.

[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:54.620]
Do it.

[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.360]
No, I can't.

[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.760]
No, you don't.

[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:57.480]
I'm just going to tell you Neil.

[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:58.580]
No, well, that's fine.

[00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.900]
But just do it.

[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:00.560]
Okay.

[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.020]
I like that.

[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.240]
Stand up and be a man, sir.

[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.080]
I want to call it Dan.

[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.020]
The bass player.

[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.420]
A major douchebag.

[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:06.320]
Oh.

[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.320]
Now you're talking.

[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.400]
And Lena and Molta, all the guys down at ACS.

[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.780]
The major, major douchebags.

[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:13.400]
Oh.

[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.220]
Good job, sir.

[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:14.560]
Okay.

[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:15.080]
See you.

[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:15.620]
Have a great life.

[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.640]
See, you got to put some of these people up a little bit.

[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:22.820]
Laura brings me a fact that says could you call Mike at American Express a douchebag?

[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.320]
No, I will not call Mike at American Express a douchebag.

[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.160]
Oh, yes, I will because it says I have some mid 80s cubs, your books for you.

[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.140]
Look for them in your box by Tuesday.

[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.840]
Now if I get that 86 cub, your book, I may not be able to come in on Tuesday.

[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:37.860]
Oh, man.

[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.240]
The one with that Mike Polucky picture in there.

[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.540]
I'm telling you, I can't handle that.

[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.540]
Nobody in the world is supposed to look like that.

[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.700]
It should be against the law.

[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:50.120]
So thank you so much to people from whoever the hell is in Boko.

[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.260]
Let's go to Pompo, hello.

[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:53.320]
Hey Neil.

[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:53.720]
Yeah.

[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:57.920]
You know, I just listened to your car today about that birth car.

[00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:58.680]
The what?

[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.780]
About the birth car.

[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.360]
You know where everybody is burping on her?

[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:01.780]
Yeah.

[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.480]
Boy, I just got that same problem.

[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.080]
I don't know what to do with it.

[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:05.540]
Yeah.

[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:10.820]
Yeah, I just, it just comes out and, boom.

[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.020]
Okay.

[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.460]
Well, that's an excellent call to end the week on.

[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.700]
And I hope I sure hope it gets fixed by Monday so we have some good holiday, okay?

[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:18.380]
Yes.

[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:19.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:19.660]
Yes.

[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.400]
I've been wondering there.

[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:27.020]
One of the talking about these bridges about orange and boats that you talked about earlier.

[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:27.660]
About what?

[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.620]
Biggers, cars and boats.

[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:34.060]
Now we're talking about bridges over the causeway, not the ones in your mouth.

[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.540]
I don't have any of my friends.

[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:36.900]
Okay.

[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:37.600]
Okay.

[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:38.260]
Yeah.

[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.140]
Calm down, sir.

[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:39.920]
Take a deep breath.

[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.360]
And that is, was it regulated by the United States Corps of Engineers?

[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.380]
You know that, didn't you?

[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:44.860]
No.

[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:45.960]
Well, it is.

[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.200]
All bridges over Navigable Waterway.

[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.920]
See if I knew that I wouldn't have been asking, see?

[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:51.720]
What's that?

[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.060]
I said if I knew the answer to the question I wouldn't have asked it in the first place.

[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:55.540]
Okay.

[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:04.220]
Well, I'm saying, sir, is that the United States Corps of Engineers are the ones that regulate bridges over Navigable Waterways?

[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:04.920]
Over one?

[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.000]
Navigable Waterway.

[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:07.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:07.820]
Okay.

[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:08.400]
Okay.

[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:08.920]
Yeah.

[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:17.420]
So it's up to them to decide what time the bridges should not be open to the marine traffic.

[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:17.860]
Yes.

[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.560]
And what time should they not be open to marine traffic, sir?

[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.460]
I'm telling you that they come up with the times.

[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.680]
Well, what is the time?

[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:36.260]
I believe it's at rush hour times, sir, that they are not open to marine traffic.

[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.860]
Other than that, they are open to marine traffic.

[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:42.680]
So in other words, any slump with a boat can come along and back up traffic for two months.

[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.420]
That is absolutely correct, sir.

[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.560]
Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crappers that?

[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.560]
That is not a communist bunch of craps.

[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:53.660]
Sounds like some kind of the end-of-the-all fascist, Tommy Pico, uh, conspiracy to me.

[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:54.920]
There's got five people that will be over the top of the one boat.

[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:55.980]
Right, exactly.

[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.440]
But a boat is going to stop for five thousand cars.

[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:00.500]
Is that it?

[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:04.300]
No, I think that fifty thousand cars ought to stop for one jackass in his boat.

[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.740]
I think that's what they ought to do.

[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.120]
Man, you better know your laws, Mr. Because you sure don't.

[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:10.620]
That's right.

[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:15.400]
I suppose you want the man-briggs closed to both traffic and a hurricane, too.

[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.480]
I want the bridges closed, period.

[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:17.920]
Okay?

[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:18.740]
I want them closed.

[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.540]
I want the bridge tentative to go home and watch your MTV and get the hell out of our lives.

[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.100]
Get out of the way!

[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.820]
I want those bridges closed.

[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.640]
Let him use the junior tunnel, okay?

[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:28.040]
You know, I'm not a man-bent.

[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.560]
I think they ought to go on a George Washington bridge and jump all of the bridge tenters.

[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.360]
How do you like that, sir?

[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:38.280]
Well, I don't know about you, but you shot like some stupid idiotic jerk.

[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:43.300]
Well, I don't know about you, but you shot like some stupid idiotic jerk.

[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.080]
Stupid, stupid, stupid idiotic jerk.

[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.780]
Stupid, idiotic jerk.

[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.360]
Twelve thirty at WIOD.
