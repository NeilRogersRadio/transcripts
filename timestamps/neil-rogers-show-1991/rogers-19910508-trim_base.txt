[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]
I'm a cup fan. I'm a cup fan.

[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.080]
I got you.

[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.280]
I'm a shot.

[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.420]
San Luis.

[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.020]
I'm going.

[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.480]
I'm going.

[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.740]
San Luis.

[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.680]
Brown is sharply the San Luis.

[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.260]
And this game is over young Bob's death.

[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.340]
San Luis.

[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.580]
Well, if he's not hard to win your first major league game,

[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.660]
but he has done it.

[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.200]
And the same goes the Dave Smith.

[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.240]
The story that rock thombs in the world.

[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.960]
I don't know one thing.

[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.100]
What was she doing there?

[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.660]
Carousing and drinking to four o'clock in the morning.

[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.360]
OK, does that sound like a sexist pig?

[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.460]
When you say that, are all the feminists going to get

[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.040]
bent out of shape?

[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.760]
I just wonder what she was doing walking unescorted into a

[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.100]
bar, schmoozing with all the candidates, drinking to four

[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.380]
in the morning, going home with them.

[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.840]
And thinking she was going to a tea party.

[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.040]
I don't understand it.

[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.480]
We sure try to blow that game last night, man.

[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.780]
Bob Scanlon pitches a great six innings.

[00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.860]
Week in a little bit in the seventh, his first major league

[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.000]
start looked like we were going to coast on in.

[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.640]
And then all of a sudden Dunston start making areas and

[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.460]
Barry Hill dropped a ball at the plate when the game

[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.140]
should have been over.

[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.380]
And do we like to make it exciting?

[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.240]
OK, that's the way the Cubs play.

[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.540]
And how about those pirates?

[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.920]
Boy, Chuck Meyer must be in a hog heaven this morning.

[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.200]
Unbelievable.

[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.980]
Pirates are kicking ass in a penguins.

[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.920]
Just totally.

[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.400]
It was great for his period last night.

[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.380]
But after that, they just totally blew away the Bruins

[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.240]
and tied up the series.

[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.160]
I have a little thing for Chuck too, as soon as he clears the

[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.120]
cobwebs out of his head.

[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.980]
I have the most amazing pig report in the history of this town.

[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.980]
It is mind boggling.

[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.660]
And I hope Officer Pig is listening right now.

[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.180]
I'm sure he is.

[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.600]
He's an elite.

[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.460]
I'm coming to work this morning.

[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.760]
And I get off as usual at the Golden Glades because I see

[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.460]
95 looks pretty emotional.

[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.080]
I saw Tony Cruz out there directing traffic.

[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.220]
And so I get off on Northwest 7th Avenue and come down there

[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.040]
like I usually do.

[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.540]
And I get a few blocks down.

[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.540]
All of a sudden I see a Metro pig car in my rear view mirror

[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.440]
with its bright lights just barreling up from behind.

[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.440]
I mean, just flying.

[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.960]
So I assume when you got your bright headlights on,

[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.920]
and he probably is going somewhere in a hurry wants me

[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.440]
to get out of the way.

[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.980]
So I whip over to the next lane.

[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.440]
And he whips over the next lane right behind me.

[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.500]
But like right on my tail with those bright headlights burning

[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.360]
in my eyes.

[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.180]
So I thought, well, maybe he wants to go somewhere in this lane.

[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.180]
So now I get back quickly over in the center lane.

[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.300]
He gets over in the center lane behind me.

[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.040]
We go by another 10 blocks.

[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.640]
All of a sudden here come, and I'm going to speed limit exactly

[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.000]
40 miles an hour on the dot.

[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.400]
We go by another 10 blocks.

[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.480]
All of a sudden here come his lights on for me to pull over.

[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.100]
So I pull over around a corner to get out of the way from traffic.

[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.500]
And he pulls up behind me, gets out, young black Metro cop.

[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.360]
And he says to me, he's got to use those blinkers.

[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.220]
When you're changing lanes, got to be a little more careful.

[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.780]
I said, well, I'm trying to get out of your way.

[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.480]
I said, I thought you had your bright headlights on.

[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.520]
I thought you wanted to get around.

[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.360]
You were going somewhere.

[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.060]
He says, well, maybe it was just me driving like a retard, huh?

[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.880]
That's my quoting verbatim.

[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.020]
I didn't want to touch that line because at this point,

[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.400]
I don't know exactly what's going on.

[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.760]
Okay.

[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.140]
I felt like saying, yeah, you've got it right on the nose pal.

[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.220]
So he said, well, here is this car.

[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.820]
I said 91.

[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.500]
He said, boy, what a beautiful car.

[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.560]
You don't want to get it all messed up.

[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.600]
Better be a little more careful.

[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.420]
I said, okay, have a great day.

[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.380]
So I turn around.

[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.920]
I get back on Northwest 7th Avenue.

[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.820]
I'm wondering to myself to see who I am.

[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.360]
Was it a joke?

[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.780]
I go about another 10 blocks.

[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.180]
I'm almost to where I'm going to turn at 81st Street.

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.300]
Here he comes again.

[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.520]
With this bright headlights on.

[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.620]
And he's over to the lane to my left.

[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.720]
And he motions to me to roll down a window.

[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.500]
We're both moving.

[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.820]
And he says, roll down that window.

[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.400]
I roll it down.

[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.360]
He says, I got a pig report for you.

[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.280]
And I almost passed out.

[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.780]
He's laughing.

[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.100]
And he said, you're a neorodger.

[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.940]
I said, yeah, now I'm moving along.

[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.160]
He pulls up to the lane to my right.

[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.300]
Rolls down his window.

[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.220]
Great show.

[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.360]
Great show.

[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.620]
The most incredible experience I think in recent memory.

[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.580]
I mean, just amazing.

[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.420]
Talk about it nearly.

[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.420]
I'm sure he's listening right.

[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.560]
You're a great American, sir.

[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.740]
And I'll never do it again.

[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.500]
Whatever I did, I'll never do it again.

[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.080]
Boy, I just was amazed.

[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.700]
Shocked.

[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.340]
Flabbergasted.

[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.280]
So between that guy and then a plantation pig

[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.460]
that came burrowing into my driveway last week.

[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.920]
Remember that?

[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.700]
It just loves the show.

[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.040]
We're big with the pigs.

[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.120]
In spite of popular rumor, okay?

[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.260]
Anyway, it's 11, it's 12 minutes after 10.

[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.800]
Daryl Strawberry, how about the big,

[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.480]
a straw man last night at two run home

[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.420]
or then comes up in the night

[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.520]
sitting with a tying run of third base and grounds up?

[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.700]
Boy, kind of a mixed bag.

[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.340]
Are the meds ever going to play on a road again

[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.760]
or they just play in all their games at home?

[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.840]
What the hell is going on?

[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.520]
Anyway, baseball's starting to get a little exciting.

[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.320]
We want some pizza from Flora's Rogers

[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.680]
in Irrubbinga's stomach again.

[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.100]
How about a meatball pizza?

[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.920]
Do they have meatball?

[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.120]
Huh?

[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.080]
Because you've got a picture.

[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.420]
Roger gets, when we were back in our little dieting,

[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.780]
our bogus dieting contest,

[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.640]
Roger used to try to get a little advantage

[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.900]
by stimulating my appetite by leaving in front of me

[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.000]
as he would get out of the studio at 10 o'clock in the morning.

[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.580]
A magazine called Pizza, what is it?

[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.300]
Pizza today.

[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.900]
Here it is.

[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.920]
In fact, he just happened to have left it again here today.

[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.920]
And you'd start leafing through this

[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.740]
and see these pictures.

[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.160]
You just go nuts and immediately,

[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.680]
you know you're going to have all kinds of pies

[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.480]
and crap come in here.

[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.100]
That was the way he gained a little edge temporarily.

[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.460]
They'll start to pick it out himself.

[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.140]
So now he leaves a picture with a note on it.

[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.300]
Hungry today, question mark.

[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.820]
New pies on the block.

[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.200]
And it's got a picture of a pepper and meatball pizza

[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.340]
that look with extra cheese.

[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.960]
That looks so incredibly great.

[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.200]
So I figure Flora's will probably bring one up right away, right?

[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.160]
We don't want to impose on Jeff again, do we?

[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.140]
Now we don't want to impose on him

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.940]
because he's too busy giving all those free pizzas out

[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.300]
to the nose contest people, right?

[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.680]
We better do some business here.

[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.120]
It's 10, 13 at WIOD.

[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.520]
So I bet your Flora's will be on a phone

[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.040]
in just a second or Jeff or whoever.

[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.760]
Cause Roger, starving over here.

[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.280]
All you mothers out there got good news for you this Sunday

[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.840]
on Mother's Day instead of just going to some

[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.700]
pedestrian place like Lenny's or something like that

[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.120]
for Mother's Day, which isn't too exciting.

[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.800]
Why not go to the Spice Dampel and Spice Up Mom's Day.

[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.760]
They're starting with brunch on Mother's Day

[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.640]
from 11 in the EM till 2 in the PM.

[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.620]
And then dinner starts at 2 o'clock this Sunday

[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.080]
at both Spice Dampel restaurants,

[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.440]
featuring complete dinners at unbelievable prices

[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.680]
even at kids menu and special Mother's Day coupons

[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.220]
will be in the following newspapers this week.

[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.880]
Check out the Showtime section of the Sun

[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.420]
Sentinel this Friday, the Boca News on Friday,

[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.040]
the Palm Beach Post tomorrow, and the Helen Dale Digest

[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.940]
and Jewish Journal.

[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.680]
I'm Thursday and Friday this week, tomorrow and Friday.

[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.260]
And when you go to the Spice Dampel,

[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.300]
you can choose from two great specials for Mother's Day,

[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.480]
Roastlegg of Lamb or Bakes Stuffed Orange Ruffy

[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.560]
stuffed with shrimp and lobster,

[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.500]
or choose from the Spice Dampel's complete regular menu

[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.740]
with that delicious gourmet country and seafood stuff,

[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.520]
all of that down-home comfortable North Carolina setting.

[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.780]
It is incredible, it's all homemade, delicious.

[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.900]
So make mom real happy this Sunday

[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.300]
by taking her over to the Spice Dampel

[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.400]
for a fantastic feast.

[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.580]
Seeding will be limited, so call now, make reservations.

[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.880]
I'm Griffin Road, a mile west of I-95.

[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.360]
The number there is 962-0772.

[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.940]
962-0772 and in Boca, 2700 North Federal Highway

[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.680]
just north of Glades Road, 394-3100.

[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.200]
394-3100, do it up big this Sunday for Mother's Day

[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.620]
at the Spice Dampel.

[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.260]
What a beautiful letter here

[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.420]
in the a new times yesterday that I miss somehow

[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.160]
that George just handed me the Neal thing it says.

[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.460]
Susan Coole's, Give Me A Brick,

[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.200]
Letters April 17, her coming to the defensive neal rushers

[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.020]
was about as short-sighted and hypocritical as that moron is.

[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.520]
Wow, anyone who has listened to that garbage

[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.420]
of a radio program undoubtedly has heard

[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:45.080]
some of the exact sort of prejudice and ignorance and intolerance that Susan seems to be so concerned about.

[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.740]
Ooooooh! That's because this rodent of a man feeds and gets rich off the idea of stirring and arousing

[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:56.520]
the funny bones of an audience composed exclusively of simple-minded, lethargic Joe Sixpaks who have

[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:02.500]
no lives by using a brand of humor that is distasteful at best, disgraceful at worst.

[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.420]
Gee, don't you just love those Arab 7-Eleven jokes that he pops from time to time?

[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.340]
How about Mr. Rogers' wonderful descriptions of the elderly on Miami Beach?

[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.020]
My personal favorites. Isn't that interesting? My personal favorites, so must be somebody who listens a

[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.940]
lot, right? Richard Salis in Miami Lakes? My personal favorites are the ones where he gets off

[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.480]
on being Jewish by playing those silly little bits and pieces that poke fun at Judaism,

[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.920]
even though he claims to be an atheist and let us not forget his hate-filled discriminatory

[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.280]
anti-biolingualism campaign of a few years back, not exactly ancient history. The problem with Susan's

[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.020]
letter was that she overlooked the fact that the Neorodger show is a perfect symptom of what is

[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:47.140]
wrong with South Florida, a population of ignorant, isolated, unaware people being exploited by

[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:52.840]
unproductive useless, extreme stupidity, with an ignorant, isolated, and unaware, shmuck feeding off

[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:59.460]
it all. I think he's got a pretty well-done pat, don't you? I didn't see all the words used to

[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.020]
describe Neorodgers in the best of Miami issue, but I'm going to add one more. He's a jackass!

[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.440]
Damn right, Dick. Dick Salis in Miami Lakes excellent letter, and I'm sure he's listening right now.

[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.280]
All the lines in date are open again today. I kind of took that personally yesterday. Everything

[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.100]
else is tied up, and then I listened to Rick Insadzen was the same syndrome. Is there another thing

[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:25.380]
going on in date? Maybe they have a big party at Dick's house over in lakes. 751 WIOD in date,

[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:34.000]
something really bizarre going on. Are they getting ready for the new flotella? Oh, I'm sorry,

[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:45.340]
Miami. Is this another Metz fan calling in? That was our first Metz fan of the day ladies and

[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.540]
gentlemen, or they must be just in heaven today. They probably were a little nervous when he

[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:55.000]
hit that tremendous two-run homer that made the game a lot closer after nearly blowing a six

[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.760]
nothing lead. We have an open line on the Starline, Star IOD in two and date, 751. What does he say?

[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:07.260]
751 Jackass. Fort Lauderdale. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I want to congratulate you on that great

[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:12.640]
opening, inspiring opening on the show this morning. Are you another Joe Sixpaxer who has no life at all?

[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.300]
What was that? Well, the guy that writes the letter, he said, what does he describe all the people

[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:28.520]
who said, ignorant, isolated, unaware? I don't understand those big words. Good job, Dick,

[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:35.080]
right on target. He's got a lot of open lines in Dave County. You keep giving him out in English.

[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.800]
Sir, are you one of those bigoted, rough people at this guy's writing about?

[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.220]
Let's get back to the ball game. Let's get back to the game, Nelson.

[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.620]
Yes. Is that all you're going to talk about today or the Cubs?

[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.540]
Yeah, great. No, I'm going to talk about the Penguin Bruin game. Did you see that?

[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.120]
No, I didn't get that out of the set.

[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.660]
Will the little fan of the dead in Rackie put the hand left? Will the little takes over?

[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.520]
Right to the far!

[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.900]
The big far! Will the little fan of the poor Gary?

[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.080]
Pretty exciting, huh, sir? Yes, sir.

[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.180]
Will you a little bit of ignorant morons out there that I'm feeding on?

[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.840]
I couldn't watch the game because I was watching Roseanne.

[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.320]
Oh, okay. Well, that's more our speed, anyone.

[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:22.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.060]
Well, have a great day.

[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:31.420]
Well, enjoy your show and I'll be around for the duration, even though some of us have, uh,

[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.240]
no lives. Right, right. I'll still away though. Take care, and you. Okay, bye.

[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.680]
10-21 at WIOD, we have an open line in Broward, 5-2-4 that's ringing as I speak,

[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.100]
as in ringing in your ears. Hey, listen, all you ignorant slabs out there want to have a great time

[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.360]
today? Let's have a big congregation of like a hundred thousand ignorant misses go out to the

[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.740]
Swap Shop and just have one hell of a good time. Watch the elephants do their thing near, lift their

[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.540]
tail and their trunk simultaneously. And the amazing part of it is the same thing drops out of both.

[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.720]
At the Swap Shop on West Sunrise between 9.95, the turnpike, they have the Daily Circus,

[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.720]
Daily Monday through Friday. There were two shows, four big shows on the weekend for people

[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.300]
who have no lives at all every Saturday and Sunday. This is called 7-9-1 Swap for Daily Circus

[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:18.820]
Times and also for concert times this weekend for Conway Twitty, who sings about this town at

[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.820]
famous song His It's Only Make Believe. The Saturday the 11th and Sunday May the 12th. And of course

[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.780]
millions of great items for you to pick up new and used bargains inside and out at the Swap Shop

[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.760]
and money back guarantee on every piece of merchandise that you buy. So if you want to have a great day

[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.840]
and just go away and try to pretend you do have a life, this is a good place to do it. At the Swap Shop

[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:43.180]
on West Sunrise Boulevard between the turnpike and I, 95. Hi, this is Rick and Sun. If you missed

[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:48.040]
us yesterday, you missed this. I like to know if I could really try on your shoes. It's really

[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.000]
important that I just, if I could try on your shoes real quick. I mean I'll get them right back.

[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:58.680]
I was just expecting everybody to take them off for a second. I mean I'll leave my minor

[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:04.480]
worst more than that. These are $150. All right, he's taking them off. I'm going to take my

[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:11.560]
off now. You're kidding. That's just your buddy. Wow. They're on me. Are you kidding?

[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.680]
I got your shoes on. You're wearing your shoes? Yeah. Okay, how black hell.

[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.440]
Go. Go. Go. You want to get that go. I want them to chase you. I'll give you another 25

[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.160]
bucks if you have them chase you. You want them to run? Run. I'm taking over this guy's shoes, okay?

[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.700]
Okay. All right, I'm out of the parking lot. Go. What do I do? Run.

[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.280]
No, look like that. Remember? All right, I'm not all the way to the streets.

[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.780]
Well, I don't ever miss this again, okay? Here's a thousand dollars. And be here today at two o'clock

[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:56.020]
on 610 W-I-O-D. Here's Ricardo Motobon and the Chrysler New Yorker. This luxury automobile has

[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:02.260]
always delivered the performance you'd expect from a New Yorker. And now Chrysler introduces

[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:09.600]
an onboard microprocessor which even speaks to you just like a New Yorker. Hey,

[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.620]
more Ron, you want to put on your seatbelt or would you rather eat the steering wheel, eh?

[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:21.260]
Ah, yes. This is truly a New Yorker. All right, genius. You left the goddamn headlights on.

[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:26.700]
Jeez, you want some, eh? All you know that. And for the most dangerous city in the world,

[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.760]
a security system second to none. Hey, bagel, praise. You want to lock the

[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.140]
fucking doors? Or maybe we should put a fucking sign in the window and say, rip me off.

[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.920]
Yes, the Chrysler New Yorker. If you can find a better luxury car, buy it.

[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.620]
The brightest, dipshit. I got your luxury right here.

[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.120]
So, you're going to get a car from Flores yet? You're probably not even open yet. Well,

[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.160]
Roger's hungry. Roger's hungry. You know, I think the only way we're going to solve the

[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.340]
date problem because they all start to get lit up again and they dropped off. There must be

[00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.400]
something real exciting going on. We don't know about. Let's do screenless in date only.

[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.340]
So, answer the other ones and just leave date to ring. Okay, that's the only way we're going to

[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:10.720]
get them back. 751 WYOD in date. And good luck to you. Sunrise. Hello.

[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.520]
Hi, this is Greg from Sunrise. First time caller on Tom listener. Yes, Greg. How you doing today?

[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.980]
Great. Are you another one of those ignorant unaware people isolated?

[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.300]
Yes, matter of fact, I had to run out and get me a six pack before the show started.

[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.460]
Good. Bottom's up. That's what Henry says.

[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.040]
I've been listening to you ever since the dean left the station

[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.600]
aired. Yes. I got around to calling. Yes, dummy. What's that?

[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.520]
I say, I hope you're having a great day so far. Oh, I am. It's beautiful.

[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.800]
I'm on vacation this week. Hi, yeah. And you're staying here? Of course.

[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.400]
Oh, God. You are ignorant and unaware. The guy was right out there. Can I isolated,

[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.680]
definitely isolated? But what am I supposed to do? Go up since Maddie?

[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.400]
Yeah, that would be a good place. Have you ever watched a life of Brian at Money,

[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.320]
Python movie? One of the all-time greats. Of course. I don't know if you have any notice,

[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:06.020]
but I think Gilbert started that movie. It was a Pontchist pilot's friend from Rome.

[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.200]
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Okay, I just want to close the eye.

[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.440]
And you have yourself a good day. Okay. Yeah, by the way.

[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.720]
Bottoms up. 1028 at WIOD.

[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.180]
Dave County. Hello.

[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.420]
Hello. Hello. Yeah. Neil. Yeah. Are you doing, buddy? Okay, pal.

[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.860]
I just got out of the shower. So, and I heard you say you're going to go scream.

[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.140]
But I figured out everybody's taking a shower indeed. That's what's going on.

[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.460]
Well, Neil, when you go to bed late, you got to take a shower when you wake up, no?

[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.300]
I guess so. Yeah. So how you doing? I'm doing great so far. How are you doing?

[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.300]
We have an open line at Broward 524WIOD. We're doing screenless indeed.

[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.280]
Oh, really? Yeah. That's why I call because I never call it usually.

[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.360]
Why not? I don't know. I feel like I'm having a problem.

[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.620]
Well, maybe you're not one of those ignorant unaware slime balls that listen to this show.

[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.200]
Oh, really? Am I? You have a six pack handy?

[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.760]
No, not a problem. I don't drink or smoke it.

[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.080]
Are you serious? Really?

[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.680]
Almost are good. I mean, that's very healthy. You know how that is.

[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.440]
Yeah. What about yourself? Are you a dining right now?

[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.760]
Am I what? Dining? I'm dying. Yeah.

[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.160]
No, no, I'm dying. I'm dieting over here.

[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.740]
I don't know who would do if you'd die. I mean,

[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.880]
is there going to start your host? I mean,

[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.960]
while you probably wouldn't be isolated and unaware anymore,

[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.680]
and you'd probably start drinking like liqueurs instead,

[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.840]
something a little more classy.

[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.660]
All right, Neil. I'm out of, as your colors always say, out of material.

[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.340]
Okay. Well, why don't you want? Okay. Wipe down good now.

[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.260]
Hey, don't get crazy. Okay. All right, let's see you.

[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.700]
Now, let me ask you something. How come you're what just happened there?

[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.520]
We're doing screenless in the Georgia's little confused, I think, in date only.

[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.540]
Date only. W-I-O-D.

[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.220]
All right, birthday tonight. I'm lighting the entire city of Miami to come sit on my face.

[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.960]
Oh, man, I knew that joy would get back on one way or another, wouldn't it?

[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.000]
W-I-O-D.

[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.000]
Neil. Yes. How you doing?

[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.660]
Okay. Neil, I want to ask you something.

[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.780]
Okay. Didn't you use to be in Nashville or in Memphis?

[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.980]
Four weeks, yes, for exhaustive, excruciating weeks.

[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.380]
Oh, in 1980.

[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.340]
You know, I have no desire to go back.

[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.060]
No, I have no desire to go back.

[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.040]
Do you have a desire to go there?

[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.220]
Oh, wow. Yeah, I like Nashville.

[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.140]
What do you like about it?

[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.020]
I just love, I mean, I have the tourist I like going there.

[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.580]
I like to go see the Grand Old Opera.

[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.000]
Oh, yeah, that's my favorite.

[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.160]
I can go see Conway, Twiti at the Swap Shop for free.

[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.200]
I don't got to go all the way up there with those Yahoo's.

[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.960]
Well, with all those troglonites who are hatched out of a gigantic Martian egg.

[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.200]
There'll be plenty, plenty of blue-collar women there.

[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.020]
Believe me for Conway.

[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.020]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.840]
Man, it might be a good time to go and women watch.

[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.420]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:41.080]
Okay.

[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.760]
You'll anyway, Carthels never won.

[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.360]
Remember that.

[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.780]
Yeah, the Cardinals had a good game against Atlanta last night,

[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.380]
though the end of the year, too.

[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.440]
Only team in the Eastern Division had lost.

[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.760]
I want to rub it in, I think.

[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.120]
What the?

[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.180]
That was pathetic.

[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.080]
Nine to two.

[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.060]
Even if I turned it off after about the third inning,

[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:54.980]
it was so bad.

[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.200]
Did you watch any of the hockey game?

[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.060]
Just a little bit.

[00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.260]
I'm not a real hockey fan.

[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.800]
Any exciting first period, though, until I think Chuck is right, though.

[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.700]
The Penguin, unless the things turn around, they...

[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.220]
I mean, both games in Boston, the Bruins one,

[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.560]
and both games in Pittsburgh, the Penguins one,

[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.900]
now they go back to Boston, so.

[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.220]
Well, I like...

[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.560]
I mean, I watched it sometimes,

[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.180]
but I don't know that much about it.

[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.520]
You don't have to know a lot about it.

[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.700]
Just call up Chuck in the newsroom, he'll fill you in.

[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.860]
He'll tell you the penguins are great.

[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.320]
Can I say something?

[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.780]
I'll tell you, Mary O'Lehmue is God and...

[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.280]
Recky and all those guys.

[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.880]
They're regular recky crew.

[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.060]
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.780]
I just want to say that Alan definitely is not a douchebag.

[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.320]
Okay.

[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:32.860]
Okay.

[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:33.520]
Thank you.

[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.080]
Sweet dreams.

[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:34.340]
Bye.

[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.940]
1031 at WIOD, screenless and date.

[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.080]
I don't think they're following this.

[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:38.880]
I'll allow a couple of...

[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.920]
They're all flashing and date.

[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.000]
Are they flashing it and date?

[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.520]
And we have one of...

[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.100]
Obviously, this guy in Miami Lakes is listening right now.

[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.700]
We probably should try to call him a little later on.

[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.140]
Don't you think?

[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.720]
Have a little chat with him on the air,

[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.680]
see what his problem is.

[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.180]
Because he quotes...

[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.440]
The ones that I love the best are the ones who just despise the show.

[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.200]
I'm a jackass.

[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.800]
Everybody who likes the show is an idiot.

[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.140]
But they can quote chapter in verse every bit, every line, every word.

[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.320]
For like the last 10 to 15 years that I've been on the air here,

[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.140]
which is only 15.

[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.780]
We have an open line in the center square and brown,

[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.480]
at 524WIOD.

[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.000]
I'm going to have a problem with date ringing.

[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.520]
It's kind of like a throws you off balance.

[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.600]
Lake Worth.

[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.000]
Closing.

[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.400]
Let's get those Edmonds and oils out of there so we can have a whole USA Stanley Cup.

[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.240]
You sound like a bigot to me, eh?

[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:23.940]
No.

[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:24.300]
Eh?

[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.220]
Good point, though.

[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:25.840]
But those penguins.

[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.420]
Well, the North Stars are ahead two games to one and they're playing where they plan tonight.

[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:29.880]
Minnesota.

[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:30.780]
Are you serious?

[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.120]
Yeah.

[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.100]
Oh, man. They go.

[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.080]
They win tonight and it's all over but the shooting.

[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.800]
They need to win that one this way, yeah.

[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.600]
They lose an Emmetton.

[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.320]
They still got to come back and play in the...

[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.620]
Well, you should have watched the game last night.

[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.320]
They didn't have any Canadian national anthem.

[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.740]
I watched it last night.

[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.580]
In Pittsburgh, you had two Boston and Pittsburgh.

[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.960]
Have you seen as much nothing in that off as this series or what?

[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.480]
Did you see where they were shown?

[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.740]
Both of Mandy Moggen, who's the guy for Boston for Pittsburgh?

[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:56.800]
What's his name?

[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.280]
The goalie?

[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:57.980]
Baratso.

[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:58.660]
Baratso.

[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.800]
He was... what he was doing was like muscling it like up so it was real loose.

[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.300]
He kept back in that net and like pushing it so it was like barely on the magnet

[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.780]
so that if anything happened he could just breathe on it and it would fall off and they'd have to stop to play.

[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:12.180]
Exactly.

[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:12.900]
Pretty clever.

[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.440]
Yeah.

[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.620]
Mandy Moggen played a great game last night, by the way, all over.

[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.840]
They're coming down to two good series.

[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.340]
Yeah.

[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.880]
Well, it's kind of refreshing that you're going to have Boston, Pittsburgh, Minnesota,

[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.420]
or well, Edmonton will be out.

[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.760]
We hope if it's the first three teams and any of those two it'll be great in the Stanley Cup.

[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.240]
Get rid of those same old teams, Calgary and Edmonton and the Canadians.

[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.700]
Get some new blood in there.

[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.520]
New breed, like...

[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:35.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.440]
Especially in baseball, like getting the metto hell out of there.

[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:38.680]
Right.

[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.360]
Bringing the club.

[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:40.860]
All right, Neil.

[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.620]
Listen, only 147 days to pop.

[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.280]
We tried to blow that game so hard last night.

[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.120]
You have no idea.

[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.280]
The ninth inning starts and Harry's already.

[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.280]
They're showing Bob Scanlon as kid, the rookie in the dugout, and Harry's saying,

[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.020]
well, it's going to be his first major league win.

[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.860]
And tomorrow the Cubs are going to try to sweep.

[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.560]
He already wraps these things up.

[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.800]
He hasn't learned his lesson yet.

[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:58.480]
Exactly.

[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.820]
And then we're throwing a ball around the ballpark like a bunch of sandlot kids.

[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.700]
Dunston makes an incredible catch of a foul pop fly and he takes an easy ground ball.

[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.740]
It should have been the end of the game.

[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.380]
Bobbles it and then throws it away.

[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.920]
Listen, I got a spy report.

[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:10.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.060]
Don Brainer.

[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.600]
Yeah.

[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.440]
It's still breaking, Trotter's is running down.

[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.380]
Okay, good news.

[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:14.580]
Please.

[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.240]
See you.

[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.540]
1034 at WIOD.

[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.220]
We have an open line in the center square and Broward, 524 and 1 in Palm Beach,

[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.200]
655 WIOD.

[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.500]
We're doing screenless and dayd, hello.

[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.440]
Tantaram, tantaram, tantaram, tantaram, tantaram.

[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.760]
Oh, this must be Alex Jr.

[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.480]
It's got to be.

[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.200]
How are you doing, Nia?

[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.120]
Where have you been?

[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.220]
Magtime, no park.

[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:33.880]
How come?

[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.520]
I've been busy.

[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.900]
And it's all bad about that now.

[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:38.540]
Yeah.

[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.920]
I saw Chuck Meyer in the hallway.

[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.360]
He didn't stop in to thank me for playing that wonderful goal with Bob Cole.

[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.020]
Hey, Juddy Bar, Jr. hasn't called you in a long time.

[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:47.680]
No, it's true.

[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.580]
Well, he's probably busy.

[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.700]
They've got him strapped in the nets and Toronto waiting for Maxine to start.

[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.400]
Hey, Nia, how good is Rochester?

[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:55.740]
For what?

[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.320]
Well, I might be going there.

[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:58.840]
For?

[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.460]
I got a job offer.

[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.460]
In Rochester, you'd love it.

[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.380]
It's a great town.

[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.580]
So the weather sucks if you can handle that.

[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.640]
You can handle that weather.

[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:08.580]
It's tremendous.

[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.760]
It's a wonderful place.

[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.840]
Have you heard of Ashley Audio?

[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:11.640]
No, sir.

[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:12.400]
Pretty.

[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.900]
The Amplifier Eastman Kodak at Baush and Lomb.

[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.140]
Well, Ashley Audio.

[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:16.900]
Tiki Freeman.

[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.600]
Ashley Audio's in the Rochester also.

[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.540]
Don and Bob's at Kedette Cleaners and Foxes Deli.

[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.420]
Pretty all those.

[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.180]
Did you cool that?

[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.080]
No, I didn't say that.

[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.440]
I said if you can handle a cold weather, it's a nice place to live.

[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.800]
But I mean nasty weather.

[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.780]
I mean, ten-foot, no, okay, laugh now.

[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.100]
And cry later, I'm warning you.

[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.700]
I mean, nasty.

[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.980]
Lots and lots of snow and sleet and driving on the ice.

[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.520]
Talk about skating on thin ice.

[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.580]
Well, I shouldn't visit in the summer then.

[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.400]
Well, if you want to dilute yourself,

[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.280]
go there like in the middle of July during the July line.

[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:50.300]
Great.

[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:50.940]
Like the week of summer.

[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.000]
And the week we have summer, that's exactly right.

[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.680]
And you'll love it.

[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.800]
Not so it's a good town.

[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.240]
It is.

[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.040]
Oh, why?

[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.340]
I'd get out of here, believe me,

[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.660]
because there's nothing but a bunch of mindless idiots down here.

[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.700]
Are isolated unaware.

[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.040]
I don't know, maybe I can.

[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.220]
The larger, simple minded.

[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.280]
Six-packed.

[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.760]
I think the guy actually hits it on a head pretty well here,

[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.400]
quite frankly.

[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.240]
He says South Florida is a population of ignorant,

[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.700]
isolated unaware people,

[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.760]
being exploited by unproductive useless extremes.

[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.380]
Stupidity.

[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.600]
What's, I think he's on target.

[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.280]
I think he's got something there.

[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.780]
Yeah, but he didn't include himself.

[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.040]
Well, he probably didn't, just didn't want to admit it.

[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.580]
Well, have a great life, Alan.

[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.640]
Hey, hey, you got a birthday coming up, don't you?

[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.800]
No, not that I know of.

[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.180]
But let's pretend that today's my birthday.

[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.340]
And everybody can call and say,

[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.380]
happy birthday since everybody's out of material.

[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.740]
Yeah, so everybody's doing those triple black cherry

[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.320]
of vanilla pancake.

[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:38.980]
Butloads, yeah.

[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:39.840]
Yeah.

[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.620]
Because I was wondering when you're going to have the next

[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.620]
reunion in the area studio for free food.

[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.740]
Not, uh, not anytime soon.

[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.340]
So, fathers can go buy, you know.

[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:47.820]
Mm-hmm.

[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.640]
Take it easy, Neil.

[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.600]
Let's see Alex.

[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:50.640]
Have a great life.

[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:51.700]
Go penguin.

[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.260]
Okay.

[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.680]
1036 at WIOD.

[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.020]
We were doing screenless in day.

[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:56.720]
They're all flashing.

[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.080]
And two open lines in brown,

[00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.620]
at 524 WIOD.

[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:01.980]
Snapple is sitting here on a counter.

[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.040]
I got like six packs.

[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.720]
See, I'm Joe six pack too.

[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.800]
Only I got my Snapple.

[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.020]
So, guy is right.

[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.240]
But Snapple has no garbage in it.

[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.700]
You know, you got to be careful about that garbage

[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.480]
you put in your body.

[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.120]
Or some people out there just put anything in.

[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.580]
And that's why you just

[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.840]
swig down gallons and gallons every year of those soft drinks.

[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.840]
Look on the label sometime.

[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.780]
All the artificial, everything is artificial.

[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.780]
Even a bottle is artificial.

[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.380]
What I plastic and all those chemicals

[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.300]
leaching inside and just mung.

[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.460]
Snapple is really the best.

[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.800]
Because it's 100% natural.

[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.400]
Whether it's the juices or the sodas

[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.120]
or the unsweetened salchres like the black cherry

[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.320]
that I got in my hand right now.

[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.860]
All made with the best stuff on the face of the earth.

[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.180]
And it's all in glass bottles too, resealable.

[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.000]
So, if you're like not all at thirsty,

[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:42.700]
you want to drink camp.

[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.400]
Just swig it down.

[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.040]
Have a great time.

[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.840]
Or if you want to drink two, three, six packs

[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.180]
like most of our six pack audience,

[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.300]
just go ahead and do that too.

[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.600]
Check out Snapple.

[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.400]
Once we get you hooked,

[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.560]
you'll forget about all that other stuff

[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.900]
with all the chemicals and cramp in it.

[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.520]
You'll find Snapple available at

[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.480]
Freddy's Albertsons and the prestigious stop

[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.980]
and go go out and stock up today.

[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.140]
Okay, we're having a little conference here

[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:06.520]
on the air.

[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.220]
Ladies and gentlemen,

[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.480]
Nick Tregoni and Mike Disney

[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.460]
and Cheryl, our executive assistant,

[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.780]
the trouble maker, Yenta,

[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.300]
are in the studio now.

[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.140]
We're planning our trip,

[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.220]
a long way to trip to Chicago this summer,

[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.720]
which we have no idea what weekend it's going to be

[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.880]
or what the hell is going on.

[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:20.860]
Or whether we're going to stay

[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.140]
at the Yasup Kitchen this year,

[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.260]
again, like we did last year.

[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.920]
I mean, I do like the Camilla sounds

[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.880]
and we do a lot of great work,

[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.280]
but I don't necessarily want to stay there

[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.120]
unless it's absolutely necessary, okay?

[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.020]
And two years ago,

[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.260]
we stayed at the Ritz Carlton.

[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.360]
So, we're going to get this all straight

[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:34.920]
and out with him.

[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.320]
We have it right from the horse's tail.

[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.780]
The thing that bothers me is when you work for a douchebag.

[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:39.220]
Yes.

[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:39.740]
You see?

[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.400]
Exactly.

[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.140]
Oh, by the way, I have a special...

[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:42.500]
You should get it better.

[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.960]
Since Mr. Tregoni, one of our headcocks broadcasting haunches,

[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:46.720]
I see you've got wives

[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.760]
and got rid of those blockbusters,

[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.700]
by the way, just in time.

[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.580]
I have a special tape that I'd like to play for him

[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.800]
and I'm sure everybody will enjoy.

[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.560]
Mike Disney's Jewish Would You Believe It?

[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.760]
Fleetwood Grover Gary Bruce 2

[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.960]
Henry Barrow's Jewish Could You Conceive It?

[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.720]
And could Old Phil Costan Is Too?

[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.980]
Johnny Duck is yet his can't you smell it?

[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.700]
When Freight is nearly on the Garcia's too?

[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.180]
As a matter of fact,

[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.620]
all the cocks employees are Jewish

[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.820]
since I fell in love with you.

[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.140]
We've had Mill again,

[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.480]
since I fell in love with you.

[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.820]
Mill the Gantanelli,

[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.960]
since I fell in love with you.

[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.900]
Okay, it's Aguizun.

[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.500]
So what do you want to come in and take calls from the audience today?

[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.040]
Sure.

[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.040]
You want to do that?

[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.600]
We've never done that before.

[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.740]
You know when Sandy was here when the station had a one,

[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.160]
and most of those people were the walking dead,

[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:50.920]
have a seat here.

[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.880]
Nick Tregoni is here.

[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.860]
Now Disney of course is too chicken to do this,

[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.240]
but Mr. Tregoni of course,

[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.140]
it makes the big bucks.

[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.360]
He can handle it.

[00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.700]
I'd be glad to do it.

[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.540]
Of course, he's also one of those Joe Six packs.

[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.480]
He's part of my audience.

[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.360]
He listens in on a listen line every day,

[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.420]
spies up there in Atlanta.

[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.100]
A population of ignorant, isolated, unaware people being exploited

[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.140]
by an unproductive schmuck named Neo Rodgers.

[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.100]
That's the letter in New Times.

[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:11.840]
They love me here.

[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.260]
See that?

[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:12.920]
So, huh?

[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:13.880]
They love me.

[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.620]
So anyway, what should we do?

[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.700]
Should we, well, let's see what these people have to say.

[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.440]
This is like ask the manager.

[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.920]
This is going to be great.

[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.800]
Cheryl, why are you directing?

[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:26.560]
What is it?

[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.460]
Would you just relax?

[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.760]
Why is everybody so hyper?

[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.020]
So if there's anybody you'd like to have off the air,

[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.840]
like me, any complaints, anything you'd like to say great about us,

[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.240]
here's the guy.

[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:37.220]
I don't know.

[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:37.920]
Is it on, George?

[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:39.720]
Can you hear me?

[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:40.820]
I can hear you.

[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:41.540]
Disney.

[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.900]
Moving real close.

[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.800]
Pretend you know something.

[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:44.820]
Disney's sitting down here.

[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.280]
We're going to do ask the manager.

[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.380]
Let's talk about White Chuck Meyer.

[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.180]
Is it on Saturday morning stuff like that?

[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:51.780]
Okay.

[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:52.860]
Pemberpine, hello.

[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:53.940]
Leo.

[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:54.340]
Yeah.

[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.900]
How about the Monday morning, huh?

[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.580]
You have to know.

[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.720]
Do you want to speak to our head, honcho, sir?

[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.120]
Oh, is there anything there?

[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:00.960]
Yeah, he's right here.

[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.520]
Yeah, I'm right here.

[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.280]
All right, Disney, no.

[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.760]
Forget this cup thing.

[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.500]
Put it in Pittsburgh.

[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.380]
Cubs are great.

[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.480]
Put it in remote in Pittsburgh.

[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.240]
Pittsburgh sucks.

[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.340]
But I mean, come on now.

[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.600]
The cubs are already out of it.

[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.580]
Yeah, that's Chuck Meyer.

[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.040]
That's too much influence.

[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:13.520]
What's Chuck?

[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.100]
I mean, take Chuck Meyer.

[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:15.640]
Leave me alone.

[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:16.700]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.780]
I don't want to go to Pittsburgh.

[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.260]
Well, that's all right.

[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.200]
I'd rather go to Orlando before I go to Pittsburgh

[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.300]
and I'd rather be dead before I went back to Orlando.

[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.680]
You know that that Pittsburgh pirates

[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.940]
made Lady take off her costume at the game Saturday?

[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.380]
Well, that's the most excitement they've had there

[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.300]
in a long time, sir.

[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.660]
It said the pirates could be sued

[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.000]
if someone was hurt trying to...

[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.760]
Don't you want to talk?

[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.140]
I mean, here's your chance of a lifetime.

[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.000]
Come on.

[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.960]
He's not a real person.

[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.040]
He's never going to happen again.

[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.500]
He's not a real person, do you?

[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:41.860]
You're right.

[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.400]
He can't be.

[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.100]
Well, how about Mr. Tregoni now?

[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.160]
He's like one step below the sisters.

[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.120]
Tregoni.

[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.620]
Almost without the money.

[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.080]
He plays for the maple leaf, don't he?

[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:50.400]
Exactly.

[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:50.920]
Goal.

[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.740]
Okay, have a nice life.

[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.300]
See, it's right.

[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.380]
The guy in the article is right.

[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.040]
We have a bunch of ignorant Joe Sixpacks.

[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:55.520]
I agree.

[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.200]
I agree.

[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.360]
And that's what we like.

[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.720]
Can I bring up a major point?

[00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.840]
Only if you speak into the mic.

[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.540]
This is radio.

[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.460]
Not TV now that he's in the TV division.

[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.300]
He doesn't know what a mic radio microphone is.

[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.740]
Can I bring up a major point about the executive assistant?

[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:07.280]
Yes.

[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.280]
She's married, right?

[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.540]
At this moment.

[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.020]
Why doesn't she have a diamond ring?

[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.020]
Well, she's kind of undecided.

[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.420]
I don't understand.

[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.940]
She kind of switches her husband and she?

[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:16.340]
For what?

[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.760]
Well, I was the judge.

[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:18.540]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.020]
Lake Worth.

[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:21.380]
Neil.

[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:21.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:22.860]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.240]
Okay.

[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.320]
First time caller.

[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:24.660]
Great.

[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.700]
Well, here's your big chance.

[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.440]
Hey, can I get you to do a cart for me?

[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.640]
Oh, no.

[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.100]
Don't hang up, please.

[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.660]
Come on, Neil.

[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.180]
What is it?

[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.380]
I'll write it down for later.

[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:36.820]
Huh?

[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:37.860]
I'll write it down.

[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.200]
Okay, that's good.

[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.220]
Come on, hurry up.

[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.660]
They're not going to stay in here too long.

[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.320]
Let's go.

[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.900]
Do the asshole song for me.

[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:44.220]
Okay.

[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.240]
Back off.

[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:45.940]
I'll call you back.

[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:46.820]
Come on.

[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:47.640]
Now, clean it up.

[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.360]
We got the crick-o-n-e sitting in here

[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.620]
and you're using all this language.

[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.080]
All right.

[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.760]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.400]
Up your is, pal.

[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:53.660]
Okay.

[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.460]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:54.720]
Hello.

[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.120]
Oh, probably chickened out.

[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:57.860]
Let's get...

[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:58.660]
Should we clear the lines?

[00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.240]
You think, George?

[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:00.700]
Should we clear them all?

[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.600]
Because we had them all go.

[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.900]
We had a great show in progress.

[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.780]
And these idiots came in here and screwed it all up.

[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.280]
Okay, let's clear the lines.

[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.800]
Here's your chance of a lifetime.

[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:08.380]
Here we go.

[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.720]
Taking my life in my hands.

[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200]
And those people who want to speak

[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.660]
directly to the horse's tail.

[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:13.260]
Here we go.

[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.120]
We got Mike Disney, who's kind of small potatoes.

[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.320]
And Nick Trigoni from Atlanta.

[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.580]
From Cox Corporate Headquarters in Atlanta.

[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.700]
The homados braves that just powered

[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.160]
their way over the Cardinals last night.

[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:23.780]
Nine to two.

[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:24.420]
Red hot.

[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.820]
That's your quota for this week.

[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.220]
Good.

[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.200]
Let's go to a Fort Lauderdale.

[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:28.500]
Hello.

[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.120]
Disney.

[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:29.960]
Yeah.

[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.400]
No more Yankee baseball.

[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.080]
You got to promise.

[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.980]
No more UM basketball.

[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.020]
Sorry, you can't do that one.

[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.380]
Underwater basket weaving.

[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.540]
Okay, I can handle that.

[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.060]
And we want Neil on six hours a day.

[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:46.780]
Yeah, thanks.

[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.340]
See you.

[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:47.940]
Get rid of him.

[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:48.620]
Can't afford it.

[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.460]
Get rid of him immediately.

[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.280]
Sunrise.

[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.600]
Boy Yankee baseball.

[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.360]
You got it.

[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.760]
Whatever you say.

[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.760]
Miami Beach.

[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:57.980]
Randy Morton's.

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.440]
Frugged.

[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.220]
That's my opinion.

[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.380]
Okay, thank you, sir.

[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.860]
Well, at least they're sure we get a lot of calls.

[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.520]
Yeah, very intelligent call is here.

[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.580]
Read the article again.

[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.140]
It'll give you a good idea who you're talking to.

[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:07.440]
Miami.

[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:07.840]
Hello.

[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:08.680]
Hello.

[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.180]
Yes, yes.

[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:10.680]
Yeah.

[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:11.520]
Oh, yes.

[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.020]
Okay.

[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.620]
Uh, bottom line.

[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.860]
The week ends are good at ISD.

[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.380]
Do something about it.

[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.600]
He said a weekend suck and I would be is what he said.

[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.480]
Come on.

[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.440]
Let's get some real living people in here on the weekend.

[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:23.800]
Okay.

[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.180]
Can you handle that, Disney?

[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:27.660]
No problem.

[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.520]
Whatever you say, sir.

[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:29.040]
Okay.

[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.500]
Neil, he's looking at the newspaper you have here.

[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.720]
He's with his finger.

[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.720]
I think he can't even read.

[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.040]
You hired him.

[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:35.940]
You hired him.

[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:36.300]
That is.

[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.160]
Don't remind me.

[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:37.620]
Miami.

[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.000]
Hello.

[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:38.640]
Neil.

[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:39.740]
Hey, what's up?

[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:40.420]
Does he still there?

[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.380]
They're both still here.

[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.800]
Hey, tell him to cut that news.

[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:43.560]
Weather traffic.

[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:44.380]
Crafts.

[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.540]
Yeah, get it right.

[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.180]
Get it in the right way.

[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.580]
I don't have a lot of everybody listening to that.

[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.800]
How about sky one, two, and three?

[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.340]
Do you like that?

[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.300]
I don't have to get some billboards up with your face on it, Neil.

[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.220]
Sky King and Penny.

[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:54.720]
Okay, Neil.

[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:55.080]
Okay.

[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.780]
Neil, can I ask you a question?

[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.100]
Yes.

[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.120]
Where's Sandy these days?

[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.080]
So she's still working tomorrow?

[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.620]
Sandy is in Channel 10.

[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.280]
She's doing consumer reports.

[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.960]
She doesn't do a very boring consumer report.

[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:05.660]
She's no major.

[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.900]
Drunked her out of the radio business.

[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.940]
Because when I used to come out here,

[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:09.920]
she worked deep.

[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.740]
No, when I used to come by here,

[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.280]
when I ran radio in the old days,

[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.100]
I'd come in here and it was never a phone call.

[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:19.320]
Does that, you know,

[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.140]
does that why she got country read the book?

[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.760]
You have to have listeners before you get phone calls.

[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.080]
That's what Steve says.

[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:27.860]
It's 1048.

[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.760]
We don't want to bring that up at WIODR.

[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.060]
Are you over your head with credit card and hospital bills?

[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.220]
Are bill collectors calling you at home and work?

[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.760]
Well, did you know you can't stop them from calling legally?

[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.680]
Three planes because of self-water traffic patterns,

[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.540]
it takes three planes to cover the tie-ups,

[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.380]
the delays, the detours,

[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.360]
and the accident.

[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.080]
Dan.

[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:15.920]
I looked up,

[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.480]
saw the statue of Lady Justice,

[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.400]
suddenly realized something.

[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:20.340]
Well,

[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.800]
I don't think she's wearing any underwear.

[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.940]
Tonight at 730 on Nightcourt.

[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.460]

Two of them have been run on.

[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.680]
There's a long ride.

[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.480]
Did seven feel way back?

[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.780]
Way back, you might be out of here.

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.440]
Hit it!

[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:51.900]
Holy cow!

[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.060]
Okay, just reminiscing about last night's game.

[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.280]
Let's get a lot of these calls in here.

[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.560]
A lot of the complaints out of your system.

[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:56.860]
Miami.

[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:57.360]
Deal.

[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:57.880]
Yes sir.

Fabulous. How you doing?

[00:34:59.080 --> 00:34:59.260]
Okay.

[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.320]
From Mr. Disney's,

[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.360]
it can send Hank to Vegas.

[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.500]
Why can't you go to Vegas?

[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:03.120]
Exactly.

[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:04.120]
That's what I want to know.

[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.720]
Yeah, why did I have to pay to go to Vegas

[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.900]
to have a good time this weekend?

[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:08.020]
Right?

[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:08.840]
All the speeches.

[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.880]
All the speeches they've got none.

[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:11.680]
Yes, speechless.

[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.180]
He's holding his head in his hand.

[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:13.840]
Which one?

[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:15.500]
Neil.

[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.680]
Let me just tell you this.

[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:16.940]
Okay.

[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:17.260]
Yes sir.

[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.340]
I will talk to Mr. Disney after we get to see him.

[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:19.840]
Get him straight.

[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:20.100]
No.

[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.640]
I don't want you wrong here.

[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:22.060]
You know what I mean?

[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.480]
Gotta go on chicken crate airlines

[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.320]
to all these places.

[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.740]
How about going like first class?

[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.320]
He should send you first class.

[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:27.820]
Top drawer.

[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080]
At Ritz Carlton.

[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.060]
At Ritz Carlton.

[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.540]
Staying in the Marajan Vegas for a week show out there.

[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.040]
Absolutely.

[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.080]
No matter if we got it, we're already planned.

[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:35.840]
I must be psychic.

[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.060]
We have a pizza ex-boned February 3rd through 5th 92

[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.680]
in Vegas next year.

[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.300]
We'll be there.

[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.560]
And we are going to be there.

[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.380]
And Nick Trigone has already committed himself to it.

[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.140]
I've committed it.

[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:46.460]
Okay.

[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.500]
I'm going to talk to Disney.

[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:47.900]
It's done.

[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:48.540]
It's done.

[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.300]
Opalaka.

[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.900]
Oh, look guys, there's still there.

[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.040]
They should double your salary

[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.760]
or give you two or three months off a year.

[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.720]
Now you're talking.

[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.520]
He'll ride your seat.

[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.260]
Starting today.

[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.940]
Guys, can't screw around with him.

[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:58.300]
Yes.

[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.540]
And you ought to pay for his trip to Vegas.

[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:01.660]
Do I think a show with you,

[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.660]
Neil, run around in a casino at Vegas

[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.120]
with a wire to you for a mic?

[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.480]
With about 50 grand to gamble.

[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.360]
Oh, man, that would be intense.

[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.100]
You bet.

[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:09.520]
Yeah.

[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:10.380]
Okay.

[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.420]
It's all done.

[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:12.860]
Science-yielding delivered.

[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.160]
For Lauderdale.

[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:14.760]
Yeah.

[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.220]
We're old and ton you cruise.

[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.340]
We're not letting her go until the man's are met.

[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.300]
Disney said, keep her.

[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.260]
Okay, let's go through a Tamarack.

[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.500]
Manage and Disney are getting married.

[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:28.200]
Okay.

[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.040]
Well, we're showering this morning downstairs

[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:30.820]
when I came in.

[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.340]
Here's a lady.

[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:31.780]
It was super.

[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:32.700]
Lady in Miami.

[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:33.320]
Hi.

[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:33.460]
Hi.

[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.520]
Hi, how are you doing?

[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:34.820]
Great.

[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.680]
Mike, you sound good on the radio.

[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.340]
You're not thinking good.

[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.140]
Don't say that.

[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.360]
Oh, she's don't say that.

[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.280]
More cost-cutting on the weekend.

[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.120]
I can see it now.

[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:42.820]
No, no, no.

[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.680]
With the revenues, it's going to start coming in

[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.700]
because Rick and Suss and you are there.

[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.600]
Give me a break.

[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.480]
He's going to, he can give you Chicago and Vegas.

[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.100]
Exactly.

[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:51.760]
Exactly.

[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.300]
That's basically why I called.

[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.660]
I was going to give up Chicago,

[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.460]
you know, and make it and say, say,

[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.480]
do Vegas one year in Chicago the next.

[00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.980]
But no, you can do both.

[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.240]
John, done.

[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:01.900]
Whatever you'd like.

[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:02.460]
It's all set.

[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.080]
All right.

[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:03.620]
Thanks a lot.

[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.480]
Scott is legs crossed when he said it.

[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.660]
Pembroke Pines.

[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.960]
Yes, I'm just pleased.

[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.040]
I'm here.

[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.780]
Oh, can you tell me about Ludlow was sitting on the porch?

[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:12.840]
Ludlow.

[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:13.260]
Yes.

[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.620]
What do you want to know about Ludlow?

[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:15.420]
Is he that good?

[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.020]
Ludlow is very good.

[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.840]
Is he coming to Florida?

[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.520]
Pretty weeks, sir.

[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.740]
Tron St. John, Jr., radio and the Florida.

[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.420]
Ludlow is an Atlanta, Georgia, act.

[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.760]
He's an institution.

[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.680]
In fact, he does his show for him one every morning.

[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.480]
And he would not do well here.

[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.160]
I think his humor is more directed towards

[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.680]
how can I say this now?
