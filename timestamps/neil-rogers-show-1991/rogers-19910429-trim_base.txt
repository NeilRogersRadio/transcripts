[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100]
Oh, seven at WIOD. Welcome to our Monday morning party party

[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.120]
Whichever fits and a delicious salad at somebody left here. I wonder where this is from

[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.020]
Anyway, here's a lady in Tamarack. Hello. Oh, hi Neil. Uh-huh. I'm

[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.500]
Home because I have the flu today and normally I listen to you on the way home at lunch time

[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.680]
Everybody's got it today, huh? Yeah, and you're just great. I am from

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.520]
a little low porch country Atlanta. Yes. Well, I'll be dang

[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.220]
But when I get down here, I found your station. You found a real radio station? Yes. Yes. They're

[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.220]
kinder and gentler up there. They're looking like a bunch of backwards yaw-hoo's up there, aren't they?

[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.380]
But I love it and I love Rick and S. Well, that's great. And listen at the

[00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:00.400]
Yaw football thing last weekend was great. Yeah, it was great. Oh, it's the best that draft. But but Neil,

[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.820]
You please play that jeopardy thing about those chickens. Oh, the chicken jeopardy. Yes, that is so great. Is it great?

[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.580]
Yes, and stay great here. Well, everything's great. Okay.

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.880]
And you're great to see him. She's great. That's great. That is great.

[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.920]
I just just just passed the gallstone. Oh, that's great. Oh

[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.220]
boy. I just popped a hemorrhoid. That's great. Hey, one thing. She's a happy lady. Okay?

[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.580]
Okay, that gave me time to get in the machine. Oh, no, that's a kitten's deputy on your host.

[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.780]
Alex, for beef. We move on now to double jeopardy. Penny, you had the low score at the end of the last round.

[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.560]
Choose a category please. Extra terrestrials for 200. It makes strange noises in the chicken

[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:55.820]
coop late at night. Yes, boneless. Frank Purdue, no. Cajun. No, what is a poultry guy?

[00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.180]
A poultry guy. Penny, you still have control of the board. To beak or not to beak for 600.

[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.580]
He was the star of the Omen. Boneless. Correct. We'll return with my only chicken jeopardy

[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.340]
where the category will be choking the pecker right after this. Okay, it's 11.09. See, I love the

[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.780]
way he says poultry guy. And the whole ambiance of that series of bits that they did because that's

[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.100]
the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life. And all these suits sit around. Oh, yeah, I knew that.

[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.580]
Yeah, poultry guy. You know, it's for a pseudo intellectuals who have no who have a very low

[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.360]
opinion of themselves and justifiably so anyway, where the hell is that information from Poppano Park

[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.020]
Dammit? We got a whole bunch of people out there who hate me like poison who are listening right

[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.140]
now wondering when they're going to get the info on how many people shared in the pot from Christmas

[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.240]
list winnings and how much they're going to get. And as I left there on Saturday night is they were

[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.140]
all clawing and grabbing at my body parts and I said, I'll have it on a year for you Monday. Where is

[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:08.160]
it? Let's go. Let's get with it. I probably nobody over there. They're all going out to to lunch.

[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.180]
Here's a lady mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hi Neil. Hi. I'm a first time caller.

[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.760]
Great. Yeah, I just wanted to let you know I quit listening if you're so about a year ago when you

[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.220]
started writing on Joan Love It all day. Oh my god. Yeah, I couldn't I couldn't understand it and I

[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.480]
can't understand it even more when you have somebody wonderful to write on like Diana Morgan on

[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.560]
channel six. I think she's awful. She is awful. But Joan Love It needs a face job. No, that's not true.

[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.320]
She needs new face. Well, at least she's got good news and she doesn't. She has good nose? No,

[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.660]
news. No, that's a lane editor with a good nose. No news. But at least she's a hell of a lot better

[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.880]
than Diana Morgan. Well, whatever you say. That's like saying she looks better than Ann. You know,

[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.880]
I mean, so does my grandma. And she's been dead 20 years. Wow. So what else is going on? I agree

[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:05.460]
with you about Get a Life. I think that's horrible show. And my fiance loves it. And I think he's

[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.240]
a jock size. I'll tell him you said that. Actually, he's listening right now. So well, he knows. He

[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.800]
can relate to it. Yeah. Probably too many showers with Mandage. Well, listen, have a great day and

[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.260]
put you up. Okay. See you. It's 11 after 11 at WIOD and we have two. Oh, by the way,

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.860]
speaking of Channel 7 news, the big news. I don't know how we could have left this out so long.

[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:35.320]
Rick Sanchez has been promoted. Isn't that incredible? Well, if he hits another couple of guys

[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.460]
and they're going to make him the owner, going to give him the station. Seriously, he's been promoted

[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.160]
from his 530 and 630 anchor post opposite Joan. I love it. See how this off its in on his show?

[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.280]
Two, the main five and six PM newscasts right alongside veteran Sally Fitz.

[00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:01.400]
Oh boy. And if Sally Fitz does don't know and his Dave game. But we'll find out. Boy, what

[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.700]
I it's like revolving chairs on those newscasts. You know, the same bunch of silly people over and

[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.000]
over again. Nobody gives a crap anyway. There are two open lines. I'll say to get in brown.

[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.780]
We're on a very, very ponderous Monday 524 WIOD. We're still waiting for the word from

[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.120]
pop it. Oh, just in case you hadn't heard in the last two minutes or so that we don't know yet.

[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.880]
We're still waiting for the article by Tom Jicke and Juan Carlos Cotex about those ratings.

[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.080]
We're still waiting for our sales department to wake up. But let's do a little

[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.960]
bit. Should we do a break just to see if there were paying any attention? We're here at point.

[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.300]
Kind of sounds like it's chicken Monday, doesn't it? 1115 to WIOD spinging of that Alan J. Finkelson,

[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.280]
a legend in the harness racing business. Is that on the phone? Yes, sir? I have the count for you.

[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.280]
Well, thank God. I just got it. The only answer. We depend under garments. We have to rest up.

[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.420]
You know, yeah, I know. Well, here we are. So does my wallet. Yeah, I know. I put it in the freezer.

[00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.460]
If you lost, it's not because of me. It is because of you. Hey, I'm hiding from you. Robert

[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.880]
Cleiner is still he was there sat the night. Good. He's hiding from you. Great. And I'm hiding

[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.700]
from somebody. Okay, let's get those numbers. These people hide from 18 people. That's not bad.

[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.460]
Comes out to $50.54 and 40 cents. The checks will be mailed out. No, week to 10 days.

[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.240]
They don't have the call here. We do have their addresses. It will be mailed out. There was an

[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.060]
excellent promotion. Thanks to you, sir. Sure was. Just a laviano who owned the horse and,

[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:35.460]
uh, it's you did predict if he did win, your prediction would have been right on the nose of 25,000.

[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.760]
Right. But he's tired. He raised about no, he's not tired. Tommy Houghton parked him a quarter in

[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.140]
27.3. Don't tell me he's tired. He's tired now after that race. You bet. Well, he's tired. And so

[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:53.060]
you and I now rest your pocketbook up for, uh, May 24. I know you love quarter horses. And you'll

[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.060]
eat in the cafeteria with exactly. I love him just as much as you do. That's correct. Right.

[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.480]
Right. Love you for everything. Okay, Alan. Thank you. Thank you. There you go. 418 winners.

[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.000]
$54.40 cents. Now that may not sound like much, but at the metal lands, they got about 27 bucks.

[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:15.000]
A piece and they started that promotion with symbols. Yankatron. As in Yank this, and we did okay. It

[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.940]
was a great promotion. It was a lot of fun. Excitement. We had a lot of people out there. 418

[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.240]
diehards who came every time Christmas list raised and they're rewarded with $54.40 cents. Would

[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.400]
you all to pay for their parking? It was great. Next year we'll do it right. Next year we'll get a

[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.720]
horse that makes about 10 million. And I get half. It's 1117 at WIOD. The Palm Beach line is open. We

[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.560]
reopened it by the way. There was somebody on there and they dropped off. Thank God. Boy,

[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.440]
they're probably out there writing swastikers on walls right now. Hollywood. Hey, hello. Yes, sir.

[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:52.140]
What's up? Now I'm a first time caller. Great. I got a support for your idea of saying that,

[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:57.320]
you know, the States are becoming a police state. A couple of weeks ago, I mean, my girlfriend

[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.000]
are at the beach. And you know, we're just sitting there, we're eating. We got some take-off

[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.720]
from McDonald's. And this pig comes up, you know, he says, may I see your identification?

[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.880]
For what? I don't know. I asked him the same question. He says, well, I don't have to tell you,

[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.640]
you know, I don't have to tell you what he said. Yeah, but, um, you know, he called me a

[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.280]
putt in front of my girlfriend. Are you serious? Yeah, I'm dead serious. He's like, he said, I don't have

[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:31.240]
to tell you. Yeah, you know, I mean, I can't tell you know, I'm a taxpayer. Unbelievable. Why

[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.660]
did you say what the hell do you want? You fascist Nazi pig? I want to, but you know, I know. He's like,

[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:42.260]
you know, he searched the car. He searched the purse. Yeah, probably strip search your girlfriend too.

[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.040]
Yeah, and they wonder why they get shot, you know, exactly. You know, um, they wonder why the

[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.900]
public is sick and tired of being harassed by this fascist police state that we have out there.

[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.980]
And then we're supposed to say the police officer is your friend, right? Right. You know what I mean?

[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:07.140]
It's, it's such bomb like you, you know, they have to public fool in the believing. And we're paying

[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.320]
their goddamn salary right now out there waiting in the bushes and coming around and harassing

[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.200]
people so they can act out there much or whatever their fantasies. And I told them that says, well,

[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.820]
you know, I pay your taxes. I don't care. The city pays my taxes. Yeah, right. Like who pays the city?

[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.220]
I tell them to stick right where the **** is so shine. You know what? Exactly. Okay, good luck to you.

[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:34.700]
Okay. I also want to call someone a major douchebag. Yeah. Nick Navarreau, you're a major douchebag.

[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.280]
A major ****ing douchebag. Absolutely. You're a great American now. See you.

[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.280]
Right. 20 after 11 at WIOD. We have an open line in Broward 524 WIOD.

[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.060]
And one in Palm Beach. You don't think Joey's going to show up. Do you? I sure hope not.

[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.120]
Oh God of all days. It's kind of a smart me day to begin with. Kind of a sleazy day.

[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:06.380]
Yeah, exactly. Here's a lady in Miami who says nothing who's gone. She's gone.

[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.800]
The lady in Miami on three is gone. Hello. Hello.

[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.520]
What a ****. Do you believe that? Was she on her a long time? I did. She was on her a long time.

[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.920]
Was she under the age of a hundred? Or was she some old bag? George, was she an old bag? No.

[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.440]
Well, we're very sorry. Okay. I know you have a very busy life. Probably got another customer

[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.660]
at the door right now, huh? 20 after 11 at WIOD. Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.340]
Yeah. Hi. How are you? We did not hang up on us. Thank goodness for you.

[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:48.160]
No. And I'm definitely under a hundred. Good. And I want to wish someone who is also under a hundred.

[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:54.160]
Happy birthday and say Michael Cohn. You're not a douchebag. Okay. Okay. That was sweet.

[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.540]
That was sweet, wasn't it? Yeah. I hope he's listening. Okay. Me too. Okay. See you. Thanks. Bye.

[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.220]
Now that was short and sweet and right to the point. No beating around the bush. No phone

[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.400]
a preliminary. She just got right out there and did it. Okay. No radio four play with her.

[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.460]
We have an open line in date. I'm going to keep punching these numbers all day because it's

[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:18.900]
Monday. We're doing fair for Monday. Not too bad. But Mondays are usually just a

[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:27.480]
hernia inducing day awful. And there's one in Broward at 5249463 Fort Lauderdale. Yeah, Neil. Yeah.

[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.020]
This is Chris. I just got back from Vegas. Hey, Chris. How was it? Good. I took your advice.

[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:38.340]
I went to Powell station and punched my brains out and boss. Really? What are you going to do?

[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:44.840]
Remove Vegas. Don't hold your breath. I don't even know what we're doing. Our cubs remote. These people,

[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.640]
they they are so non-communicado. This outfit. I saw Mike Tichello, our friend from Midway Airlines,

[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.120]
driving up the street one day last week. He was leaving here and I was leaving. He honked the

[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.440]
horn and waved and he gave me that your number one symbol. Yeah, the little finger. Right. But

[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.560]
other than that, I have no idea when we're going to Chicago or if we're going to nothing, they just

[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.020]
sit back and that's it. Try to get away with spending as little as possible and that's the way it goes.

[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.560]
Yeah, well, nice talking to you. I just wanted to call my girlfriend at douchebag. Okay, Chris.

[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.780]
Definitely. You're at douchebag. Good luck to him. Okay. I don't know when we're going. People

[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:23.200]
calling all the time. When are you going to Chicago? I don't know. They tell me nothing. I hear nothing.

[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.260]
They tell me nothing. They offer no information. They're too busy with these 85 billion of these

[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.900]
silly jock sniffing remotes that they do between the draft and all this other silly crap.

[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:40.040]
That they lose money on by the way. I know we made a lot of money. Yeah, right. I'd like to see

[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.540]
how much money we make on the sports department. Okay. I'd love to see it. I want to see it in black

[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:51.200]
and white. Okay, Joe. Right now. Now. I want to see it right on the table. Slime ball.

[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.180]
Let's take a call from a lady in Miami. Hello.

[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:08.040]
Go on again. How is that possible? She just called, right? She just called. Yes. Hello. Yes. Hello.

[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:17.640]
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes.

[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:33.240]
Yes. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.940]
There's some bitch on the phone here and she won't speak. Hello. Hello.

[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.480]
Hello. Hello.

[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:04.340]
Put the bitch on hold. Okay. Two open lines in Broward 524 WYOD. Here's a mobile pick report on 7.

[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:16.100]
Hello. Hello. Yeah. We got a pick report. Yeah. Yeah. It says that 10 of them on 57 to have

[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.480]
any of the palm that up. Wow. 10 to 5 on each side. Unbelievable. Yeah. We can be in the general pick

[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.480]
emergency here in Miami. Are they earning their pay today or what? They got to. They got 10 of them out.

[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.460]
They pay up the helicopter out there every day on real. Unreal. I just like to call a friend of mine to

[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:39.800]
doos bag. Dale Kate to the doos bag. Okay. All right. Thank you. Wow. 24. Oh, y'all done, Jay.

[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.980]
Great job. Got it done fast today, huh? Probably got to go spend that money at the dog track.

[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:53.980]
Matt and he is tomorrow. Two open lines in Broward still. We're just dying over here. 524 9463 524 WYOD. Hello.

[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.700]
Hello. Hello. Hi. Hello.

[00:14:59.700 --> 00:14:59.780]
Hello.

[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:19.300]
Sally, what are you doing? Oh, there it goes. Hold on, Sally. She's getting ready for Rick.

[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.020]
Open line in the Broward 524 WYOD. Miami on the Palm Beach line.

[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:30.380]
Okay. They sound pretty good. What? They sound good. Who does? Can you hear me? Hello. Hello.

[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.540]
How about in that fancy? What line was she on? She's still on there. She's on one.

[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.820]
We got Dan, I tell her to listen up. Yeah, and she's taken up that deadline that makes you have to

[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.280]
call on the Palm Beach line. How do you like that? I'm going to work anyway. So I figured, you know,

[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.260]
exactly what are you doing? I get a long distance call here, you know. I started to track

[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:53.240]
Pompano, their Saturday. Christmas list puking down the stretch at her. Well, what kind of damn?

[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.240]
I had a box in the triple, though. So I and with another three other ones. So if that matters,

[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.740]
it was pretty weak payoff. You had a box with three others. Yeah.

[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:05.160]
I like to ask you 24 bucks. I know. It was a weak payoff to pay off. How much did it pay?

[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.420]
It paid 112. I got half of it. Well, what's wrong with that? Well, I was, you know,

[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.240]
there were only six horses. I felt like pretty weak. You don't understand. Yeah.

[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.880]
When there's only six horses, how much is it going to pay? If you were the horses,

[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.840]
the smaller it's going to pay. Yeah, but I mean, it was nice. You want to see a small payoff,

[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.480]
the race that Mr. Steincached with Talbot Bandit with Walter Ross. And Mike Dieters came second

[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.600]
with a four horse. There was a 13 to one and a 20 to one shot. And the perfected paid only

[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:40.000]
$214.00 and the triple paid about a thousand. It should have paid 6,000. Talk about a smelly payoff

[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.300]
in that race. That's crap. Yeah. God damn it. Give me the phone number, Neil. Exactly. Hey, they're all gone.

[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:50.100]
They all left town. You can't get Walter Ross now too late. Oh, man. You got your money.

[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.300]
Hey, I want and the Chicago. You like Midway, Neil?

[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.000]
Did Beatser Hallot over here? I like Midway. I like Midway a lot of time. It's great.

[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:02.840]
This must be Mike DeCello. It is. I knew how you doing. Tell that bitch in the

[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.540]
mind of the line to get off the line. Is this Mike? Oh, yes. No, it's not. It's not.

[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.700]
This is just, can I listen for a while? You don't have a nasal voice to be Mike DeCello.

[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.460]
This is Mike DeCello. Hey, Mike. Yeah. Hey, don't hold on Mike. 27 after 11 at WYOD.

[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:24.480]
She's still tying up that line on one. That bitch in heat on one. Hello.

[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.720]
Hello. See if you can get her to say it every now and then it kind of helps.

[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:39.520]
Hello. Hello. Okay, let's go to, let's go to a break. Okay. Boy, we're getting way behind here.

[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:45.440]
Not really. 28 after 11 on 610 WYOD or hysterical station for the 90s. We got Rick and

[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.820]
SUDs and Buffalo Bob and some howdy duty between two and six this afternoon sports talk with

[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.740]
Jolton Joe, Mr. Expense. Mr. We're dying over here from all the expense that sports department

[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:04.940]
builds up over here. I'm telling you, all those basketball games from, from Diamond Head and all

[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.940]
those other frivolous trips around the world. We can't even make one trip to a Vegas. Okay,

[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.020]
for one week on this high rated, high-a-page show where we bring in all this revenue.

[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:19.020]
And a sports department continues draining and draining. It's like a massive, high-calonic.

[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.500]
28 after 11 at WYOD and we'll be right back. Okay, it's 11 32. There is nothing worse than a guy

[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.740]
who comes in after his team wins a couple of games by Big Score and has been hot for a week,

[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.260]
which is about all it's been, and start trying to rub your nose in it. Chuck Meyer comes in here

[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:40.660]
swinging an imaginary baseball bat with a big smile on his face. I got news for you. We got Elaine

[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:45.820]
at Taurus nose in my house and I'm going to rub her nose in it all day long and then it's going

[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:51.380]
to be what you think it is either. Something my big dog left in the backyard is kind of a surprise gift

[00:18:51.380 --> 00:19:00.340]
for Elaine. South Miami. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. I want to ask you, it's not real, it's not a request,

[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.880]
but I just want, no, no, it's not a request. I swear, it's not a request. You're right. I want to make

[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.860]
us a suggestion for the return of a listen to you for about two years, a suggestion for a return

[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:17.640]
of an old favorite. It's not a, it's not a, it's not a, that's good. I'll give you, I'll give you a clue

[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.640]
of what it used to be, what used to be an old feature of your show, but, but I would like, I would

[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:31.120]
call up when I would go, W, a, R, M, F. Remember the old lightning round? Forget it. What happened?

[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.920]
Forget it. Why? Audience killed it. Yeah, but it's time to, you know, it's been dead for a while and

[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.720]
I've kind of been hearing some grumbling about maybe you should be hearing some rumbling.

[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.260]
Some grumbling. I think it's probably bad grits. I think it, I think it, I think it,

[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:53.100]
1133 at WIOD, we have an open line in Broward, 524 and two in date. We're just fumbling our way

[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.480]
along, just trying to kill another Monday, boy, and I think some of the audience here, they're

[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:03.800]
butchering it. 751 WIOD in date. Nobody gives a crap about anything anymore. You know what I'm

[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:10.760]
saying? They don't care. In different oblivious. I think everybody should be on a phone to Tom

[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.180]
jickid, the sunset and the last game where the hell is his story about the ratings and especially

[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.780]
Rick and Sudson. I've rate they didn't kick ass in the afternoon in the spite of all of his crap.

[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:24.220]
I think everybody ought to start standing up for yourselves and stopping a bunch of whims, okay?

[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.780]
That's the problem in this world. We got a bunch of followers and a bunch of whims running around

[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.280]
with hair grown out of their cheek with a hole cut out in their ass. That's what's wrong with the

[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:41.680]
world. Carol city. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you? Okay. Listen, how about the pirates, man?

[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.480]
They're kicking some wood. Yeah. Bond, but he advanced flight, man. They're tearing it up. Yeah.

[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.200]
Anyway, now the cops will start coming to do. No, we won't. Forget about it. Why do you have to go

[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.980]
through this whole agonizing routine? Isn't it enough that I said the cops suck? I admit it.

[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.740]
But that isn't enough for you know, how about those pirates screw the pirates? How do you like that, sir?

[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.160]
Well, what they do on their own time is enough to do it. In addition to which, let me say this to you,

[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.780]
two after all these high paid primadamas on the pirates art back next year, they better do it this

[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:24.180]
year. What are they going to do next year? Play in the three eye league? Forget it. This is the

[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:31.460]
job suck. Okay. We bite the big one. We stink. I'm tired of excuses. We play like crap. They make me nauseous.

[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.840]
True. But I still love them, right? But they suck. How about the mienke? What the hell are you

[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.380]
eating in there now? George sucking out of a thing? What is that? Soup. Soup from where?

[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:52.540]
From home. All from home. Didn't bring me any soup. Neil. Peace among. Yes, sir. How about the mienke? What kind of soup is it?

[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.840]
Ramen. What is it? Ramen. Ramen?

[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.680]
You know, they're talking about soup, not religion. What is it now? The Yankees stink too. Sir,

[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.240]
do you have anything to say except how about them pirates? How about them cubs? How about the mienke?

[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.960]
Why don't you say something constructive? Like how about those tigers? Yeah, right. Okay. I think

[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.700]
this is both burned, sent back, and uh, parking innocent. Good thinking. Have a great life. It's

[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:23.160]
1136 at WIOD. We have two open lines. They're both in Broward in the day, whatever the LAR 751 WIOD.

[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.520]
Lora is running around frantically looking for that copy, which is not existent. Oh,

[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:34.160]
we got a cute story about that too from our crack sales department. I guess we can't call it that

[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.420]
anymore since one of our sales people departed. We used to call it the crack sales department.

[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.960]
Anyway, let's take a call from Papano. Hello. Hey, man, you're great, man. I was just driving home

[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.420]
from school and switching around the channel. Come on. Don't tell me you just discovered this show by

[00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:07.600]
Oh, yeah. All I got to say to you, sir, is okay. This isn't the sports final on Channel 4. Okay,

[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:15.080]
we have a delay. It could sound like he's um going nuts in that car, huh? Is he in a car?

[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.780]
In one hand on the wheel. I think he was sitting on the other one. He's all right.

[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:26.860]
23 tell noona WIOD. Here's a mobile in Miami speaking of in the car. Yeah, I'm doing okay.

[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.860]
For that, I think I look very familiar there. Yeah, we had to give him the old he's holding.

[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:37.180]
I was waiting for the old people to come out. The Dow is up 15 and a half points. Aren't you impressed?

[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:45.260]
I can't wait. Thank you very much. Let me give you one back. Back on you. Hey, Niddle. Yeah.

[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:50.120]
I think the Tigers are going to slip on by everybody. Yeah, they're slipping it all right. They're

[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:57.260]
slipping it to their fans. Real quietly. Well, you can tell it's Monday here. It's uh oh,

[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.980]
man. Yeah, people are adjusted there. But I will say this usually I get pissed off about this

[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.040]
because Monday I come in. I feel fine. I'm ready to do a show and the whole world is like in a

[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.240]
coma. I'm in a coma today. So it fits in great. That's why we're having a good time.

[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.300]
There's no, there's no problems here. If the food fits, where it in real quick, people had

[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:24.020]
buried bikes. This is Tony A. Yeah, I mean, we're going to check the back right break because it's

[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:29.420]
squeaks a little. Okay. All right, check this later. No, 22 till noon at WIOD. We have an

[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:37.600]
open line on a star line. Now listen, for that punk kid that called it before in the rare likelihood

[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.940]
and it's not too likely that that was a legitimate call. You can say anything you want, but you

[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:48.720]
can't say this show is ingrate. Okay, you can say the show sucks. You can get away with that.

[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.940]
But if you're going to say this show is ingrate, you got a real problem. I don't have a problem,

[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:58.160]
but the FCC, all those bureaucraticals, farts up there in Washington to sit around with their

[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.720]
finger up their butt, they have a big problem. Okay, because they have nothing more important to do

[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:09.240]
than be the word police in this damn fascist state that we live in. With a bunch of pigs and uniforms

[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.560]
in heat out there writing tickets like it's going out of style because we're paying them to protect

[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.940]
this from the murderers and the rapists and the arsonists and the drug peddlers and so on. They can't

[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:23.380]
do that, but they can sure write those tickets, can't they? I almost said they can write those god damn

[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:31.060]
tickets. Here's a nice lady in plantation. Hello, Neil. Hi. How are you? Okay. Okay, yes, a lady

[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:37.920]
in plantation with a cold. Oh, everybody's got it. But other than the cold, I am really

[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:46.140]
steamed at WIOD. What did we do now? Oh, sports intensive WIOD, the whole gang of us wait

[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:54.080]
to Sunday afternoon for white fox and the Yankee game. What does WIOD put on that crappy Randy Martin?

[00:25:54.080 --> 00:26:04.480]
Are you serious? Are you serious? Yes. She was on yesterday? Yes. And I, that's, I listened to WIOD

[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:12.740]
until 11 o'clock every single day. Oh, no. I'm not Randy Martin. The game. I'm sorry, I'm a lady,

[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.700]
but I was really pissed off. Yes, I listened to Jeff DeForest and more. Can't see DeForest for the

[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:25.880]
trees, right? By the way, you didn't hear Dave in the graveyard on Saturday morning. Oh, man,

[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.500]
there's nothing worse than a guy who is not funny trying to be a comedian. He was playing

[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.100]
every cart in the room, trying to be funny. I was so embarrassed for him that I was just grabbing

[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.760]
myself. I just couldn't believe it. Yeah, well, I was grabbing myself yesterday afternoon. I had

[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.820]
WIOD's management here. Oh, yeah. You grabbed that? We've been a whole gang who listened to this,

[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:49.500]
even for my 11-year-old granddaughter right on up. We all different ages. They put that damn

[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.560]
Randy Martin on yesterday afternoon. I could have taken my radio and spoiling him against the wall.

[00:26:54.740 --> 00:27:01.740]
I don't blame him. I was really p-oed. Well, let's have a big billboard campaign never again.

[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.900]
It could be our slowest. Yeah, I mean, it's about sports, intensive sports, intensive, and who

[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:14.500]
they put on? Randy. Exactly. I couldn't believe it. It was pretty bad. You want people to say what

[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.260]
they think? Yeah, it's funny that we're over here blowing you a lane into his nose and it's not

[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.520]
even a test to her face anymore. It's incredible. You know what I see? It's like something that one of

[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.120]
those slight of handguys would do. Well, I hope when she puts the nose back on, she doesn't run

[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:30.680]
upside down, which was drowned out in the showers. Like senior wensers. Anyway, have a great day. We'll

[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.940]
try not to do it again. Okay, Neil. Great listening to you. See you. Boy, how does she really

[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:41.600]
feel about Randy? That's the question. It's 1141 at WIdee. Anybody else here, a week magazine,

[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:48.440]
this Saturday morning with Dave in the Graveline? Oh, man. There is nothing more embarrassing and

[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:55.340]
more humiliating than what? Why couldn't he just do it? Straight face, the deadpan, just be a voice,

[00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.860]
which is all he is, and stop trying to be a personality and a comedian. Oh, God, I was so embarrassed

[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:06.280]
for this often embarrassed radio station. I was plotting in the car. I was on a way to the market.

[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.320]
I just was puking all over the steering wheel. I just couldn't get a grip on it.

[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:16.700]
We have an open line in Broward 524WIdee. The audience is, I'd say about semi-comatose now. They're

[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.960]
coming out of it. Here's a mobile in Miami. I got a pick report for you. Another one? Another one. Man.

[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:29.400]
I got it on par metal in between 57,000 to 167,000. They're in heat. Yep. I guess so. Boy, was my

[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:34.100]
prediction right today, sir? Yep. It's the 29th of the month. They got a gigantic quota to fill

[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:39.080]
and they're just out there harassing the public like there's no tomorrow. They have nothing better to do.

[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:45.680]
Yes, sir. All right. Take it easy. Thank you, public. Great American. It's 1142 at WIOD. We have an

[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:50.220]
open line in Dave. We're pretty ticked off about this harassment. It's got nothing to do with law

[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:56.920]
enforcement. It's called harassment. Horace. That's what it is. They're harassing the public and we're

[00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:04.750]
tired of it. We've had it. A bunch of disgusting porkers. Yeah. And you wonder why the public just cringes

[00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:09.990]
every time they see somebody in uniform. Used to be, oh, the policeman is your friend. Is your

[00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:14.350]
buddy? If you're in trouble, call a cop. Now you see a cop coming, man. You're, you're florid. Anything

[00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:20.350]
to get away from them. Now, what is that? A different lady now? Or is that the same one? I'm one.

[00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:31.830]
Hello. Hello. Hi. Neil. Yeah. Hi. I just wanted to say I'm in Coral Gables now. And I was driving through

[00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:38.810]
cooking a grove. Yeah. And all on South Bay Shore. Watch out. Be worst of the worst Coral Gables police

[00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:45.290]
police station. Well, right by monies. So be careful. Well, I'm telling you, I think that if anybody

[00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:49.890]
wants to rob a bank today, it's a hell of a good day to do it. Every cop in Dayton Broward is out there

[00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:57.190]
writing tickets today. It seems like they love red Corvettes and black Mustang. That's who I saw

[00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:01.750]
camp down the side of the road with the car. Incredible. Well, they probably thought it was me in the

[00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:07.150]
vet. They want my ass bad. Believe me. Probably right on Flamenco. I'm telling you, when I left my

[00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:12.090]
house today, right on Flamenco, a road, they've got a van in the median there. And behind the van,

[00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:17.110]
they got two pigs on motorcycles with their radar guns up over the hood. Like Clint Eastwood waiting

[00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:23.770]
for the ambush. I believe it. I believe it's got to fill that quota. Yeah. I just want to call my

[00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.630]
boss Michelle douchebag. Okay. As you drive by him again, let him know their number one.

[00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:36.190]
Okay. We'll do. See you. Bye bye. 1143 at WIOD. We have an open line in day 751 pig. Why?

[00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.910]
Little did I know when I predicted that at the beginning of the show day, because I saw him

[00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.910]
everywhere myself. But little did I realize that there would be out in such massive force. They're

[00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:50.030]
putting their feet down today, man. You can hear the boot stop at all over town. Everybody drive

[00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.570]
at least. See if you're driving under the speed limit. If you're over the age of 100, you have no

[00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:57.410]
reflexes and shouldn't be on the road at all. That doesn't count because they don't get any browny

[00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:01.790]
points for that. So they don't give a crap. You can do whatever the hell you want. But if you should

[00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:06.530]
be driving seven eight miles an hour over the speed limit, God help you. Okay. They're going to take away

[00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:12.970]
your driver's license, your car, slap your ass in jail, take away your green card, and your

[00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:20.590]
arbitrarian diary. How do you like that? It's 1144 at WIOD or up station for the 90s and we'll be

[00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:25.970]
right back because they always it still says blank for Rick and suds on a blackboard here. So it could

[00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:34.250]
be joy because it says blank sunrise. Hello. Yes, Neil. Long time caller. First time listener. Uh-huh.

[00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:39.830]
Sorry. The jokes aren't that great week. But you got to realize the people I live around in

[00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:46.270]
sunrise. But uh- We don't want those young people up here. That's so true. Did you see that story

[00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:51.290]
that I just threw in a waste basket that I mentioned earlier? Didn't see it, did you? No. One thing I

[00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:55.110]
wanted to go over with you and you obviously don't care because you just that's why I didn't know

[00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:59.310]
that's okay. I didn't hear it. Okay. Don't worry about it. I threw it away. Uh-like you, I'm also a

[00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:09.810]
met hater. Mm-hmm. I'm from St. Louis and we've always had a great rival with the Cubs. But you know-

[00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:15.550]
people sometimes don't get along. Says Sandy Blach director of senior services and project

[00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:20.910]
coordinator for the Jewish Federation. Traditionally, our Cades bring in the types of people. We don't

[00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:27.870]
want in this area. How do you like that? Amazing. You try to get them all right. When you chase teenagers,

[00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:32.450]
they don't move. Blach said this means they'll go across the street. We don't want to have those

[00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:37.990]
types chased out of our property. In other words, they're living and they're under the age of a

[00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.750]
hundred screw. How do you like that in sunrise? Uh-uh. I think we need to get them off the street.

[00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:47.310]
So why not have an arcade? Let's get all the old parts all off the street. How's that? Well,

[00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:51.230]
let's find a- let's find a very accurate- a metamusal cafeteria where they have the

[00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.150]
pollident and the metamusal on the table already in about five million pounds of sweet and low for

[00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:58.770]
them to shove in their bag. You imagine how rich it would be if you had the distributor ship and

[00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:04.710]
South Florida for that stuff? Exactly. But uh- you ever think how appropriate it is to have the

[00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:11.610]
metz plan and chase stadium in a town that's called flushing. Mm-hmm. But uh- yeah. You know what

[00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:16.230]
drives me crazy with people calling and they have called- You remind me of Eric Lambert. You know,

[00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.830]
you can just see your dying right right before your very eyes. But we only have TV. We could watch

[00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:26.790]
you just dying over there. That's right. I'm pacing. But uh- you know, people call you and they have

[00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:31.750]
call waiting and they go ahead and put you on hold. I'm surprised you don't dump more of those people

[00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:37.130]
or nobody's ever uh- Well, no, you see it's always tantalizing because you figure if they put you

[00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.510]
on hold it must be something incredibly important. Mm-hmm. And you want to see like was it the,

[00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:45.630]
you know, the Canadian lottery calling that they just want 15 million because if it is then they might

[00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:50.070]
give you, you know, a couple of bucks. That's a good point. But uh- So when you get your own show,

[00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:55.630]
think about that. That's an idea. Yeah. But uh- what most people don't realize if you pick up the

[00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.970]
phone you want to call and you don't be on the air and you don't want to be disturbed,

[00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:04.430]
if you dial the star 7- Yeah, that's no phone. We don't want to do that. We like it to be spontaneous.

[00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:10.870]
We don't like to have all I've contrived crap like they do on some shows. Well, you mean like uh-

[00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:15.810]
No, I don't have any amateurs on the weekend. No, like the amateurs on uh- every day on some stations.

[00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:21.210]
Well, the amateurs that you've been talking about- Don't mention Andy Martin's name again, please.

[00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:25.990]
Okay. Did you buy, did you hear Graveline's Saturday? Just for a little bit. You're the only one in

[00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:31.650]
the audience who will admit it. Oh man, it was the- just gruesome. I mean just desperately try to be

[00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:36.290]
a comedian. He's got a sense of humor like a more tissue. I mean, a man is just not funny, okay?

[00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:41.270]
Well, if he would just sit here and read the uh- info and play his little adeta alive and just,

[00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:45.850]
you know, just play it straight if he gives people a doing that and it would be just fine.

[00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:50.250]
Well, if you're going to do that with him, you can almost say the money and just have, you know,

[00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:55.310]
wrap it off and have your uh- loyal listeners come in and uh- do the work on Saturday.

[00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:59.890]
See ya. You can always tell when they're sniffing around to be. And remember what night

[00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:05.550]
used to go on? Oh god. All those people auditioning to be the sidekick after the bird,

[00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:10.630]
they flew away? Unbelievable. And AirBeeOne was a bigger disaster than the next.

[00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:19.890]
We have two open lines in Broward 524WYOD 5249463. You know, it's interesting. On Tuesdays,

[00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:25.230]
Rick and Sput are now soliciting new collars, which is great because we do like, you know,

[00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.230]
get great people in, get them in the habit of calling who are different to new. I'd like to solicit

[00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.210]
old collars. You know, a lot of people we haven't heard from at a long time. I don't mean

[00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:37.090]
Pete the Boredop. I am so, Pete, you're a great guy, but get a light, okay? Terminal. Remember

[00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:41.190]
that call Friday? Well, when you go to go back to topics, can we have some time? I got a topic

[00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:47.730]
for a chronic Boredop, so we have no light. But like a Robert. Remember Robert from U of M,

[00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:54.930]
and Alex Jr., and I don't know, they're just a whole bunch of people. Rick, of course,

[00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:59.670]
we'll never hear from him again. And then there was Joey Jr. threatening to come in here one day.

[00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:03.730]
Joey Jr. and Senior, we ought to take up an office pool and see which Joey shows up first.

[00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:10.070]
You notice by the way that Joey Senior is not shown up and will not be here today? I don't think,

[00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:15.730]
he won't show up. He don't have the balls to show up here. Miami, hello. Hello. How you doing?

[00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:19.430]
Great. How are you? I'm doing great. Now, like a pretty decent Monday for Monday.

[00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:24.290]
Yeah, not too bad, not too bad so far. You know, if all those pigs were out there, it probably

[00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.050]
would be better for a lot of people. Well, that's why we're getting a lot of calls today, because

[00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:30.910]
everybody is scared spittless, so they're all up at the cars and the garage and they're inside.

[00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.430]
They don't dare to go anywhere to them, Tony. I was sitting here remodeling my house. You know,

[00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:38.350]
I lost my job. I used to be an advertising, so I know what you mean about the sales department.

[00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.990]
You know, and here I sit there thinking about the pigs out there and we're saying,

[00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:46.490]
the sales people are right. You know, I mean, if they need money, what did they do? They go out

[00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:51.870]
and they stake out behind a van. Is that about right? Yes, sir. You should have seen that scene on

[00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.490]
Flamingo Road this morning. One of the most embarrassed, that's the second time I've seen them pull

[00:36:55.490 --> 00:37:01.750]
that crap and they're like hunched over this, this, I don't know what a Jeep or something that's

[00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:06.710]
next to the van and they got their radar guns stuck up the street and their fingers stuck up their

[00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:10.830]
butt and it's just pathetic. It is. You know, and that's the thing that they're really embarrassed

[00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.990]
and it's more than that their fingers stuck up each other's butt, which is kind of interesting.

[00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:17.250]
Yeah, you don't know. That's why they're hiding behind that van. Right. Now you're talking.

[00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:21.230]
That's one of my favorite roads. I like to fly in that highway. Yeah. Nice and wide open.

[00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:25.470]
I'm telling you, I go 48, 50 miles. Never go more than that because I just know they're going to be there.

[00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.550]
Long as weather's permitting, you know. Oh, yeah, Lane just came in with their new push,

[00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:34.830]
with their new nose. Look at that. Boy. I was reading the paper there and missed something about the

[00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:41.590]
name of the potential. Yeah, we don't discuss that anymore. Well, I had one. I had one. I'm here.

[00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:47.550]
Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Please. I beg you. Don't do it. Neil, I told him for 15 minutes.

[00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:51.830]
What is it? And nobody mentioned it. And it's one of the, I think it's probably one of the best.

[00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:56.210]
Boy, chop a little. Will you sir stop whimping around? What is it? Oh, it's the Miami Mag Pies.

[00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:57.790]
You know.

[00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:07.230]
1156 at W.I.O.D. We have two open lines in date. Why do you spoil it? And otherwise not to bed call?

[00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:12.770]
Why did he spoil it? I warned him tonight. I said, don't do it. You'll be sorry. We'll all be sorry,

[00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:26.190]
including the audience couldn't control himself. We have two open lines in date. 751. Where's

[00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:32.990]
the upper nylons? Boy, is she looking really bizarre? Well, I mean, it's such a dramatic change.

[00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:38.050]
It's just so drastic. It isn't like it. No, seriously, it's like a different person. You can get

[00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.690]
used to it if there was just, you know, just a little subtle change, like most nose drops. But

[00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:46.610]
this is like somebody took a nose off some entirely different person and slapped it on her

[00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:51.930]
pus. It's incredible. But you'll get used to it because she's going to say, are we all good doing

[00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:57.470]
the nose? It's just kind of, wouldn't that be something if they gave her a new nose and she had

[00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:02.270]
like this real nasal? If she sounded like Rick Riley with that real nasal sound.

[00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:06.150]
Anyway, speaking of Rick Riley, the very own Rick and Spud will be along,

[00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:11.150]
the container from 2 to 6 to 7. You can all be children again. Buffalo Bob Smith, howdy,

[00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:16.090]
duty. Is he going to say punk your magic thing? Well, we'll find out. That's from 2 to 6.

[00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:21.490]
Joseph Gackey on sports talk at 605 and the rotisserie show with Hank 8 to 11 tonight.

[00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.390]
Okay, and already we've had all kinds of predictions in the building that Rick teamed up with Sally

[00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:32.770]
now is going to be a gigantic hit. Anyway, it's 1206 at WIOD. Here's a lady in Davy.

[00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:38.450]
Hello, Neil. Hi. Hi. I just don't know what I'm going to be moving to Orlando. I'm going to

[00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:45.530]
miss you. You're moving to Orlando with all those crackers up there. Oh, man. I got to get away from

[00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:50.230]
Neil Farth some of her. Nothing but a bunch of old spit kickers up there. Well, not

[00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:55.950]
around universal. Probably work at universal. Oh, I see. We're with some living and breathing people.

[00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:01.930]
Yeah. Really, something new. Well, if you're going to be that far south, you can pick us up.

[00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:06.510]
Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, good. Because I was up there and it would take fuzzed out. I don't want

[00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:10.290]
to talk to you. Well, it gets a little scratchy, but that all depends on where you are. You can hear it.

[00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.330]
Oh, good. I was getting worried there for a moment. Being there saw the way over to Naples.

[00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:20.070]
Oh, okay. I have a long time listening, but I have never called. I don't know why, but...

[00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:24.250]
Well, that's great. See if you would have waited you to go on up to Orlando. We had never heard from you.

[00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:29.310]
Oh, really? You're not in great? Oh, well, I want to call Stacy a douchebag.

[00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.590]
Okay. And love your show and I'll miss you.

[00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:33.850]
Well, good luck. All right. Thank you.

[00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:37.890]
Call us collect when you get bored like the second day. All right. See you.

[00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:42.650]
All right. Bye-bye. Mark, it's up 11 and a half points. The Dow Jones infernal average.

[00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:48.270]
We have an open line in the center square. It's star IOD. George is foaming at the mouth because it seems dark in there.

[00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:53.910]
It does seem dark in there. Just that we're getting a lot older. Okay. Things are starting to like get real dim.

[00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.150]
There's kind of... Well, maybe it's the haze in this place today. This is a real hazy day.

[00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:04.030]
Things are just... You can always get that feeling when you walk into back door.

[00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:09.190]
In fact, so far, auto-start giving the climactic... the climactic conditions inside.

[00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.670]
Instead of outside. Do you think we're going to get all the business in this hour, George?

[00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.630]
Can we squeeze it all in? Miami Beach. Hello.

[00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.530]
I need a meal. The okay.

[00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:26.850]
I've got a little paid report. All of our tax dollars are going. They're a harbor police.

[00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:32.990]
I go through the tow booth. I just bought a scooter. A little bit of scooter, right?

[00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:37.330]
I bought a little bitty one, yeah. Yeah, let's not. So I pay my money every time go through there.

[00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:42.330]
And so the girl, she looks at me. She says, listen, it's so small. Go on the ground.

[00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:45.490]
On the side. Yeah. So I do that for a few days.

[00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:53.410]
Yeah, I do that for a few days. I guess I got a new tow booth. I guess you call it the police, right?

[00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:57.510]
So about two days later... So small, just go on the side.

[00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:05.670]
Yeah. Well, okay. So a few days later, I'm coming back towards. And I see from this game

[00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:10.310]
in Bunevoir, they're checking me out. All the way there. They're checking you out for biscuit in Bunevoir.

[00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:14.350]
Yeah, the police. Well, all these police components are starting to put together into a very

[00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:19.310]
Toddry story, sir. Yeah, they're front of me, behind me everywhere. You know, I'm just,

[00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:25.510]
um, so when I get to the tow booth, I go on the grass. And the next thing I know, I see a motorcycle

[00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:31.450]
cop. Yeah. It pulls me over, right? It's against the law to go on the grass, sir.

[00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:35.870]
Hey, I just doing what they told me. Just doing what comes naturally.

[00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:44.850]
Well, you know, yeah. But anyway, I told the story. He goes back to the tow booth and checks it

[00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:48.890]
out 20 minutes later. He says, no, don't go on the grass. You're right. You know, I shouldn't be going on the grass.

[00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:54.470]
Okay, 10 after, you know, that's all I could stand. I don't know about you, but I couldn't take

[00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:58.230]
another second. We have an open line of date County. I mean, if you're going to go on the grass,

[00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:04.490]
you're going to get busted for it. Okay, pal, quit going on the grass. 751 W I O D indeed.

[00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:10.770]
Fort Lauderdale. I just want to listen. Yeah. Because I already called once I can't make it

[00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:16.790]
about course. Okay. Open line in Palm Beach at 655. And that was on a Palm Beach line.

[00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:20.890]
Is that give you an idea of how worthwhile that line is? That's what we get on there. We get, like,

[00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:28.490]
swill. We get the sludge of the universe on that line. 655 9463 and somebody just expired and

[00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:35.650]
proured 524 North Lauderdale. Hey, Neil. Yeah. How are you doing? Okay. Just from watching on TV.

[00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:40.950]
I can't imagine what the hell you watch it on TV. The new match game. Oh, yeah, who's on that?

[00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:48.870]
Well, the old Marshall Wallace. Remember that red info. That awful face. Yeah. And guess who's

[00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:55.690]
up to that top right? Charles Nelson Riley. Of course. Is he? Yeah. He looks like he's about

[00:43:55.690 --> 00:44:02.810]
140 years old now. Yeah, he's a bad looking old queen. And then they have Sally Struthers. I

[00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:08.950]
guess she's hard up for work. Yeah. Well, she's been for money for the poor exactly. And Fred

[00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:14.430]
Travillena. Another chronic game show type person because he can't get any other work.

[00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:19.350]
Hey, you ever watched that head of the class or whatever? Nope. There's a girl on there. I

[00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:25.170]
guess she's trying to break into the old game show business. She's in the old Fanny Flag seat.

[00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.990]
But what is it called? Head for the class head of the class.

[00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:37.290]
Yeah. From right there. But I was driving down to Halendell Beach Boulevard between

[00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:46.630]
US one and A1A. Yeah, your music way. These old old ladies, they don't even look when they cross

[00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:51.610]
the street. Almost ran into two of them. Boy, then they had a lot of points. Don't you understand?

[00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:57.750]
Then they have the nerve to sit there and, you know, first screaming at me when my life. I just

[00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:03.150]
came up with a great way to decrease the to lower the median age in South Florida. Yeah. And that is,

[00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:07.270]
we're going to have, you know, how they have these different checkpoints with a pixel over. We're

[00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:13.090]
going to set up a WIOD as a cubic service. And we're going to hand out those masks, you know,

[00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:19.350]
those black masks. And when you're turning east off of I-95 on a Halendell Beach Boulevard,

[00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:24.630]
we hand you, we stop you, we give you a mask and it's required that you wear it over your eyes

[00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:30.370]
until you get to your destination. Yeah. Can you imagine about two days we can wipe out all those

[00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:34.670]
old farts, sir? Yeah. We can lower the median age to life. I think you're out in the streets,

[00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:39.190]
looking for pennies or something like that. Yeah, pathetic. But yeah, they were screaming at me and

[00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:44.730]
my life was green and they're, you know, no, don't walk, I was. I got off the turnpike yesterday

[00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:50.630]
and I just paid my 50 cents and of course there's about four lanes that merge into two or three.

[00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:57.330]
And some old geeky woman is, she was ahead of me. Uh-huh. And there are three lanes there.

[00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:02.330]
And there's no, she's in the right hand lane and I'm behind her, but I'm in my vet obviously

[00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:07.430]
and she's going about 10 miles an hour going nowhere. And so now for no reason at all, she pulls over

[00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:12.330]
into the middle and her traffic coming from her left and all she is is creating chaos. You know what I'm

[00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:16.230]
saying? Yeah. So I whip around around her right because I'm not going to go 10 miles an hour. I mean,

[00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:21.110]
she's, she's just in the, and she gives me a look and you know, with that wave of the hand, like,

[00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:26.030]
what are you doing? Yeah, really. I just like to bust her into God damn mouth. You know what? I mean,

[00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:30.250]
what kind of crap is that every time somebody else down here does something wrong, especially the

[00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:35.050]
older they are, and you try to get around them or survive, they look at you and they give you

[00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:39.270]
the finger and a look and all this other unbelievable. Well, they have the right way. There's a

[00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.530]
right. Exactly. If you're, if you're over the age of death, you have the right way.

[00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:47.490]
That was driving up a federal highway near Oakland Park and this old man and his wife.

[00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:54.930]
You know, it's three lanes and they stop in the left lane near the medium. Yep. Hold up traffic in the old

[00:46:54.930 --> 00:47:02.130]
lady, dip out of the car and walk across the street. What's her dinner, honey? Something new.

[00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:09.230]
Musburger help. Yeah, it's a little turkey, a four little ham and a whole lot of bloating.

[00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:19.070]
It's, it's so bland. It didn't use to be in the box. Not anymore. It's been canned.

[00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:24.370]
Really? And it's so easy to prepare. It's practically self-serving. Isn't that right, Jimmy?

[00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:29.870]
It certainly is, mom. That is a plate. He's again. It's so tough.

[00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:35.670]
Most of the helpers. And trying to proof-flavored Musburger helper with a taste of our great.

[00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:44.350]
Funny afternoon at W.I.O.D., the red dragon, Curse of Hannibal Lecter this Friday.

[00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:54.150]
Is it Friday? May 3rd. Let's see one. Yeah, Friday. I think it's 8 o'clock. I'm not sure, 8 or 9 o'clock.

[00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:59.630]
1968's manhutter retitled the Cacheon on the Sun and Siddalayam's red dragon, the Curse of

[00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:07.110]
Hannibal Lecter on NBC Friday night. How the hell are they going to show that? It's such a bizarre and

[00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:16.730]
tasteless and crappy and interesting and erotic and weird. Don't miss it. 20 afternoon at W.I.O.D.,

[00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:22.870]
Boka. Hey, Neil. Yeah. Larry King was on David Letterman on Friday night. I didn't see it,

[00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:27.150]
but Roger was telling me this morning that David ripped him and asked and I wish I would have seen it.

[00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:33.530]
It was, you know, Larry came on to the same field, same crap. Yeah. Anyway, on his on the radio show,

[00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:42.270]
that night people were calling up Kissing his brother. Anyway, there's one small calls and he says,

[00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:48.410]
you know, if you had Larry, I met you about 15, 16 years ago when you were on the air in Miami at I.O.D.,

[00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:55.070]
and I came, there was a stand appreciation night. I don't know why I don't do that anymore.

[00:48:56.010 --> 00:49:01.190]
Anyway, so I came to the studio, I met you and Neil Rogers and Bill Crowder was there.

[00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:10.150]
You were saying that you had just come to the market and you and Bill Crowder were there. Yeah. Is that a fact?

[00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:15.410]
Were you there? I remember doing that. No. There's no one in hell with I.O.D. when you first came. No.

[00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:23.570]
So, what is this guy talking about? I remember doing that. That's what he said. Yeah. I remember doing that.

[00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:28.410]
Anyway, this guy is watching match game. What was he called Hollywood?

[00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:35.430]
The guy watching match game. Yeah, what about him? I'm watching God. Frankie Pan Angel is taking a bath.

[00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:42.810]
Oh, good. Don't miss it. 22 afternoon at I.O.D., who wants to see some old a hairy guy take a bath anyway?

[00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:49.470]
We have an open line in Broward 524WIWD, not me, not even Ron Jeremy, especially not Ron Jeremy.

[00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:54.710]
God, I get goosebumps thinking about that. Jimmy Music. Neil Rogers.

[00:49:55.030 --> 00:50:00.230]
Quantum. How you doing? Okay. Listen, I was listening to an interview on a radio station from

[00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:05.830]
Pomano Beach doing an interview with Mickey Mantle. Yeah. We reflected on his recent interview on Larry King's show.

[00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:09.990]
And the guy said, what kind of interviewer is Larry King? Mickey Mantle said the worst.

[00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:16.370]
I don't know to do it that. He said absolutely the worst. And since you're a little slack on advertising today,

[00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:22.790]
do you hear about the people that energizer getting all of a sudden because a chorus is going to do a takeoff on their

[00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:27.410]
funny rabbit thing? Really? That's right. Very upset about it. What does that have to do with anything?

[00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:30.390]
I just thought I'd throw it into your short on advertising. That's right.

[00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:37.290]
Well, I want to make you understand something. When it gets to be the 29th and 30th at the end of a quarter

[00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:43.550]
or at the end of a month, it's like these days are written off. And you know, in the sales department,

[00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:47.230]
they only sell like starting the first of the month. You know what I'm saying? That's not right.

[00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:51.870]
So today and tomorrow or maybe only today, there'll be like no business all day long. And then all

[00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:56.870]
of a sudden it'll be like we'll be doing 18 minute breaks. Uh-huh. Well, see, today you can talk a little

[00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:02.050]
advertising. If you don't have a solicitor. No. I thought that was terrible because the energizer ads are

[00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:06.530]
based on making fun of other people's ads. And now, chorus wants to do a little fun with them. Well,

[00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:10.750]
screw them is what I say. Sure. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen, right?

[00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:14.230]
I agree with you. And I just threw into home space where I've got to go. Nice talking with you.

[00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:16.770]
Okay. See you, Jimmy. Don't call us again too soon.

[00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:21.210]
No, I mean, really, you know, it's one thing to make fun of other people just like I do. And then

[00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:25.690]
if people who rip me and I be thin skinned about it will be wrong. You can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.

[00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:31.430]
Exactly. We have an open line in Dave County, seven-fifth. And that's what I would say to Hank,

[00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:37.930]
too, the same thing. Okay. If you can't stand the heat, then cut the crap. Hank, Hank, just, I don't know.

[00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:43.630]
I like Hank. He's a great guy sometimes. But he wants you. These sports people, if you look at him

[00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:48.250]
cross-side right away, they start getting emotional and hostile and hysterical and all this other crap.

[00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:54.510]
Nobody promotes that show on his station more than I do. Nobody. Now, because I'm a rip at occasional,

[00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:59.150]
I like tonight he's doing his rotisserie and fantasy link baseball crap. That's his business. It's his show.

[00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:05.210]
But at least I'm talking about it. Okay. But he gets so damn emotional. It's like, uh, God,

[00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:10.270]
like certain people in the building that you always have to kind of like do a little dance for to make

[00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:14.270]
sure that you're not upset or to make keep them happy. I don't want to mention Cheryl's name.

[00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:20.430]
You know what I'm saying? Like always like, uh, that tentative look like, uh, you know,

[00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:25.390]
you're going to smile at me. Come on. Give it a rest already. After the first 10 years, it gets old. Yeah.

[00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:35.110]
Bringing my, my little suit, my straight jacket. I don't wear a straight jacket. Okay. Here's

[00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:36.590]
Mr. High Kalani himself.

[00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:42.750]
Fresh gentlemen, pressing the plastic tip in too far could result in irritation to the bowel wall.

[00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:47.210]
Speaking of flushing New York, here's Mr. Mr.

[00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:51.630]
Gaulstone. So when you're done with that reading, I've got a real good book for you.

[00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:58.130]
Calls up tissue cleansing to bowel management. I still think my favorite line in this whole

[00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:02.630]
my favorite line following the treatment, clean the experiment from your stone.

[00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:06.510]
Now this isn't about Mick Jagger, is it? No, I don't think so.

[00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.910]
I'll later describe and freeze them. Stick them in as your friends.

[00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:14.090]
Throw them to your friends and the family. It'll make for lots of fun. Now show them to your doctors

[00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:17.530]
so he'll be able to agree with you to cancel the operation. You want to hear something sick?

[00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:24.510]
Yeah, not too sick. I did that. I froze them. You put the little screen on the pot and collect them.

[00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:28.090]
Yeah. Trade them with your friends or polyg baseball cards.

[00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:35.230]
Yeah. Anyway, I went out and read it while the work had to be. I understand that after

[00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:39.770]
freezing for about a week they start glowing. Well, they can't do this radiating thing in the freezer.

[00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:41.850]
You can't stand the heat. Get out of the kitchen. Right.

[00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:45.050]
It now riches case. I don't know if he could fit them in the freezer.

[00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:48.870]
Are you going to start picking up that rich? No, no. How's he feeling?

[00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:53.730]
I don't know. He's just a full of crap. You know, he talks a good game for a couple of days

[00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:57.370]
and then he makes excuses to go start eating the game. But I shouldn't talk. I ate like a pig

[00:53:57.370 --> 00:54:01.030]
yesterday. You know, you talk about me being pasty. He looks pasty.

[00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:06.630]
No, he doesn't look pasty. He just looks fatty. Looks like he's got one foot in and one foot out.

[00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:11.890]
And lately, he looks like he's got a foot in a half and it's not a joking matter. He better

[00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:16.890]
crack. Yeah, he better speaking of pasty. I rented Wild Orchid the other night. Have you seen that?

[00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:21.470]
I wouldn't want is that Mickey work? Yeah. I wouldn't watch a Mickey work movie if it paid me $50.

[00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:26.090]
Oh my god. Well, I'll tell you what, he's fighting at the War Memorial on the 23rd of May.

[00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:30.570]
He's getting back into boxing and I'm going down there to hope to see him get his ass kicked.

[00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:35.190]
Oh, god. He must be desperate. He and Leon Spinks. He is so

[00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:40.490]
f***ing ugly. I mean, who cares? You know, people are just so desperate. I don't want to see

[00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:44.330]
ugly people rolling around on him. But you know, we're just before, just before he filmed Wild

[00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:49.610]
Orchid, he had a facelift. Okay. And he's all, you get all puffy. You know how Elaine knows

[00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:54.050]
is? Yeah. Well, his cheeks are like that. Her cheeks are like that too, but not the ones that

[00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:59.050]
are face necessarily. They're all puffed up. Boy, where do they put the nose? Same place.

[00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:03.390]
Anyway, right? Right smack in between the cheeks. I couldn't believe you had somebody from,

[00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:09.290]
you had a call earlier to magpies. I know a bunch of douche bags. Why do you have to dignify that?

[00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:14.210]
Well, that's their name. That's their team. They're cycling group. Team name. I know I'm called. I don't

[00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:18.450]
care. Markets of 15 and a half. I don't hear the call. I didn't hear the call. I just heard

[00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:22.130]
part of it. I don't know what they said or what they did. Didn't say anything. It was an okay call

[00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:26.130]
until he started with this crap about. He's got a name for the team. Then yesterday I'm in the

[00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:31.030]
car and I'm listening to Joe, which is I was going very slow, of course. And some guy,

[00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:36.010]
crank calls and he says, I got a name for the team. And it was, which we've heard a million times

[00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:41.470]
before because it's a blockbuster in Huzanga. How about the, what I can't even think of what

[00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:48.070]
the hell it is? The Bobbusters. You know, we've had that how many times a million times? And Joe,

[00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:54.250]
being Mr. Sense of humor. No, seriously, I mean, these people on sports talk have no sense of

[00:55:54.250 --> 00:56:01.170]
humor at all. Okay? And he not only does he hang up and says, oh, what a waste of time. You know,

[00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:05.270]
I mean, he says, and he says to think that anybody would take that under consideration.

[00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:11.490]
I mean, the guys are crank. Okay? And he's like taking it real surly. I mean, it's just so far

[00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:15.090]
out. Who would even take that into consideration? So in other words, as if to say, it would have been

[00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:19.410]
something that would have been taken into consideration. That would have been a great call. I mean,

[00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:24.070]
these sports, the jocks niffers, Manay, have got no sense of humor at all. Well, maybe you

[00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:29.070]
ought to give him a copy of that and give it to him. So seriously, just they're like, they think

[00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:33.470]
that everything else that's going on in the world is secondary compared to the WLAF scores. You

[00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:37.650]
know, I mean, give me a break. I think maybe we should buy Joe's on Kalimia board. What do you think?

[00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:45.390]
I think he's frozen his somewhere for posterity. All right. So anyway, I hope you enjoy the

[00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:47.950]
reading and let me know if you're going to do it. I'm sure you're going to do it. Well, at least now,

[00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:52.330]
you got some good reading to do while you're getting rid of the stone. Let me tell you this book.

[00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:59.750]
I've gotten my hand now. You would love there's more material in this. Okay. Even Richard Nixon never saw

[00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:07.690]
plumber like this guy. Good day. Good night. 29 past noon at WIOD here on a frantic Monday. Boy,

[00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:11.870]
my head is just swimming from the idea of freezing your gallstones and putting them into freezer.

[00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:16.070]
I hope you don't have anything like wrapped up in there like old hamburger meat stuff like that.

[00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:22.270]
Well, you know, in the refrigerator, I don't know about in the freezer,

[00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:27.910]
but in the refrigerator, tastes have a tendency to mingle. You know what I'm saying? Aromas and

[00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:32.510]
tastes they start intermingling unless they're wrapped real tight. So I don't know what the taste

[00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:36.210]
would be of the gallstones, but I don't think I want to find out. Here's a mobile in Halea.

[00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:43.810]
Halea. Yes, sir. Hello. Yeah. Hey, deals to pleasure talking to you. Finally. Yeah. Are you

[00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:49.090]
a Chicagoan or an extra-cogoon? No, sir. You're not. No. Okay. I don't know why I just thought that

[00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:54.590]
you kept on talking favorably about Chicago, which most people don't, but why not? I don't know.

[00:57:54.590 --> 00:58:00.190]
Yeah, the, uh, I'm just looking at it. It's about New York. So I thought you were now. Chicago is,

[00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:04.290]
I mean, you can't even compare the two. Chicago is a great is like a, should that be in the same

[00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:11.350]
Chicago is a 500 on a scale of one if New York is a minus eight. In all lessons, um, is this a

[00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:20.010]
sister station to W.I.N.D.? No. No. Okay, because you keep on coming across with the same

[00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:27.870]
type of format with the W.I.N.D. W.I.O.D. No. No. No way. Probably the same crappy jingo

[00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:33.090]
company. We're the jingles, but we have nothing to do with them. We do have an FM station up there.

[00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:37.810]
I don't know what the callers are. We have some FM classic crock music station up there in Chicago.

[00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:49.990]
Years ago, they had a format pretty much like yours that was Larry Delegion. I don't know if you

[00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:55.370]
Larry Loujack. Larry Loujack, yes, that goes without saying, but Larry, Larry, Larry,

[00:58:55.530 --> 00:59:00.650]
Larry, Larry, who the hell is that? Some kind of a Southern type person that was on I.N.D.

[00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:06.030]
And never heard of it. Now, tarp, the airway is pretty good. But you do it all right as a,

[00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:13.290]
probably Dick Beyondy's illegitimate son. As far as the, uh, uh, blindfold gig for, uh,

[00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:20.290]
son, right? Yeah. I live in son, right? I'm wearing, uh, the blindfolds right now. Okay,

[00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:26.590]
Florida. I'll keep track. How many points do you get for a pregnant nun? 50,000. Oh my God.

[00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:32.090]
Good luck to you, man. That's a good one. See you. Boy, why is it they do okay,

[00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:43.210]
right up till the end? They start pressing, you know, start pressing. 1231 at W.I.O.D., we have

[00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:48.550]
I just can't handle it. I'm just, um, I mean, last year was one thing, but this year it's just,

[00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:53.430]
uh, the big letdown, as usual, the big, big build up and then the gigantic,

[00:59:55.570 --> 01:00:03.010]
awful. Here's a mobile in Miami on their dime. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. This is Ted Somers. I'm

[01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:07.830]
Evans father. You're living Evan. The guy that brings you to Chinese. Oh, yeah. Listen, uh,

[01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:12.450]
try to bring us to Chinese. Well, we bought the Chinese. I bought the Chinese. I know you bought it.

[01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:16.750]
I know, but he was nice enough to pick it up and bring it to every point. Right. All right. Listen,

[01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:20.350]
I tried to get three last week when you were talking about that rich with his global out of

[01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:26.090]
problems. Yeah. I had a very serious attack about a year and a half ago. Okay. Uh, which developed

[01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:31.010]
into a case of acute pancreatitis because one of the stones passed through the pancreatic duct.

[01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:35.810]
Ooh. Yeah. I needless to say, I was in a lot of pain. I was in the hospital about 10 days.

[01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:40.870]
Uh, I have a buck that that's really very innovative and he's very short.

[01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:46.670]
He put me on a new medication called ac teglol. Your pat rich has been taken. Okay. My

[01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:52.370]
stone. I had three months. They have dissolved completely. Wow. How long did you have? How long

[01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:57.490]
did you take it? I've taken it now probably about 15 months. And it takes up to two takes about

[01:00:57.490 --> 01:01:01.570]
two years to work. Yeah, but don't you have a problem as they shrink and start getting into

[01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:06.370]
the bile duct. Don't have a lot of tanks. They absolutely dissolve. Uh, the last time

[01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:10.830]
they don't dissolve overnight. I mean, they keep getting smaller. No, no, no. Well, actually,

[01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:14.930]
they would have what a happy I don't know how they dissolve, but they do dissolve and there's

[01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:20.210]
like granules of sand left. And the sand flushes itself out. And then MacDonald carry comes to your

[01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:24.890]
house and says like, sand is through the hourglass. And we build swimming pools. Yeah. But, uh, they're

[01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:28.710]
gone. The only thing you know, what are the stones of our lives? There are two types of stones,

[01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:34.170]
you know, one of cholesterol based, one of calcium based. Uh, the pill only works on cholesterol

[01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:39.070]
based stones. So if you have calcium based stones, maybe you have to dissolve it. What do you

[01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:43.230]
know about? How do you know which is well left? If the, if the, if the actical spots dissolving the

[01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:48.570]
stones that basically cholesterol, yeah. Okay. And in my case, they were and I understand it

[01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:54.210]
90% of the cases they are cholesterol based. But the stuff is fantastic. There's no pain. There's no

[01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:59.870]
F perfect and the stones are gone. Uh, and these home remedies are great, but you have to know

[01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:04.030]
what the fight effect can be. Right. Okay. All right. Well, I know he's taking that. So we'll see.

[01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:10.970]
Well, it should work. If he's, uh, if he's taken so would they as, as the medication itself prescribes,

[01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:17.170]
if he's don't like me and I'm sure he is, he should go up to free. I, I was taken free of

[01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:21.570]
a one in the morning and through it when I went to bed. And they really worked. They worked great.

[01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:27.670]
No side effect. Okay. No problem. Well, we'll see how it all comes out. Okay. So to speak. All right. Thank you.

[01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:35.330]
1234 W I O D the doctor's in. Hello, doctor. I got such a pain doctor. We have an open line and

[01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:41.110]
brown word 524 W I O D 524 Raspberry Enema time and we'll be right back.

[01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:53.030]
This is the most disgusting program. I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[01:02:53.750 --> 01:03:00.030]
On this Sunday's very special Easter episode, Jigs got the flu and look who's replacing him.

[01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:07.790]
It's John Paul the second. All right. Great. Great. Okay. Okay. You got me. I couldn't

[01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:11.550]
Okay. You're forgetting. Nice work, folks. Let's blow.

[01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:19.330]
You know, you wouldn't have this flowed if you'd take off that hat. Don't miss Pope and the fat man.

[01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:25.110]
This Sunday night at 10. That's the same alleged voice that's a takeoff on the board. The love

[01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:29.470]
both. Another one. I was sitting out in the yard yesterday and of course it's the time of the

[01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:34.970]
year we're getting close to summer and everything that crawls and flies, including some of the

[01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:42.770]
neighborhoods is out. Everything creepy, nasty, locusts, wasps. In fact, we're taking up a petition

[01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:48.610]
now because we got too many wasps in my neighborhood, not enough Jews and blacks. But um, and so anyway,

[01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:55.070]
it's May is coming and May, October, our love bug month. And I started laughing out loud because

[01:03:55.070 --> 01:04:02.510]
I was thinking about that guy. The love bugs. The love boat. Oh, God. I mean, what is wrong with the

[01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:08.730]
world? What? What? What is the appeal of that? Can you tell me? Can you answer that question? Why

[01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:14.290]
would anybody like that? It's just it's nauseating. It's like if you keep turning the public off

[01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:19.590]
enough, they'll start enjoying it. It's like administering pain and conditioning people to SNM.

[01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:25.030]
And if you fly, isolate them enough, they're going to start loving it. Love bug.

[01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:30.690]
Anyway, what do you do to those things? Well, those are the most disgusting. Have you ever driven

[01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:35.250]
like up through the state and May or October when the love bugs are out? And at the end of about

[01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:40.730]
a half an hour, your car is just the whole grill and the windshield and ah, you might as well just

[01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:46.630]
take the damn car and throw it out. Forget it. Even Spencer ain't going to help help that baby.

[01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:52.690]
Even with that boric acid that he uses on a dash. North Miami Beach.

[01:04:53.210 --> 01:05:00.350]
With what they have to do. Good afternoon today. Men who sweep with their grandmothers.

[01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:08.130]
The topic is interested in all of us. Here's two men here, the grandmothers. We have a

[01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:14.430]
grandmother in the audience, molested by her son. The whole thing is bizarre and it's going to spin itself out.

[01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:20.730]
Yeah, spin this, Larry. 1239 at W.I.O.D. We have an open line in day,

[01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:27.790]
7.5. One I guarantee if he had her although as his guest on a show, he would never say any of that.

[01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:32.150]
It would be, oh God, there was the best grandmother routine I ever saw in my life.

[01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:34.450]
Where'd you find those great grandmothers? How was great? It was great.

[01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:39.050]
You're a but sucker, Larry. You're a phony and a but sucking fool.

[01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:44.830]
We have an open line in Broward. Did I say that at 5249463?

[01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:48.030]
524WI.

[01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:52.830]
D. Miami.

[01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:59.290]
Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil. Yeah. Yeah, how you doing? Okay. My first time caller.

[01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:03.170]
Great. Fantastic, sir. Welcome to this place. Yeah, you sound excited.

[01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:10.690]
I want to ask you for a favor. I wanted to know if you'll, there's about a half an hour.

[01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:15.970]
Well, not only do you want a favor, but it's got to be like time out. Well, the thing is that the girl

[01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:22.430]
that I worked with is not to lunch. Well, she doesn't, yeah, she doesn't know why you guys make fun of

[01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:27.390]
ambitious so much. Really? So you want to hear Anne ball? That's what I want to hear that

[01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:32.950]
card. Hmm. About a half an hour. Do you understand what you've just done? What? You've gone from

[01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:36.990]
getting everybody, including me all enthused because your first time you sound like you're under the

[01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:42.330]
age of 500 and you've just turned it around completely. You've not only made a request, but you

[01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:48.450]
want to hear it in a half hour. Neil, do you work tomorrow? Last time I checked.

[01:06:49.490 --> 01:07:02.930]
How you deal? Yeah. I was going to see if you wanted to go to six flags of land, it's with me

[01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:06.510]
Neil, what do you want? What do you really want? I want to hear Anne Bishop and

[01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:11.070]
Neil. After that line, you want to go down to six flags of land, isn't slide on my knee?

[01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:18.710]
Neil, your callostomy bag. Okay. Goodbye. See you. 1240 at WIOD is not a first time call.

[01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:23.170]
You're not fooling us, sir. We have an open line in date. He's called from the channel 10 newsroom.

[01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:28.430]
7519463. That was Dwight. You know, that was Dwight on the phone. He let some of his moustaches

[01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:33.610]
here right on the thing. And one open line in Broward, 524. Here's a column, Cassimmy.

[01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:38.350]
Hi, Neil. Yep. This is another first time caller. He was no first time caller. He is a

[01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:44.310]
slime ball. He was a gigantic, pocket raspberry animal waiting to happen. Waiting to explode.

[01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:49.330]
On the other, I got the ultimate spy report. Yeah. Listening to the great. I know why a lot of people

[01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:53.430]
don't call this show, sir, because they're intimidated because they have no balls.

[01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:57.510]
You have any idea how many people listen to the show, but how many of them like that last

[01:07:57.510 --> 01:08:00.950]
caller are just cowardly little of wimps? I'm a long-dreamer. I'm here from

[01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:05.730]
Cassimmy from all places. Well, we don't care. Okay. Well, I was listening to the great FM radio

[01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:09.890]
that's here in Central Florida. Yep. Some days ago. Yeah, sure wasn't from down here.

[01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:17.650]
I know listening to 94.1. Then you easy Y. I hear the Delta tones of Mr. Glenn. Don't call me

[01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:25.270]
the bird. Phil. Are I want station? Easy Y. Easy listening. 94.1 in Lakeland. Wow.

[01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:32.690]
Unbelievable. Incredible. Is it he didn't tackle? He didn't talk about Phoebe Cates. He didn't

[01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:43.270]
talk about tennis. He gets. He spun the hits. It was shocking. Yeah. Unbelievable. It was

[01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:49.550]
sh**ing shocking. Well, now let me tell you one other thing. Yeah. Next, this coming up, we can

[01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:53.990]
the awesome braze are going to sweep the cup right out of full and county state. Good

[01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:58.610]
me. Good me. That's braze. You're not going to get me excited about it. One way or the other.

[01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:01.790]
I mean, the braze. I'm a long-time braze fan and this is shocking.

[01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:07.190]
Eight. Eight. You guys suck. Let's face it. But Dave Jeff does looks good, doesn't he? Yeah.

[01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:15.730]
Okay. See you. Thank you. 1242 at WIOD. We have an open line on the starline. 5249463. The

[01:09:15.730 --> 01:09:19.110]
Palm Beach line is there. You know, then I'm worried if you want to use it fine if not

[01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:28.050]
we're used to it. Davey. Hello. How y'all doing? Pretty good. How are you? Okay. Hey, listen,

[01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:33.870]
I just heard you talking about the braze. I'm a big braze fan. Yeah. And I'm just incredibly

[01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:38.290]
shocked about how they've been playing lately. Well, hey, listen, you know, every dog has his day.

[01:09:38.730 --> 01:09:42.230]
But there's one thing that I have a problem with. Yeah. And that's Tom Glavin.

[01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:46.210]
And I want to know if you want to make a trade with Bosky.

[01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:51.510]
Okay. I heard he just hit a home run a few days ago. No chance. What? No.

[01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:56.130]
Karate. Harry likes Lavin. He's a very handsome young man. Well, that's okay.

[01:09:56.470 --> 01:10:00.770]
Oh, come on. Okay. Walking Sean Bosky. Sean Bosky is God's. No way. Come on.

[01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:04.850]
The only guy we got in the community is the youngest best looking prospect in the major league.

[01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:08.490]
We already got good looking guys. They just can't play. We don't need any more good looking guys

[01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:12.810]
who can't play. Okay. Okay. Well, let me have a request then. Yes, sir. What do you mean? Let

[01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:17.250]
you have a request? You're like the other guy with a colostomy bag. Come on. I'm a second time

[01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:22.110]
calling. Give me a break. Oh, man. What do you want? Okay. How about the apples on? No chance. Come on.

[01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:28.590]
No way. That was my favorite. God almighty. Don't you know the audience has grossed out by hearing that

[01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:32.710]
50 billion time? Hold on. Hold on a second. Okay. I'll go away. Don't go away. Okay.

[01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:37.190]
Now what do you think? Should we play it? Come on. Come on. Come on.

[01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:43.350]
Oh, geez. It's on a stupid jackass on it with a pig report. Hello. I wanted to mention

[01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:48.210]
everybody that for my birthday tonight. I'm inviting the entire city. Okay. Hello.

[01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:53.310]
Clear that. We got I'm trying to take a little poll on the phone. We got everybody playing

[01:10:53.310 --> 01:11:00.790]
bits on the phone. There's nobody who'll speak. Hello. No. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Do you want to

[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:08.980]
hear it? No. Do you want to hear it? No. I'll sing it. You want to hear it? Where's the lightning

[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:19.200]
round? Well, you heard that, sir. I think you're in deep spit. Oh. What do you sound so deep?

[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:25.020]
Prest about. You must be calling from light bulb radio. That's nobody who likes the show calls to

[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:30.120]
request that song. Listen. I've had an active, an active sabotage. You know how you know how you

[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:35.480]
know the media for all out and the live's going off and your arms are both asleep and you can't turn

[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:42.940]
it off. Well, it depends on where they are. He tried to blame it on me. How about a little bit of time?

[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:51.980]
How's that? Okay. Let's go on, Neil. See you. It's fun. You deserve all the credit. You're an asshole tonight.

[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.840]
Okay. Little bit of time. It's all we can take. 1245 at WIOD. Let's do our last break of the

[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:02.220]
hour. Make sure we get all this business in on a heavy, heavy Monday. And we'll be right back.

[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:18.340]
All the white folks hate the black folks and the black folks hate the white folks to hate all but

[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:24.260]
the right folks is an old established rule. Oh, during national brotherhood week,

[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:31.420]
national brotherhood week, lean on horn and share it. Clark are dancing cheek to cheek.

[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:39.240]
Fun to utilize, but people you despise as long as you don't let them in your school.

[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:49.340]
Oh, the poor folks hate the rich folks and the rich folks hate the poor folks. All of my folks hate all of

[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:57.720]
your folks. It's American as Apple Pie, but during national brotherhood week, national brotherhood week,

[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:06.940]
New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans cause it's very chic. Step up and shake the hand of someone you can't stand.

[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:10.080]
You can tolerate him if you try.

[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:19.240]
All the Protestants hate the Catholics and the Catholics hate the Protestants and the Hindus.

[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:25.560]
Hate the Muslims and everybody hates the Jews but during national brotherhood week,

[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:32.700]
national brotherhood week, it's national everyone smile at one and neverhood week.

[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:44.880]
Be nice to people who are inferior to you. It's only for a week so have no fear. Be grateful that it doesn't last all year.

[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.480]
Okay, let's roll it kids. It's talking to Creek High. It's 1249 in WIOD. The center square is open and

[01:13:51.480 --> 01:14:00.540]
Broward 524 WIOD. Another pig report. I know. What? I know. Yeah. Okay. How about that pig report? Yeah.

[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:06.320]
Instead of the people stay home, they'd be staying in a trouble. Well, my neighbor has a travel trailer next

[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:12.460]
to our army on his private property. On his private parts, yeah. Yeah. And he doesn't use it every year.

[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.280]
So he just left it. Danny didn't re-know this thick because he's not going to be taken as drifter.

[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:21.560]
He went up to a Yellowstone Park and he said, well, I'm going to return a couple of years. I just let it set there.

[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:27.060]
Don't you know they came in and they properly input a citation on it for not having enough to dig on his own property?

[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:35.560]
Incredible. Hopefully. And you're on property. You're talking to stay on. You stay in harmony. Got it anyway.

[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:41.400]
On real. Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot, Neil. Good luck to him. Maybe just get out of town. I might do it.

[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:49.180]
Okay. We have an open line in date. 751 one on that center square. 524 wiod. Speak now forever. Hold it.

[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:55.340]
You notice when I was going through taking that little pole on that phone and there were I went to fork

[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:02.040]
lines and three of them had stuff that they were going to play. So I got all their tapes on

[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:07.300]
cute. Good. That'll teach you. Boy, I'm so tired of that. These people that have their little

[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:12.420]
recorders going and playing them on the phone and the recorder is up there but the phone is in

[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:17.140]
the living room and just incredible. Here's a mobile and four-lotterdale.

[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.100]
Hello? There's somebody on there. You know this?

[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:34.080]
Up yours, pal. One and Broward. 524. One on the starline. Star IOD. Let's go to Coral Springs. Hello.

[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:39.100]
Mr. Rogers. Yes, sir. You had Zimmer come out here and standing for reconcets in a gold vacation.

[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:44.180]
Yeah. He didn't do nothing. I might as well get out of our here anyway. What a... Why don't we want to say it?

[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:50.040]
I said to a fact, Freddie, about the colon rectal disorder's program.

[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:55.640]
Actually add the paper fence that no one saw it. Did you see it? It worked real good too,

[01:15:55.740 --> 01:16:00.200]
buddy. From the Pittsburgh fan. Okay. I thought that was funny. They do that like every week,

[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.420]
for that and there. Well, that's where Zimmer's got his finger these days.

[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.860]
I need it twice to see who's been naughty and nice. Are you going to cancel your remote in

[01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:15.720]
Chicago? What do you mean by that? Aren't you have a planned remote from here? Listen,

[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.980]
we have done that each year for the last two years and the plan is to do it every summer but

[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:25.400]
the problem is I can't get anybody over here to get involved enough. It's already almost the

[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.680]
first of May and we go like in July, what early August. And I don't know what they're

[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:33.080]
doing. I think they got with Zimmer. They all got their finger in the same place.

[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:37.440]
We'll get Chuck to move at the Pittsburgh. No, we're not moving it to anywhere, sir. We're

[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.740]
going to Chicago. All right. I mean, at least Chicago, you can have a good... How long

[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:45.640]
to go to Pittsburgh, whether without baseball for getting? Wait, the cops played Pittsburgh.

[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:51.240]
Forget it. No way, Jose. They play him well. We're going for the Houston series. Why not have

[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.680]
a chance to win at least one anyway? One out of many. One out of several. You're right.

[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:01.680]
Good luck to you, sir. See what I mean about those Pirates fans? Rub it in. Rub it in. I hope it

[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:08.280]
gets infection in there. We have two open lines and Broward 524WIODC Marvin Wanderer

[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.820]
in around the hallway. What's he doing here so early? Plan, Mr. Hot Shot, Mr. Big Shot out there

[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:22.260]
in a street corner with his yellow jumping and his hot pants. Slimeball. Miami. See what I mean?

[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.320]
Let me ask you a question. Do you have any idea what that is? No. Neither do I. Neither

[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.220]
does anybody else in the audience. That's the second time because I cut them off the first time on my

[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:47.460]
pull. Why waste the time? I mean, talk about having no life. Talk about a gigantic void in your life.

[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:52.760]
There's a classic example. We have an open line of days. I've been saying this all. I'm not going

[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.900]
to say it anymore. I can't do it. I mean, just pushin' and pushin' and pushin' and pushin'

[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:03.120]
and pushin' Monday. I'm staying home Mondays. Next Monday is my birthday. Let's just put another

[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.020]
big blank up there on the board like they have a Rick and Suds next Monday and Tuesday. I'm

[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:11.180]
celebrating somebody's birthday. Next Monday and Tuesday. I'm taking a few days off for it.

[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:17.940]
West Palm Beach. Check your list of serial numbers with these. See what I mean? Miami.

[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.980]
Neil. Yeah. This is Gary Jones. I'm calling for Miami. I just want to let you know, I went to

[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:31.120]
this watch shop over the weekend and I saw dances with Wolf. Yeah. That movie really sucked. I know.

[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.480]
It was really slow. So what difference did it make where you went to see it? Well,

[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:40.180]
unfortunately since I thank God I went to see that and I got to leave and go to another screen and

[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:45.000]
see another movie. Oh, now you're talking. I mean, Ken. Why would you go and see a stupid movie like

[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.420]
that? I don't know. I mean, I would listen to all the idiots go to the seminal bingo at least

[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:53.760]
you might make a few bucks. I'm telling you. Thank God I got to see a couple other movies out of

[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.940]
there for free because I was gonna waste the money. Good thinking. Hey, before I got just

[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:02.760]
went to call Paul Gerton and Major League douchebag. Okay, sir. Thank you. See you.

[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:09.200]
Best call of the day. 1254 at WIOD. One in Dade. One in Palm Beach. You know the numbers and

[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:13.340]
that's not going to be the answer at all that effort. We got an open line. I'm sick of it. 15 years plus.

[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:19.980]
15 years plus. And like I said, this station would never have an open line. Especially on the show,

[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:26.780]
if most of the people listen, we're in such a bunch of cowards. Slimey cowards. Boy,

[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:32.100]
just can't take a chance. So what if you are humiliated and debased and degraded in front of

[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:36.140]
thousands of people? That's what it makes it exciting. That's what it's all about.

[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.060]
And who knows? You might get lucky and actually be articulate and have something to say and have

[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:47.280]
a good call. It's unlikely, but you never know. Miami. Yeah, I got a good question for you.

[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:52.520]
Yes, sir. How do you compare Tim Abbott to Captain Hook? Okay, let's go to a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.740]
Hello. How you doing? Yes, sir. Don't lose faith in the Cubans, man. They haven't been playing that.

[01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:01.000]
They stay and get out of here. They're pathetic. They're playing the red red red red hot.

[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:06.020]
They're playing. Oh, come on. Why did they have the Cardinals? The crappy Cardinals can't even

[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:11.120]
hit the ball on the infield. They took two out of three in Chicago and two out of three up there.

[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.840]
It's their pathetic. Well, let's not be, let's not be a bunch of crybabies and start making excuses.

[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:21.780]
No, no, no, no. Let's just admit that we stink. That's all. We could go to Sunday when they play the

[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:26.100]
par. They had the game run by seven and they turn around and they're about Friday night.

[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:31.040]
They're way ahead of what a rehash. We blew the Dave Smith blue three games for us in four days.

[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:36.440]
Our club's stock. See, even Harry admits it. Have your mobile up there and don't lose faith in the

[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:41.720]
game. I'm not a front runner. Okay. We went last year and the time we went there, there were so

[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:45.540]
many games out there. We're already like almost mathematically and we don't go for that. We go to have

[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:49.300]
a good time. That's like the people up here in Palm Beach don't lose your faith in us either.

[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:54.060]
We'll see you later. Okay. Boy, you got a lot of different story on that one pal. You can't lose

[01:20:54.060 --> 01:21:00.040]
something you never had. 1256 at WIOD. I'm really disappointed that guy didn't get his request.

[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.000]
Okay. This little bits and pieces open line on the Palm Beach line. Tells bro beach.

[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:18.600]
Deal. Yeah. Throw that cart in the basket. The asshole cart throw it in the basket.

[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:26.160]
Yeah. That's killing your show. It's killing it. We're playing it three seconds at a time,

[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:33.720]
sir. I think we can handle that. That's even worse. No chance. Open line at Broward 524WIOD.

[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:37.660]
That's a guy from Magicality. The Ron St. John senior. You're not fooling us. You're just jealous.

[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:41.300]
You can't play it on the air. Right, Ron? Isn't that your problem? You're not fooling anybody, pal.

[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:50.180]
Go back to the press box at the J.R.S. Here's a lady in Miami. Hi, Neil. Hi. How are you? I'm okay.

[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:54.780]
I hear you don't get much women's calling. Well, we had a flurry of them for a while there.

[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:58.960]
When I cast them out, then all of a sudden we get a whole bunch and then they go back to a laundry or whatever they're doing.

[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:07.940]
We become intimidated by you. I don't know why. I have no idea because I treat the lady callers with velvet gloves.

[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:14.260]
Oh, well good. Because I have some news for you. You probably already know it. Because I missed the show this morning.

[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:23.420]
So don't yell at me if you already know. What is it? I'm on coppola. Dead. Oh, poor. You know. Yeah. So what about it?

[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:30.380]
Well, I know you like him. No, I don't like him at all. What do I like about Carmine Coppola? He wrote the music. I don't like him.

[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:34.960]
Oh, okay. I rephrase. The ever-to-be-the-everybody to his house for a cup of coffee. No way.

[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.560]
Only if he played music for you.

[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:46.240]
I like his music. I don't like his nepotism. I don't like his granddaughter's gigantic snows.

[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:52.060]
He's incredibly honest. He's dead. Yeah, well, it just made a little tiny blurb in the hell.

[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:56.160]
So I know you love the hell and don't miss anything in there. That's all.

[01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:03.960]
Okay. Wow. I always check the obituaries to see if any of my listeners are named, especially ones who are going to call that day.

[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:10.760]
No, because in this town it doesn't make any difference. They call anyway. That's true. Yeah.

[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:16.420]
Alive or dead? And by the way, I left the house as well.

[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:24.340]
You love dances with wolves? What'd you like about it? Kevin Cosmer. Oh God. Oh, please go get a lobotomy. Please.

[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:32.860]
Go to the optometrist. He is so boring. He is so bland. He's got a personality like skim milk terminal.

[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.120]
He's better than Johnny Depp.

[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:42.900]
I can handle a lot. Okay. That's the end of that call. That bitch ever calls this show again.

[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:47.720]
We have a deal with what you said. He's better than Johnny Depp.

[01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:59.420]
You need a gigantic chocolate cream whipped high colonic is what you need.

[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:02.140]
I want to make sure I got all the right ingredients in there.

[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:07.300]
Kevin Cosmer terminal. Oh, ring.

[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:12.980]
We have an open line of date and one at Palm Beach. You know the numbers? I will never give those

[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:17.440]
numbers again. At least not till after the news. Elaine Nettoor is standing by now with a nose for

[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:21.220]
the news. She is really, I'm telling you, it's just if you've gotten used to looking at her again now,

[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:23.620]
I never got used to looking at her before.

[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.520]
Anyway, she's got the news and then we'll come back for our big one to two hour. Buffalo Bob Smith

[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.820]
with Rick and Sons today. Perfect for Sons. Boy, he must be in his glory today because that's right

[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:40.120]
up his alley. He likes all those like silly people and probably have his little Clare Bell noise,

[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.960]
maker on there, making little sounds. In fact, I bet you at the end of the show when you go home,

[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.000]
there's going to be a whole like 400 packages from the Hop at Home channel because they're going to

[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.400]
think you're doing tooty every time they have another one. What the hell is tooty? Can somebody tell

[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:57.340]
me what that is? If you ever watched that, they say use tooty. What the hell is that?

[01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:01.740]
There was one guy for use to work on the production you're at. His finger over his nose every time

[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:05.760]
they said that. Anyway, a Joe with sports talk, Hank at 8-11 tonight.

[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:20.840]
