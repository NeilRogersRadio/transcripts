[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.560]
till donny osman this family came

[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.740]
well done about donny but you know a few years ago they passed a uh...

[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.400]
uh... and a cable decency law

[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.780]
they would have outlawed hbl

[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.960]
and uh... sure why not yeah and uh... the governor

[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.600]
vetoed it uh... good guy

[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.020]
and then uh... let's just pop in for a spot come on out there either

[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.320]
they don't like the thing or anywhere near the waste

[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.380]
well it's later over wrote the veto they took it all the way to the dam supreme

[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.060]
court spent about a million dollars of the taxpayers money for for a waste of

[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.440]
course

[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.980]
but it's interesting though with all the pseudo-piety that goes on and we're

[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.660]
talking about this couple weeks ago all the

[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.300]
almost all of the mass murderers seem to be like in uh... you taught and up in

[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.980]
my uh... but washington state and organ and

[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.400]
you know there's like a whole uh...

[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.820]
thing out there there's like a lane

[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.300]
yeah but he was out there for a while

[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.680]
when he started up their work this way down that's right

[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.780]
he was re-u-ta

[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.360]
he was the only place they actually convicted him for a while and it won't be

[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.480]
calirado uh...

[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.440]
uh... the trial is kind of walked out one day got tired of sitting around there

[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.220]
waiting walked out

[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.560]
the reason i called you was uh... i'd like to get some of this music that you're

[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.900]
playing and take it back to you down shock the hell of some of my friends

[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.620]
well probably in a cassette recorder be a good idea

[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.460]
we're gonna get it

[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.020]
get what

[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.560]
get this music that you're playing

[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.960]
get the music that i'm playing yeah you know like this uh...

[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.580]
one was that

[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.160]
what was the syphilis who and uh...

[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.320]
you know this kind of stuff

[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.460]
yeah we're gonna buy it

[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.920]
working you buy it

[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.520]
yeah don't you sell it

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.160]
well i don't want to get too personal

[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.180]
no no no the music the music

[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.160]
no we don't sell it now come November first will do our commissar's thing

[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.120]
again but that's a long way off we have a tape every year the best of tape

[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.160]
so this stuff that you're playing is not for sale i'm a story now of course not

[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.080]
you have to have to have your cassette recorder see if you were smart

[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.640]
and that's a big if because you've lived in some bizarre places but when you do

[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.420]
is you take the show every day and then

[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.440]
what is so funny about that

[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.940]
and have somebody

[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.800]
easy and by it but definitely now nothing's easy if it's easy it's no fun

[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.120]
well it's a deal it's uh... pleasure talking to you uh... harder it is the more fun

[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.480]
again

[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.940]
that's okay thanks yeah

[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.160]
well you don't want to listen to me you don't want this stuff is just want

[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.080]
somebody to hand it to him right on a platter you know

[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.360]
we have an open line and date seven five one nine four six three and one on the

[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.900]
starline

[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.960]
star i would be by the way skipper chuck is a good guy he really is the show last

[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.260]
night

[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.420]
that's another story

[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.160]
now the show is good up until he had that stiff on i'm so tired of the station

[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.560]
bringing all these old line farce

[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.460]
that want to talk about how great everything is and all we're doing just fine

[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.860]
and boy it's great having the sidewalks roll up at nine o'clock at night and

[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.860]
chasing all the living and breathing people are

[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.020]
i'll tell you one thing if we didn't have south beach

[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.960]
that's our only and you know maybe the grove if you're one of those people are

[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.540]
floats but

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.940]
seriously if we have south beach that would be it

[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.900]
we can just roll it up like sand augustine say okay used to be great here

[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.880]
and we can have like monuments on other used to be a lot of stuff going on

[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.760]

[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.680]
wet t-shirt contest

[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.640]
the button on the beach and for a lot of other turn that baby down and build

[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.880]

[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.280]

[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.940]
no i'm not going to say the same crap all over again it's every done it repetitive and the fact

[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:29.160]
that it's a bike or rip off in fact this guy i don't you got me started the guy that was on

[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.780]
with skipper upchuck last night i have i think he was a guy from woometko about a 400 year old guy

[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:39.680]
used to be there skipper chuck too but anyway this guy was going on and on about the well if they

[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.360]
want to gamble we got the cruise ships and they go out in the middle of the wall she and they go

[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.200]
around in the circle all they do is they're floating crap ships and people can gamble if that's

[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.580]
what they like it bap bap baan yada yada and how great it is all the people that come down here can

[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.540]
do that well yeah all the people come down here do that they get on a plane they come down to the

[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.760]
airport here they get in the cab they go over to the port they don't spend one dime in the stinking

[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.640]
town they get on the cruise ship they give these ripoff artists all their money well that's great

[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.540]
that's wonderful yeah they don't leave a dime here they don't create one job in this area they don't

[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.040]
leave one penny for us that's a biggest pile of crap and the only reason the Bahamas even exist

[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.260]
is because the mobsters have kept gambling out of our god for sakin town and the people over there

[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.420]
he had gambling here at landic city would fold up like a prune and the Bahamas would fade off into

[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.020]
the bermuda triangle never to be seen again keep going keep going have a nice day okay

[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.660]
119 at ww idea toadia wasn't going to get worked up about it

[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.840]
i think there ought to be an investigation as to who the powers are that continue to prevent this

[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:44.460]

[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:08.200]
crap anyway uh i'm a blumber service plumber have been for some time and i heard the word crap here

[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:14.480]
quite some time ago yeah from Jonathan crapper uh he designed the first toilet in England about

[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:20.480]
turning the century right you also invented crapless crap yeah right well what happened uh

[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.720]
would they have decided 20 years later that's big an allendale by the way crapless crap yeah south

[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:33.320]
beach a little bit little bit but uh they decided that was a worse mistake society ever made but they

[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.520]
had to make the best of it well we don't know what's gonna happen but an interesting point

[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.140]
to the can i ask you a question you may what the hell are you talking about but what am i talking

[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.940]
about yeah well the worst thing that we've gotten probably the best thing that we could have the

[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.960]
plumbing system in the united states there you go now we're talking about something i will say

[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.980]
that boy the plumbing down here is the best except of course in my backyard where i have that swamp

[00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:01.400]
next to the city of plantation oh god so you want to get me started on plumbing okay i've got a

[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:08.280]
i've got a some plumber i've got like a it's like swill it's horrendous oh god so many places are

[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.580]
just no previously god just standing water i know when i was in service plumbing i

[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.560]
ground is saturated now because they dug this big canyon back there and they can't figure out why

[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.860]
the water don't soak into it anymore oh god for the ground either but san francisco's got the worst

[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:31.200]
plumbing in the world oh i'm not touching that line sir you're not touching that one now anyway

[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:38.620]
i the plunger i see plumbing becoming something in the future there's gonna be very creative yeah i

[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.960]
would say that households will be self-sufficient there will be a grid beneath the house this is my

[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.860]
opinion okay but i there'll be a lot of grit beneath the house if we can think about it i think

[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.660]
it can be i think you i think you may rhyme with that but i don't think it's grit well listen it's

[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.000]
been a real educational but we got to move along here all right have a great day take care don't

[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:32.760]
fire as you see that's just a little gas up there on a causeway and when a bridge is like up in a

[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.500]
year after you get through the railroad tracks it's like it's like an obstacle course it's like

[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:42.260]
davi road in davi with the railroad tracks and if you don't make the railroad tracks you get the bridge

[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.480]
well it's the same way here on 79th street as you're coming across uh miscane you know first you get

[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.600]
the railroad tracks then of course that's after you get around the 75 big gold uh whatever those

up out of dumpsters all over the highway and you evade that part of the obstacle course you get

[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.860]
around the attracts and then you finally you think oh here it looks like clear sailing you get past

[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.140]
