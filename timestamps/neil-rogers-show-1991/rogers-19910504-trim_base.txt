[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220]
Yes, sir. Yeah, I just wanted to congratulate you. I was glad to see you're finally understanding the market here

[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.700]
And you're not acting quite so much like through mentor

[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.520]
What the hell are you talking about what your ratings were up, right?

[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.000]
My ratings my ratings are almost always great sir

[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.940]
What are you trying to talk about my mentor? Who's my mentor?

[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.820]
Alan Burke oh my mentor. Yeah, yeah, right. What the hell are you talking about? Do you have any idea with this phony voice?

[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.200]
What are you talking about? I'm just talking about that

[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.680]
You got like marbles chitlins in your mouth or what? No, no, I'm not the most nice. Uh-huh

[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.840]
Okay, okay, what the hell is he talking about 1053 at W.I.O.D. my mentor?

[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.400]
We have an overlighted pond beat 655 W.I.O.D

[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.520]
Here's a pig report that I'm sure can't be there anymore

[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.540]
Yeah, the feeding friends young I say when you fire it might be going drive

[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.440]

[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.580]
Don't answer the question. Hey, yeah about them cups, buddy. Yeah, how about them?

[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.180]
Hey today is this is D day this weekend sir. It's the turning point

[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.020]
Over 500 or under and down the yonder the hill we go

[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.520]
I'm pretty slacked up for today about what?

[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.380]
We had a bunch of boys going down to the keys about two o'clock for the whole weekend. Great. We rented a room

[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.260]
One bed we got about 13 guys. Yeah, well, you ought to have a good time. Yeah, we should. What do you like to you like pivot man?

[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.080]
No, I bring up the rear okay good. Well, I hope you have a big weekend

[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.560]
1054 at W.I.O.D. We have an open line in date 7519463. Hope you don't have any Cuban girlfriend 655946

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.520]
I think that's a terrible thing you said George. That's it. What I want to talk about an ethnic slur

[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.700]
Cuban women all have big butts. What a what a grotesque host most Cuban women. Yeah, right. How about Cuban guys?

[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.860]
I don't think so

[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.240]
Uh, we'll talk about that next hour anyway. We I started to say we had an opening and dating one in Palm Beach

[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.420]
I think I already said that let's take a call from beautiful coconut creek

[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.400]
Okay, he's on all the lines now curl springs. Hello. No, Neil good morning, sir

[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:16.020]
Listen, no plays Friday. No smooth and no sucking up. I'd like to hear the dirty hairy carry tape

[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.580]
Okay, well, we'll give you a direct answer no chance

[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.580]
Two open lines inbroward 524 W.I.O.D. Let's take a mobile in

[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.500]
Halendale

[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.040]
Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. Thank God that there's only one more week of the not-slanding lady

[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.320]
What's your problem with the not-slanding lady, sir?

[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.700]
But at least you do have the balls to call us and tell it on the air

[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.080]
I will give you that credit so far. I mean, I think more your listeners would rather hear Gilbert and he's terminal

[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.760]
No, sir

[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.400]
If you want to take a poll on that, it's not even close most of our people would rather be dead than hear Gilbert again

[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.820]
Some of them already got a beat to the punch

[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.460]
The not-slanding lady all of sudden is a cubs fan now

[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.660]
What so what are you trying to say she can handle it? She's big enough to handle it believe me. What do you want to say?

[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.600]
I just want to say that I'll be very happy when she's off next week

[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.020]
But tell us why don't just say that what is your problem with her because most of your listeners

[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.880]
I think don't watch the show and don't follow it. Well, that's their problem. I don't give it to them

[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.400]
Most of my listeners aren't cubs fans either. Does that mean I'm going to not talk about it now

[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.880]
But most of your listeners know what they're talking about when it comes to baseball

[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.240]
That's what you think

[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.760]
Go filly's mishloins is number one. Okay. See that proves it

[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.860]
Good luck to you sir. Now. I know where you're coming from thank you sour grapes

[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.120]
1056 at W.I.O.D. John Cruck is God boy. What a big fat slob he is but always kills the cubs just kills us

[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.280]
Chris everybody kills us

[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.820]
Guys, it hit like 100 against the league hit 700 against the cubs

[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.900]
Darren Dalton who can't get arrested killed the cubs. Here's a mobile in Miami

[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.420]
Come on come on turn that radio down. Let's get with it. Let's go

[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.020]
Let's get one of the stick

[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.720]
Are you going to speak to us or not? No, they're not going to speak. We're just playing with their knob

[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.180]
Open line and date 751 W.I.O.D. Here's the lady in Miami

[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.640]
I have to tell you I love guiding light. I've watched it. I don't want to thank God for this call

[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.800]
Now let's really get that last guy upset because I'm sure he don't watch that either

[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.820]
Okay, but listen what are you calling Mindy the town slide for? Oh, she's a spoiled rich girl. Not not the town slide

[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.120]
She's a sleaze bag

[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.160]
She's like no, she's not she's she was a couple of years ago now. She's all burnt out looking

[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.360]
She looks worn out. Well, she's like a shop worn slud

[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.880]
Well, I think she's cute. I think it's a great story. Well, I'm not saying she's not cute relative

[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.020]
I mean she's cuter than Alex. There's no question about that even cuter than Alex bedded

[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.700]
But no, it's getting good now the thing with the earring under the bed. Oh excellent

[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.980]
The best the best and this kid a heart talk about a temper. Yeah

[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.280]
Boy, he's just ready to go off the deep end any second fact

[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.620]
He filled his depends three times yesterday when he heard that the farm wasn't is anymore

[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.300]
Somebody bought the farm

[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.300]
That's gonna be a good one. Yeah, this whole thing with Samantha though is stupid. I hate her

[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.840]
I she makes oh she is so

[00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.720]
Mousy and weasley just oh, I mean so now she had the operation. She got her legs back walking and she still walks around like oh

[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.840]
Everybody should feel sorry for me. I got news for if Dylan would even look at her

[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.240]
She ought to get on the ground and gravel and kiss his toes. Am I right? That's true. You bet

[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.820]
But how about Blake? Which is he's also a wimp though, too, you know

[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.000]
Hey, no pop up legs though. Oh, I hate her

[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.220]
Oh, isn't she great to hate yeah, she you can tell she's Roger's daughter

[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.660]
Oh, absolutely. What the hell happened to what's your name all of a sudden is also become kind of a carousel

[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.660]
What's your name? What's her name? Roger's ex-wife

[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.080]
Oh, my mom's Holly. Holly what's with her all of a sudden? Oh, I think it's great. That's good. She needs that

[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.920]
I put you up her image a little bit

[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.580]
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, she and Ross were kind of a boring pair. She's good with this a wimpie doctor. She got

[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.620]
Yeah, I didn't think he had it in him, you know, I didn't think so either. Well, I guess he did

[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.720]
But they killed off or they rode out my favorite character Josh no India

[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.640]
But India from here they killed her off. Well, they got rid of her

[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.640]
She came into town cause and trouble and then breathe that she was kind of she'll be back

[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.320]
I hope that she's the best

[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.820]
She was back maybe she can come back and be Roger Thorpen her next life

[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.940]
Well, she was a good match for Roger. Yeah good pair

[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.880]
Well, listen today is going to be the episode of your lifetime trust me. Yeah, no one waiting for it

Okay, cuz we like guiding light and knots landing

[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.600]
And by the way, I cut about like three minutes of Bart Simpson Thursday night again. That is the most pathetic

[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.760]
Stupid show. It's okay for like four-year-old kids

[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.360]
And I noticed nobody else is talking about it. You notice how the bloom is off the

[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.660]
Pansy now on that thing what a piece of crap. That's just still

[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.620]
Fun for the feeble mind. Anyway, speaking of feeble mind and Henry Barrow has the 11 o'clock news

[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.300]

Barbara Bush she and her potlier tracking down the world's biggest bad guy

First I figure out teach that main jevamen to read and then I'll spring him off

[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:34.220]
She's judge and juric in her own kangaroo court. It's hangham hun starring Barbara Bush and Clint Eastwood

[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.140]

[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.700]

Hang on the high high-hole

[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:07.780]
Okay, it's 11 o' 7 at w. I. O. D our number two. It's a tremendous Friday. We got to Derby tomorrow

[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.520]
We got Dave Johnson any minute any second sometime hopefully

[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.820]
Probably shine by the way. I have speaking of things that nobody cares about that turns off the audience

[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:25.780]
I have went through great effort to take to put on card a couple of the great races both from 78 of course the 78 Derby

[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:33.180]
And the 78 Belmont which you get the Derby of course with Dave Johnson and the Belmont which the late chick Anderson

[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:40.820]
The 78 Belmont was the greatest race in the history of any kind of racing and if anybody disagrees you're full of crap how's that

[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.280]
For laying it right on the line with the firm then aledar. Oh man that last

[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.120]
mile

[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.040]
Where they just raced

[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.780]
Head and head nose to nose in that long stretch run at Belmont

[00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:01.840]
Where aledar stuck a nose in the front was the first time he had passed him and I don't know how long in any race just a nose

[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.360]
And volasquez inched over and cut off the room for steamy caught on the whip right hand

[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.640]
And caught and went to the left hand and they came neck and neck nose to nose right down to the wire

[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.220]
And a firm came back on the inside and won it

[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.060]
God

[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.940]
Anybody who even thinks they like horse racing has to give goose bumps

[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.420]
I'm there off. Yeah, well, we'll get to it later

[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.920]

Hello Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. What's up? What can we do for you sir?

[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.420]
Pardon me? I say you're off that speaker phone now or whatever you were on. Yeah, I was working good

[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.980]
So how you doing? I'm doing okay. How you doing? All right. Just enjoying the show. Uh-huh. I'm calling well

[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.440]
That's pretty exciting. Yeah, who's gonna win a race tomorrow? Don't you care? I don't care

[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.380]
Well, that's good good. I like that. No beating around the bush

[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.640]
No pretending to be an expert when you know nothing about it right like me. I know nothing

[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.180]
Yep, well just let you know we're really enjoying the show. Thank you sir. Have a great life

[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.180]
You too. Take care. Okay. That was good. It's the first time caller

[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.980]
He didn't pretend he had something to talk about didn't try to be a smart ass. That was good. Don't do it again though

[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.060]
We have an open line at Broward five two four W.I.O.D. and Palm Beach where they're all busy

[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:17.900]
Handicrapping or at least part of that six five five nine four six three six five five we don't care who wins. Here's a pig report

[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.380]
He said

[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.600]
Are they gone on a mobile?

[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.720]
Father's a little pig for you anyway just because they're gone star lines open star i.o.D

[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.860]
Pembroke pines

[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:32.420]
Deal. Yes, sir. Did Chuck say that guy could have quit it huh? No, Chuck didn't say anything was probably old Henry Barrow said

[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.140]
I don't know like well. I'm glad to see that at least

[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.420]
That's what I called about. Let me let me ask you a question

[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.800]
If they started televising executions when you watch it

[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.660]
And would you videotape it for like replaying it parties later on?

[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:52.200]
I think I would yeah, yeah, I don't know. I think you get a 96 here. I think there's no question about it

[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.600]
I think you would show a little more

[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.160]
But anyway

[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.240]
Yeah, outcome. There's no national league games last night. That was so weird very unusual very bizarre

[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.220]
But we sure needed the night off now that we only got like two pictures left. We need every day off we can get that was weird

[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.300]
And where's the all-star game at this year? I don't have any idea

[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.200]
We had a last year. I don't know who gets lucky this year. I don't know. All right, and in this

[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.680]
You know, everybody has his

[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.340]
His doors oh and don't care anymore

[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:24.440]
There's a big rally going on for a parade or something happened May 18th. Welcome back. Pray to something

[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.700]
Yeah, my company's gonna be a major sponsor. I won't say the name. Yeah, so they announced at the meeting today

[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.880]
You know, it'll not like well show your support and all this stuff

[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.000]
They turn to this big sales mean it will get there to be a lot of veterans you can sell this to oh, man

[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.160]
Just total what a smarmy but your crap

[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.840]
I'm sitting there. I'm ready to jump up and say something like, you know

[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.280]
Why are you turning this to you know unbelievable? That is one of the most disgusting things

[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.320]
I would have stood up right in the middle of meeting and shouted at the top of my lungs

[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.200]
Yeah, and it did the same thing. I mean when the doors started down after I didn't work

[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:05.180]
I mean, I don't sell but I don't have to I mean I took off the whole day's glued to TV. I get this call, you know

[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.760]
Why aren't you at work? Why aren't you doing this? What does the work going on? I mean

[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.920]
They can wait another day to be sold

[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.140]
It's just unbelievable how well

[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:19.340]
I hate to say this and there are people be upset by my saying it and I know they did have 300,000 people for the shorts

[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:24.080]
Caught parade in Louisville. They're there but at this time of the year you can have 300,000 for a cockroach parade in Louisville

[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.460]
I mean there's 80 billion people up there

[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.260]
But all of that

[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:35.980]
And you know, I know there are a lot of people who legitimately felt that way and are very appreciative of all the troops and are glad that most of them are coming home safe and sound all that but

[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:45.020]
I think that a big percentage of that was just another ego trip and the Americans beating themselves on the chest and saying we won and were great just now that it's over just

[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.960]
You know back to the usual pathetic little lives. That wasn't a big flagraver when it started

[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.360]
I mean, I was kind of in a moment world here. I didn't know yellow ribbons everywhere go crazy

[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.840]
But I think I was probably more supportive my own way than

[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.940]
So-called flagraver

[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.820]
Anyway, that also's over

[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.320]

Uh, what do you have against her? What would you like to have against her?

[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.560]
Hmm, well, we'll talk about that later. Yeah, I bet you would

[00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:00.900]
So what's that story about the Cuban women with big butters? Are there any truth? Well, yeah, I'm not Cuban. I'm Nicarawan

[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:42.880]
Hello, hello, yes, sir. Oh, hi. How you doing? Okay. Um, I know you're not particularly a med fan

But I want to find out if there's any truth to the route trade rumor last night

[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.500]
I heard some more on it. I think it was on the

[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.140]
Channel four news. He said something about Jeffries and uh and

[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.220]
Magnen

[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.040]

[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.020]
No, they traded they traded Jeffries and Dwight good into the cubs for Jerry Varsho

[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.260]
Yeah, you're wet

[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.120]
What it is true? Oh

[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.560]
What are you doing Andy? Andy is in here. He's in the twilight of a mediocre season

[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:25.300]
He knows you guys are fundamentally unsound and other than a couple of good pictures. You're a crap team. I feel for you

[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:31.060]
No, but seriously is it true? Is it no? It's not true? Andy said no, and he's the number one med fan in the USA

[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:37.780]
That guy that newscaster the sportscaster is a real penhead. I can't believe he said that. Who wasn't sigreto

[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.620]
I don't know. I told you he's always just laughing and joking

[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.740]
The black news black the black whole lot of people to be honest with the newscaster on

[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:51.680]
In fact, Andy said he lives and dies with the meds. That's why I'm dying over here. He's been saying it a lot lately

[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:52.620]

I was sandy for that's the greatest race in the history of mankind

[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:50.760]
It might be and just because the the the series was built on a rivalry of affirmed in Ali dar and who knows we could have another

[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.440]
Terrific rivalry this year. There are some good horses in this uh Kentucky Derby

[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.380]

[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:30.640]
No, I'm sorry. We cannot give that to you. It must be in the form of a question. What is bark sparky? You still have control of the board

[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.980]
Taboo's for 600 and the answer is the new sofa and the poodle next door

[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.300]
All right, correct. What are two things you're not allowed on

[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.500]
personal hygiene for 200 the answer is because they can

[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.480]
Scruffy no bond bond

[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.520]
Correct the answer is because they can the question why do dogs lick their

[00:18:53.160 --> 00:19:00.940]
Oh, and that means we're out of time we'll return with final dog jeopardy where a category will be scratch and sniff right after this

We see him in the sack with not page Linda

[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.300]
Who's doing it with everybody interesting and

[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:31.580]
Gary is trying to make up to what's her name with the broken arm and getting her a horse and all this other stuff and

[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:36.440]
Claudia says that they're horse and around because she wants her back working for the senator with all the money

[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.820]
And Anne is trying to a swindle the black male gets the money and finally Claudia brings the senator and

[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.000]
Stephen in and tells them both that she's really stevens mother and who was the father and

[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:57.040]
Anne is out so well again. I guess it's gonna hit the man. And then Anne's old Anne's boyfriend steals this goes through this elaborate scheme to steal this expensive cross from this

[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.820]
collection that Sumner's got and then she wakes up in the morning with a note and a rose and he's gone across

[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:07.740]
Wasn't worth enough and he's got to pay off his debts and he's left. She's left there without a cheeseburger. She got nothing

In War Roy's all over in this race the Derby yeah strike the gold. He was just flat-outs

[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.680]
Flat-out knocked off his feet and the preview stakes which KO road couldn't win

[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.780]
Yeah, he was a struggling third trying to get through traffic in the Wood Memorial

[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.280]
Lost Mountain

[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:41.100]
No, they even second he should be the most like lost mountain was the reason why he didn't you should have won the whole race

[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.780]
No, Wood Memorial lost mountain just bounced right off the front right off and then shoved him into the rail in the

[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.020]

Ever-popular and I've been in France for years cash asmusin and knocked them dead several years ago up in New York

[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.080]
He was kind of like the second coming of Stevie Caughton

[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:43.360]
And the Stevie went off to England and the cash you went off to France and that's basically it once in a while

But I heard my answer. Well, I answer anything just to get that guy upset that that slime ball that called a couple of calls ago

[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.960]
There was attacking our lovely friend and not landing

[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.720]
That's right

[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.200]
I watched the whole thing until the last 10 minutes

[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.580]
I had to walk my friend home in the dark. Well, did you see the part about how in finally went in to say I want the money now

[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:21.900]
You saw that yep, and she spilled the beans and then that was it and then I walked out the door look out

[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.460]
Cheryl Mike is coming up to that end of the building look out. I think he's desperate

[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:32.640]
Also, how about these horny guys in the office, huh? I have no these ward ops man. I'm telling you

[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.960]

[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.320]
Yeah, Alex is put around a hole

[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.500]
Yeah, she says hold this okay, and he said okay

[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.340]

[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.080]
Boy, why don't you go like over to the zoo when animals do that like he's grabbing his crotch

[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.780]
It's like Roseanne bar and heat in there. What a maniac. We need more guys like him in here

[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.260]
Now what is it?

[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.240]
Well, that was it. I just wanted to call and ask you what happened last 10 minutes not well

[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.940]
Um, you know you answered it all along. I told you Linda was in the sack at the end

[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.480]
Everybody expected it to be paid because this guy was like really just

[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:26.460]
I heard you say it was Linda when she came in she recognized him because they were old uh fall on top of each other

[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.620]
From years ago from five years ago

[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:34.460]
Okay, so Linda's just I mean she's just on top of every fact. Let's get Linda fairgate in here

[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.180]
That'll keep my calm for a couple of minutes. She's ready for anything

[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.660]
Yep, she sure is if it's breathing or even just barely breathing like the senator. She's ready

[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.340]
Just like me or of course she does like it to have a little money. She likes that too

[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:52.920]
So I guess that leaves all our guys. Well listen have a great weekend and don't forget big finale next week big episode

With Warren Beatty branded to will the Angela landsbury Carl Maldon and even Marie saint

[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:33.960]
Who is also in on the waterfront with Marlon Brando one of the great movies of our time the guy in his film guy gives it one

[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.700]
Stink and Lausy star is probably right about that

[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:42.420]
Look at the Broward lines. They all just opened up. Okay. Look at that. That is pathetic. We don't care

[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:50.900]

[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:59.900]
Another gallery of middle American failure is competently portrayed by a writer and actors very practiced at this sort of thing whatever that means

[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.780]
Hmm director John frankenheimer

[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:14.120]
The strange era of nostalgic Americana where the familiar is the Freudian grotesque says the New Yorker 1982

[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.140]
That was okay. No reason I liked it's cuz Brandon de Willow was in it

We got like two four five calls and 32 minutes to go that'll never fly

[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.200]
So why don't we just play the cards again that we have played it like so much

Or did I put away that bill and Ted's excellent. We got to put that once more. Don't we?

[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.740]
Huh? Oh, yeah, that'll kill a minute and it'll kill a couple of minutes for me to find it. Oh

[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.240]

[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.340]
Why don't you get a car in your phone or phone in your car

[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.300]
Well, we just got it we just went through the whole thing and a book it only got one lousy. Did you see it?

[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.600]
You never saw it was it was a it was bizarre

[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.900]
But it was interesting and the car baldens always great you kind of get fixated on the nose

[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.820]
But after you used to that uh, he was very good and Warren Betty was see

[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.440]
I don't even like Warren Betty, but in that movie he was good because he was not the uh

[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.500]
Plastic kind of Warren Betty that we you know is always doing his hair and stuff

[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.560]
Like in shampoo and branded the willed of course speaks for himself

[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:53.640]
But he's not feeling too well today 130 at w.w.w.wd. Here's a mobile implantation

[00:30:53.640 --> 00:31:00.000]
Neil yes, sir. You showed today is great uh chick Anderson was a good friend of mine and listening to some of those taste

[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.520]
Springs back a lot of men. Can I tell you a very amazing thing? We're down. It's amazing to me

[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:10.280]
Chick-at you know how we talked to Dave Johnson today. Yeah. Well, I was on w.w.w. west back in 1978

[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.940]
was my first year there in this spring of 78 and just before that particular

[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.040]
Belmont I talked with chick Anderson on the ear on the phone

[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.080]
And you know we talked about the race coming up and we thought we're gonna win and then when did he die?

[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.060]
What year was it? Oh, it's been 10 years again. Yeah, so just like a year or two later he dies

[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:36.600]
But he was excellent. He was very good. He had just gotten that contract to do all in New York

[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.840]
Right, which was a you know the highlight of his career was right then he really really wanted and he he had a

[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:47.200]
He was shaving and had a heart attack or something wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah, just like bingo how old was he?

[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.760]
45 oh man incredible

[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.400]
Nightest guy in the world very good

[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.860]
And then of course we went through this long dry spell

[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:58.580]
We had to put up with martialcans in New York for years after Dave Johnson was making too much money

[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.480]
We had to put up with martialcansity and he got that job because he was like a little nepotism there

[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.480]
I guess and he was probably the worst in history next to Ross Morton and now thank goodness

[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.020]
We got Durkin up there doing a tremendous job. Yeah, he's good excellent

[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:17.620]
That movie that's on tonight the red dragon. Yeah, not near as good as violence at the lamp

[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:22.600]
The book was as good. Yeah, but the movie isn't close. Well the movie is kind it's really

[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.900]
Very bizarre. I don't know how they're gonna put that on without really chopping it up

[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.500]
It's gonna be interesting to see how they do that. Yeah, well, you know, they ruin movies anyway

[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.820]
Yes, sir. They should stop this stuff

[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:37.880]
There's not gonna be much left because there wasn't much there to begin with. Yeah, well they figure he's in there chopping everybody up

[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.120]
They might as well chop a little too. Okay. Thanks a lot. I see you

[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:46.480]
132 at WIOD at open line on a big famous star line if you have bell-soft mobility star

[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.840]
I would be I think we ought to play white white one baby one more time too, don't you?

[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.580]
Well, God at 62 seconds long what a perfect way to kill a minute. Don't you like that?

[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.020]
I thought it was great

[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.720]
I thought it's the best thing I heard Ray Charles doing a long time

[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.380]
Miami, Neil. Yes, sir. How's it going guys? Okay, sir? Listen

[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]
I just want to clear up something

[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:17.180]
Cuban women do have big butts. Yeah, especially you know, we have something complement that yeah big big ego

[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:24.560]
That's about it. You're talking to a guy who knows believe me. Oh really? Yeah, I've been around anyway

[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.680]
So I'm just trying to say I have a little controversy here my wife is gonna see that way

[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:36.040]
If you ever met that famous Cuban Jewish Cuban movie star. Oh mama-la Schwartz

[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.420]
I have a little controversy about to speak

[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.840]
My wife is gonna go see the chipmint else tonight. Yeah, and she won your wife must be desperate

[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:52.180]
You must not have all what you're telling us sir. There must be something missing in that relationship

[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:57.660]
We got to ask her we got to ask her. Yeah, she wants to leave me alone with a baby and I don't think that's fair

[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:02.800]
What do you want? She's going to see the chipmint else and leave you with a baby. Yeah

[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.360]
Yeah, I think that answer

[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.700]
I have a feeling yeah

[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.660]
I think you're gonna have a feeling too if uh

[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.140]
She's the word Jackson hospital listening right now, so I'd like to call her a big douchebag

[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.320]
And I'm not staying home darling

[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:25.800]
Okay, go on find some a big-butt Cuban woman out there. Okay, bye have a good time

[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:32.360]
133 here on the big-butt radio we have an open line on the center square five two four W.I.O.D. and Broward

[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.460]
I think that's a disgusting grotesque

[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.520]
awful thing to make those terrible generalizations that Cuban women all have gigantic rears

[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.620]
I think that is one of the most vulgar probably true though

[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.940]
Miami Beach

[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.260]
Neil yes, sir

[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:53.020]
Did you not have Charles the can't the honest well last year derby day correct?

[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:57.660]
You did yeah, I think the last couple of years so Charles he's been there with Dave, but

[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.220]
I guess that orange here that Dave is developing kind of turns around

[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:06.580]
Dave Johnson is excellent. He is sensational dork and I think now is at the top of his game

[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.280]
He's number one Dave is right there number two, but Dave doesn't need to see the thing about Dave

[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.680]
You can see anything because I always kid him about it, but he's made so much money that it's just a tremendous

[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:21.060]
No, he's excellent, but an earlier caller alluded to racing cliche by an outer. Yes, sir

[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.360]
And I would rather listen to and down the stretch they come

[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:32.200]
24 hours a day as opposed to this one can I do it for you you ate it too the one that I like best here

[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.700]

[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:53.120]
The closing day and he is at the peak of his game. I hope he's feeling as good as he sounds. He's doing a great job

[00:35:53.120 --> 00:36:00.520]
The great guy. Yeah, he's really he's improved like 10,000 percent since he started he calls races intelligibly Ross Morton cannot

[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.460]
Can't understand a word. He's got like mushroom as well

[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:07.660]
The thing with Ross Morton if he makes a mistake nobody ever knows because you can't understand what he's saying

[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.380]
He's absolutely terrible man hunter was a very

[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:17.260]
He's moved. He's a ball. Yeah, very depressing and very dank the FBI. Yeah dark dank and depressing

[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:22.780]
Yeah, so everybody at 2 and n it'll make him forget about the depression we're talking about NBC

[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:30.860]
My favorite line was Bob Savage circling the field on the rail. That was always one of my favorite lines

[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.160]

Appreciate it. Okay. Killin cad's excellent venture. Who did that?

[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:47.880]
Who did what that ACN? No, that's a rock comedy network that I stole from Rick and suds and I'm proud of it

[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:54.580]
Because like I said Rick Riley plays those things one or two times then he throws the then he loses it in the middle of the car

[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.360]
Rack here with all that other crap they threw in here. You never hear it again

It'll be great

[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:56.220]
See, I like somebody like that who promises and delivers how many times as somebody said

[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.820]
I'm going to give it to you and then you find out they don't

[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:04.080]
We can all relate to that right you're going to get it and you don't get it

[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.700]

Misery name glades. Okay. Well, just don't mention that one because we're having a good day so far. No

Kid that was uh, you know, okay

[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:37.480]
but

[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:43.000]
Uh, it's bringing back so many memories my grandma and grandfather was right across the church of down

[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.420]
And I mean I can see the people from their front porch

[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:47.320]
and

[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.920]
Just an incredible show. It's just flooding back

[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.280]
flooding back. I've been flooding back. Maybe some depends might help

[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.160]
and uh, it's

[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.660]
Even tying into other things I'm gonna say and uh

A hell of a picture. How about my for leaky? He could be them. Well your

[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:21.360]

Whatever 143 at W.I.O.D

[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.880]
I don't know what he's talking about. We have an open line indeed

[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:35.840]
751

[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.980]
W.I.O.D. Let's go to Lantana if we must

[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:46.300]
Yes, we must good afternoon Neil. Yes, sir. It made the goods news viewers. That's right

[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.300]
This call has one of those Spanish women near the end the big but

[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:56.800]
um, I don't like I'm not gonna say that about rearing a big family because that was a terrible line. Okay. I don't like not

[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.720]
landing and I don't like guiding light. Yeah, I'm not a horse racing right, but you're still out there, sir

[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.600]
But here it comes that's right and here's where that's that an anatomical part. Here's that big but yeah

[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:11.380]
That's right. I think listening to you all talk about it has added a little bit of interest to my day

[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.760]
And I hope it's broad enough. You're horizons. That's so to speak so to speak

[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.400]
And I just wanted to let you have that

[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:22.420]
parting shot. Well, that's great. You're a great American sir and obviously have no life. That's right. Thank you

[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.120]

[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:30.700]
144 at W.I.O.D. We got the Derby tomorrow. We got baseball cbs kind at 125 tomorrow. I didn't say it was planned

[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.340]
That would be nice if we knew but I guess I'm getting a little picky now, huh?

[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:39.100]
CBS baseball. I don't think most people care which network it's coming from they like to know who's playing

[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.920]
We got Meg green tomorrow morning. We got Dave Graveline if you get up early tomorrow

[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.700]
We're apologizing for that already

[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:51.300]
Weekend magazine used to be one hell of a show with Chuck Meyer. Hope you feel bad about it in the newsroom Chuck

[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.660]
People are killing themselves jumping off tops of tall buildings

[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.820]
People are resorting to incredible tactics now Saturday mornings

[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:06.480]
That's what they're doing because mr. Graveline's all right. Good voice. No talent

[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.380]
No sense of humor and we got the u.m. baseball tonight

[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:15.220]
And tomorrow night because it's a big three game series hurricanes and fs u

[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:21.000]
We got mr. Canceli de Forth for the tree Sunday morning who I'm sure will analyze the Derby

[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.140]
It with his great expertise, which he knows nothing

[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.680]
And Yankee baseball Sunday night so we got like his usual a whole bunch of sports and crap

[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.080]
for Lauderdale

[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.220]
Dale yes, sir

[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:34.460]
You're about to see you. Yeah, I can tell bad radio

[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.980]
Listen not all Latin women have big butts. Yeah

[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:45.120]
And but it really doesn't matter as long as the tight elastic pants are on and the nails are done in the hair's nice

[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:51.940]
I mean seriously nails have to be maroon I think you know these women they take their carry more about their hair and their nails

[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.780]
Than everything else. I mean, you know don't hit the treadmill whatever you do exactly

[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.580]
They'd spend more time prepping their breasts than their hair. They'd be a lot better shape

[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:05.040]
Seriously, I mean we're in the same shape. Yeah, but anyway

[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.540]
Tom jickey you started to say well

[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.600]
Yeah, you know that one tape you have now nothing make one

[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.360]
But the one about sales people are

[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:15.320]
Uranus yeah

[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.400]
Do one with

[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:24.160]
Uncle Uncle Tom something like that on I think he is I think he is an uncle time to be honest with him

[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.960]
I think he's playing little games with his column now to try to be cute

[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.120]
And I think that's a disservice to the public and uh, you know

[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.200]
Yeah, let me say this to you the people who care about the ratings on his station

[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.240]
Making difference because they get him because we give him out on the year and we give mac you really and honestly

[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:44.720]
But as far as the readers of a newspaper it was worse than a joke. It was in a scratch

[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:51.600]
I mean, we're looking at the market style 14 and a half it is plunging sir. Can you believe that plunging taking a dive neckline

[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:59.460]
Yes, sir, but the you know, he's so off base. I mean, I don't care about boxing, but the fight recently with George

[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.380]
With four men in that he go that he called it but the night before it says

[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.940]
Are you can watch the laugh for a fight turn out to be one of the better fights?

[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.200]
You know there could be you know and the guys that joke

[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.160]
But I think one that like that was that uh, newspaper critics are apples. That would be a good one

[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.640]
That would be an excellent one. We'll do it on Monday one more thing to ask and you shall receive

[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:24.920]
I want two more little things two more little things markets down 15 now. Oh, it's dropping man

[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:31.940]
Who one big grab it before hits the floor all right? Who does the book is wrong? What is it the book of song? Who who does that one?

[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.040]
That's a brick and puds. I don't know is that what you're called

[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.260]
That thing is great. I mean, I don't want you to play it. I know you want to put it in it

[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.180]
I don't see I don't play their songs. Okay, I might

[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:47.720]
Like butt load or something that can drop in or some of the a rock comedy that they're never gonna play again

[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.000]
I'll ask them. I'll ask those guys. I didn't know ever. What does it call?

[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.040]
The yet the focus song or whatever it's like the tamarack on something like that

[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.940]
He would bothers me about Rick Riley if you're gonna have stuff that's stillable at least

[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:06.680]
You know like he's got F and R and O and and then you know you can't find anything to steal it

[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:12.240]
Well, it is and his own mind he has a good stuff. Here's Coral Springs. Hey, is that close enough?

[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:18.480]
Now the focus song it says we don't know the song it is, but I just you can't find it over here

[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:19.040]
Those guys

[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.020]
All right listen wait a minute. Wait a minute. Maybe this will do it hold on a second

[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.640]
We

[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.680]
Is that good enough?

[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:34.500]
Damn because that's one of my favorites and I will say that is like pitiful that was a William Shatter one

[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:39.180]
No, this is but this beats William Shatter at least he's got an excuse. He's from outer space

[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:45.540]
All right one more thing man. He's closing. Yes, sir. Oh wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold on

[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:49.060]
She's manny as a major man. Wait a minute. Don't don't do it sir. I'm sorry

[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.340]
There we go

[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.980]
Far be it for me that's it's still there material

[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.160]
But hey, it's a request on Friday. You're all right

[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.860]
See you

Is that's what I like about milk? Okay, I'll queue it up

[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:24.360]
Look at that shirt. Are you funny? Look at that. It's my socks. Where the hell's Rick Rally?

[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:32.240]
