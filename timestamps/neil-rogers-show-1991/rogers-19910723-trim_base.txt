of the people and I had a good fortune in meeting my husband. Well wasn't that nice?

[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.900]
It turned out to be beautiful. Well that's great we married 38 couples off my dating show.

Is that exciting? Well we married almost six seven years. Well congratulations.

[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.100]
She was strictly because his friend heard your show and we were not on a double date and

[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.600]
that's how I met my husband and I just wanted to thank you and said that it was a big thing for

[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.700]
people who were very lonely at that time. Well that's great. I don't know why it went off. Well it

[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.880]
just kind of ran the course you know it's just there's a time and a place for everything and

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.000]
now of course we got a lot of other people trying to do the same thing and turn it into a

[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.100]
pornographic dating shows and all of that crap but now while I was widowed and he was widowed

[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.300]
and I guess we were just right looking for something. Well that's great. I wanted to thank you

[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.120]
because it wasn't for you I never would have met him. Aren't you nice? And after all this time

[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.920]

[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.200]
Jeff Cohen's hysteria over the fact that while he was away screwing around an acapulco or

[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.240]
wherever the hell it was we had a you know a couple of Sarah's over here a couple of times okay big

[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.760]
deal don't get all psychotic and the reason he's psychotic and neurotic is because Denenberg handles his

[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.020]
account you know he's like a Mexican jumping bean and heat which is why Jeff probably went to

[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.260]
Mexico in the first place W I O D yeah I talked to Neil hold on a second I'm not talking on that line

[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:32.200]
here's a mobile in Miami on that terrible connection hello Neil yes sir good morning how are you

[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.760]
you saw a connection when I picked it up was really bad listen yes fireport yes

[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.640]
they're on those kids out there could clear up their complexion as fast as your phone line cleared

[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.120]
up we'd have a great world listen on the Rick and such show yesterday the guy that does the

[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.100]
enough of the sucking calls so hard me what is it the guy that does the enough of the sucking call

[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.460]
yes yeah the Rick and such and he's the same guy that does the godfather and Michael Jackson did

[00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.440]
you know that enough of the sucking no I didn't know that he did it and supposedly he said this

[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.980]
is finial and they recorded it and everything so I've reconciled what where is it I don't know

[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.660]
if he must have taken it at whatever I don't know oh boy and he said enough of the second he

[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.520]
and he said it pretty much close to what it was the first time and this is turning it to be a

[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.960]
marathon you know you would think that he would have been able to do it the 56 times we had him cut

[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.840]
it that other day last week but I think it was more relaxed yesterday and I know I heard Rick telling

[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.840]
whoever you know supposed to record the show did you record did you get that did you get that

[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.580]
well we don't have it so much to be in Marvin because Marvin never gets anything but they said they

[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.800]
got it yeah I'm saying but it's not on a cart not that I see unless they're hiding it somewhere

[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.640]
as before they probably want to get money you rent some money or something for it yeah well

[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.460]
I'm gonna make them an even swap they can have oh my lord they can have that I'll see you tonight

[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.000]
a pizza lot okay they care guys later well it's about time we got to the bottom of the barrel here

[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.340]
I mean the bottom of some of these questions now have you been handed anything yet I'm playing with

[00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:03.440]
my nose not bad don't start asking a lot of personal questions that wasn't too bad let me hear

[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.020]
I'd got a queue up again I just got through playing it and off for the stocky that's pretty close

[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.740]
ah close not that and the board goes back it's not it it is it but since you are on the phone

[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.580]
I want to know what Corey was doing in here again yesterday that was the most disgraceful the only

[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.980]
thing worse than that was after William Shatner was on yeah and you sucked around with him for a

[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.300]
and at the end of the call I thought you were going to kiss and run off and get married in the

[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.500]
Tahoe or somewhere and then all of a sudden after really he was only on a half hour and he

[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.740]
wouldn't take any calls he said douchebag and he slipped slide it around that thing on Saturday night

[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.760]
live about get a life and a spineless and try to promote his new stinky movie why didn't you tell him

[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.800]
that why didn't you tell him that why didn't you do a Chuck Meyer rats on soupi sales routine okay

[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.440]
we need some people in the station with some balls I think you'll be it on so close to Hank I think

[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.920]
it's starting to rub off this kissy kissy with all the guests okay I'm going to rip it some ass okay

[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:06.580]
this town is talking to a man who's still asleep is not very effective that's true that's true although

[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.280]
maybe subliminally it'll sink in well you know I mean he was still let's get back to Corey again

[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.740]
what the hell was he doing on here I thought we were going to you know talk about the song the guy

[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:21.020]
gets on he said we don't need to talk about it he's been promoing it and suck it around and

[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.060]
siphoning off airtime for months on it now and hanging around here like he owns the place the

[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.640]
fact that we played it you know and then he comes up with this crap well what's it gets on the FM

[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.540]
state it'll really take off yeah better than then us okay we don't have three and a half minutes

[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:43.300]
to waste I'm crap like oh man well we're in the video what's not in the video oh that's why

[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:51.000]
you're sucking around huh well the video gets produced we'll probably have to do that and off of

[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:56.000]
yeah see now we got it on two carts we can play it back to back like an endless loop forever

[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.020]
tooling sucking you're on the video well isn't that great that in 40 cents will get you about a half

[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:07.540]
a cup of coffee at Wolfie's actually bringing out something to send them home oh great I'm

[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.020]
serious somebody stole a balls in this joint I'm telling you that right now okay so William

[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.500]
Shatner's on the phone and you're gonna tell him he's a whole is that and he's a jerk and he's a

[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:22.300]
yes I wouldn't have had him on the first place what that's sad to talk to him about that yeah that

[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:27.920]
star Trek stuff is turmeric you know let me tell you something I've thought about this many times

[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.000]
because such as like an overgrown infant okay we all know that including him but science

[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.260]
it overgrown science fiction undergrown ingrown science fiction is for young adolescent males like

[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.560]
when you're like 11 13 14 15 years old and then you outgrow it because you realize it's a lot of

[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.120]
hookahs focus it's like Santa Claus and God and of tooth fairy it's a budget crap yeah and then

[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.580]
you go on to bigger and better things okay like sex I mean you know you you outgrow science fiction

[00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.700]
it's for kids it's for young males well why don't you have a little father to son talk with him I

[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.020]
don't have anything to do with that show that's your job that's your show well you know I'm just an

[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:12.380]
appendage to your show you're letting the tail wag the dog is what it sounds like to me because

[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.660]
I'm a nice guy no because you're a wimp not a nice guy because you have no gonads pal well I thought

[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.500]
it my you got it anyway you lost a lot of weight now I realize it extended beyond just a waistline

[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.520]
buddy let me tell you that right now Jeff can't see the force for the trees left his

[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:33.480]

[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.480]

[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.000]
I'll get some gonads now and refuse the appearance Jeff brought you some back from Mexico and he said

[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:13.620]
drunk we have an open line on the center square they're in Broward 524 W.I.O.D. Kendall when is he

[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:19.380]
as right on I'm doing great good listen we ask you questions cori on a payroll no he ought to be

[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.640]
pretty soon I think maybe he ought to pay put in a lot more time in some of the people in middle level

[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:28.220]
management I'll tell you that I think he ought to pay W.I.O.D. for being on here he ought to be banned

[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.900]
from the property we ought to have like a 24 hour security guard if he comes anywhere near this

[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:38.400]
place that had just card him off with cement shoes yeah that commercial you just had on last

[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:45.320]
break that guy was going yeah okay I think that that sounds like half the audience every time they

[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:56.480]
hear that cori on here I think you could have a point I think you're on to something I think

[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:04.220]
maybe you're just on something I think they'd rather have a bout with I mean we've tried everything

[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:09.660]
we know to try to give this guy a life and to try to legitimize this embarrassing crappy rap thing

[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:16.680]
that he did and it's it's sucks okay I hope so and then he then he tries to legitimize it by saying

[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.140]
he's going to give a part of the proceeds to Camilo's house well where I'd he never discussed that

[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.420]
with me not that I'm the spokesman for Camilo's house but it's interesting how he tries to siphon

[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.540]
that in there so like we'll legitimize him and put him on and put up with this crap I'd like to see

[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.980]
if he really does you notice how Eric Lambert just disappeared from the human race remember him

[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:40.760]
with two live Jews remember that yeah he was he was a star for about six minutes and he was on

[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:46.220]
with Regis and Kathy Lee and on MTV and he disappeared like he never existed okay like stepping

[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:51.960]
on a fruit fly I think there's a lot of similarity there to be honest with you exactly your fruit

[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:59.100]
fly has more hair more gonads too yeah that's for damn to then they do in this place this is your

[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:12.400]
lengthening oh missa horny look at that penile augmentation or lengthening is perhaps one of the

[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:19.120]
best kept secrets of the urological profession yet numerous articles attesticling to attesting

[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:25.200]
with success and application adorned urological literature i do this procedure frequently in a

[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:32.000]
1989 my video entitled augmentation fallow plastic was accepted and shown at the annual american

urological association etc he says the average american adult male has a five and three

[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.360]
eight inch erection however i would affirm that having served in the u.s. army medical core in

[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:02.480]
a career that black men do tend to have longer penises and chinese men have somewhat smaller ones

[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.560]
some men with a penis clearly too short to provide decent conformation to the rest of their body

[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:22.860]

a great guy i'd love working with him i mean it would be great having him here do you really do you

[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.180]
think that they're or have they considered that or well what do you mean i mean they haven't

[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.480]
even started bidding for the rights yet so how they're going to worry about announcers yet i'll

[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.960]
guarantee that way in his anger is going to get like six thousand tapes from everybody who's

[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.540]
ever even seen a ballgame wanting to announce the games yeah believe me will have you ever heard

like Atlanta and Pittsburgh and river franta saying louis they all look the same they all look the same

[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:28.060]

I'm sorry

That's okay

[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.400]
Don't ever do it again

[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.780]
It won't happen ever again

[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.040]
Okay

[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.300]
Real quick

[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.120]
Something in Tampa happened this weekend

[00:47:59.120 --> 00:47:59.520]
I wonder

[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.320]
Something about a video tie

[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.300]
I missed that

[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.940]
The warrior at the bottom of the steps

[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.700]
Well, I don't know what happened because I was out of town

[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:07.480]
Well, it seems that

[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.620]
What do you mean you were out of town

[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.940]
Well, you must have heard the new story

[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.180]
You wouldn't know something happened

[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.020]
Some pervert with a video cam

[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.400]
Was sticking his nose in other people's business

[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.240]
And they were doing it in the bathroom with the blinds are like open

[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.720]
And he taped it

[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.160]
Okay

[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.420]
With one of those one-armed video cams

[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.640]
He had to keep the other arm free for obvious reasons

[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.160]
I understand

[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.700]
And now he called of cops and they got busted

[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.880]
They got a bus Tim first in the mouth and secondly

[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.960]
For invading their privacy and thirdly for being a peeping idiot

[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.580]
Oh man

[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:35.160]
I said

[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.920]
And we tied a take him on the back alley enough

[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.400]
Exactly

[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.040]
And video taped that too

[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.780]
That's the whole problem now

[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.180]
Everybody's video taping everybody else so they can get everybody busted

[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.260]
But they got because now they're gonna have a

[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.520]
It's that you ever seen 911 to rescue

[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.320]
Yeah, yeah

[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.240]
The people who are actually hurt at that second

[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.300]
You know, and they got

[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:54.760]
Sure

[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.660]
Up in their eye

[00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:00.840]
And this guy he's just getting ready to start a new show on Fox called America's most pornographic home videos

[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.120]
I'm Tonya

[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.160]

[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.820]
I know I've got almost three videos to send into them

[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.100]
I'm ready to show to start

[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.280]
Okay, well, let us see him first

[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:08.740]

[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:30.840]
Jetfan

[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.800]
Man, that's like saying I'm the scum of the earth

[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.400]
It's like saying when your dog scoots on the living room floor

[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.520]
That guy's what it leaves behind on the carpet

[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.040]
Okay

[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.500]
Man, I'd be embarrassed to admit it, sir

[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:46.520]
Let's take a call from Hollywood and see if we can upgrade the level of these calls

[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.060]
And it just doesn't seem to ever end

[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:05.240]
And who has that bin bet that he had there that he met at facade and he took home and they were like in the sack and the phone kept

[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.620]
Bringing it he kept running out to answer and it was Madonna and he was she was whispering

He's such a slut

[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:18.420]
Exactly

[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.640]
I think it's a match made in heaven I think they're a perfect match

[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:22.600]
Yeah

[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.280]
With his personality and her hygiene man, they ought to be great together

[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.180]
Yeah

[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.220]
Um the real reason I call it

[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.560]
I heard there's a rumor that you need some parts for your vent

[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.200]
Really

[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:34.820]
Yeah

[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:35.840]
Unlikely

[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.420]
No

[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:36.880]
No

[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:37.960]
Oh okay

[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:40.060]
Like which part did he have in mind sir?

[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:40.460]
Huh

[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.380]
A motor

[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.480]
A motor huh

[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.100]
That's what Rick was telling me

[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:45.780]
Rick Sanchez

[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:46.740]

[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.420]
He's jealous he wants to get one of the same color

[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.060]
And he's been like a little child now you know

[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.560]
He can't make up his mind he's going through that second stage you know second childhood

[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:01.620]
One day he wants a Porsche next day he wants a Vet just like Niels then he wants his cobra back

[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.400]
He's got a cobra

[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:04.340]
Yeah

[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.580]

Was it nice?

[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:08.740]
I don't know

[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.340]
You have to ask him

[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:14.420]

We're gonna spend $80 billion for a car

[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.820]
It'd be nice to have like radio and a roof and windows

[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.700]
