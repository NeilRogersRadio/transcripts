[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820]
If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now. I'm kick your goddamn teeth in if I had the goddamn teeth

[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.300]
I'd take outside kick my own damn ass you come on here, and you bash me

[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.660]
No, it's very obvious you two guys are out of work and you want the afternoon shift around here

[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.400]
It's a most tasteless thing I've ever heard in my life and I'm driving to work

[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.220]
I have a show to do and I'm getting ticked off at you

[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.320]
Call it if I had if I had the ability to do I take you out here right now kick your goddamn teeth in

[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.340]
Well, I think a ability is probably the key word

[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.780]
Yeah, I hope it's in my key

[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.860]
You're nobody

[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.640]
Till somebody loves you

[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.200]
You're nobody

[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.360]
Till somebody cares

[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.580]
You might be king you might possess the world and all it's gold

[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.480]
But gold won't buy your happiness

[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.400]
When you're growing old

[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.000]
The world's still the same you'll never change it

[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.920]
As long as the stars shine above

[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.300]
Where nobody

[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.840]
You're somebody

[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.280]
Find yourself

[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.000]
How just anybody find yourself somebody

[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.660]
Thank you

[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.040]
And hello toad episode last night again little frog story

[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.500]
After watching a not too bad movie called over exposed with some people I never heard of before I thought it was pretty good

[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620]
I give it about a six and a half seven

[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.140]
George has about a two what what the hell do you know

[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.400]
He's got a crappy attitude lately better straighten him out

[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.720]
He'll have a better attitude on Friday because Rick and suds are doing their show at Atlantis and you'll have to be here all the way till six o'clock

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.940]
Sitting in there just

[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.900]
Chopping in the bed to get out of here anyway, so awesome movie which is pretty good

[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.460]
I'm going to bed let the dogs out and they come inside and

[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.280]
Guess what they're foaming at the mouth

[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.400]
Probably ran into one of the W.I.D. salespeople in the backyard. I could have been now they ran into another one of those

[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.060]
Bufo

[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.560]
Frogs now the big dog he just rinses mouth out real quick and when you weigh 94 pounds

[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.500]
It doesn't make too much difference. He's just fine

[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.640]
But my little dog who weighs eight pounds. He's like her key and jerky and jumping around and just to go in nuts

[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.200]
And I rinsed his mouth out and made him a little better and they started whining and yulping

[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.280]
so I take him to the

[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.300]
24-hour vet up on university and

[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.440]
McNabb

[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.240]
I think I'm about 25 shots and

[00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.460]
Put them all back in shape

[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.980]
You know the dog is sick when you take him in there and there's some old

[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.140]
Hound dog sitting on the floor and he pays no attention to him at all because my little dog goes nuts over any other dog and

[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.420]
Fixed him up at about 20 minutes good as brand new falls asleep in fact to give him a little sedative to come his ass down

[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.300]
Falls asleep in my lap on the drive back to the house and I take him back in now keep in mind

[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.160]
I got both of these dogs the same day

[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.360]
About like two and a half years ago. They're both just over two and a half years old. They were little puppies

[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.560]
Brought him home the same day one ways 94 pounds the other one ways eight pounds

[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.880]
And I brought the little dog home who was practically in a coma by that time from the sedative and you would have thought these dogs have been separated for five years

[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.700]
Just clawing and scratching to get that door open so they could just to jump and chase each other all over the house

[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.580]
Just amazing now the reason I bring the story up by the way Bufo. I think probably a short for Buffalo. That's what I've been told

[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.520]
Which probably is true because they're nasty disgusting grotesque things and they're all over the place now

[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.620]
Not only we have gigantic killer mosquitoes this year, but the toads and the frogs are like his biggest Massachusetts. They're enormous. They're gross

[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.940]
So anyway the reason I bring it up and play the Alex Bennett thing there is because

[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.220]
It was just over a year ago about a year and a quarter ago at this time

[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.960]
What does that mean you're in a quarter ago at this time that

[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.560]
Alex Bennett came to town

[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.880]
came in his meada

[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.660]
Watching T. L. O'Vision and he was the wimpiest on the guy I've ever known in my life

[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.540]
Well, he just had that real I don't know and he had pen jolette on with him is good buddy from pen and teller

[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.200]
That first day that he's on the air and of course that happened to be the day

[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.320]
I came in and told the story about my dog who was much sicker last year. I mean nearly died from the poison

[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.580]
And I talked about it and then we had all these yantas calling it about it having an nervous breakdown

[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.940]
And he did four hours ripping me because I was supposed to be this big hot shot Miami radio superstar

[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.980]
And they came in a town listening waiting to hear this really exciting hot funny show and all they heard was this jackass talking about his dog almost died

[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.680]
So needless to say alerts and I got off. Oh you've lost just incredible amounts of weight

[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.700]
If you would cut off the that schmutzie here

[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.760]
Now that you grew here in the front seriously. He'd look almost human. Mitch Lewis is just I can't I once did you lose now

[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.840]
30 some 35 pounds what an ass. I can't stand that

[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.600]
Can't handle these people are just like and melts off their body

[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.000]
And you did a newtor system too dint you boy. That's amazing

[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.780]
But anyway, um, what the hell was I just talking about before I get distracted about?

[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.980]
And I know listen, I appreciate the help, but I general I have like a general idea. It's Tuesday

[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.240]
And I know what building I mean other than that forget it

[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.960]
And he got all bent out of shape over the fact I was talking about the dog nearly dying well to me

[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.580]
I mean it was a big deal okay to a lot of other people out there had similar experience

[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.440]
And then of course when you sampled his show for the following weeks hearing about letterbox format on

[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.300]
Video discs. I mean if you go out and buy a disc player

[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.300]
I'm going to tell you right now. It's biggest waste of money you've ever invested in your life

[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.440]
You might as well go to the track and bet it all on the longest shot on the board to win

[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.100]
As opposed to buying a video disc player. They're just a waste of time

[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.500]
I mean the the resolution just isn't that much greater than other for example a super VHS V-A

[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.580]
of VCR not a big deal

[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.160]
And if you want to watch a movie that looks like it's been squashed like it's been stepped on by fat rich on both ends

[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.740]
And all squashed down in the middle be my guest

[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:35.220]
So quite frankly, I think it's more entertaining to talk about the Bufo Toads for four hours every day than listen to the crappy

[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.320]
Atterpedal if I had the ability to do I take you out here right now. I'm kick your god damn teeth

[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.680]
Although I will say this is I look back in retrospect. I do miss those melodious tones

[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.740]
Okay, anyway, it's 11 after 10 also yet yesterday quarter to six

[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.520]
I receive a frantic call while nearly frantic for my mother who says

[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.280]
now

[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.220]
She's having a nervous breakdown because her cable she just I don't know how took her till a quarter to six yesterday to discover it

[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.500]
Her cables all screwed up because she lives in Hollywood where they're unfortunate enough to have store a cable

[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.420]
Which we discussed on nausea me yesterday

[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.720]
And she's having a fit because she's trying to find her although well keep in mind

[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.920]
This is a quarter to six which means for 45 minutes. She's been flipping all around those channels

[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.900]
All I can find is the news. I can't find her although. What am I gonna do? I mean she was just apoplectic

[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:41.680]
So I said call those assholes up tomorrow and first she wanted to go down there and I heard some woman call Rick and suds

[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.820]
I was on my way home yesterday and to say that she went down there with a box because she thought her box was all screwed up

[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.180]
And it was standing online like it was the early bird on special sale

[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.280]
At the rascal house they were lined up for like a thousand blocks

[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.980]
So I said forget about going down there

[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.280]
Call them up and demand that they send you out another schedule in the mail

[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.580]
I could have told her to turn on channel nine and write down the list but that would have been too easy

[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:10.000]
So needless to say if mommy is all hysterical about store cable there lots and lots of people out there who are suffering from serious

[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.380]
consternation and or constipation today all over this town

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:19.700]
Because of those slime balls at store cable you know Jim Bozo and that is his name. He's the head honcho

[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:25.460]
I used to have money a year ago and I did all those topical boring shows and every now and then we do a show on cable TV and have the different

[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.780]
To honcho's on from cable systems and his name is Jim Bozo

[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:37.700]
That's his real name is the head guy at store. Yes, sir. Yes

[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.700]
About wars and boats that you talked about earlier about what

[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:49.020]
Briggers cars and boats now we're talking about bridges over the causeway not the ones in your mouth

[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.040]
I don't have any of my friends. Okay. Yeah, calm down. So I can deep breath

[00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.820]
Daddy

[00:08:59.820 --> 00:08:59.820]

[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:10.180]
If I knew that I wouldn't have been asking say what's that I said if I knew the answer to the question I wouldn't have asked it in the first place

[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.080]
Over one

[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.020]
Now the boat waterway. Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. Yeah

[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.760]
Yes, and what time should they not be open to marine traffic sir?

[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.880]
I'm telling you that they come up with a time. Well, what what is the time?

[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.640]
I believe is that rush hour times sir

[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:54.020]
That they are not open to marine traffic other than that they are open to marine traffic

[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.820]
So in other words any slump with a boat can come along and back up traffic for too much

[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.280]
Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crafters that that is not a communist bunch of

[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.020]
Sounds like some kind of the end-of-the-thousand fastest Tommy Pico

[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.020]
Exactly

[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.620]
The boat is going to stop for 5,000 cars

[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.780]
Is that it? No, I think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one jackass in his boat. I think that's what they ought to do

[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.780]
Man, you better know your laws, Mr. Because you should go that's right

[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.580]
I suppose you want the man-briggs closed to both traffic and a hurricane too

[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.940]
I want the bridges closed period. Okay. I want them closed

[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.780]
I want the bridge tended to go home and watch your MTV and get the hell out of our lives

[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.300]
I want those bridges closed let him use the junior tunnel. Okay, you know

[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:48.620]
I think they ought to go on a George Washington bridge and jump all of bridge tenders. How do you like that sir?

[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.580]
Well, I don't know about you

[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.980]
But you shot like some stupid idiotic

[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.320]
Well, I don't know about you but you shot like some stupid idiotic

[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.980]
Stupid stupid stupid idiotic

[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.780]
Stupid idiotic

[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.040]
1016 at W.I.O.D. We have a major celebrity on the phone now so we don't mess around with any

[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.480]
Time wasting bits and stuff. We get right to it ladies and gentlemen

[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:22.040]
A legend in the broadcasting industry a legend in the Hawaiian shirt wearing contests from coast to coast

[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.200]
Hello

[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.320]
Who is this?

[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.860]
Neil, how are you today?

[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.660]
Oh, this is I said the georgias is this sunny fox and he said yes

[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.780]
I thought it was sunny fox I put you on

[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.720]
Like oh jeez

[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.160]
What's that out of here you're a slime ball sunny from the market

[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.760]
Neil you got me very confused. I thought it was by his ox. I thought it was somebody important

[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.740]
You got me no, I'm not important, but you got a shine artist you're she you got more excuses than carters got

[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:59.120]
Oh man, but you're the confusing you're the goddess of using the whole deal you got more you got more excuses

[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.340]
That our sales department's got him. Well, let's not talk about yourself. Let's not you know they're not my favorite

[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:10.340]
No, really well. We've got something in common anyway. They're the best. Okay. They kick ass. They each others

[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:16.480]
I know you've told me that you're diabetic. Yeah. Can you not eat the fresh fruit that I send you? That's correct

[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.840]
Well, then I won't send it right. Hey listen. I never stopped it before. Let me just say something to you. Okay

[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.520]
You know what I like the best forget about when I said about the tea fact you're diet, which is a very I like that a lot

[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.180]
That didn't mean you should stop sending the great stuff you were sending before there's not enough fat in all of that put together to

[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.900]
Well out to a p hole in the snow as somebody I know would say that's right

[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:41.480]
So don't worry. I you know, I mean when you went from one extreme to the other and all of a sudden started with a slice of onion and two

[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.860]
Carrots sticks that wasn't exactly my idea of a gourmet salad

[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:53.760]
Well, what happened yesterday? What's your excuse for today? I have no excuse, but you know you have so many people sending you so many great salads and food

[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.100]
I thought that one day that I didn't send it you wouldn't miss it

[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.380]
Oh

[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.240]
You know something I don't think it was a boof-hove

[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.580]
Toted all in my backyard. I think sunny was in the yard last night the dogs both were foaming at the mouth

[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.200]
Because you make me foam at the mouth. I tell you that

[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.700]
One day you tell me that you enjoy those raspberries and fresh blueberries

[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.900]
I do but I'm not supposed to eat them. I enjoy having like a hot-fudge Sunday on

[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:20.840]
Caramel

[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.620]
Chris Biscream too, but they don't mean I can eat it

[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.040]
Well, that's why I'm confused. I don't know what to send you anymore

[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:35.660]
Oh, man this man is so full of crap. Did you have any complaints all those other days? Were there any complaints? How many times you brag about that anti-pastel? I send you

[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:44.020]
And then and then I found out that you said don't send anymore that I don't want it who the hell said that you did on the air you're full of crap here now

[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:50.920]
I'm telling you I heard you say that the same as the plantains and the same as the other day

[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.000]
I sent you those beautiful berries and I heard you say who wants my fruit exactly

[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.040]
Well now, you know, I wasn't talking about the berries. Oh, excuse me

[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.480]
Sonny, you're so full of crap, but just why do you why do you lower yourself?

[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.520]
Do you mean yourself to this level where you like gravel on your kid?

[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.540]
Why don't you just said? I mean if you're gonna send which I'm an additional which I'll pay for it

[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.780]
I have no problem. I'm not looking for a freebie. All right, send me on a paper. Give me I'll give you credit. Yeah, right

[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.480]
Listen, it's my pleasure to send you our fresh shallower. You're full of crap, sonny

[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.600]
And if you wanted me to feed all your crap, I don't want you to feed listen to me, please

[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.520]
Do you want to sell it George?

[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.920]
George would like one George deserves when he's underpaying. He's a great guy. No

[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.380]
Listen to me. Stop trying to be a big shot to make up for yesterday being an asshole. Okay, listen to me

[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:42.160]
If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now. I'm kicking god damn teeth in one for me and one for George

[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.940]
Period the rest of these people like I said before what really bugs me

[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.680]
Like if I get something in here that somebody sends me

[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.880]
There are certain people in this building who automatically assume that it's my obligation to feed them

[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.500]
What when does their show come on you know what I'm saying absolutely? So the hell with them

[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:03.400]
I'm not gonna play this game and then then if you bring him three or four then there's like 20 other people where is ours?

[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.540]
Scroll them let them go out and buy lunch okay?

[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:12.380]
They got a good time under hand. Do not do it any work in this place with great respect all your colleagues and contemporaries there

[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.160]
If I want to feed the world I can you know bring them all in it is a thousand out there

[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.280]
It'll be you want to get free salads out go down to Camilla's house and help those people down there

[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.800]
They need a lot more than these people out here to go to or I do for that matter. I do send them a lot of

[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.360]
God start sucking around up, but I'm gonna send you and George a fresh salad. Oh, man

[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.660]
All right, see I told you do you hear that?

[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.420]
That's right, but I don't know what is right and what is wrong

[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.660]
That's obvious so that's all having that white hair like that is wrong. I'll tell you that no further fucking right

[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.300]
All right, I'm telling you I love listen to me. Yes, sir

[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.740]
You come on here and you bash me something to say to you in closing, sonny. Yes

[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.860]
See you see you

[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.360]
Come on in one after ten. I thought it was my socks

[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.400]
So I immediately went rushed right to the call and I had a carton here that was left in my box that I wanted to hear what it said

[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.580]
Hey Neil I'm the guy you love the rip on on my amy zone scottie Mac

[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:16.720]
Oh, jeez what a twerp what a real twerp. I am so sick and tired of hearing about my amy zone

[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:23.880]
What does that mean who cares? He's a torpy little boredop who sits in there and picks his nose and comes in here and screws up all the carts

[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.340]
When grave lines kids and his friends aren't in here doing the uncederedy morning

[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:33.180]
And yes the word is out all over the building the guy comes in here to do a four hour show or four and a half

[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.320]
Whatever it is Saturday morning once a week four hours

[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.480]
Why is it necessary? This isn't this isn't the circus. It's not a playground. It's a place of work

[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.440]
It's a radio station

[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.700]
Why is it necessary for him to bring his kids and his ex-wife and his girlfriend and

[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:53.800]
Boyfriend and 20 people in here playing with the carts like it's a playground this ain't a playground. It's a place of business grave line. You jackass

[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.500]
Now what does that call from Hollywood all about hello? Oh, yeah, but I do yeah

[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.520]
I mean you were last on the line, but I was just to peeked my curiosity when I saw the topic

[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:10.640]
Well, you you were talking to Sonny, right? Yeah, I thought was gonna be Zavox, but it was old white here. It's sunny

[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.580]
Is that the sun needs that we see on TV? Yeah, no

[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.500]
Sonny that you've heard of the green grocer. That's Joe Cartioni. This is sunny the white hair grocer

[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.200]
No Joe died, right? So Sonny's last but bottom Joe died

[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.920]
Joe Cartioni didn't he? Joe Cartioni died

[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:27.460]
No

[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:37.520]
Come on, did he too many of those poison berries I think but but but what I want to know is why why you land back to old Sonny

[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.260]
What are you talking about?

[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.280]
Well, I don't know I just sounded like you were giving him the give him the hard time

[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.000]
Given him the raspberries, that's where because he deserves it because he's a

[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.080]
freeloading of fool

[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:57.020]
Well, that's what I always wanted to know like you know sometimes we listen to you and you and you're in somebody and uh

[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.920]
The radio show sir. It's part of the radio show

[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.880]
He enjoys that he loves the publicity we can call him every name in the book and he loves it because he's an

[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.380]
Egotistical Eagle maniacal adoosh band, okay?

[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.520]
He loves it. It's just a radio show. Don't take everything so uh so seriously

[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.240]
Actually, I don't think it's seriously gonna where you get in

[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.940]
Get the early shot here on the radio. Yeah, I love you

[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.000]
I'll tell you one thing these people this must be like Monday because for Monday yesterday

[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.220]
We had a sensational Monday the phones were jammed for four hours today

[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.460]
They're jammed and then they're all dropping off in a hurry like they usually do on Monday

[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.940]
One minute I looked down every line is lit then all of a sudden have them drop off

[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.340]
Then I looked down or I'll let again in the dry they're like ancillary pants Tuesday

[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.180]
I guess or maybe they're killing toads in the backyard

[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:41.900]
I don't know what that is or maybe the mention of Alex Bennett's name chased a couple of them away. That's possible

[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.460]
I don't know. Well, let me call you have you been at the uh

[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.480]
You've been called already. I haven't been to call her yet this meeting now

[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.080]
But they really did a good job, but now it's second floor up there boy. Yeah, he uh

[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.000]
Make it a pleasure to lose your money. Oh really? Well, that's what I hear. I hear it looks sensational

[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.100]
You're only dead

[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:06.260]
Oh, here's the body by solo flex spot got to go sir. Okay. See if do you have that promo the traffic one see wipes

[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.420]
The brand-new king sky watch six 10 traffic with three play coverage

[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.220]
Okay, I can't I can't handle that's it

[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.500]
When I hit that pop pop peep peep. Oh god, those are nauseating

[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:24.400]
I do notice that that four hundred second promo disappeared for how you dial star 70 before you call so you don't get the call waiting

[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.440]
That insipid piece of crap that went on for like five and a half minutes like slapping the audience in the face

[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.720]
And I'm gonna tell you another thing since I'm on a roll this week. Yes today in the beginning of their show

[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.540]
W-I-O-D's day get it off

[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.020]
Yesterday at the beginning of their show I hear a Rick and suds lamenting the fact that was he hanging around?

[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.200]
Was he looking in here because they said he was in there was jumping all over their ass about how they have to say

[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.780]
W-I-O-D news talk or whatever the hell it is like 80 million times an hour when I first came here

[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.900]
Bill wise tried to give me the same crap and wrote a stupid memo about that which I read on the air and just ripped into pieces

[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.100]
You see this business of promoting inside

[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.740]
Everybody who's listening right now knows they're listening to W-I-O-D. Okay, they know the dials on six 10

[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.140]
They know it's W-I-O-D. They know I'm the erudgers. They know it's Georgian air. It's Rick and suds. It's Reneering

[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.040]
They know that he recycling the same audience over and over again doesn't get the job done

[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.820]
See so it's instead of going out there and promoting the people we got on the year and what we really do here

[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.760]
Instead they put up those stupid news weather and traffic billboards

[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.300]
They give us no promotion whatsoever and then they put the the monkey in our back

[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.500]
That's your GTR monkey they stick it on our back. Okay, it's your fault. You guys aren't

[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.900]
None of station idea. They don't know what station it is. Yeah, they know what station it is

[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.020]
Phil Kostin just came in he said Joe Cartioni be dead so

[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.820]
He thinks he's pretty sure not positive so dead or alive

[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.200]
There's a good run for you Chuck when you come back on Saturday morning

[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.260]
Chuck by the way not too happy the pirates didn't win yesterday. Of course they didn't play

[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.680]
But he was walking around with a real surly look on his face this morning

[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.700]
So it has to be either because I parked in the new space again

[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.240]
That's my space out there by the way. I'm only here for an a half hours a day

[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.640]
Huh, so now it's my space. I've appropriated it

[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.420]
Whether they like it or not in addition what they shouldn't be in here anyway. They should be out getting news, right?

[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.380]
Miami

[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.380]
Hello

[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.160]
Oh

[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.720]
Boy these calls are choking me up into that or these cheap cigars my amies gone

Hello, yes, sir. Hey Neil. How you doing?

[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.860]
I thought this is Lee Lee. This is a JNO

[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.280]
No wrong number

[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.220]
I guess it didn't win the Saddam Hussein toilet paper

[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.000]
Is that what they're doing? Oh, I'd not I heard during the war

[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.760]
They were doing some stupid. Well, that's pretty exciting. You know, that's the major market radio up there

[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.520]
Chain. Oh, that's a big time. Yeah, I got to pick him a long time ago. Yeah

[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:53.740]
Anyway

[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.980]
Please play please play the yeah, please. Oh, chance. Oh, you know, you got those

[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:06.760]
You haven't even said hello. Well started out trying to be funny with some crap about Lee Fowler and his look-alike toilet paper

[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.900]
Which quite frankly he can wipe his own and you haven't even been like made an attempt

[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:19.720]
To say anything you get right to the bill which is good. That's good. You're not sucking around. Yeah. No, what do you want? What do you want?

[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.680]
Those speaking of those

[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:29.300]
Promotes for the news. Yeah, which sound like you know music they played during a 72-dolphin clip. Yeah

[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:35.660]
Those things Rick and suds did up for that. There's stuff. I don't play there stuff. You don't call him and ask him for it

[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.980]
I want you to do it anyway. I'm not gonna do it because I don't think you mean the one about Henry

[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.880]
I don't think they're funny. I don't I don't like those at all. I don't I don't

[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.780]
I don't like him if I like to might steal it

[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:49.000]
But I'm certainly not gonna steal material. I don't like I think they're mediocre at best

[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.800]
You know what the real shame you guys I imagine you got a it's bad radio to rip your own

[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.220]
spots on the station to rip what rip your own spots

[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.660]
Rip our own spots. Yeah, the commercials. No, we don't rip our commercials believe I'll tell you that you could you could do

[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.600]
50 hours a day on that. Well, that's great, but we don't I know

[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.260]
Like you could while we're here we're a horser. We're here to make a living and however we can do it

[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.380]
That's what we're gonna do. I know have a great life

[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.520]
Wow 1053 this cigar is just killing me over here

[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:18.800]
Wow

[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:27.960]

[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.160]

[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:07.300]
um

Which I don't care what anybody says I do like that show all of it

[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.000]
It's a very tacky inner a horrendous interview with that poor little 14-year-old kid who's got AIDS over in search

[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:44.120]
He's marrying a 16-year-old girlfriend and they had the mother and the other mother and the one way the 600 pounds on the sofa

[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.880]
Was it I mean why don't they just get up off the couch saying mind your own business and go to hell and walk off the set

[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.720]
You know, I mean get lost with that stuff

[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.660]
But she says this morning she says it's gonna be hotter than Hades

[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.080]
She's predicting like 91 to 94 for today

[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.500]
And I'm telling you Maria one of these days soon is gonna say it's gonna be hotter and hell

[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:10.120]
Come on Maria you can do it and a whole audience out there is just gonna get up and do it like a Bronx cheer. They're all gonna

[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:20.660]
You're something like that in the background or one of the other. Here's a lady in South Miami. Hi Neil. Hi

No, Jerry's not there Jerry went to that big light bulb in the sky. He's on WFT

[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.800]
You couldn't hear it there for a million dollars

[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.540]
WFL oh for God we found the losers and believe me in his case. They were sure right about that

[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:50.400]
Things just aren't what they used to be are they since those good old days? It's just going to hell on a hand casket

[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.240]
Very nothing WQAM right

[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.820]
Radio's a waste like a gigantic radio cesspool is it it's horrendous? I mean you have nobody

[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.140]
Listen to or anything. Yeah. Well, thank God for us right

[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:07.960]
Good for you

[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.400]
Thank you Neil. Okay, you hang in there. It's gonna get a lot worse

[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.060]

[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.720]
With us five o'clock and a

[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.440]
It's a cut it girl. Why it's good to begin with a laugh. I always say the cutting through it is I've been in love before

[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.240]
Okay, it's 11.06

[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:08.980]
The reason I was getting into that cut is that somewhere on there is the thing with the green grocer and an honor of Joe Karchione being dead

[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.480]
Even though it's you know a couple of years. He probably ain't even mildly warm anymore

[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.120]
But we'll probably play that

[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:20.800]
Six minutes after 11. I want to thank sunny profusely while sunny junior actually came over and he says if my dad gives you any more flank

Oh, look at that boy. That's a nice looking salad for George there

[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:36.480]
And there's a beautiful banana that Laura might want. Oh, I thought you were coming in here to take that to George

[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.640]
Understand why you just sat your ass down on the chair and here look at this. What is this no fat no sugar? What is that?

[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.140]

[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.240]

[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:55.600]
And here's mine. Okay, everybody's got theirs and that's it and anybody else in the building who didn't get theirs too bad because we don't share

[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.000]

[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:32.900]

[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.220]

[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.220]
No, no

[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.820]
How about Zimmer?

[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.140]

Yeah, it's kind of funny. You had a somebody call mentioned JNOS hour, but

[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.740]
That's what it's about. I was listening to your your buddy Lee

[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.440]

Bubbles yeah, you know, I don't know you have an on-car, but it's like it sounds like bubbles popping

That's a Sally Fitz card

[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:34.340]
I have no idea. Well, what do you worry about that station in that market? It's not worth worrying about

[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.980]
It's like asking me about how the station in Belgrade is doing. It's just it's meaningless

[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.380]
I want to get home. I turn jack hole and oh god

There's a celery on the shore and that's a lovely stock

[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:50.360]
How did you get here little celery if only you could talk

[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.860]
What else do I see upon the shore that may give me a clue

[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.220]
I see a few potatoes

[00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.760]
So tasty and Irish stew

[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.340]
Someone was on the beach I think to have a picnic

[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.400]
And knock their picnic basket over when they tried to have a quicky

[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:15.140]
I see veg tables everywhere scattered about the sand

[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.340]
If I could see this every day I'd open a produce stand

[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.140]
I see another stranger there

[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.220]
She's well

[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.560]
She's wearing a bookini

[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:29.760]
Okay

[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.640]
Excuse me miss I wonder if you dropped your zucchini

[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:42.360]
And now I see her boyfriend running toward me in a frantic pace

[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.140]
I think he's going to kick some sand right in my back

[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.400]
Donut attack me sir I'll tell police

[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.800]

Ask your girl is also dropped a melon

[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.420]
Perhaps me now and I finally know how a vegetable really feels

[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:08.060]
Because this goon buried my face down in the sand up to my heel

[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.500]
Yeah, thank you Joe Cartagony Jr

[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.820]
Welcome dick this is Joe Cartagony Jr. Your green grossa reminding you

[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.500]
Never just you with your finger on the beach

[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.520]
Someone will mistake it for a close point at the shore

[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.900]
And that rich is still eating

[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.420]
1117 at WIOD look at his guy his own little mini salad in there

[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.740]
He comes and there's anybody in the world eating

[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.700]
He has to sit down and to be sociable and eat with him

[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.940]
So if there's anybody out there planning on eating lunch just wait a few minutes he'll be right over

[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.920]
Oh look at that you got your beautiful papaya with a

[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:53.740]
Self-propelling knife in it. It's 1117 at WIOD Miami. Hi. Oh, why? Yeah, okay? Hey, you know what papaya is in Spanish?

[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.220]
I don't want to hear you gotta be careful. Okay. All right

[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:01.300]
You've been into the movies lately, huh? No, you gotta go see back jobs pretty good. Why?

[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.580]
Because it's in Chicago

[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:08.200]
It takes place on Chicago and they have great scenes in Chicago and boom by the way that girl I called it

[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.320]
That if she wanted to take her her boss somewhere she said where's the action at

[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:18.440]
You're up in the rush street. Mm-hmm. All around him. Yeah, pretty boring, huh? No, it's caught. No

[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:23.980]
Oh, why'd you say that? Have you heard these other calls? Yeah, they're there. I think by comparison

[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:29.860]
You're like about a 32 on a scale of six they're all by comparison because everything is relative now really go see back

[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:36.300]
Yeah, but it's a really good movie. Yeah, I think it's gonna be nominated for a couple of awards. Did you see um body chemistry?

[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:42.260]
No, did you see over exposed? No, okay? Well, I've been at least nobody else did either

[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.160]
I watch these stupid movies on a cable and then I figure

[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:51.540]
Somebody out there will have something to say now body chemistry wasn't too bad, but the ending was horrendous

[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:58.140]
It just uh to me the worst part that people have is ending movies right they just don't know how to end the movie

[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.200]
In other words, they write this script they do it. They you know

[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.660]
They put it together and then they come to end it. They don't know how to end the movie

[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:04.880]
Exactly

[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.060]
Back times had a terrible ending, but it's still a good movie though. Yeah, you know

[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:15.020]
Dives the one of the main guy. I'm not gonna say who was that Joe Cartioni. No, you know what he ate

[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:23.220]
Probably too many papayas. No, he ate something that uh, uh, what's his guy? What's his name? Dom to Louise cooked

[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.340]
They were buddies, you know, right? No. Yeah

[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.060]
He's hanging out who's buddies?

[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.500]
Dom to Louise with who?

[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.920]
With with the green grocer with Joe Cartioni. Yeah

[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.700]
You know that now

[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.000]
You know, he's out there. We've had his own little cooking thing right? Yeah, yeah

[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.160]
There were buddies. Okay, well, he don't look like he's been eating too many vegetables to me. I'll tell you that

[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.380]
Don't by the way the cup suck

[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.160]

[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.300]
Definitely

[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.860]
I've got some news about the green grocer yeah

After the unfortunate demise of the joker choney and I'm dying over here. Yeah

[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.680]

Yeah, and also does a television spot on ktb. You well, that's great

[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.780]
It's good to see that we keep those fruits and vegetables in the same family

[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.600]
Definitely um

[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.380]
Just wanted to say that

[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.440]
With the news about the baseball team coming here um

[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:45.460]
I don't know if the people are in in florida know how fortunate they are that they're getting a nationally team as opposed to an american

[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.180]
That's correct

[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.940]
It's uh we got an american league too and always be like getting the minor league marlin's back. Yeah, triple a exactly

[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.660]
Like getting iowa

[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:57.780]
Well, I'm I called you a couple weeks ago and um

[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.540]
I'm the san francisco giant fan that recently transplanted bay area

[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.440]
Person the giants are making their comeback

[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:12.640]
You know hopes brings us all right, right and uh I'm making my my trip next week that I tell you about to go see the giants in the cubs

[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.460]
really so really forward to that and

[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:21.520]
Took your advice and let the let the hotel get the tickets and so everything's all arranged. Yeah, no problems behind that

[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:27.840]
That's what we're doing. Okay, so I just want to say you've got a great show and um and one of what you know about the green grocer

[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.540]
you know

[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:35.200]
The senior goes up to heaven and you know the sun takes over. Okay. Well listen don't feel too bad about those three losses next week

[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:40.480]
Have a great time. All right, but let's go to willadian my amy. Hello. Hi. Neil. How you doing?

[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.080]
Um, not that great. Why I just have so much to complain about

[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:50.520]
I'm actually out here watching my house because we just had termites. Yeah, I had the house tented

[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.580]
No, I'm not here watching it. I don't know why I'm watching it because we were just bugged right two weeks ago

[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.440]
This lovely city of north Miami

[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.800]
Where is there to move down here? That's pretty safe

[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.540]
Oh, I think like about four miles out into the Atlantic would be good like an old robot

[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.780]
Yeah, really there needs to be low jack for uh the criminals put in fire

[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:15.220]
Low jack inside your body exactly put inside their bodies. Yeah, not them down

[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:19.020]
So how's everything else going? Have you ever had your house term or not?

[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.380]
Have I ever had it what terminized? Terminized

[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.800]
I'm outside on my portable phone. That's why I can't say that I've had to pleasure

[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.840]
There have been a few termites that sneak into front door every now and then but most of them go back out

[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:36.420]
I'm sure and how about burglarized. No lucky you know. Yeah, one time. Yes, I did

[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.640]
Isn't it the worst? Did they not not a lot of fun, huh?

[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:44.800]
Or did they just clean it out? Clean it out. When in doubt clean it out. Did you have an alarm system?

[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:51.440]
Uh, no, it's a long time ago. This was we've been alarm system too. Hmm. They don't care these days. Now

[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:56.780]
Knock it in come on out and they know well, maybe they were after the termites. Maybe you're right

[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.920]
I hope they got it. I'm going to sell in them by the pound

[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.540]
Exactly

[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:00.640]
Exactly

[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.480]
Now I brought that up yesterday, but of course nobody ever responds to anything I bring up. It is a real-day Lima

[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.720]
In this area is to wear

[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:13.640]
To live because unlike most major metropolitan areas. I mean, there's no hub. There's no

[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.520]
There's nothing that you really want to live close to unless it's your work or something

[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.160]
But other than that there's no like center where the action is meant because there ain't any action

[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.920]
But it's just so we have a conglomeration of all these bedroom towns

[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:32.260]
And you just keep moving further and further west. That's what I've been to. I'm almost out in the Everglades now way out there in plantation acres

[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:36.640]
But like I said the other day if you don't live anywhere near the ocean you might as well be living in

[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.560]
Peoria it's just there's just no attraction

[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:44.480]
Well, we move from West Kendall not to mention the fact that the further west you move you're wearing it all these big

[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.280]
Bufo frogs and your dog start freaking out and

[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.820]
Mesquitos the size of a Gibraltar. It's just it's outrageous out there. Are there a lot of mosquitoes out where you live?

[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:57.040]
Oh, man, are there a lot of mosquitoes? There are more mosquitoes out there than there are people

[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:01.640]
See we move from West Kendall. There are more mosquitoes out there than there are termites in your woodwork

[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.360]
Well, Kendall was pretty bad not because of the mosquitoes but the language barrier

[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:09.300]
I lived in Kendall for five years and then I just couldn't handle it anymore

[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.440]
Yeah, no one speak English

[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.660]
When I had to every time I left the house I had to show my passport I said no more for me

[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:19.260]
I felt the same way so here we are north Miami and that seems to be changing too

[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.900]
Well, I also isn't it amazing how we kind of follow each other around

[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:27.820]
I also lived in North Miami at the Twin Lakes Racket Club for two years long ago and it was a wonderful neighborhood and it was a great place

[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:33.960]
So we're in the California Club area which is really not too far like a stone's throw you could throw a giant rock from there to where I live and

[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:38.660]
Might not be a bad idea a nice place, but it's getting worse changing neighborhood

[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.360]
I hate to put it in those terms, but it's getting pretty smarmy

[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.880]
Yeah, so I just don't know where else to go and that's sad because that's a real you would think that would be a primo part of time

[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:53.700]
It's right it's right there at the golden glades and it's so convenient to come anywhere you want to get on a turnpike the Palmetto 95

[00:47:54.260 --> 00:48:01.260]
Tabito it's just it's like heaven it's perfect area of location wise but 20 minutes from everything but I don't know what to do

[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.340]
It's kind of like faded into oblivion exactly

[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.860]
Exactly to make convenient stories next step is plantation

[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:13.320]
Well plantation is nice, but like I said you keep getting farther and farther in the west and it's like living in

[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.220]
Sagadah, Michigan I know you want to get like that guy from Sagadah?

[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:21.860]
No, I came from Long Island a place called Stony Brook. Oh, yeah, just way out there

[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:26.460]
I know how long it took to get into the city to do anything constructive

[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:30.760]
So I think I can handle it just to feel safe. I just don't feel safe here anymore

[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:36.680]
Well, it's not a problem getting around because it takes me only about 35 40 minutes getting all the way from the acres down here into Miami

[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.220]
Right because of the 595 and the turnpike it's a snap right

[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:48.100]
But I am getting a little upy-oed with the frogs and the mosquitoes and it's just it's like living in the Everglades and then in May and October

[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:54.040]
The love bugs which to me are the most disgusting things on a face of the they're just all over the place

[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:59.640]
You go out to lay in the shades in a back and get a little sun and relax and all of a sudden they're just all over your face and you're swatting

[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.120]
Oh, man love it the love bugs

[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:09.320]
I have another name for them, but I've repeated in the air. Well the mosquitoes we got now are as big as two of them love bugs

[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.800]
So maybe it was maybe they did a little breeding in between

[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:18.640]
So the frogs that you're talking about that your dog had trouble with yeah, it is similar to the frogs that they had on LA law

[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.000]
Last month I don't watch LA law

[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.560]
They had these frogs that's mostly lick the frog and you get a high off of it. Oh really? Yeah

[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.240]
Or your kiss the frog and you turn into a princess

[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.300]
Which I think I may have done some time along the way

[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.620]
Well listen have a great day and good luck to you. Let me know where you land. Thank you

[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:36.520]
Okay, okay

[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:42.000]
Now she's got a real dilemma there. Maybe there are people in here for the chamber of commerce for various parts of this god for saken town

[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.460]
I'd like to call input a big pitch in for I can't imagine where the answer is

[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.600]

Not since I've been back from Houston people in the business remember but fortunately for me the public has a short memory

[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.300]
Say what about that guy you flattened is he still in a coma?

[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.840]
Yeah, still in a coma. I'm so glad you brought that up, Sal not

[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:39.020]

As you know the insane who's saying gosh can I turn an original phrase or what yes poison gas but as I squat over Baghdad

[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.680]
That's not so late

[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.840]
I'll give him a gas of my own hot air out of both ends

[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.360]
Oh

[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.460]
Hussein today said

[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:12.720]
You might know the secret weapon the Americans have the 40 foot colossal news anchor with the chopped lips squatting over my country with a smelly gas

[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:18.020]
My troops are all fleeing but for me I ran but I couldn't hide

[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:24.200]
Well, that's all the time we have for today party on sale party on Rick. I'll sit in squats. Are you worried? Not

[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.400]
Rick over our rack for Channel 7 news

[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.680]
Okay 1151

[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.580]
W.I.D. hadn't heard that in a long time you know that rick sanchez stuff it just delivers forever

[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:40.020]
It never dies out because he still is what he always has been we have an open line in dates

[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:44.900]
7519 463 see I get tired of people not just in this business, but in general

[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.740]
Suck it around with everybody, you know mr. Gladhand

[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:51.880]
I'm not saying that you necessarily have to rip people, but why do they just kiss each?

[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.560]
On the starline

[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.840]
Well, I'm not in Delray

[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.560]
More on them all the way up to West Palm well congratulations

[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.120]
I have so many things to say to you that I don't even know where to go. Well, you got a lot of time

[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.520]
Just take your time

[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:09.280]
You might want to cut this off because I don't know if you're still selling snapple. Yes

[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.700]
Well, I want you to know that because of you

[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:17.540]
I was in the convenience store and it was a hot day and I bought one of those cranberry ice tea you were rating about yeah

[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:21.200]
And now on the dictus great. I love it. Well, that's good

[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:26.760]
And I think you see the impact I have on this audience. I sure hope our sales department is listening back there

[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.800]
Oh, I hope so too and then about the

[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.020]
All over this state tremble at the sound of my voice

[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.000]
Especially up in a front office

[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:41.680]
We get read exactly well. We got plenty of cases around this joint cases of snapple. I know about the other case right

[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:48.540]
Secondly, I think you've inspired me to remind the audience of something very important that we should do for quarter hour maintenance

[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:59.040]
It's a Jupiter go ahead. Okay, uh, you finally hit the nail on the head with there's no place to go and there's no place to hide

[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:07.720]
And if you want a live in day county you either accept it or you go back to wherever was most of the people here came from

[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.040]
Yeah, somewhere else

[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:18.440]
Well, I know I get oh there's Madonna like a virgin where right on MTV? Oh, she's such a jerk. She is

[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:25.380]
She's a great business woman. I give her that but aside from that all this other about her intellectual honesty

[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:30.240]
And that's a bunch of crap. She just peddling whatever she can make a buck on. Okay, that's all it's all about

[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.400]
That's absolutely right. There's nothing wrong with that

[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.960]
But don't try to pretend that it's something other than what it is that guy was pathetic

[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:40.960]
The other thing I want to ask about at the risk of you calling me a dumb rod

[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:42.100]
um

[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:48.220]
I tried to remember remember the guy that called you up about the Minnesota North Stars

[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.980]
The $75 bad yeah, the guy that called us about 400 times about that right. Oh, I

[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.060]
Didn't hear him for at least at least if they win no

[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.200]
They lost yes, man, they got

[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:04.860]
Very very and they were almost one well almost don't cut except in portions

[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:10.460]
Because of the $3,000 no, I wasn't rooting for him because you got to be a chronic pest

[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:12.040]
Well, see I'm

[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:16.600]
Worse during the day and when I'm on appointments and I'm in with a client. I can't have my radio

[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.560]
He'll develop a little humility now. Oh, maybe will

[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.880]
Yeah, you're a bit well. That's what they say

[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:27.420]
The other thing all of a say there were four things oh

[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.180]
um

[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:34.660]
I just want to remind the audience that when you talk about all of the people down here

[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:38.980]
Madonna's got three things. She's got her hand on one of them right now. Now what is it pay attention?

[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:39.840]
I'm listening

[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:48.780]
I can handle it when you talk about the people down here negatively. Yes. I just wanted to remind your audience that

[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:54.480]
75 to 80% of all the people down here came from somewhere else

[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:58.140]
Well, what does that prove it doesn't make any difference? I mean, you know, this is still reality

[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.000]
This is what we are no matter where they all came from. This is what we got

[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.160]
But they're not natives. So what does that mean? They're plenty there are plenty of natives who are much a Yahoo

[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:11.280]
Hillbilly redneck douchebags too. Okay, don't don't come on like all the natives are such great people some are

[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.200]
Like any other group of people some of more and some of mate

[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:21.880]
Well, the ones who've been here for as long as I've been here used to be real friendly and used to be a great town. Oh, I'm sorry. No question about

[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:25.840]
I still think it's the greatest place

[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:31.240]
Well, you're entitled to that opinion and the guy thought Madonna was the greatest thing too. So

[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.140]
What goes around comes around? Well, that's true. That's true. I have to give you

[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.440]
That's good. Well have a great time

[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:44.160]
I'm going to and I'm almost out of range anyway and love to listen to your show

[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:48.840]
Thanks, have a good one. You always put a smile on my face. Well, thank god for that

[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:56.640]

[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:37.160]
including that big fat Richard just waddled out of here and I her nose looks fine. Don't you think so

[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:40.340]
George thinks your nose looks great and I do too it

[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:50.060]
Kill that stupid bastard. Well, yeah, with those long rejoins that go on and they know what station they're listening to even the van lady knows what station

[00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:53.520]
It is I see how I put you at the top of the list because you're my neighbor

[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.240]
I know it's wonderful and a wonderful neighbor who puts all these gigantic signs up on her

[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:04.540]
I know I want to use tributes and put baseball up at my computers down. Oh, so I can't do it

[00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.260]
But I don't want to get my hopes up

[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:13.220]
But anyway, what about those frogs? What are we going to do about those frogs? I know you do you hire one of the neighborhood boys

[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.720]
What they do I hire one of the neighborhood boys? I think that's a bad start to this conversation

[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.480]
All right, you don't mean like the one who lives next door to you do you?

[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.220]
Well, there's about three of them four of them over there. Yeah

[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.560]
One that drives the CRX or whatever that is never mind. I know what you're talking about

[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.160]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:35.420]
Hey, listen, that's a great family there. Now that's an all-American family. They should have a TV show

[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:40.040]
Pattern after that family. I see out. Am I right? They are the family

[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.800]
They're the definitive. There's something in that family. For they're all doing cars in the driveway there

[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:48.760]
That's the definitive American down-home family. They're great people

[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:55.420]
But you get someone rather than a neighborhood boy then yeah, and you a neighborhood old man

[00:57:55.420 --> 00:58:00.140]
No, no at night you get this kid to put on gloves and go out with a flashlight in the bag

[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:05.160]
You freeze the frogs in the light of the flashlight pick them up put them in the bag and then dump them in a field

[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.600]
No, freeze was the operative word you put them in a bag put them in a freezer

[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.100]
And you sell them for frogs legs

[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.320]
Well, there you go if you want to do that, but you can't you freeze them with a light

[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.940]
Because I hear those are pretty valuable. That's what I've been told

[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.020]
Toad

[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:20.960]
also

[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:27.380]
You know what about the size of our mosquitoes in our neighborhood this year hey listen quick complain

[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:31.520]
Oh, no listen, have you caught any you live in the Everglades? I understand

[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:34.860]
But this is my second year in that house and last year they were they were bad

[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:38.300]
But this year that the size of moths I haven't seen a mosquito like that

[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:43.200]
This is bad this year, but you know what last insect I saw that big was mark hybnic from our sales department

[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:50.280]
If you go out have to go out in the evening now listen to me because I bet Rick didn't tell you that the VM lady was also an Ava on lady

[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:54.060]
No, but I am so if you need skin cells I'll put a note my mail. Oh, great

[00:58:54.060 --> 00:59:00.660]
But listen if you go out in the evening and you have to be out by the way Rick is our mailman for the benefit of the audience and who comes the

[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:01.940]
Boogie board spot. I'm sorry

[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:06.940]
You use the same spray on yourself to skin cells off keeps mosquitoes away. Oh really?

[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:10.480]
I hate I'm telling you I get a mosquito in the house at night when I go to bed

[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:14.840]
I will not go maybe they sound childish, but I don't want to wake up like a big welt in the morning

[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:20.540]
Okay, and I turn at light on and the dogs are helpful because they like look around and they the big dog

[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:23.120]
He catches him in his mouth. I've never seen anything like it in my life

[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:26.240]
And I'll finally sooner or later they get on the ceiling the mosquitoes

[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.880]
I mean sooner or later they got to land somewhere and when you see him there and the for you get the spray first of all

[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:35.200]
And you spray and you douse him with about 20 gallons of that stuff because they've developed this

[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:40.220]
immunity to it and then you just swat him and you know and then then I'll go to bed

[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:44.560]
But if I hear him buzzing around man, that's it for me. I got to get I will not rest until I kill the sucker

[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:49.040]
Okay, but if you have to go outside you can put that skin cells sprayed on your arms and legs

[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.820]
I use it all the time at the boy. All right, so we do we get the guy from the house over there with the CRX

[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:57.080]
We get him with the gloves on outside my house at night. Yeah, that's Chad

[00:59:58.180 --> 00:59:59.700]
Chad's is that his name? Oh

[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.340]
He hides every time I drive by there. He like rolls down behind a current high. Hey

[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.720]
No, it's just because you're on the roof waving

[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.520]
It's just a joke

[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:13.920]
But and they go out with the gloves and they grab the frog with a spotlight on them

[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.700]
They won't jump and you put them in a bag. You know the see the more

[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:20.720]
They're in my front yard much more than the back they're in front all over the place

[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:26.120]
And I never really felt that they were the bullfold things because they've been there ever since I've been there millions of them

[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.440]
And my dogs never had a problem

[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:34.220]
But I don't know what they do go out back. That's the point and all of a sudden last

[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.800]
night evidently one got in the backyard

[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.980]
Well one's not too bad, you know

[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:42.280]
Well, yeah, but I mean where there's one there's more it's like mosquitoes when there's one buzzing around

[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.220]
You've got to it's like when you look on your dogs back to get fleas and you find one you know

[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.580]
There's a hundred when you find one yeah, we'll just grab the one frog and talk to them over the fence

[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.540]
Over the fence so we can come back underneath that thing

[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.920]
Oh, I don't want to talk about the fence that's um, I know

[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.400]
See now now that we got that lake that develops every time it rains hard now

[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.500]
It's the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes and attracting the frogs

[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.940]
It's just perfect. I think I'd assume the city of plantation. Oh, I wish you would they just made me hook up order

[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:11.080]
Oh, boy, how did you make out with your dish by the way? Do you ever put it up or is it still sit?

[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.740]
Are you are you serious? We were gonna hide it

[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.480]
No, you can't hide it you got to get a permit

[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.520]

Yeah, the other day had a great ride about as much class as Madonna's armpits

[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.180]

Can't stand him now some of the van Halen music was great. Okay, but David Lee Roth by himself or like just period

[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.820]
Another legend in his own mind. God. He's just

[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:39.240]
Grotesque and obnoxious and arrogant and egotistical and rich

[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.980]

[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.240]
Yeah, mostly the thing with van Halen's I like listening to their music

[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.980]
But if you see the videos you have to see him and that just I can't deal with him

[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:27.180]
He's just such a jerk and then he did that thing Dave TV and he just thinks he's like the hottest stuff on earth

I know it. I know it. I'm not letting you down. Yeah, absolutely not you never do. Yeah

[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:17.420]
No further fucking

[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:26.400]
Geez bad laughs sir you just lost 20 points on his call with that laugh that forced laugh now. What was it?

[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.420]
As far as promotion goes you can't complain about ours because we don't have any absolutely

[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:36.880]
You know I first found you by accident. I'm sure that's right. I was listening

[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.060]
I was waiting to listen to sports talk on w i o d and you were doing two

[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.620]
Two to six on wins at that time

[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:50.280]
And so there wasn't any of the six I was doing ten to two on wins

[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.900]
No, there was a time you were doing two to six on win wrong

[01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:00.560]
I never did two to six on win stand major did two to six. I was doing ten to two way back way way way back

[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.780]
Well way way back I was doing eight to midnight on wins

[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:10.360]
I never did two to six now somehow I heard you and you were you were on right before sports talk came on

[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:14.520]
W I O D well, I may have been filling in one day or something, but I didn't do two to six well

[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:21.460]
That's how I caught you anyway in any case in any event. Yeah, right. That's how I got you and I've been listening every since

[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.460]
But in other words, you knew I was coming over here. Oh, yeah

[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:29.300]
Because there are thousands of neo-rodgers listeners who still don't know two and a half years later than I'm on

[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:31.880]
W i o d because the powers that be here are um

[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:38.700]
Then barris by oh well listen George Jim Hobbs from sales just walked down the hall with the cup coffee of a cup in his hand

[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:43.180]
Would you give him this cassette that I did special for someone of his brother-in-law or brother or somebody up?

[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.720]
Because I'm gonna forget to give it to him before I leave when he wasn't here this morning

[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.820]
Thank you George

[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:51.940]
Just George just runs around here. You didn't get payday thing you runs all over the building like a lackey and we feed him a little salad

[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:52.820]

[01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:01.200]

Sleepy time

[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.060]
But it's worth but you're right it is just getting out of here for a couple of days is always good though

[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:21.980]
You're right. It's you're right actually that's right. It's better than just hanging around here right and uh, you know

[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.720]
We'll spend a couple of nights and

[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.880]
Hang around Santa Belmeans kept you it's pretty nice. Have you ever been out there? Oh, yeah, it's real exciting

[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.240]

Yeah, I never have as soon as they find out he'll be back on the phone

[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.020]
He'll be back. He see one thing about him. He calls sparingly

[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:56.080]
He leaves you wanting more. Okay. He's not one of these people are calls like every day like Bonnie from Kendall

[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:00.280]
God, I haven't heard him the last time I heard him when the bird was still there

[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:06.400]
Nah, come on. He calls every now and then when he's expected well, listen to her in closing

[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.320]
All right, now boy. Take it. See you

[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:17.280]
There's old deaf leopard on there. We're doing a little play by play on the uh, there's a little torture scene with deaf leopard on MTV for those of you are at work and can't see

[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.300]
As palm on a deadline

[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:24.080]
How is that possible sir? I'm gonna reverse the charges. That's why what do you mean you're gonna?

[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:30.380]
You want to stop it? Anyway, I was calling yesterday. It's a little late now sir. Yeah, just ask George

[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:34.860]
He'll send you a check in the next round. I'll call for my place anyways. Okay. That's good. That's a way to do it

[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:39.900]
Yeah, anyway, you're calling about the leak about baseball team the leak

[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:45.140]
Well, didn't a couple days before that did you read the article in newspaper a boo about

[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:49.380]
Style and hunting or purchasing that 12 story office building no

[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:53.500]
Well, when I read what is that noise on this phone? Do you hear that?

[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.840]
I had no idea. Oh, it stopped. Okay. Go ahead

[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:03.260]
Yeah, because they purchase a 12 story office building downtown. So I figured I've entered their Los Olas

[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:08.620]
Place and I know it didn't do that just to keep blockbuster and they needed that for the right then

[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.280]
I just store an old videotape up there

[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:14.640]
We got it sir. It's in we're in it's in the bag. I know

[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.420]
Anyway, I'm calling because

[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:21.640]
Did you hear the story about that song or touch myself? Did you hear the story behind that? No

[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:26.600]
What is that noise now? I'm hearing all this rattling. I mean, I know. No, it's that but before you touch that mic

[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.960]
Is somebody rattling your cage over there sir? Not here. Okay

[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:35.780]
What's the story anyway? I saw it in the inner. Oh, it's the shortness mic court

[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:40.280]
Can we get a new mic court in here? Maybe after two and a half years that doesn't have a shortness

[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:44.900]
So every time somebody moves around it clunks like some kind of a light bulb radio station

[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.880]
God almighty. You think we're asking for the moan here. Go ahead, sir

[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.720]
That's right. What up? Please? What up? Please

[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:59.180]
No, it's just frustrating because the you know, they think everything listen to that only have to was breathing the stamp thing now is clonking this

[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:01.060]
Mic cord's got a big shorten it

[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.740]
I'd listen to that

[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.240]
Go ahead. Oh, yeah

[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.700]
Are we set?

[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:14.120]
Why? All right, well, what I was telling me about is the story behind why they wrote that song and I touched myself

[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.260]
Because I can picture it happening down like a hollandale easily

[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:25.140]
Hold on a second hold on. Maybe it's on his end, but there is a shortness mic court. He's got a noise coming out of his end

[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.600]
Oh, that's what it was because it was too regular

[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:36.980]
I think there's a short it's it's the the jack is coming to lose. Oh, geez. Yeah, kind of droops when it was at the bottom

[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:41.940]
It's big enough. Yeah, okay. Now. What were you saying? I was saying it. I can easily picture just the happening

[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:45.520]
I counted hollandale what happened with this head was they were sitting at a

[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:51.340]
Place is talking about the shows and stuff and they look next to you got an annoying thing on your end, sir

[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.140]
You're something loose. There's something loose on your end. How about home? I'll change to a portable phone

[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:59.820]
No, that's okay. We kind of getting used to it now. Okay. Go ahead. We're just hanging there

[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:05.080]
There was these five old bats like eavesdropping on them and she picked it up and she said well

[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.620]
She's gonna start making up a story about like the lyrics so they have some funny to tell their nursing home people

[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:17.840]
And they said like they're like stretching out trying to hear what they're stretching one out their head. They're trying to eavesdropping stretching out their heads

[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.280]
They were eavesdropping trying to find out what the symees twins said on

[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.620]
John Rivers yesterday about two heads are better go ahead. I'm sorry. That's all right

[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:33.920]
So anyway when they let where the hell is that card when they left the oh my god look at that somebody stuck it way back up there

[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.520]
Do you know as they can never go any place without a tie

[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.080]
Okay, now we can continue yeah

[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:50.660]
Currie it up because this this phonyers is driving me nuts. I'm starting to get saying vitus dance just from listening to it

[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:55.600]
Yeah, I don't know what's wrong because I know what's the story they were doing this and doing that and what happened

[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:00.240]
Well, when they left the thing they were laughing about how they made up that whole story so these old people could

[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:06.140]
Could hear and they said well why don't we write a song about it and that's why they wrote the song will I be damned

[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:11.320]
That's what they said okay, well, I'll tell you sure was worth putting up with all that noise to hear that story

[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.000]
Have a great day sir. Don't call us ever again. Now. What is it? Oh?

[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:19.440]
I just came in to say hi and clear up any questions that you may have about some things that are going on

[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.260]
I freaking pontificating this morning and

[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:28.700]
I'll say to say feel much better now. Well that happened to me because of that constant banging on that phone

[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.660]
My innards were like clopped around from here in that same here god was getting seasick there for a while

[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:38.840]
Do we have to hear about your knighted algal goldstein's house? I don't want to hear a name dropping

[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.600]

[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:52.240]
Did he really yeah, mm-hmm and he just said you're saying I come here. I want to rip that off

[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:54.780]
He's not that skinny yet

[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280]

[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:13.440]
And the weight loss too. Okay now you're doing these he is he's got a real problem though as far as

[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.880]
He can't quit ordering out if he's like got catalogitis

[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:21.520]
He's got stereo standing next to stereo suds was in heaven

[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.820]
suds thought when I die I want to go here. I'm serious

[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.480]
TVs on top of TVs everything on see when you have that much money

[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.400]
You just have to find somewhere to spend it exactly too much money

[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:38.880]
If you send some over here in a big paper sack. Yeah, we could take it off his hands and solve the problem for him

[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.540]
Amen. All right now speaking of all the money you guys are making with all these tremendous things you're doing yeah

[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:48.360]
Uh, I got the drift yesterday. I couldn't be wrong, but I got the distinct impression

[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:52.880]
That the sales department once again. I don't want to put words in anybody's mouth, but again

[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:58.720]
Manipulated manipulated and his voice over upon you things that you knew nothing about and there were like kind of a last minute

[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.000]
What the hell are we doing deal? I don't I don't want to put it in those terms, but I think I just said well

[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.420]
We are the saviors of the station when we just put it out. Well, what does it mean now?

[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.080]
Why are you going to be at Atlantis this Friday doing the show from two to six?

[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.240]
Because we won't be here

[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:19.520]
No, that's not an answer. I know I know. I know for them. Why are you going to be there? I what is the scam? What's the reason they're open and

[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.880]
Detail they are. Yeah, and it's a neat place

[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:28.000]
And what are you going to be doing there? Uh the same thing we're doing here. Okay next question on Saturday

[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.040]
I see at the except looking at a lot and I pretty jealous about this

[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:36.500]
Atlantis, you know, I can give her take it depends on who's going down the slide on a shoe department with this

[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.100]
That's what I'm really upset about

[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:40.940]
Because they don't they don't offer me no shoes stores

[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:43.440]
You know, I get to sit out in the hallway a couple of Ridge mall

[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.480]
And you guys get to go to bird eyes in the men's shoe department in day land from 11 to two you bet

[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:53.920]
Do a yard or what are you going to be doing there shoes try them on sniffing around help the exactly

[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.400]
Ha ha ha ha

[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.780]
Tip towing through the tulips

[01:22:58.860 --> 01:22:59.960]
God pretty much

[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:03.300]
What are you going to be doing there? We have people who listen down there who buy shoes

[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.240]
So we figure this would be a good place to meet them

[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:10.520]
Okay, all right, and then of course we got the ball game next Friday, but that's kind of too pedestrian

[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:15.020]
I mean we know what we're going to be doing there. Yeah, and we're going to be out there with you and I'll say you said

[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:19.640]
Waiter and how goldstein will be there a week from Friday. How do you like that? That should be how to deal with him

[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.120]
He had like stacks of tickets to the June 6th deal as he

[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.840]
June 6th what deal the game the miracle game there. I mean stacks of them like he's a ticket vendor

[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:33.620]
I know I know I'm like he made his money some you know do something that's where he's getting the stereo

[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:37.980]
And it sure wasn't him in glory a letter in that porn movie. I'll tell you that nobody bought that

[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:42.820]
Did you ever see that? No, oh believe me. You don't want to want a full stomach listen

[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:46.100]
I saw screw magazine and I thought I got to go to this guy's house

[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.800]
I don't want to hear anymore about how you went to his house. That's all I don't care

[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:52.260]
I

[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:58.720]
Want to go to your house. No, I know you won't invite me for what because I want to go for what I want to come over watch

[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:02.800]
I have a very pedestrian house. I have a very simple house. So does he?

[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:06.200]
I used to have a collatial house in Jack Oran. It was like a palace. Yeah

[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:13.220]
And it was just cost it was just ridiculous. I don't have a $75,000 watch like out goldstein. You believe that thing

[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.800]
Tells the year on it because your father told me his matter of fact

[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.740]
I'm the sales department keeps up with their present trend

[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:25.840]
I'm gonna be living in a quonset hut in Miami. Lakes pretty soon. Well say hi to me. I'll be your neighbor right next to the technical school

[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:29.340]
But I want to go to your house you won't have it invited me over for a game

[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:32.340]
You know something see the audience is gonna take this for real

[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:36.040]
I invite you guys to go to pop it over the track and it's not your house. No listen

[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.460]
People don't keep inviting people repeatedly for things if they just if they give like a

[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:46.800]
An insincere response, okay? It's like Chuck. I said it chucked a couple of weeks ago

[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:49.740]
We got because he was saying I'd like to go to Calder some Sunday

[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:54.880]
Well, I said well, we go out there some Sunday. Okay, great. Okay fat rich will go chuck me you guys come out

[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.480]
Oh, I see you won't go anywhere where you spend any money because your cheap scale let's go

[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:04.660]
Where Sunday where I don't know where we called her is that where you're going? I wasn't going anywhere

[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:11.000]
See you missed construe having it like a date on the calendar something else is being sincere

[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.960]
I'm not making a date with you okay, but no, well, I just had something else to do when you asked me before I wasn't

[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:18.020]
Insincere well, that's what chucked it, but he gave like the next 36 Sundays

[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:24.540]
Well, you didn't offer us that option. Oh get out of here. You're so full of crap. No, I would like to go out of the

[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:29.300]
Right now I've got all the time the world open out except for quarter horses. You don't want to see that well

[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:33.900]
Then let's invite me over for a cubs game. I want to see your satellite dish. I want to see all the stuff you can get

[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:36.060]
I've never seen a dish and then what?

[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:36.940]
There's just

[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.100]
Oh, okay, then I promise

[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.720]
Real fast. See, I don't have a

[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.360]
Frightening so I don't have that Ferrari sitting in the thing anymore like the good old

[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.120]
I wanted to see that see that poor that sitting over in front of Dave's house. Well, all the things I want to see you keep getting rid of

[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:56.260]
I'm getting the hit. Well, that's the reason

[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.840]
In fact, anybody want to buy a dish keep

[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:05.720]
135 at W.I.O.D. I will continue the recap of today's ding dong school right after this

[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.480]
What can't we do because I never get to hear any of this because they won't speak to me

[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.620]
Thank goodness because they're not allowed to speak to me

[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:15.000]
Well actually today was kind of disappointing everything was all right just discussed

[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:16.920]
Atlantis and

[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:22.720]
Deadland more to discuss if you don't know what you're doing there. That's why it was a short meeting. Okay

[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:29.760]
Other than that, you know, it says and we hear about any future hopes for outside promotion like

[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:36.780]
TV spawn or billboards or newspaper. Why was it always a short meeting when that comes up? Okay. Hi, Alia

[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.620]
Hello, yes, sir

[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.260]
My god, I can't believe it

[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.640]
believe it

[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:50.300]
You know you foiled my plan majorly. This is Alba from Surcider eyes and ears from the swap shop

[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:57.140]
And see my girlfriend was down in coconut grove my eyes and ears from the swap shop. Oh, yeah

[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:01.640]
We have high-fight corner stereo shop upstairs. Oh, I got you. Well be more specific if you're gonna

[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:06.080]
Give yourself a plug don't beat around a bushop or just come right out and blurt it out. Oh, there we go

[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:06.900]
Blur it out

[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:17.520]
See you foiled my plan because my girlfriend was in the coconut grove and I'm sitting in front of her house waiting for her

[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:20.920]
And I know sitting in front of her house like on the ground under the tree. How romantic

[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.880]
No in my car

[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:27.960]
It's the air condition and everything my car started over. He knows but I wasn't gonna hang up the phone because I've been trying to get a hold of you

[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:33.480]
So anyway, I knew she'd be listening to you because you know, she's gonna turn me on to you

[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:38.800]
That's unusual. She's the other way around. Yeah, yeah, I know but she did it to me this time and anyway

[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:45.640]
I wanted to tell her you know that I was listening and then I missed her and her to haul ass and get home and all that but

[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:49.620]
Anyway, you got to go check out the new dog show act at the swap shop

[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:53.780]
They're like kind of mixing the aromas now. You got a mixture of the elephant

[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:58.720]
Fantastic and they mixed the sawdust with the a little like two parts elephant one part dog

[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:03.080]
Yeah, you got about 20 little poodles yapping all day long and it does wonders to your nerves

[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.480]
20 little poodles crap it all day long. Oh, yeah, absolutely excellent and any elephants walk around and my favorite

[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:12.840]
Those when the guy comes out with a broom and sweeps it all up in the sawdust to get up in the air like into your lungs

[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.920]
That's the best I just go nuts over that

[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:20.240]
So as if to you know the drop in from the elephant wasn't enough now they got the dog stuff to worry about too

[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.920]
But anyway, so it smells real nice in there

[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:27.160]
And I'm stuck through like four shows a day for Friday Saturday and Sunday

[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:28.820]
Well, that's what this town is all about

[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:31.280]
Absolutely. That's what it's all that's where it's at

[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:37.180]
In fact, we got the swap shop spot coming up in the next break. It's appropriate that you kind of like segwayed into it in a few minutes later

[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:39.480]
Yeah, they had that caller before talking about Santa

[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.540]
Yeah, that's a sleepy town my job. Oh, that's really exciting

[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:47.120]
I have a lot of friends. I know that every time they get a couple of days off or want to get away from the weekend we go to

[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:49.320]
Santa Bel or

[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:57.160]
What's the other Marco Island? Oh, they kept you know kept you but there's another boring terminal boring. It was great

[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.760]
boring. It's nice to be bored once in a while

[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:00.700]
boring

[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:05.480]
So that's a boring sport too. I can't handle that. I like to go scuba diving

[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:10.660]
Take the fish that I want and spear on well. That's what he'd like to do too. Yeah, there you go

[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.280]
But the fish are on land right?

[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.740]
Albert have a nice day. All right. See you

[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:23.520]
That's I guess what too much of that a romable doodium. Well, Cheryl looks really psychotic today. I guess Adam turned her down

[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:30.200]
If you missed the Neil Rogers show yesterday on six ten W I O D you missed this

[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.600]
Is the bird yeah, bird how you doing? Okay?

[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:40.220]
Listen do me a favor play anything because I can't stand listening to you. You start like a douchebag

[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:45.240]
Do what do you mean? If ever play anything? Well, can I ask you a question before you go? Oh god

[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:50.320]
You sound so stupid. I hate to talk to you. Yeah, go ahead. Why did you call me? I didn't call you

[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:54.460]
You're not just to tell you not to say anything just play something

[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:58.500]
Oh god can't stand it. Well then why are you listening?

[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.600]
Something already. Why won't you answer me?

[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:06.580]
Get stand up. You won't see he won't talk to me. Oh, we got a car here. Hello

[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:15.080]
Well, I don't know about you but you shot like some stupid idiotic jerk stupid stupid stupid idiotic jerk

[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.560]
Did you see one of the movies body chemistry?

[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:21.640]
No, no and the other one was overexposed was that it?

[01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:28.980]
You see murder in a high place has anybody seen any movie that's on this I don't get it. I just don't get it

[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:31.440]
I tried to be conversational with these people

[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:36.040]
They always come up with these movies that nobody ever heard of and I mentioned a movie that's like a recent movie

[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:39.340]
It's on all the cable services and it's like what what is that?

[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:45.900]
What is wrong with these people? Do you see murder in high places? No, what's that? That was the movie

[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.520]
I was on Colorado

[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:53.560]
Boy these cigars are just killing me. They're tearing up. I was at papaya by the way. I don't see eat much

[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:57.340]
If I see a cut and slicing and cutting but not eating sunny said to say hi. Oh

[01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:02.140]
What up he wants to know now if you want that salad salad on Tuesday

[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:06.540]
Because he knows you're going to mommy's you tell him to send it over here every day

[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:12.820]
What I told the worst that can happen is the Brooklyn Bridge said the worst that can happen on WKPX

[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:15.800]
Is that we give it to somebody else exactly and they're happy. Yeah

[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:20.740]
And since he already lied through his teeth and said that he'd give one for everybody in a building practically

[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:23.200]
We know that's a bunch of crap because today I wasn't here on remote

[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:27.760]
They took the one back that they had sent over here for me because I wasn't here. So we know it's full of crap

[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:34.120]
Just I don't why is it kind of be such a big deal and you know why it has to be such a big deal because that way it's all this publicity

[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:40.000]
See I don't want to give him publicity because then dennenberg and boy garyney all the rest get upset

[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.460]
I mentioned every day. Thanks for the salad sunny. It's great

[01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:46.600]
That's it. Like flora's we don't give them go through a big

[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:50.460]
soap opera about them when they send food were great were grateful

[01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:52.140]
It's great. We thank them and that's it

[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:56.560]
Exactly and they don't expect anything else because they're not paying for it and he's not either

[01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:05.040]
So he should kiss the ground that a major superstar of my stature is willing to eat his crappy food and talk about it for a second or two

[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:09.700]
And believe me what he's saying here today. I wouldn't feed my dog even after the toad

[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:15.540]
Weak very weak just not up to his usual standards at all

[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.520]
Like a bunch of that shredded carrot. I don't want shredded carrot

[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:24.580]
That's gross. It's like something eat on Purim or something. I don't want that

[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:27.280]
Shredded carrot doesn't stay too crisp too long

[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:30.620]
That and it's just not a question of how it's crisp when it comes out of

[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:32.680]
Ain't crisp. I know that but that's not the point

[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.040]
I don't have my lunch or pre-cooked

[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.860]
It just isn't good. It's just a crap

[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:44.740]
I said to him. I said some of the corny's got great corn no corn today nice big slice of idalia onion not not in there

[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:47.420]
So in other words he's getting evil with me all the stuff

[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:50.940]
I said I like to accept there were three like stale plantains in there little slices right?

[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.120]
I was saying today

[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:55.480]
Well, he's must have been from my stweaker else from the swap shop now

[01:32:55.480 --> 01:33:00.040]
See I'm coming in eight o'clock on Monday morning, which means I'm gonna have to get up about five o'clock and drive through

[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.220]
horrendous traffic to get here, but it'll be worth it to me

[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:07.580]
To meet with these sales clowns back there say hi for us. We are and you know see if it was just

[01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:13.500]
me that I'd say oh cam a pain in the ass and I'm a hard ass, but I know just about everybody in a building shares the same frustration

[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:17.060]
They haven't got any idea what they're doing back there none

[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:24.120]
Zero and like I said yesterday and I stand by the statement more money falls through the cracks in this building in a week

[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:29.120]
Then most people make in a lifetime and I believe that it's just it's amazing. It's astonishing

[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:33.400]
And then they go out of shunning around together like at the fight last night

[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:40.640]
I got a spy report getting plowed and badmouthing all of us me especially and uh, you know, it's we're not it's not a contest here

[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:45.600]
In other words, it's not optional. We're it. We're the station. We're on here. Reneere us. Thank you. Whatever

[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.660]
That's what they got to sell

[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:53.200]
If we're not here, they got monofony records. It can bring back sandy patent. I mean basically that's it

[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.100]
So it's not like it's optional whether they like us or not. That's their job

[01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:00.900]
And do it or get the hell out makes sense to me exactly

[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:05.660]
So

[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:07.900]
Anyway have a good time in the shoe department

[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.120]
It's 151

[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:15.140]
If the food fits where it that's what Johnny dark said

[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:19.600]
Now which one of these should I take oh now is that a collect call on eight

[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:25.000]
That can't be for real. There's no way. Are you sure there is no way? Wait till you see where this call is from

[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:28.220]
Hello, hey, are you for real?

[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:31.600]
This is a call from eintree, Georgia

I know you've been way past what Reynolds doing. How's Ned Bayney doing up there in the woods? Hey

[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:40.700]
That's just that was just a story you know that Neil

So how you doing down there? Hey you wouldn't not believe it, but we pick you up right all the way up here 800 miles away

[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.180]
No, no way. We're big in eintree

[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:52.260]
The highest mountains

[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:58.100]
I can't believe it we do we pick you up don't let John void here about it

[01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:06.960]

They're looking at me like what what is that? Go ahead sir

[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:46.140]
I'm mad as hell and wish I didn't have to take it anymore. Howard be old junior. That's right. I just got back from

[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:51.960]
Getting my driver's license renewed. Yeah, I go up to this place. First of all, I charge did you did you bring your green card? I did

[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:56.460]
That's and the first thing they did was they wanted to charge five dollars extra for a motorcycle endorsement

[01:36:56.460 --> 01:37:00.300]
You know just just five bucks because they needed the money. What do you mean like you're doing

[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:02.580]
Suzuki spots now or something?

[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:07.600]
No, no motorcycle endorsement for a motorcycle license. Oh, I see put on the license. I got

[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:13.920]
Then get up there and take the whole deal and then they said okay, this you're here your license and it's good for four years

[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.320]
And the guy next to me is license was good for six years. Yeah, but you got a ticket. I made a U-turn in 1989

[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:22.320]
Sir, I have the same thing. I got caught on radar

[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:28.120]
I have one ticket in the last like six to six years or something like that and she give me a four-year license because I have a ticket on my right

[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.940]
The whole thing is ridiculous and I said honey take this license and sit on it and do a perpendicular

[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:38.020]
Facelifts and whatever else and she just looked at me and say get there all out of here and don't ever come back

[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:40.460]
You got to go back in four years and pay another 20 bucks. That's right

[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.980]
Another ripoff sir. It's another great Florida ripoff

[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:51.200]
And in the meantime air vehicle alien who just came in on a rubber raft is driving a 57 Chevy up this game boulevard four miles an hour

[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.560]
With the wheels falling off in free gas exactly

[01:37:55.540 --> 01:38:02.120]
And expending a lot too. Well, that's all I had to say. I'm mad at Hill and I wish I didn't have to take it any more

You know they hop around a front door you come home at night

[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:26.980]
And you just let them kind of like hop over your foot and give a little kick and get out of here

[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:29.640]
You know get out of my way and you go in the house and forget about them not anymore

[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.480]
No more rister nice guy

[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:35.660]
The only good frog is a dead frog. I wonder how much those total legs would be worth

[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:37.960]
I got a good idea

[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:43.220]
Well bring him in here and saute him and a little olive oil downstairs and pass him off of the staff his frogs legs

[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.080]
I'll never know the difference

[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.160]
Can you see him all running around here foaming at the mouth

[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:51.360]
Let's feed little to programming to middle and upper level management. All of who would know the difference

[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:55.260]
They're always foaming at the mouth anyway north day. Hey. How you doing? Okay

[01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:01.000]

[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:05.640]
With the dolphins meaning what what do you mean got taken off the field well?

[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:08.660]

[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:10.600]
He's no longer

[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:14.780]
Gonna be practicing for the rest of what he do injure himself doing like a

[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:20.020]
He got tangled up with some other other who is gyrating under the well post got his leg caught on the goal post gyro

[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.100]

[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:34.140]

[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:41.140]
Hello first time caller fantastic and I was wondering when you got off work if you can go down the street and kill the frogs or toads in my yard

[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:44.460]
No, I think I'm gonna be busy in my yard for a long time

[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:50.380]
You know that till I get my toe killing license. I don't think I can do it outside of my house after you got your satellite permit

[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:54.720]
Mm-hmm. Yeah, when you're in plantation you got to get a toe killing permit too. That's $600

[01:39:56.420 --> 01:40:01.260]
For toad my figure it's since one of our other neighbors called I would call to I'm a neighbor of yours too

Because then you can still watch it all the while that they're finagling and haggling

[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.200]
You don't have to worry about waiting until they come and kiss you on the ring

[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.260]

[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:12.720]
