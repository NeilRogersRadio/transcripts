[00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.580]
A chicken farmer went out when dark and windy day

[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.140]
By the crew he rested as he went along his way

[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.060]
Lullin' once a rotten egg hit him in the eye

[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.120]
It was a sight he dreaded

[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.500]
Ghost chickens in this guy

[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.200]
A farmer had raced chickens since he was 24

[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.220]
Working for the colonel for 30 years or more

[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.000]
Killing all those chickens and sending them to fry

[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.540]
Now they want revenge

[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.340]
Ghost chickens in this guy

[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.320]
Everybody come up!

[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.820]
What, what, what, what?

[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.080]
The pigs were black and shiny either as we're burning red

[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.060]
They had no meat or feathers, these chickens were dead

[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.980]
They picked a farmer up and he died by the claw

[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.860]
They cooked a extra crispy meal

[00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.720]
And ate him in close line

[00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.640]
Everybody!

[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.940]
Ghost chickens in this guy

[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.720]
All the chicken all the time

[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.480]
I think chicken describes adequately some of the people call this show today

[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.620]
Here's a fact we just received two Mike Disney

[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.620]
If you think we listen to WIOD for news weather and traffic

[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.940]
Then your IQ is lower than your age

[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.280]
Signed a long time listener

[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.700]
Oh! Yeah! Now we're talking

[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.620]
Now we're getting to the meat of the matter

[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.860]
Lead house point

[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920]

[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.360]

[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620]

[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.760]

[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.860]
guy brings him his order the he's like he's yellow and he's complaining or whatever the guy

[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.460]

[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:38.320]
serial on the floor in the oil I was no was it him was it the bridge tender I was afraid to ask

[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:43.900]
and this guy he looked like he was right homicidal that's the word on blue I have a good day

[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.320]
thanks pal man I wonder if it sounded just like

[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:53.380]
I don't know about you but you sound like some stupid idiotic jerk I shatter before I beat

[00:30:53.380 --> 00:31:01.160]
the crap out of you 20 after one at WIO Miami yeah hey how's going it's going okay I was wondering

[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:06.660]
if you were able to see the um planetary alignment over the weekend the I was watching some ballgame

[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.300]
and they were showing like mercury right on top of Uranus I mean they were like right next to

[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:15.140]
each other right right well I don't know I don't think the weather was that um do you think that

[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.980]
explains the behavior of the people today perhaps well could have something to do with it maybe

[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.660]
somebody broke their thermometer in hell and there because I always hear these astrologers

[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:28.760]
astrologers saying like mercury is in Uranus right right which ought to be painful I would think

[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.020]
well anyway I was going to give some advice to some people who might have had some trouble

[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:40.220]
with the telescope like we did yeah well there's a small grass refructor on the inside of it

[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:46.760]
right by the eyepiece and the thing is we're working well we're reaching rivals from Boston here

[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:51.320]
and go to school it up are you uh thing is real oh you've got a telescope over there I

[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.740]
you're probably like looking through the dorm windows across the way I know right right right so

[00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.300]
what you see anything good yeah well anyway we're looking through it we can't see anything come

[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:05.340]
to find out you have to take apart the inside piece right near the eyepiece and there's a small

[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:10.520]
grass refructor there uh-huh and that came loose from the um from the glue that was holding it together

[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:17.200]
and um this well you know it's uh it could it could happen so in other words it's like an

[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:22.180]
instructional call today I say anybody else has the same bad experience exactly you know it's uh I

[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.620]
mean when you're really desperate and you've got it aimed just at the right window where you know

[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.200]
there's always something really hot going on and then all of a sudden you can't see a damn thing

[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.900]
right okay I see where you're coming from yeah have a good day well wait a minute wait a minute

[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.160]
it was that like a nervous affair well like we finally discovered why you're in and no but nobody

[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:44.020]
just runs around with a telescope well we we had brought it because of the um alignment

[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:48.360]
here you know I know the alignment you wanted to see which one was on top okay right well it only

[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.320]
happens every hundred yes you know huh it only happens every 120 years right that's what a lot of

those are the three teams we can beat every now and then yeah that's it oh is up there last

[00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:02.480]
week it really feels so the um other cubs take two out of three from the giant yeah so what a

[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.480]
what a fantastic place where we feel a lot of fun see that's the thing people don't understand

[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:12.040]
even when we get the crap knocked out of us which is often it's still fun and people here can't

[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:17.040]
relate to that I mean I mean my team right the giants were losing it and actually we had a great time

[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:28.760]
just a fantastic place to drive way back my beyond the hood this first career hall

[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:34.140]
see and we lost the game but it was exciting oh then to add to it we had dinner at the night

[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:39.660]
at the night of Tuesday at Harry Curie's restaurant and two tables away who should be there but

[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:45.100]
the great man himself yeah he's spent a lot of time there and he was as the evening went on he

[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:50.440]
was well into his his his bedwizer more and more and more and more and he becomes rudder and

[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.140]
redder it was an interesting phenomenon yeah and um it was just really interesting by the way

[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.140]
somebody I think had called yesterday about going up there they they don't take reservations

[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:04.220]
unless you have a group of eight I believe so if you if you go there when you're there anybody else

[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.500]
if you don't take a large group uh we went there around eight o'clock and and they told us that

[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.900]
the front of two hour wait they got us in about an hour and ten minutes yeah there there are a

[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:17.380]
I would don't want to generalize but a lot of the really good restaurants like scusies up there

[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.940]
they're really a tiny restaurant they don't take reservations and usually have to wait about an hour

[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.640]
it's yeah and it's worth it though yeah no you know you're on an hour's worth of memorabilia

[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:29.640]
on the walls all the different photos and I'll tell you another restaurant I love is the palm down

[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:34.560]
there right on the lake sure boy that palm is great steaks and lobster yeah yeah um well we had a

[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.860]
great time and told that you have a great time when you go up there and uh I guess I maybe the

[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.900]
giants will will be able to well maybe they'll finish 500 at best but like you say the bottom

[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.960]
line is it doesn't really matter if they win or lose it's just just having a great time it's going
