[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120]
It's going to work you at a state.

[00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.440]
Well, geez, you better make a few calls call the ex caliber and call the start us and call the

[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]
Fair to little world.

[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.820]
Yeah, so what motivated you today?

[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.060]
Well, actually I'm going to Las Vegas next week and I thought you might be able to tell me a couple of things.

[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.260]
What? Huh?

[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.480]
It'd be nice without it.

[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.920]
No, but I mean I have to.

[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.900]
Have you never been there before?

[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.740]
No, not at all.

[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.540]
Where are you going to stay?

[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.120]
I'm not really sure.

[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.200]
I think we're going to stay at the holiday royal.

[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.180]
The holiday royal?

[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.900]
Yeah, some people play for me.

[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.840]
Well, I can motel six with Tom Bo-Det.

[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.820]
I think that's it.

[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.020]
Why?

[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.940]
Well, you better watch out because Tom hangs out under the bed and it was places.

[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.660]
That could be fun.

[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.220]
Are you sure that's the name of it?

[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.180]
The holiday in royal?

[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.840]
Uh-huh.

[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.760]
I don't know what that is.

[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.700]
But I got news for you no matter where you stay.

[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.620]
Even if it's a feedback, you're going to have a great time.

[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.720]
You're going to rent a car, aren't you?

[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.120]
Yeah.

[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.540]
Well, that's all you need.

[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.620]
I don't have to tell you anything because everywhere you go, it's going to be great.

[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.180]
You'll go to the Mirage and Seas here next caliber and the Stardust and Palastation and the Tropicana.

[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.520]
And you just eat all of a phase and gamble your guts and guts out and see if you show us.

[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.280]
Have a great time.

[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.540]
You'll feel that you've never even been born before this.

[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.420]
You just look at a mirror wonder what you've wasted your life doing here.

[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.040]
I'm telling you.

[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.160]
What about these shows, can you recommend me?

[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.160]
Well, I don't know who's playing out there, but I mean they have a, in the lobby of all the hotels you'll have like a, or in your room even.

[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.700]
Uh-huh.

[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.000]
They have these, they just, no, seriously, and they, you know, booklets and they show you like all the stuff and who's playing when and that's it.

[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.040]
Oh, excellent.

[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.580]
Yeah.

[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.360]
Okay, well, think for what?

[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.640]
You're going to have a great time.

[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.220]
Okay, and all the stuff that can't even walk.

[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.320]
Well, you want a full report when you get back? When you're going?

[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.840]
Uh, next study.

[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.140]
And you're coming back when?

[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.200]
Uh, the following Sunday.

[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.440]
Same for Monday.

[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.860]
Okay, well, the Monday after that, was nine days.

[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.300]
You may not want to come back.

[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.800]
No, not where Florida is.

[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.700]
Oh, man, well listen, we want a full report the Monday when you get back, okay?

[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.220]
Okay, great.

[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.900]
We're going to mark it on our thing and expect it.

[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.320]
Okay.

[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.040]
Have a great time.

[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.920]
Bye, guys.

[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.220]
Thank God she didn't get cut off.

[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.820]
Can you imagine all the great calls that we've had get cut off over these three years on that clicking line?

[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.060]
Probably the best calls we ever get coming on that line they never make the air.

[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.100]
That's why some days the show suck on this station.

[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.920]
The good calls never get through.

[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.020]
Back in the early days before I realized that they don't give a crap about anything here.

[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.780]
I used to just carry on about that thing.

[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.680]
There's something wrong with it.

[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.280]
Oh, no, there's not a wrong with that line.

[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.560]
Southern belt checked it out.

[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.980]
Now, even people who've been in the building for five minutes.

[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.080]
I mean, even listeners, people who have casually listened to this station know that line six and browored the clicking line is screwed up.

[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.420]
Even sud knows it and you don't give a crap.

[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.100]
It's screwed up.

[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.700]
Oh, no, there's no problem.

[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.740]
We checked it out with a fork.

[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.480]
But of course they're going to tell you there's no problem because if they admit there's a problem then they've got to fix it.

[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.720]
And they don't know how to do that.

[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.120]
That might take some work.

[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.100]
They might have to face somebody some overtime.

[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.760]
God forbid.

[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.540]
So I imagine that the best calls that ever come into this radio station are on line six and you never get to hear them.

[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.580]
Man, I'll tell you what we're going to do is we'll have somebody else talk to them off the air like whether or not you just before they get cut off.

[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.860]
And then we'll tape it.

[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.560]
Yeah, Alex can talk to him off the air.

[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.020]
Real loud like he talks in here.

[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.100]
He keeps pressing that inner comedy.

[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.540]
He doesn't have any idea how loud it isn't here.

[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.920]
I mean, can I ask you a stupid question?

[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.640]
What's the video where the guy sitting eating the pizza and the the Marlin jumps through the window?

[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.680]
This is on every 10 minutes.

[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.840]
Do you know what that is?

[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.680]
The guy sitting there eating slices of pepperoni pizza.

[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.360]
There he is now.

[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.140]
Make a statement.

[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.880]
Or is that a spot?

[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.520]
Well, that's a spot.

[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.940]
I thought it was a video because it's on like intro spec.

[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.960]
Make a statement.

[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.640]
Look at that.

[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.580]
He was making a statement all right.

[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.200]
And that was his mouth either.

[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.040]
Okay, we better move right along, boy, while I check that a lot closer.

[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.060]
It's 135 at WIOD or plastic station.

[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.360]
The Roger.

[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.560]
That's my one.

[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.900]
Pretty at WIOD.

[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.020]
Let's go to a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.240]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.780]
Okay.

[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.980]
Good show today.

[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.040]
Outstanding.

[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.280]
I would say I know a scale of eight.

[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.480]
I'd give it about a 45.

[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.700]
But then what do I know?

[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.960]
Because the cops didn't do it yesterday today.

[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.100]
We're doing it every day.

[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.480]
Good.

[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.080]
We may not be good, but we're consistent.

[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.620]
Well, I have a comment about...

[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.960]
Don't think the suck wants in a while, but when you can do it every day, then you've got a life.

[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.040]
You're right.

[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.240]
They are consistent, aren't they?

[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.460]
Yeah.

[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.260]
All right.

[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.520]
I have a comment up the Rick and Sud show.

[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.020]
Okay.

[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.960]
They can handle it.

[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.180]
Well...

[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.880]
That's sitting in there right now with the spoon and his canola.

[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.640]
He can handle it.

[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.160]
It sure does seem that people are awful or gistom-ly.

[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.840]
I don't know what that was.

[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.400]
Yeah, what that was wrong, all of a sudden.

[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.520]
It's like...

[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.080]
See, this radio station, there's something foul in the air with this...

[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.960]
I have never worked anywhere where the audience turns.

[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.900]
I mean, just like on the same day, like they all woke up on the same day, they had like a meeting.

[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.400]
And they decided, okay, it was fun for a while, but now let's turn on this one.

[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.300]
Let's try...

[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.960]
You know, like...

[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.020]
I'm sure we'll be glad to bring Alex Bennett back for five minutes.

[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.900]
Just a good refresher course that boy, they'll be screaming for Rick and Suds.

[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.980]
Well, I remember a while back when they were kind of stuck in there by up there.

[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.460]
Now they've got a contract, but now I don't know.

[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.680]
Maybe they're getting a little too cocky.

[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.920]
I like to listen to them, but...

[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.000]
Are they getting a little cocky?

[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.300]
Yeah, I've noticed that. They are going to, especially Rick Riley, he's getting real cocky lately.

[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.440]
Yeah, if he just eye out of this, I'll tell you what.

[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.360]
Well, maybe I can take the pressure off, because I don't want to sit on the air,

[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.200]
because I don't like to get all this personal stuff, but I'm getting a divorce too.

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.160]
Well, you got to the best around all of you, so just hang in there.

[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.240]
That happens to all of them.

[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.420]
And I hope the cops do it again today.

[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.760]
Okay, thanks.

[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.740]
We're not playing today, so we'll be a good day today.

[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.000]
Well, hey, nothing lasts forever, Tweety.

[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.000]
We have an open line in Broward, 5249-463.

[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.760]
I just don't know what this...

[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.720]
And then like this book, I never even saw the whole book, so I'm not going to look at Arvertron ever again,

[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.500]
or just pull a crap.

[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:09.420]
But, like, you know, is there anybody out there who really believes that the lowest number of listeners on this station are between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m.?

[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.880]
And if you do, let me ask you this question.

[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.640]
Have you ever listened before 10 a.m. and after 6 p.m.?

[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.880]
I think that speaks for itself.

[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.620]
And how about on the weekend?

[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.740]
Has anybody ever listened on the weekend?

[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.180]
Oh, that's a stupid question.

[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.360]
We don't have enough time to search for those people.

[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.920]
Right, Meg?

[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.120]
Well, we got the plant guy.

[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.080]
And we got Meg, and we got ball games.

[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.200]
We got any kind of crap we can throw on to fill up some time, because we don't have any...

[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.840]
We just don't have anybody to throw on there.

[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.700]
That you might be entertaining or attracting audience under the age of 500.

[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.680]
Right, Dave?

[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.220]
Miami Airport.

[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.280]
Good afternoon.

[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.160]
When is this?

[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.100]
Barbed loads.

[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.700]
Yeah.

[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.740]
Plain loads.

[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.680]
I got a fire report.

[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.100]
Okay.

[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.200]
Driving west down on the...

[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.620]
49th V-Coswave.

[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.300]

[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.840]
I saw Sky 1, Sky 2, Sky 3 hovering over the W.O.D. tower.

[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.440]
Yeah.

[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.660]
Well, I'll slip a giant tandem over it.

[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.940]
Boy, does he have a lot of hits by...

[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.900]
That's where they call him, the safe station for the 90s.

[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.160]
Right.

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.980]
Exactly.

[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.340]
And that's the purpose of that.

[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.140]
It's the muffler, all the profanity that goes over the air, so that the old geese don't get offended.

[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.540]
Right.

[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.140]
Well, as a matter of fact, we have a whole new...

[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.540]
It's amazing.

[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.060]
You must be like a super spy because we have a whole new billboard campaign.

[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.900]
That's right.

[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.780]
And it's going to be like a...

[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.340]
A reneerie head is going to be on there with a gigantic condom over it, it's going to say 6, 10, safe radio.

[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.440]
Yeah, well, it's not going to work.

[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.900]
You know why?

[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.700]
That safe campaign?

[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.340]
Yeah.

[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.440]
Because they don't come any better than the O'Rodges.

[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.520]
Have a great life, sir.

[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.140]
You too, sir.

[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.640]
See ya.

[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.120]
He just...

[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.360]
I'm not the superstar, sir.

[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.100]
Hi, this is Larry King, and they don't come any better than the O'Rodges.

[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.160]
That's a boy, Larry.

[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.740]
143 at WIOD.

[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.140]
Is anybody ever seen Larry and Dracula together in the same...

[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.300]
Crypt...

[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.640]
Pompano.

[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.180]
Deal.

[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:02.860]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.580]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.400]
I'm doing okay.

[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.040]
Just the first time caller.

[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.560]
And how is it so far?

[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.460]
Great.

[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:15.340]
I just want to let you know that I'm going to school for electronic technician right now.

[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.860]
Are we just recently started getting the AM radio?

[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.520]
And I haven't listened in a minute.

[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:19.940]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.200]
Wait a minute.

[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.900]
You just started picking up AM radio?

[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.560]
No, no.

[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:28.880]
I just started doing some experiments on it and troubleshooting and stuff like that.

[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.160]
Just getting into it.

[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.220]
Ah-ha.

[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.000]
So in other words, you want to be an AM radio engineer, is that it?

[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.360]
Not necessarily.

[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.360]
That's just part of it.

[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.340]
In order to do that, you have to be like a little whacked.

[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.940]
You do understand that.

[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:40.880]
Of course, yeah.

[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.620]
I definitely fall in love.

[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.140]
Because I've never met an engineer in my life who wasn't like it and have several bricks in the wrong spots.

[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:48.860]
Believe me.

[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:56.840]
Well, what I wanted to say was I listened to you years ago when I was a child back when you were with the big Z word, you know what I mean?

[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:57.440]
Zeta.

[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.000]
Yep.

[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.660]
Well, what do you mean years ago that was like four or five years ago?

[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.460]
Four years ago?

[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.120]
Yeah, and you were a child four years ago?

[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.040]
Man, I'll tell you.

[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.920]
Well, yeah, I worked with a bunch of pre-procantin heads, yeah.

[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.400]
Yeah, and we all loved it.

[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.100]
It was great, right?

[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.600]
I loved it.

[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.060]
I probably still love it.

[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.700]
Oh, yeah, it's great.

[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.500]
I love it.

[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.500]
It's one of the...

[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.120]
How about the show?

[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.220]
I wanted to show you a little light on the baseball situation.

[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:18.820]
Yeah.

[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.580]
How old are you?

[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.600]
Me 19.

[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.860]
Oh, so you were like a little adolescent pinhead with Zitz?

[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:24.360]
Exactly.

[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.360]
Okay, I'm sorry.

[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.360]
Okay, shedding a little light.

[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.760]
Yes, the Marlins, I believe, are going to be in the NLEs.

[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.240]
Yes.

[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:39.680]
And they're going to be sharing a certain place with a certain team which I am a devoted fan to.

[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.240]
Which is the next?

[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.160]
The stellar team.

[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.300]
Well, the Phillies?

[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:44.580]
Yes.

[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.160]
The Phillies.

[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.480]
Yes, we won't be in last place anymore, so...

[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.500]
But you won't have Roger McDowell do a pay-as-contract anymore after last night, by the way.

[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.040]
Oh, yes.

[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.460]
You unloaded that stiff.

[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.200]
Uh-huh.

[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.280]
I know that.

[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.760]
But the one thing I'm glad is that we won't be able to be called the worst team in that league.

[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.800]
We'll have another team to make fun of.

[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.480]
Yeah, that's...

[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.300]
That is a good point.

[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.740]
We can get like 15 more teams in the NLEs to be in good shape.

[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.920]
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.860]
But, um...

[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.560]
There's a buddy of mine at work who listens to all the time and they talk about you all the time.

[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.300]
I just wanted to call them all douche bags.

[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.740]
So, Mike from Scotties and Burris and all the whole crew there, they're all...

[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.220]
The whole crew is a bunch of douche bags.

[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.320]
That's what this wonderful astute gentleman said.

[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.680]
Well, listen, you were hanging there and think it over several times before you decide you want to get in this business.

[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.220]
Believe me.

[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.120]
All right, thank you.

[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.300]
Good mental health feeds the hell out of money anytime.

[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.480]
All right, good luck, Neil.

[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:36.920]
I'll see ya.

[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:38.720]
Great color.

[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.900]
Boy, what a great American.

[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.680]
We've had some wonderful people on the phone today, haven't we?

[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.260]
Alex?

[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.520]
Alex is there, a bunch of stiffs.

[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.880]
We have an open line in Broward that's ringing as we speak.

[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.320]
Boy, we are just smoking today.

[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.360]
Man, oh man.

[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.880]
You want to take this show and just roll it up in a gigantic paper.

[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.100]
And light it.

[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.120]
And stick it in the Sally's ear.

[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.080]
You probably enjoy it.

[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.180]
Anyway, speaking of having a great lunch,

[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.280]
Bobby Rabino is the place for ribs.

[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.920]
He's also the place for a great lunch.

[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.460]
Any day, seven days a week, they're open for lunch daily from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.

[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.840]
And for dinner, of course, 4 p.m. until closing in the wee hours.

[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:26.040]
10 different delicious appetizers included their gigantic colossal onion ring loaf

[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.480]
and zupra zucchini loaf.

[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.760]
Don't let it loaf.

[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.440]
Head for Bobby Rabino's.

[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:36.040]
And buffalo wings and chicken tenders and barbecue chicken wings and barbecue ribs, of course, which they're famous for.

[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.000]
And six different salads, six different kinds of seafood.

[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.260]
41 tempting entrees, soups and sandwiches from 8 a.m.

[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.480]
All kinds of great stuff.

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.760]
Delicious. That's the reputation.

[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.140]
Bobby Rabino's has always had for dinner, but now for lunch, too, from 11 to 4 every day.

[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.700]
Six Broward locations for Bobby Rabino's.

[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.040]
They're in Fort Lauderdale at 4100 North Federal Highway.

[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.660]
The South Fort Lauderdale is at 1430 Southeast 17th Street.

[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.900]
Sunrise on North University Drive, St. Rodin, 44 in Davy, North Federal Highway in Papano, West

[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.460]
Halondale Beach Boulevard in Hollywood, North Kimberly Boulevard in Margate, and on Glades Road in Boka.

[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.280]
So for a luscious, fantastic lunch and the price is always right.

[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.100]
Head for Bobby Rabino's.

[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.520]
Just because these divorce doys are ready for you.

[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.320]
I'm your dog.

[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.000]
Now, I do want to say this.

[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.840]
I want to cut you off right at the pass because I know that.

[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.780]
I know what I know that with these things happen.

[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:37.580]
You like to you like to cast aspersions on your partner and blame it say that he's callous and uncaring and vindictive and hateful,

[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.440]
which is true.

[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.940]
But so are you.

[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.240]
Thank you.

[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.620]
They're not listening to the other more than they're paying any attention.

[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.940]
I'm trying to stand up from he'll even have the monitor up there.

[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.820]
He's got the monitor down in the other room.

[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.740]
You got to crank it up there.

[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.040]
I want that man to pay attention.

[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.480]
I'm standing up for him.

[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.540]
By the way, Hyde Alisa.

[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.240]
I said, Hyde, who are personally a little wilder, I just wanted to say hyena radio.

[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.380]
I'm not saying the word about that.

[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.740]
I heard that just just that.

[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.760]
That was just muscle out of my territory.

[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.740]
Okay, buster.

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.360]
So anyway, no, but you're going to come on you guys and I know immediately somebody's going to bring up the fact that you

[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.100]
Dell is a history again.

[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.520]
No.

[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.260]
And you're going to say, well, I've been through it before.

[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.380]
I've been on the other side.

[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:20.900]
Oh, yes, you are.

[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.100]
And you go, well, you're vindictive and hateful and you've got the thing I'm bummed out about.

[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:25.780]
You've got the obsession with him.

[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.700]
Because I hear you say it all the time and you're going to pretend like, well, I don't want to exploit some guy while he's down.

[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.040]
You making me up to be a wimp.

[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.640]
Listen, I listen to that show.

[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.160]
Yeah.

[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.160]
And the fact is, I'm only upset because he didn't last as long as Sud's predicted.

[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.220]
Sud's what you give him, six months.

[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.500]
There is hope for you after all.

[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.400]
And he only went like three or something.

[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.800]
Try it out loud.

[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.220]
The three of us, I lose the pool.

[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.740]
What are you like eating weedies now?

[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.100]
Oh, look what that did to Brutal.

[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.480]
What I did to Bruce Jenner.

[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.160]
Oh, man.

[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.280]
You see it lately?

[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:01.900]
No.

[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.160]
Really?

[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:10.220]
Looks like a cross between Martina and one of the Nelson twins.

[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.340]
I'm serious.

[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.300]
I don't know what that is.

[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.820]
I don't make jokes about Martina.

[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.440]
She could beat the crap out of all of us.

[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.400]
I am, I'm just strut.

[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.520]
But I'll live.

[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.140]
This is Sud's that says he gives a good crap, huh?

[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520]
Is that a replacement word?

[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.520]
You know you're going to actually attack him viciously.

[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.520]
Because I'm a happy place.

[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.320]
I think that's already been done.

[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.960]
Not by me.

[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.860]
You didn't hear me ragging on that guy.

[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.200]
I think he got it, did it to himself.

[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.260]
No, that's Peewee.

[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.060]
You're getting all these stories.

[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.420]
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.

[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.820]
You get all these stories, the next step.

[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.640]
This is drug rehab.

[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.240]
Well, there's only so many shows you can do on that.

[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.020]
But then they're like exhausted.

[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.260]
One, like you said.

[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.120]
The agenda's gone.

[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.280]
So you're not going to win five.

[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.860]
You're going to actually come on and tell it like it is.

[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.560]
I just did.

[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.800]
After all the grotesque, disgusting things that were said about you

[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.740]
and you were going to flop and you were going to bomb

[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.620]
and you guys suck and he's this up upon all of them.

[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.800]
And here he is again.

[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.560]
It's like every three months now, he just like bounces out.

[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.780]
Because there's nothing there.

[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.260]
There's nothing there.

[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.100]
Absolutely.

[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.760]
And I want to exploit somebody when they're down and out in this business.

[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.240]
Much less all about.

[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.060]
What, exploiting people in the dark?

[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.260]
You bet.

[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.220]
Damn right.

[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.100]
Let him have it.

[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:32.520]
Screw off.

[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.340]
And they have no airtime as they're on to come back.

[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.060]
You're going right.

[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.820]
Slime ball that was in here trying to stab you guys in the back.

[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.880]
See what goes around does come around.

[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.160]
And you didn't hear that call that he called back and tried to justify all of that.

[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:48.580]
Joey?

[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.040]
Yeah.

[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.280]
Don't you remember the day I got him to call me?

[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.660]
Any weaseled out on the phone?

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.400]
Kind of like melted away like an old ice cube in the middle of the biggest desert?

[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:02.860]
No.

[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:09.660]
Like, Eiffeley Bailey with a slime ball on the witness stand just sliding down that chair into a little pool on the floor.

[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.860]
Pull a mush.

[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.980]
You don't have any idea, but I'm just I'm enjoying it.

[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.300]
And I like to see people get their jerks deserves.

[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.080]
And I'll as leave foul or at Debbie Ellis and recycling the right crap.

[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.580]
Oh, you're so right.

[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.660]
Why did they just put on paid religion and stop trying to try to salvage something that's been dead?

[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.520]
Like trying to bring back Grover Cleveland, Alexander.

[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.580]
Forget it.

[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.060]
He was great.

[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.960]
Those are great movies.

[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.980]
What's that? The Grover Cleveland story?

[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.520]
Grover Cleveland, Alexander, yeah.

[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.800]
Didn't Ron Reagan play him?

[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.500]
Grover Cleveland, Alexander.

[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.120]
Yeah.

[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.840]
No, he played Grover Cleveland.

[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:51.640]
Oh.

[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.600]
No, he was Grover Cleveland.

[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.400]
No, he was calling from Cleveland, Georgia.

[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.100]
That was our first call to this morning.

[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.040]
I want to take one call and see what they have to say to you guys.

[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040]
North Miami.

[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.040]
How you doing, guys?

[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:03.600]
Great.

[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.640]
How could you call Rick Riley with me when you don't even like boxing?

[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.940]
Boxing's a real sport.

[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.060]
Yeah, boxed this.

[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.520]
You don't even like boxing either.

[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.160]
You pretend you do to keep up your image.

[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:15.980]
Jarron Wright, I pretend I like everything.

[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.480]
Yeah. Just so I can suck around.

[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.760]
He's into silk panties.

[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.100]
Don't they look nice?

[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.160]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:23.580]
Hi.

[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.380]
Who is this?

[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:27.660]
Hi, Beth.

[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.120]
Who?

[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:28.860]
From out in the void.

[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.660]
Who is it?

[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.420]
Heather.

[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.040]
Heather, how old are you, Heather?

[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:34.680]
Yeah.

[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.160]
I'm calling about.

[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:37.540]
Heather.

[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.100]
He's herman.

[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.840]
Heather, who is this?

[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.580]
We just got this.

[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.320]
Is this a child?

[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:41.900]
Yeah.

[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:42.920]
How old are you, Heather?

[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.920]
I'm 10.

[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.140]
I'll say Andre Dawson is God.

[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.740]
We'll be right over to rescue you in the IOD mobile cruiser.

[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:50.460]
Yeah.

[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.100]
Well, yeah.

[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.680]
My dad listens to you guys a lot.

[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.520]
Well, that's great.

[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.280]
Is he driving right now?

[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:56.560]
Yeah.

[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.060]
Are you driving?

[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.440]
He's there one.

[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.880]
Well, you sound like you're in a car, Heather.

[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.600]
I'm not.

[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.440]
Where are you?

[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.560]
And then my dad works.

[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.140]
You read your dad's work?

[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.320]
I thought he sounds like you're out playing in traffic in the middle of a

[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.440]
holiday on the beach Boulevard.

[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.140]
So what's the question, Heather?

[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:12.220]
Huh?

[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.240]
Heather?

[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.440]
What?

[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.500]
What's the question?

[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.020]
What?

[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.400]
Heather, are they playing grab ass in the office back there?

[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:22.580]
No.

[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:23.240]
Okay.

[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.240]
Now what's the question?

[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.420]
Well, I always thought that when people say,

[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.680]
maybe Herman was on TV, he would be weird.

[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:31.300]
Yeah.

[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.100]
I'd ever thought he'd do a thing like that.

[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:33.660]
Yeah.

[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.760]
You want to see it?

[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:36.880]
No.

[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.540]
But he's like, why?

[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.140]
Everybody knows it was on the news.

[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:41.740]
Yeah.

[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.480]
What are you eating, Heather?

[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.480]
Bubble gum.

[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.480]
Take the gum out when you call a talk show.

[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.840]
Don't listen to him, Heather.

[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:50.580]
Pay no attention.

[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.800]
You tell him we can go.

[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.620]
The matter is that people around on his show, not on this show.

[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.120]
Unbelievable.

[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:56.860]
Okay.

[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.540]
You can go out, Heather.

[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.840]
I want to hear you spit the gum out.

[00:18:59.020 --> 00:18:59.900]
Spit it across the office.

[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:00.720]
Spit it out your dad.

[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.540]
Will you leave me alone?

[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.160]
Pember Pines.

[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.260]
Just a Neil Rickshaw.

[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:08.400]
Yeah.

[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:08.400]

[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.420]
Shut down, Voron.

[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.420]
The problem is, it's like drag weed seed.

[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.780]
This is drag Rick seed.

[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.720]
That's what's going on.

[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.240]
What was that in?

[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:14.880]
It's my turn.

[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.340]
Yeah.

[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.780]
You're taking a lot of abuse lately and probably deserve more of it.

[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:18.080]
Okay.

[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.100]
It's the season.

[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.480]
This guy's right on it.

[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.420]
He's not wumping out.

[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.760]
Neil, he's probably just lost his go-nails in the divorce.

[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.620]
So he had, you know, this is what's going on.

[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:25.780]
Okay.

[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.320]
One of them.

[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:28.820]
Heather, $81.

[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.400]
Yeah.

[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:29.700]

[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.660]
I'm bringing up our total of $5,716.

[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.740]
Did you hear the story of the other day?

[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.800]
Excuse me, sir, but did you hear the story of the other day?

[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:36.540]
No.

[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.140]
This is a limo service, okay?

[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:38.540]
Yeah.

[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.040]
And I asked Marvel what's the name of it?

[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.240]
And he says, corporate car suza.

[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:44.920]
Corporate car USA.

[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.520]
He retic corporate.

[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.680]
It was like written out all together.

[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.680]
He's a corporate car.

[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.060]
He was smelling your cologne earlier.

[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.320]
So what the hell do you want?

[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.180]
He's going through a change.

[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.600]
We all go through changes, right?

[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.220]
Everybody leave my neck alone.

[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:56.500]
Rick.

[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.480]
Oh, I'm sorry, you're still there, yeah?

[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.740]
You owe us an hour of bad, Greg Brudell.

[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.380]
Pardon me?

[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.040]
You owe us one hour at least of bad, and Greg Brudell.

[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:04.360]
Okay.

[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.200]
Or they were really going to turn on him if he doesn't.

[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.000]
This will make up for the week or you went off the air.

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:09.660]
Okay.

[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.200]
All right.

[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.120]
Well, that's what I did during the whole week.

[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.020]
Well, one more hour to make it official.

[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:14.540]
Okay.

[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.420]
See you.

[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.080]
Well, at least you guys came back.

[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.520]
That's true.

[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.340]
Because he was even a lot of crap during that period of time, too.

[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:22.620]
Was he?

[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.340]
Right, it was.

[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.240]
Why do the first three minutes to see which therapist he has on?

[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:27.680]
All right.

[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.060]
Yeah.

[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.600]
That's what blows me away about him.

[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.760]
He lives his day after day.

[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.640]
What's he going to do every morning?

[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.140]
He's got this SNM quotient or something that he has to fill, and he hates him.

[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.040]
And he just comes in every day just seething and foaming.

[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.840]
It's the worst thing on the radio.

[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.440]
I hate him.

[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:45.980]
I hate him.

[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.580]
I hate him.

[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.200]
No, that's the show he's talking about.

[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:49.540]
Oh.

[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.980]
Well, listen, I can't top any of this.

[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.320]
I don't know who this belongs to.

[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.220]
I found it incredibly beautiful.

[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.800]
And I don't even like the hurricanes or the orange bull.

[00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.760]
The orange bulls of toilet.

[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:00.940]
It's a paperweight.

[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.460]
And it was in a little box down below.

[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.620]
It's probably been sitting there for years.

[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.120]
It probably belongs to Alan Courtney.

[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.740]
But I'm stealing it.

[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.560]
It's highly of all kinds of crap that you make.

[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:09.740]
That's right.

[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.600]
Like that beautiful Marlon Major League baseball poster that's in there.

[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.000]
By the way, it's managed.

[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.500]
It does the chair of the extra chair.

[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:16.940]
What is that?

[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.680]
It's like rumors that FTL Neal got fired.

[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:21.620]
Yeah, right.

[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.520]
So, yeah, no question about it.

[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:24.640]
Yeah.

[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.080]
My last day tomorrow, and I'm going to make the most of it, okay.

[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.100]
Well, I was like, we'll have the new midday guy unveiling.

[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.260]
After that sign, I'm going to FTL by the way.

[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.920]
Well, you have to get hold of it.

[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.520]
I'm going to buy there.

[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.180]
Huh?

[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:37.900]
Do you go by there?

[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.840]
I'm going to do a one-man show with Lee Fowler.

[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:42.620]
That's good.

[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.540]
Well, listen, that's going to do it for me here as we kind of like zip off into oblivion.

[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.000]
It was pretty good for most of the show.

[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.320]
What?

[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.540]
Top 10 tabloid trash headlines.

[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.920]
I want to hear a junior column.

[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.660]
We don't have that today.

[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.860]
Well, that's what it says on the sheet.

[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:54.560]
Well, they're wrong.

[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.480]
Well, get organized.

[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.360]
They're always organized.

[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.420]
What is it today?

[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.480]
It's newsroom planning.

[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.460]
I was all set to hear the top 10 tabloid trash headlines.

[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.700]
I don't want to hear news around a planet today.

[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.700]
Well, they don't listen.

[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:07.540]
I want to hear it.

[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.300]
Nice game, Chuck.

[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.220]
I want to hear it tomorrow.

[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.520]
I'll give you a junior's phone number.

[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:11.580]
What is it?

[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.320]
He was pretty good.

[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.620]
By the way, you think that guy from Syracuse is telling our show

[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.420]
and knows who we are?

[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.100]
Have a great day.

[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.180]
Stay tuned for the guys.

[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.480]
Joseph Gackie on Sports Talk at 605.

[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.020]
Skipper Upchuck for Hank 8-11 tonight.

[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.660]
Well, in the ticket, I'm going to donate it to the veterans.

[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.120]
The heck with the darn game.

[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.160]
Wasn't that nice.

[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.480]
You're a great American.

[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.760]
And I also like to tell my friends, Jeff, the fishing down

[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.220]
is those shitting murdering mobsters that are near the keys

[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.020]
that they all a bunch of douchebags.

[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.480]
I hope the mobsters get away.

[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.080]
Okay.

[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.160]
Thanks for the help, pal.

[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:46.620]
Okay.

[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.800]
See ya.

[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.400]
A Rick and Sputtle be doing their show live from J.R.S.

[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.620]
From the stadium.

[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.140]
From the seat.

[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.520]
Oh, man.

[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.540]
Is there going to be some gnashing of teeth and some real carrying on

[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.400]
around six o'clock?

[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.200]
It's a poppy car.

[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.220]
Well, I don't think so.

[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.620]
And it says the guest will be Tim Robbie.

[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.060]
The stadium manager Glenn Mann.

[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.280]
Is that right?

[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.500]
Or is that another one of the vets, uh, nightmares?

[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.700]
How can anybody be named Mann?

[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.420]
How you doing, Mann?

[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.540]
Is that his name?

[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.160]
Glenn Mann?

[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.620]
And Dolphin Cheerleaders.

[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.720]
And it says Neil Rogers, too.

[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.200]
It says Tim Robbie is going to be all right.

[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.240]
I got some good questions.

[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.880]
I think I might show up really out there.

[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.420]
Here's a mobile in high alia, Buenos dias.

[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.600]
Hello, Neil.

[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.340]
Yes.

[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.160]
How are you today, darling?

[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.100]
Okay, sweetie.

[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.060]
I'm calling to see if you can give me instructions on how to get to the

[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.840]
Robbie stadium tonight.

[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:51.380]
No.

[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.040]
Oh, please, Neil.

[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.700]
You can't get there from by you.

[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.900]
Uh, you know, I'm driving in high alia, man.

[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.500]
I'm driving by.

[00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.300]
Holy cow.

[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:00.180]
Wow.

[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.980]
Did you hear the way that voice change?

[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.640]
It was like Mercedes-McCambery, too.

[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.720]
And the emphasis.

[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.680]
There's an ultimobile with two hands being driven by two hands and a bunch of blue hair.

[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.420]
I can't race away.

[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.460]
I can't race it, but I'm driving anyway.

[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.080]
It just keeps kind of like shifting back and forth, man.

[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.280]
Neil, just a quick talk, and they got to get out of here.

[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:21.600]
Yeah.

[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.560]
Those tickets that you're looking to get rid of, if you would, maybe consider, actually decide that you don't want to go to the game,

[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:34.060]
raffle, I mean, uh, auction them off and the money that you get, you get donated to the veterans.

[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.480]
That's what I was going to do.

[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.320]
I mean, you know, that's what I said yesterday.

[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.560]
Sign that, Balthan, and, uh, and still make up.

[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.440]
Yeah, but, you know, let me, let me say this to you, okay?

[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.260]
I don't want at the risk of sounding cheap, which I'm not.

[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.600]
No, I'm not, because I came in the first day that I heard about it.

[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.040]
I think it'd be cheaper, rich, Neil.

[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.200]
No, I'm not rich, but the, I make a good buck, but the fact is, if I believe in something,

[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.940]
I don't just sit and talk a good game, I believe in setting an example and putting up a few bucks.

[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:05.320]
So I wrote it a check for 500, which, you know, maxed the one at the IOD coast, you know, check, which I think is a pretty nice donation.

[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.040]
And, uh, like when we do the Camilla's house thing, I donate thousands of dollars to that.

[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:10.740]
Yeah, well, okay.

[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.700]
But listen to me.

[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.360]
Listen to me.

[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:12.700]
All right.

[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:21.200]
I mean, what is the point of, you know, if we want to do that, then all of us in here, you just take out a collection inside the building and just all of us pay them.

[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.260]
Oh, that's not the purpose. That's not the point.

[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.620]
You see what I'm saying?

[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.440]
And then, let's say, have all the people coming in.

[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.140]
Listen to that crosstalk.

[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.040]
You know, what is it?

[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.300]
Well, we are in high alias, it's probably the radius of the community.

[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.280]
Man.

[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.860]
Can you still hear me?

[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.260]
Yeah, it sounds like Alberto San Pedro and Rick Sanchez have a little chat.

[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:41.460]

[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.400]
Anyways, I could run, guy, keep it up and, you know, I was just as hard to see if you could get the money for the veterans.

[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.020]
Yeah, okay.

[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.420]
See ya.

[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.360]
Bye, boy.

[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.900]
1045 at WYOD, boy, and they find his ass in highly. You'll never see it again, man.

[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.220]
751 WYOD, and here's another mobile implantation.

[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.760]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.320]
Okay.

[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:10.080]
You know, I'm sick of this town and having to give away tickets to one of the greatest sporting events around the dolphins.

[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.440]
I don't give anything away to these people.

[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.120]
26 bucks, come to pay for themselves.

[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.500]
auction it off, see if you get a thousand bucks to take it.

[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.420]
That's what I think.

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.620]
What is it?

[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:22.940]
That's my opinion.

[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.220]
Who said I was going to give it away?

[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.240]
Well, you know, you guys are always giving away, so you should never have to give them away.

[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.660]
I'm not giving away anything. I already paid my part.

[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.700]
That's right. I got my season tickets.

[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.040]
Right.

[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.260]
I'll see you at the game tonight.

[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:34.680]
Okay.

[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.740]
I just want to call my friend Jimmy Murphy and do his back.

[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.340]
See ya.

[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:37.600]
Later.

[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.100]
No, I'm going to keep him.

[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.640]
I am. I'm going to keep him.

[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.640]
When I left the house this morning, in fact, that's the reason I brought him in.

[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.840]
They're sitting here in front of my nose.

[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.700]
Because I wasn't going to keep him.

[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.820]
I was going to auction him off.

[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.840]
But I'm sick of doing that.

[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.520]
Every time I get something, I auction out like I'm some kind of shlipper.

[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.580]
Like I have to, you know.

[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:57.980]
Like I have to suffer.

[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.940]
Like they're going to nail me to the cross and I'm going to bleed for this community.

[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.220]
I've bled enough for this town.

[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:02.560]
Okay.

[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.920]
Thanks to Marisa Lee or whatever.

[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.000]
That's an interesting name.

[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.300]
But anyway, here's a check for 30 bucks for the veterans.

[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.240]
And a request for one of the enough of the sucking t-shirts.

[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.080]
Which I think they came in large and extra large.

[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.640]
I don't recall.

[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.200]
But we can, we can work it out because t-shirt Bob, those folks are great.

[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:22.900]
The best.

[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.700]
You know what really gets me though?

[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.420]
You know what the epitome of the whole thing is?

[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.820]
Because I heard it from several different people.

[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.580]
The boy Kurtz first reaction when they made up those t-shirts.

[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.360]
The unbelievable and the enough of the sucking and the other.

[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:42.400]
He was hysterical because they didn't have the rights to read like my little picture on the sleeve there.

[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.980]
They didn't have the right to do that.

[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.480]
Well, they're doing it for us.

[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.440]
They're not selling these.

[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.580]
They're doing it for us.

[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.260]
They're helping us raise money.

[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.180]
I mean, stop and, yeah.

[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.940]
Stop and think about how embarrassing that is.

[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:04.420]
And like I said the other day, what they should have done in the beginning was have an eerie shirts and neal shirts and rickenside shirts and goldberg shirts.

[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.940]
And each of them, one of us on our own show could have done this deal.

[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.220]
And in about three weeks, we could have raised all the money and had done it right.

[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.280]
Then proud of what we accomplished on something good for the veterans.

[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.600]
Left with a good taste in our mouths.

[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.360]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:24.360]
But it seems like every time we get involved in something, we have like a real sour taste in our mouth.

[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.340]
Kind of fishy.

[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.580]
1047 at WIOD and we'll be right back.

[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.720]
So keep away.

[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.720]
7 at WIOD.

[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.760]
How's that so doffin?

[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:37.980]
Prep meeting going.

[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.820]
We got around.

[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.500]
The things they do are old so, could cold.

[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.220]
Hope I die before I get old.

[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.360]
My generation.

[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.220]
My generation.

[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.740]
I thought Henry was in Portland.

[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.540]
It's 1108 at WIOD.

[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.180]
We have an open line in the center square.

[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.500]
Let's just put that on an endless loop and a hell with his damn thing.

[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.800]
Okay, screw it. It's Friday.

[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.200]
I got it.

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.200]

[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.200]
I started to say we have an open line in the center square, but of course you already heard me say that.

[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.680]
Didn't you through the miracle of radio?

[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.400]
At 524WIOD?

[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.300]
Hi, Alia.

[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:38.960]
Neil.

[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.540]
Yes sir.

[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.040]
That's how it's all fun here.

[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:41.420]
Yeah.

[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.720]
But that promo you got with Rick Weaver saying that I would improve defense and improve teams.

[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.100]
Don't start. We haven't even snapped the first snap yet. Don't be negative yet sir.

[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.500]
I have to play a dark side.

[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.140]
Well, hey, that's the problem.

[00:29:54.140 --> 00:30:00.700]
In fact, somebody asked Old Cam Braille with the Martian Sports class on Channel 6 who we thought would win a game tonight.

[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:07.420]
And he said when you consider the fact that many of the veterans will be absent, you know, it does create a problem.

[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.140]
Well, I always did like Mike Tom's act in the Harbour though.

[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.340]
I think they may not play well, but they looked good.

[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:13.740]
What is it?

[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.840]
I think the cars on the GOC issues are going as well as like that meaning going on over there.

[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.380]
Yeah, no, that's what that was.

[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.440]
Well, really?

[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.000]
Yeah.

[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.840]
Yeah, we won't be seen too much random.

[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.060]
In fact, that was Randall Hill.

[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.120]
That was Randall Hill.

[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:32.220]
You can, I think just in case we better, it's 1109 and WIOD.

[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.780]
We have an open line and Broward.

[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.920]
Well, a quote it did for Cosset, you know.

[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.600]
That center square is open again or was it still been open?

[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.360]
It's been open.

[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.300]
I'm sorry. 524WIOD.

[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:44.900]
Well, you know me.

[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.000]
I'm so damn insecure.

[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.160]
At a spare.

[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.840]
3PM National Weather Service radar indicated to get it to numerous hours and thunderstorms,

[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.840]
several of Murray-Lachorane call over to South Florida,

[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.300]
and in South Lavera beach, Englewood Line.
