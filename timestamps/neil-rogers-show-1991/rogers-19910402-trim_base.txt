[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.520]
Well, I'm enjoying playing some of their cards, I'll tell you that, not boobs a lot but, that other little stuff.

[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.280]
In fact most of their stuff is like just a couple of seconds long, do you know what I'm saying?

[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.020]
Seriously, well that's because there are two guys trying to talk.

[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.040]
They can't have a lot of long stuff because it makes for too long of an

[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.180]
interruption. So like, short stuff like that is good.

[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.980]
It's 1116 at WIOD or short station and here's a mobile in Papano.

[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:37.280]
Hello.

[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:37.960]
Dale.

[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:38.700]
Yes sir.

[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.160]
Then for one of those rusty walks.

[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.020]
Yeah.

[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.520]
Yeah, I've brushed the railing.

[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.480]
I've put a fitting coat of oil on it, but you've probably got to scrape the

[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:45.880]
rust off.

[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.760]
Yeah, that's not bad.

[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.640]
Well listen, they got this great, this incredible spray on in a canned

[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.160]
product that eliminates rust forever.

[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.240]
Oh, for sure.

[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.460]
Rust and crust.

[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.380]
You spray it in your walk and then your underwear.

[00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.060]
It's tremendous.

[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:58.560]
Yep.

[00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.940]
He got against the panther name.

[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:00.740]
It's a great name.

[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.220]
I even have a panther plate on my hand.

[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.660]
Oh, come on.

[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.140]
Give it me a break will you?

[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.720]
What do you hear from Madonna Neil really?

[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.560]
And have a nice life.

[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.020]
Panthers.

[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.620]
That is the most pathetic, embarrassing, crappy thing.

[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.240]
And again, it's an ego trip.

[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.420]
He went to some stupid little school in Fort Lauderdale and their nickname was

[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.160]
the Panthers.

[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.860]
So we're going to call a baseball team the Florida Panthers.

[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.160]
It's just it's just not a baseball name.

[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.160]
Okay, it sucks.

[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.960]
The Panthers.

[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.260]
Oh, the more you say it, the worse it is.

[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.980]
I mean, even the pelicans, I mean, that would be bushly, but even that would be better.

[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.380]
The Panthers.

[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.940]
How about the leopards for just the leopards?

[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.720]
How about the illegal aliens?

[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.580]
We have an open line in a day in Broward in Palm Beach.

[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.680]
Well, I knew if I said enough of them, we'd be right.

[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.920]
Now we have one in another star line and one in Palm Beach.

[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.720]
Star IoT, if you have Bellsoft mobility.

[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.200]
Very, very.

[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.340]
And you realize the holidays are over now.

[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.380]
You know what that means?

[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.720]
That means everybody's gone.

[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.740]
This town is clearing out like they had a gigantic, a mammoth bomb scare.

[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.660]
Not only the frogs that are leaving, everybody's gone.

[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.240]
And let me tell you another thing.

[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.840]
As long as I'm sitting here getting wound up like a gigantic alarm clock like Big Ben

[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.380]
and drag.

[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.960]
The Chamber of Commerce people in this town lie through their teeth.

[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.620]
There was that big article a few weeks ago about how we got all the Quebecers here, half

[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.060]
a Quebec.

[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.380]
And we got all these French Canadians.

[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.120]
And in spite of the war and all this other tourism is down only a little bit.

[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.020]
Tourism in this town.

[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.020]
Not only what you can't complain about it because there wasn't any of this winter.

[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.880]
We had no season.

[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.740]
There was no but the hotels were dying over there.

[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.160]
Seriously.

[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.660]
You could call off the management at any hotel in Broward County and you'd hear.

[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.320]
Exactly.

[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.020]
Or you could call off the management at any hotel in Dade County and you'd hear.

[00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:58.580]
Exactly.

[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.120]
Couldn't have said it better myself in any language.

[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:01.780]
Dian.

[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.800]
And yet they keep lying.

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.600]
I'm dying if they're not lying.

[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.700]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.680]
And that bugs me.

[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.180]
See because they don't want the public to realize how incompetent and stupid now they've

[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.240]
chased everybody out of here.

[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.320]
Not just the spring breakers but everybody they've chased.

[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.960]
But we're a world class city man.

[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:20.740]
Yeah.

[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.620]
Just keep saying it off and off and sooner or later it will come true.

[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.040]
It's 1119 at WIOD.

[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.360]
Palm Beach cares about nothing.

[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.320]
They're just not going to talk to us today and you know what?

[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.820]
We're pretty excited about it ourselves.

[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.980]
Here's a mobile in Miami on his dime.

[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:34.540]
Hey Neil.

[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.080]
Okay.

[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:35.660]
How you doing?

[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.000]
Yes.

[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.400]
Went to Joe Robbie Stadium on Sunday for the game.

[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.760]
First time I've been at the stadium.

[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.480]
We had a ball.

[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.080]
Great.

[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.380]
Took five people over there.

[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.480]
We sat up in a club seat.

[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.400]
Well, I didn't go in.

[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.260]
Phil Costin is pretty upset about it.

[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:47.720]
I'll tell you that.

[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.160]
He's standing out in the hallway right now waving his arms around in the air, throwing

[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.280]
objects at the window, having a nervous breakdown because I didn't attend those games.

[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.600]
What do you think of the stingrays?

[00:11:59.240 --> 00:11:59.600]
The one?

[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.920]
The Florida stingrays?

[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:01.960]
Sucks.

[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:02.700]
Okay.

[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.280]
Listen, I'm moving into a...

[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.720]
Don't you understand that's not a baseball name?

[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.520]
Yeah.

[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.140]
All the good ones are taken.

[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.520]
No, they're not.

[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.520]
What's wrong with the Miami Blues?

[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.240]
What?

[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.400]
Hey, listen, I understand you.

[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.400]
He's got a big neorodgers dartboard in there and he and Cheryl are throwing objects.

[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.240]
Oh, he belly ached about those tickets.

[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:24.940]
He wanted those tickets.

[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.360]
He didn't even show up at the game.

[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.620]
What's wrong with that, right?

[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.620]
He's a pain in the ass.

[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.380]
I heard the food wasn't that great anyway.

[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.520]
You better shape up, Phil.

[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.580]
That's what that's the rumor.

[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:34.980]
Okay.

[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.580]
Hot dogs.

[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.820]
They mean, you know, hot dogs are okay for ball games, but let's get back to that dolphin

[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.500]
food where we get some good show up there in dolphins season.

[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.840]
Neil, can I have a great stuff if I do say so myself?

[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.140]
What is football season start?

[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.660]
Silly, oh, yes.

[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.380]
Can I ask you a question about satellite dishes?

[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.060]
Of course.

[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.980]
I'm moving into a neighborhood that's not a homeowner's association where I'll be able

[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.580]
to put up whatever I want.

[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.900]
What's a good dish to start with?

[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.600]
What's a good dish to start with?

[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.000]
What's the smallest size of a satellite dish that would get a good reception?

[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.080]
Seven and a half.

[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.240]
Don't get a six.

[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.900]
If anybody tries to sell you a six-foot dish, punch them in the mouth and call a police.

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.760]
Seven and a half foot.

[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:12.700]
I have a seven and a half.

[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.780]
I get magnificent pictures, okay?

[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:15.500]
Okay.

[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.140]
Can you recommend a good company?

[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:18.560]
No.

[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.700]
If I knew one, I would tell you.

[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.400]
All righty.

[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.260]
I really can't.

[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.140]
It's a touch and go.

[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.160]
As a matter of fact, if you're...

[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.260]
Well, you don't have one, but if you knew anybody that's got a dish, do you know anybody

[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:30.740]
that's got one?

[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.140]
Nope.

[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.320]
Like I said.

[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.560]
I have a couple of my new neighbors, too.

[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.360]
I might check with that.

[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:40.560]
No, seriously, the thing to do there's on satellite F4, West R4, I mean, what it would

[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.680]
not West R, SATCOM 4.

[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.620]
Channel 10 is satellite city.

[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.800]
It's an over-the-year satellite thing, and on Channel 15 is another one, but Channel 10,

[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.880]
it's only intermittent.

[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:52.480]
Right.

[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.220]
But the satellite city, they have the most incredible prices on stuff.

[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.160]
A lot of these local dealers here are charging like double what they're selling.

[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.500]
I mean, really good, complete units with the dish and the LNB and the receiver and a

[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:05.840]
whole bit.

[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.360]
And if you got a neighbor, check that out first, because otherwise you're going to spend

[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.400]
a much too much money.

[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:10.980]
Okay, great.

[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.980]
It's called satellite city.

[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:12.340]
Right.

[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.140]
Okay, great.

[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.260]
On F4, 10 for whatever your neighbor, they'll know what it is.

[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.080]
F4, 10.

[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:17.380]
Right.

[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.040]
All right.

[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:23.080]
And, you know, at a ball at the game, it was the first time I've been at a baseball game

[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.540]
down here since the Brooklyn die.

[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.560]
Well, full cost and thanks you're a great American.

[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.760]
I can't say he likes anybody who came to those games.

[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.640]
He said anybody who didn't as a slime ball and he wants the world to know it.

[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.500]
And I'm at the top of the list.

[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480]
I'll see you in the, okay.

[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.800]
Hey, listen, if we get a team, I'll be there, okay?

[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.480]
I mean, I'm like, all these people pulling me in different directions.

[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.580]
They want me to go to the track.

[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.840]
They want me to go to ball games.

[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.140]
I got to go to somebody's brisk.

[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.280]
I can only be in so many places at once.

[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.000]
And of course, with me, it's a tough decision when I compare between the track and any

[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.920]
place else, okay?

[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.380]
The track is where it's at.

[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:54.940]
I'm sorry.

[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.300]
And then the next day I was exhausted from plunging my brains out of the track.

[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.940]
Although I didn't have a winning night, okay?

[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.160]
I had another winning night last night.

[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.580]
Not big bucks, not thousands or millions, but okay, not too bad.

[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.700]
I mean, I'm not Kelly Shepherd, after all.

[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.480]
23 after 11 at WIOD, we have an open line in Palm Beach, 655, 9463.

[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.020]
It's that time again, the sale to end all sales this weekend at Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.500]
If you're thinking about a new Toyota car, a truck, do not mess whatever you do.

[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.780]
The Toyota of Hollywood Grand Slam and set of sale value on each and every new 91 Toyota

[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.160]
car like you wouldn't believe, every new 91 truck and van on the lot.

[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.740]
You really want Grand Slam and set of this is the place because Toyota of Hollywood has

[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.660]
got the lowest price, best selection in the southeast, highest customer satisfaction of

[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.640]
any Toyota dealer and award winning service department.

[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.940]
What more could you want at a professional sales step?

[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.460]
That's therefore you're before, during and after you buy that incredible new Toyota, an

[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.560]
unbelievable price.

[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.180]
Here's the sales event you've been waiting for, the Grand Slam deal of a lifetime waiting

[00:15:54.180 --> 00:16:00.480]
for you this weekend at Toyota of Hollywood on 441 between Taft and Sheridan streets in Hollywood.

[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.880]
I'll tell her that'll teach you to fudge those numbers on me on those ticket sales, okay?

[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.440]
26 after 11 at WIOD or sports intensive station, yes?

[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.180]
27.

[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.800]
July 27th?

[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:12.760]
Great.

[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.000]
Boy, that seems like right around the corner, huh?

[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.180]
July 27th, the first exhibition game in GRS.

[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.440]
Okay, boy, I'm having, I'll tell you one thing if it sounds like I'm eating a lot.

[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.420]
And of course, I've been known to do that on here.

[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:24.780]
I'm not.

[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.560]
It's just that the salad goes on forever.

[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.940]
There's nothing peppers, everything low-calon here.

[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.120]
A couple of plantains.

[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.720]
Slice it to a pepperoni.

[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:34.920]
Wow.

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.260]
If I do say so myself, it is extra good today.

[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.220]
Let's try Cooper City just a moment, please.

[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:43.780]
Here we go.

[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:44.000]
Hello.

[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:44.780]
Hey, Neil.

[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.140]
You know, she was on the phone for so long.

[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.780]
She had to go make a quick deposit.

[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.640]
Who's that?

[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.340]
Oh, a lady friend from Colorado.

[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.240]
We took her to the ballgame and the zoo.

[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.340]
She lost her money at highlight.

[00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.160]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.900]
Basically just a big tour, but there comes the bunny.

[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.160]
Here she is, right here.

[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.760]
Here she is right here.

[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.140]
Oh.

[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.480]
Hi, Neil.

[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:06.900]
Hi.

[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.400]
You went to the bank?

[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.200]
You went to the bank that fast?

[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.400]
Well, yeah.

[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.100]
You said you had to go make a deposit.

[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.160]
More quick in Colorado.

[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:15.820]
Wow.

[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.140]
That's what Neil Bush said.

[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:27.340]
So we went to highlight and I was the only person in the entire sea of blue hair.

[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.740]
Well, there are a lot of families that used to go to highlight.

[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.980]
In fact, their motto used to be incest is best of highlight.

[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.200]
So the question of the day is, what's the average age in Florida?

[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:38.660]
Death.

[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.260]
Death.

[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.120]
Death.

[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:42.660]
Death.

[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:42.760]
Death.

[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.060]
D-E-A-T-H.

[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.340]
Death is the median age.

[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.040]
Do you follow my drift?

[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:50.640]
Mm-hmm.

[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.540]
You're going to be OK?

[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:51.920]
No.

[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.760]
But you don't live here.

[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.140]
You didn't move here just visiting, right?

[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:54.800]
This is it.

[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.140]
Well, consider yourself lucky.

[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.420]
Because living in this jury at this outdoor funeral parlor isn't easy.

[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.120]
It's hard.

[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.260]
It is.

[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.000]
Very hard.

[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.400]
New bed.

[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.360]
So how do you like it so far?

[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.160]
It was fun.

[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:07.840]
We had a good time.

[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.820]
We went to the baseball game.

[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:09.360]
Great.

[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.300]
Well, yeah.

[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.800]
I bet you had living and breathing people there.

[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.780]
See, the old farts do not come out to the stadium.

[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.620]
Very few of them.

[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.660]
Because there's no metamusel concession out there.

[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.880]
But they do go to bingo.

[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.080]
They love their bingo.

[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:22.560]
Bingo.

[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.780]
They have their majong tournament.

[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.260]
They go to the early bird.

[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.000]
They have them up at a clubhouse at Poppato Park.

[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.680]
We got all the sea of blue here in the clubhouse and the grandstand at Gulfstream.

[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.720]
You'll see more blue here than you've ever seen in your life than you can shake a thing

[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:35.960]
at.

[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.600]
So write a book about it.

[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.020]
It would be a bestseller in Colorado.

[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.900]
I'm sure.

[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.680]
Have a great time.

[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.320]
Thank you.

[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:44.940]
How long you staying?

[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.800]
How long are you going to be here?

[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:47.740]
I'm leaving today.

[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.580]
Aren't you lucky?

[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.500]
Well, I have a great trip.

[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:50.360]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.140]
And tell them all about it.

[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.180]
OK, lie a lot.

[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:52.820]
We need the help.

[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.220]
All right.

[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:54.640]
Bye.

[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.280]
Talk to you later.

[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.460]
Isn't that something?

[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.380]
29 past 11 at WIO.

[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.540]
The Abitulati people have got some pain in the ass.

[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.720]
They're hanging out.

[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.040]
I can say that because my aunt left this morning.

[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:05.960]
She's very nice.

[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:06.560]
She really is.

[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.520]
We have an open line.

[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.000]
She is.

[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.100]
OK, I'm sorry.

[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.120]
She's very nice.

[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.740]
I had some knail off yesterday at Mami's after I left here,

[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.120]
after our 17 meals had some knail off in brisket.

[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:21.980]
It was delicious.

[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.180]
Fabulous.

[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.560]
There's an opening on a starline, star IOD.

[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.180]
Anybody have know what knails are?

[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.000]
George doesn't know what knails are.

[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.080]
Oh, you'd love them.

[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.860]
See, we got you into canole.

[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.140]
You didn't know from canole.

[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.540]
And I got into plantains.

[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.720]
It's kind of like a multibyzec—by a cultural show here.

[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.400]
Opalaka.

[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.120]
Good morning.

[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:42.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.640]
Is it a canadal?

[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.520]
Something a name tag of the Canadian worship?

[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.080]
Every time I was thinking I heard your news report,

[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.040]
every time I went on a hockey puck in a volasuit.

[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.000]
Any time one of these pseudo celebrities

[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.020]
gets busted for some kind of sex crime, cause—

[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.960]
The individual who was the innocent party, unquote,

[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.760]
ends up in a magazine.

[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.240]
There's one in what magazine is guys gonna have?

[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.120]
No, it's gonna be one of those TV shows, I think,

[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.120]
this afternoon about 430, you know what it's called?

[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:11.940]
It's hard.

[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.860]
It is very hard.

[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.520]
Very hard toppy at 430.

[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.480]
And one final thing, you're perverted, twisted, and sick.

[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.520]
And I like that.

[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.260]
Okay, sir.

[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.120]
Up yours.

[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.000]
Mm-mm.

[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.640]
This sound of day was sensational.

[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.840]
And I'm care whether Dinnin' Brick likes my sand ad or not.

[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.080]
Okay.

[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.380]
It'll be pleased to know that little time he's bringing

[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.800]
some brick oven later, George.

[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.900]
And since I already had my salad,

[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.420]
you'll probably be able to participate.

[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.560]
Cheryl's not speaking to us or we'd invite her.

[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.020]
We have an open line in Broward 524WIOD.

[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.380]
And I see one we just had a line checker in Dade,

[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.120]
so there's one there.

[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.340]
We're doing okay for Tuesday.

[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.680]
Nothing I'd get too excited about.

[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.840]
I mean, if it was like this every day,

[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.180]
I don't think I'd bother coming back again

[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:53.840]
except on Thursday.

[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.800]
Here's a lady in Miami Shores.

[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:57.680]
Hello.

[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:58.540]
Y'all yes?

[00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.640]
Mr. Roger?

[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.320]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.820]
Hi, I have a quick question for you.

[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.440]
I was watching ESPN last week,

[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.680]
and they had some Canadian sport.

[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.640]
I was wondering if you knew what it was.

[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.800]
It's a rock.

[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.120]
They throw on the floor.

[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.880]
And it's old guy yells at these two young guys

[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.040]
to sleep the floor, so it's a roll.

[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.240]
Right. It's called curling.

[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.420]
What is that?

[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.020]
It's the dumbest thing that anybody's ever seen.

[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.140]
They call it a stone.

[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.680]
But I mean, they had the stadium cut.

[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.760]
And you should see when those Canadians pass a stone,

[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.400]
Maniel, go nuts, eh?

[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.100]
It's horrible, but funny.

[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:29.940]
It's terrible.

[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.380]
I'm serious, it's called curling.

[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.080]
It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.260]
Even bachibal is more sense like that.

[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:35.980]
That's like bowling.

[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.920]
You know, the Italians bowl a little bit.

[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.740]
But curling like, like curl, like curly hair?

[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.140]
No curling, curly.

[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.100]
Don't ask me to explain how they got the name.

[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.720]
I'm sure some conuckle call it and tell us about that.

[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.880]
Curling, it's dumb, it's idiotic.

[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.020]
How the Canadians who invented one of my favorite sports hockey

[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.940]
we mentioned this year, they could also invent something

[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.460]
that stupid, I have no idea.

[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.020]
Okay.

[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.740]
And they're all sweeping those little brooms.

[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.080]
Those are the kind of guys you like to have in your house once a week.

[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.780]
Why is it always the older guys who yells at the two young guys?

[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:06.700]
Who's asleep?

[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.520]
You'd have to ask David Cassidy that, I have no idea.

[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.480]
Okay, can I say something to someone?

[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:13.960]
Sure.

[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.360]
Do you even have lunch ready when I get home or else?

[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:16.900]
Or else.

[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.300]
That's right.

[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:17.960]
Good job, man.

[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:18.480]
Thank you.

[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.080]
Have a great day.

[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.780]
And in closing, see you later.

[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.540]
Always a gentleman.

[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.000]
Bye.

[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.600]
It's 11.32.

[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.360]
Well, she's talking about lunch.

[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.960]
These little bagel chips are delicious and there's only in a whole bag.

[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.100]
There's how many calories like just a second.

[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:35.840]
Very few.

[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:37.820]
90.

[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.380]
In a whole bag.

[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:40.720]
Mmm, mmm.

[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:41.380]
They're good.

[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.420]
Garlic, no less.

[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.880]
Well, with that gigantic onion that's only served me and this garlic I should be safe.

[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.780]
There's no course in this place.

[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.980]
Everybody's always safe.

[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.580]
Got a lot of ugly people at work here.

[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.860]
It's 11.33 at WIOD.

[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:54.940]
We have an opening in day.

[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.140]
7-5-1-9463.

[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.020]
Four-loader dial.

[00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.200]
Yo.

[00:22:59.640 --> 00:22:59.940]
Yo.

[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:00.640]
Yeah?

[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.440]
Yeah, we're over here celebrating.

[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.160]
Celebrating what, sir?

[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.240]
Our French Canadian neighbors are leaving today.

[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.060]
Yeah, oh, wait a minute.

[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.140]
She's a new one.

[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:09.580]
I need something.

[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.140]
Go ahead.

[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.740]
Enter jumping into their big mobile living room and rolling on down the street.

[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.780]
Heading up that old Hershey highway back to where they came from, sir.

[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:18.280]
There you go.

[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.360]
You've got your week night.

[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.620]
From the heck of a send-off, too.

[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.820]
To the rock right through their back window.

[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.020]
Good one.

[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:24.560]
Yo.

[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.500]
Hey, we bought one of those rocks.

[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.120]
Yeah.

[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.860]
Or I don't think there was the same rocks they advertised on TV, though.

[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.260]
Not handmade in the people's Republican China, huh?

[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.440]
It didn't have all the little dents in it.

[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.640]
It's supposed to be handmade.

[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.480]
I'm not buying that.

[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.160]
Yeah.

[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.100]
Well, there's nothing like being made by hand.

[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:42.980]
That's what I've always heard.

[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.180]
I'd take your word for that.

[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:45.760]
Mm-hmm.

[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.660]
But otherwise, it cooks up good food.

[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.760]
Does it rust?

[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.280]
Sure, it rusts.

[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:54.620]
Well, good.

[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.160]
That's great.

[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.320]
Then you get that special cleaner that you spray on a top of your car when you have the

[00:23:59.320 --> 00:23:59.820]
fire going.

[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.680]
That's another good one I like, where they have the fire going on the hood of the car.

[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.280]
Have you ever seen that one?

[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:04.900]
Sure.

[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.960]
That's super wax that is good for bald heads and the top of your roof of your car and all

[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.740]
kinds of good stuff.

[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.600]
Grease up the cats earlobes.

[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.260]
It's fantastic.

[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.660]
Well, listen, have a great day, sir.

[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.900]
And Tiny says hi.

[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.160]
Right, Tiny?

[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.000]
26 till noon to WIO.

[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.460]
So that's my pet frog, Tiny.

[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.760]
The dog was getting too neurotic.

[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.040]
We have an open line.

[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.860]
I'll tell you, I had such a long talk with that little dog.

[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.540]
He was so embarrassed by the way these people behaved on Friday.

[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.160]
He'll never come to this place again.

[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.300]
You don't have to worry about that.

[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.940]
A little eight pound dog wouldn't hurt a flea.

[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.260]
And these people here acted like, oh, geez, are going to be here all day.

[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.620]
Sticking dog.

[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.060]
But the most embarrassing part of that episode was fat rich was sitting here for speeding

[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.660]
that dog.

[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.840]
And I'm not paying any attention because I can't see what's going on the other side of

[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.320]
this table.

[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.240]
We have this big octagonal thing here.

[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.200]
And fat rich is on the other side.

[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.900]
And the chair and the dog is over there on the floor beyond where I can see.

[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.900]
And he's feeding and feeding meatballs in lasagna.

[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.900]
You know, who knows what the hell is he's been sitting there saying to me, boy, that

[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.080]
dog is eating up the storm.

[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.240]
Well, who the hell is, who's the big slab that's feeding it to him?

[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.800]
Forced feeding my little dog.

[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.800]
And so when Andy came to here and stepped in something that he mistook for the

[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.480]
mets because it smelled just like then everybody's making a big stink about that.

[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:29.940]
I'm sorry.

[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:30.780]
I can't help it.

[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.060]
Okay.

[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.240]
He's just human or whatever he is.

[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.460]
25 till noon at W.I.O.D.

[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.500]
It's a fabulous Tuesday.

[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.960]
We got Dick and Tater at two.

[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:38.820]
We got sports talk.

[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.860]
Somebody will be doing it at six.

[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.880]
We have no idea who.

[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.320]
And Hank Lie from LA with author, writer, whatever he is, David Israel.

[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.340]
A good Irish boy from 8 to 11 tonight.

[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.580]
Confirmed, that'll be $500.

[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.140]
See?

[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.980]
That's an awful lot of money.

[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.500]
Well, how much you got?

[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.000]
Well.

[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.040]
That'll do.

[00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.520]
Here's your boy to pass, sir.

[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.060]
Pick any plane you like.

[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.580]
Air lines are in the dumper.

[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.500]
And nobody knows that better than us.

[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.960]
Weird desperate air.

[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.960]
Yes, desperate air.

[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.900]
We'll do anything to get your business.

[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.260]
We're the planes with a big brown nose.

[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.920]
Attention, passenger.

[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.980]
This is Captain Butt-Kiss, Bacon.

[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.480]
I'm turning on the nose, smoking right now.

[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.380]
But, hey, I won't tell if you won't.

[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.920]
And desperate air has no silly metal detectors to slow you down.

[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.600]
In fact, we have no restrictions at all.

[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.380]
Boy, it's awful stuffy in here.

[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.940]
You mind if I crack a window?

[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.980]
Well, normally it's not allowed, but I don't see why not.

[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.840]
So fly desperate air.

[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.340]
Please.

[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.120]
Ready, please.

[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:42.640]
Please.

[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.200]
You're hard up and you show.

[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.360]
Call your travel agent today.

[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.380]
I sure will.

[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.000]
Slum 52 at WIOD.

[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.120]
We got a mobile in Boca.

[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.360]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:52.920]
OK.

[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.280]
You know, I've been trying to get a whole of you a couple of weeks back.

[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:02.840]
You were making some comments with regard to what's happened to a thoroughbred

[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.900]
racing in this country.

[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.800]
The obvious downswing in attendance and handle.

[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.420]
You know, it's the upie generation quit.

[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.840]
Didn't ever start going to the race track.

[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.920]
The older generation continued to go.

[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.340]
I'm involved in marking.

[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.360]
I've done studies.

[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:25.520]
I've done work for Nira and for the Fairclad for Jefferson Down.

[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.320]
And they had noted 17 and 3.25 percent decrease in attendance

[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.160]
and about an 18 percent decrease in handle over the years.

[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.040]
And we've done programs with giving away free parking programs.

[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.860]
And you know, 50 cents off on a beer and things like that that have turned around

[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.960]
at Jefferson's increase their attendance and handle by over 14, 15 percent.

[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.240]
So the problem is partly that of the race tracks.

[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.360]
They don't know who's at the track and the key is to establish a hardcore data place

[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.820]
but like who their customers are.

[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.320]
Well, you know, for example at Gulf Stream, if they don't know who's at the track,

[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.380]
then they must be wearing blinders, okay?

[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:07.960]
I mean, I don't know how that might make them.

[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.160]
The median age of those people is death.

[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.440]
And for example, using Tony Curtis to be the promotional hot shot for Gulf Stream this meeting.

[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.980]
To me, one of the most inane things.

[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.560]
I mean, they've already got all the blue hairs out there.

[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.740]
I mean, young people living and breathing people.

[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.160]
I don't even know who the hell Tony Curtis is.

[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.560]
And this is the problem that the fact that all the pair of mutuals in this state,

[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.820]
I can't speak for anywhere else.

[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.860]
But for years and years, they've been real comfortable sitting back and letting the blue hairs be the mainstay of their clientele.

[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.920]
And all of a sudden the lottery came along and all the blue hairs decided they'd rather spend their 50 cents of their dollar by a lottery ticket.

[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.560]
And they have no new clientele.

[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.980]
They haven't worked to develop them.

[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:55.280]
Well, right now, but the people that are retired now, they'll still go to the track, but they won't spend as much as they used to when they were working.

[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.740]
Well, I must have died off, okay? They don't live forever, so they're dying off if they had to be in replacement.

[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:00.980]
But I'm just saying it.

[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:06.160]
I mean, if you look at the attendance in a handle at Gulf Stream the last few days, it has been astonishing.

[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.980]
It's been so bad. Just horrendous.

[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.520]
Well, there are ticket sellers standing out in the aisles talking to you saying,

[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.660]
in fact, I got showed out. I got really picked a couple times at Gulf Stream.

[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:22.160]
They said they failed to put on 14 sellers today because attendance is down.

[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:29.240]
You know, I mean, if people are going without jobs, all they need to do is get smart where they're marketing and get to the end of people in there.

[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.080]
Yeah. I'm with you.

[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.540]
Well, I'll preach into the choir again, aren't I?

[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.700]
Yes, sir. Thanks a lot.

[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:35.740]
Good luck to you, you'll need it.

[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.860]
1155 at WIOD.

[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.840]
We have an open line on the Starline Star IOD and Palm Beach has been very quiet today.

[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.640]
We have no complaints.

[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.340]
It markets up almost 19 points.

[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.560]
6559463, 655 WIOD in Palm Beach, Pompano.

[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.800]
Welcome to McDonald's.

[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.260]
There you go.

[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.140]
Okay. We have an opening in date 751 WIOD. Coral Springs.

[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.560]
How are you doing?

[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.260]
I tuned in fairly late. I heard you talking about the Canadians and that material.

[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.900]
Did you see the article in the Herald today, the Lane Ranger?

[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.480]
The what?

[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.800]
The Lane Ranger.

[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.400]
No, I didn't see it. I don't get the Herald.

[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.440]
Okay. It's in the Broward Herald.

[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.140]
He apparently had done a column on Canadian drivers and...

[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.600]
Kids in Broward out of school this week.

[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.980]
Now I'm confused. The kids in day get out Thursday.

[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.400]
So they get like a week plus.

[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.320]
I'll tell you one thing. If I went to school in Broward and I found that the kids in day were getting longer more days off,

[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.720]
I would like to start a big revolution.

[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.220]
I wouldn't be out there at the beach hanging out, screwing around all week.

[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.660]
I'd be out there getting civically involved in whatever. I'd be screwing around.

[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.740]
21 after 10 at WIOD. Here's a mobile in Palm Beach.

[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.080]
Hi, Mia. How you doing?

[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.420]
Okay. So far.

[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.420]
Great. I can't believe my life is so empty that I have to wait my morning talking to you.

[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.440]
I'm going to join the club.

[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.340]
Well, you know, I look for them when I'm cruising in my vehicle talking on the car phone.

[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.060]
Yeah. There are a lot of people who feel...

[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:11.780]
In fact, you realize there are a lot of folks who just hold the phone up to their ear while they're driving.

[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.180]
We're talking to anybody because that costs some serious bucks.

[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.240]
But they hold it up so everybody else will look at them and think they're like an important businessman

[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.200]
and they're on some big international drug deal or something.

[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.680]
How did you know I'd do that, Neil?

[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.760]
Well, I can tell by the sound of your voice.

[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.840]
I can't believe it.

[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.700]
You don't want to sound like the kind of guy who sharp it up to have a cellular phone in the car

[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.800]
but too cheap to pay for. That's why you're on the starline because we pay for it.

[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.020]
Oh, absolutely. But I wait for my time and money talking to you.

[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.520]
I sure hope not. Why do you think we put that starline in there?

[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.500]
We realize very few people are stupid enough to call us out of cellular phone and pay for it themselves.

[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.120]
But if the sister is paid for it, hey, no problem.

[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.660]
Well, it's a good marketing fool in your part.

[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.800]
Yes, sir. I tell you, I chose what a six-brother.

[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.580]
How about that Danny Bonadoochie, sir?

[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.500]
Oh, Danny Bonadooch bag.

[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.500]
Can you spell that?

[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.660]
Not on the ear.

[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.220]
Oh, only once.

[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.760]
I can't believe you know one of the greatest throws I have is that?

[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:01.280]
Yeah.

[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.440]
They open up the closet door and look who popped out.

[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.020]
Yes.

[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.060]
It says he hid under the bed or in the closet?

[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.140]
In the closet with David.

[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.540]
Okay. And how is the room for you, David and him in there?

[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.240]
No, I'm out.

[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.040]
You're out or that's right. That's right.

[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.360]
And I'm going to take a lot of courage to do what you did.

[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:22.940]
What?

[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.500]
Turning out in the closet?

[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:24.980]
Exactly.

[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.400]
How did you see the scene who was in there?

[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.300]
Oh, my God.

[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:27.980]
So no one is in there.

[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.600]
Well, listen, have a wonderful life, sir.

[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.340]
There was controversy.

[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.180]
It was great, I was inquiring.

[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.460]
What are the callers again sometime when you really want to look important in the car?

[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.080]
1992.

[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:35.940]
Okay.

[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.460]
Soon enough for us.

[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.420]
We have one open line indeed, one in Broward to that star line.

[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.440]
If you want to look like a real hot shot, pick up that phone and call it's free.

[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.960]
You can we'll keep you on as long as you want.

[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.440]
Just drive around and make everybody feel like, hey, look at him.

[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.100]
A big business man, hot shot.

[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.840]
We had to play Mr. Businessman by race Stevens.

[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:58.600]
For all you really important people who sit there with a phone stuck in your ear, think I love about people that make phone calls in a car.

[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.480]
Is there like driving with one finger on a wheel?

[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.580]
I don't know where the other one is.

[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.660]
And they're like all over the road.

[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.820]
And just, hey, listen, I'm busy on a phone.

[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.880]
I can't be by the driving.

[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.920]
23 past 10 at your very important radio station, 610 WIOD.

[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:12.640]
And we'll be right back.

[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.560]
Sometimes I feel myself.

[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:26.800]
It's hard.

[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.880]
It is very hard.

[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.500]
1026 at WIOD.

[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.880]
Well, I'm going to start stealing some of Dick and Tater's cards today.

[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.840]
Okay, just very, I can't find that big grapes that they got on there.

[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.520]
The big belch.

[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.540]
That's my favorite card.

[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.060]
He's probably got it, got some code on it, you know, so I can't find it.

[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.780]
We do have an open line in Broward.

[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.860]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:45.920]
Don't get hysterical.

[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.660]
I'll just relax.

[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.940]
It's a beautiful day.

[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.620]
God, the birds are doing it on our cars in the backyard.

[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.060]
524 WIOD, 5249463.

[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.680]
Is there a number in Broward?

[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.660]
But first, we have a crank call from Delray.

[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.400]
No crank call today, Neil.

[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:01.640]
Hey, good morning.

[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.320]
How disappointing.

[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.420]
What a great night, last night of Pumpkin Open.

[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:06.920]
You were there?

[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.020]
I was right behind you at Fat Rich.

[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.580]
You were the guy with the two little kids?

[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:11.660]
No.

[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.460]
No, I was the guy with a friend of mine.

[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.100]
I shook your hand after the race.

[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.520]
Oh, you mean downed outside?

[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:16.980]
Right.

[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.180]
Oh, I thought you meant upstairs.

[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.980]
We had a guy with two little kids, very nice family.

[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.280]
But they had the TV said like they were not watching the races or even the ballgame.

[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:24.980]
They were watching like shows.

[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.480]
Oh, that's a shame.

[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.800]
Why don't the TV just cranked up blasting?

[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:29.480]
But that's okay.

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.020]
We like people that bring the kids out.

[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.840]
Get them used to the races and, you know, but loud TV.

[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.460]
Real loud.

[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.660]
Yeah, it was a great race.

[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.860]
Oh, it was incredible.

[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:41.960]
Yeah, I was a guy that was hollering probably in your ear when Joe started uncranking up around the table.

[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.860]
Yeah, I heard you.

[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.060]
Yeah.

[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.420]
Well, once you got clear, boy, you got the only question was, was you going to catch just say so.

[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.640]
I had to see open up three on the turn and I thought, boy, you may never catch him.

[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.060]
Yeah.

[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.160]
And of course, it also didn't hurt the key was stocking.

[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.780]
You got locked in on a rail behind a dying wall off.

[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.380]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.500]
You got out too late.

[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.000]
That helped.

[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.820]
But about 20 or 20 or 30 yards before the finish line you threw your hands up.

[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:03.640]
You knew you had to hit.

[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:04.840]
It was great.

[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.340]
I was there with some buddies of mine.

[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.860]
It was just, you know, it was just an unbelievable race.

[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.020]
That rich showed me his tickets.

[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.200]
He had nothing but fives, twos and savants.

[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:12.480]
Yeah.

[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.060]
Well, I was a mortal triple.

[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.520]
I don't know what the triple paying every.

[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.560]
I really know it all.

[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.580]
I mean, that's all I had, two, five and seven.

[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.840]
Yeah, I just went for the straight plunge with the five.

[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.120]
I didn't take no chances.

[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:22.960]
I don't want anything else.

[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.200]
Well, I said, 40 won't make you rich, but it's not bad.

[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:25.820]
I'll tell you that.

[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.540]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.640]
No, I had him a few times.

[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.740]
I wanted to tell you there was something sad to really happen up there.

[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.440]
Popping up the no park.

[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:36.600]
I don't know if you're familiar with it, but in the fourth race, there had been no Wrangler.

[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.240]
Donald Brainerd.

[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.440]
Donnie Brainerd went for win number 1,000 and didn't get it.

[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.540]
Yeah, well, he was actually what happened as he was bending over so far forward that I think he fell out of the bike

[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.260]
coming off there last turn and never to be seen again.

[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.100]
But I listen, he's not old come one of these days.

[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.920]
He had the worst part through to half and he was with a dead flesh through the lane.

[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.880]
I love the way he like crouches forward like any second we're going to get to that finish line.

[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:03.120]
Come on, we can get there and he does, but usually at the back of the pack.

[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.140]
Listen, I just like to tell everybody.

[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.240]
All the great skit there.

[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.820]
We had Dave Ingram get 2,000 a few days ago.

[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.660]
Michael chance got 6,000 Saturday night at the metal ends.

[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.520]
We almost had Donald Brainerd get number 1,000 on Monday.

[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.180]
That would have been great.

[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.540]
That would have been truly unbelievable.

[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:23.600]
But for all the folks that I try to get from this office to go up there as much as I plug Christmas lists,

[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:28.060]
one of these guys that go up there and spend some bucks and have a great time and see Neil and Fat Rich.

[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.040]
I like to call them all a major douchebag.

[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:31.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.180]
Well, congratulations.

[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.040]
Don't spend it all in one place.

[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.520]
All right.

[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.120]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:35.940]
Do you have a great day?

[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.360]
Yes.

[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.760]
And 30 at WID.

[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.840]
Harry is toying with our microphone here and has something in his hand.

[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:48.280]
Well, you know, we've been reporting all morning that MetroDate Police and the FBI were at Alberto San Pedro's home in highly this morning.

[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.220]
Little rig they know.

[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.280]
Little did we know at the time that San Pedro had already been arrested.

[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.220]
And they were executing warrants then.

[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.840]
They were executing?

[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.060]
Here's who's been arrested and here's what's happened.

[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.920]
Alberto San Pedro, Carlos Rodondo and Lester Steiner were arrested this morning based on a 9-1.

[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:16.880]
Count indictment which charges San Pedro and Rodondo as being part of a racketeering enterprise engaged in drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion, attempted murder and illegal gambling.

[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.740]
WIOD's Jennifer Rim is at the news conference with Dexter Leightman.

[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:25.640]
Yeah.

[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.140]
And we'll have further details on this.

[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.780]
I heard that Rick Sanchez drove over over there.

[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.000]
Is that true? Is there any truth in that?

[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:31.700]
No, it's not.

[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.900]
Can I comment no?

[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.680]
Okay, whatever you say. Well, that's pretty interesting.

[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.060]
Yeah.

[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.580]
And here we thought he was free as a bird.

[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.660]
Well, he'll be okay.

[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:46.960]
You know how that always goes.

[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:53.120]
This indictment, by the way, apparently was handed down on February 15th and has been sealed.

[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.500]
It's a 9-count indictment.

[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:02.820]
I heard that the arrest of him in a movie theater was watching Eating Raul in Haya Lea, which is the most popular movie over there now.

[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.820]
But it could be just one of those ugly rumors.

[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.260]
No, no I can't.

[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.540]
Okay.

[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.540]
Well, thank you so much Henry for that very uplifting news.

[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:10.160]
You're welcome.

[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.500]
It's always a pleasure and what do you have to say about that Rick?

[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.700]
It's hard. It is very hard.

[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.120]
Okay.

[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.300]
1031 at WIOD.

[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.680]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.600]
There he is, a great gentleman in his own mind.

[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.900]
Henry Barrow, great connoisseur and a cheap drunk.

[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.820]
5249463 in Broward and 655 WIOD.

[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.180]
What is it?

[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.820]
WIOD in Palm Beach.

[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:33.480]
Whatever it is.

[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.360]
You know what it is.

[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.960]
Why do I have to keep repeating it for you?

[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:36.860]
Is some kind of a lame brain?

[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.300]
Four-lauderdale.

[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:38.760]
Sorry.

[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:39.780]
Four-lauderdale.

[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.760]
Good morning Uncle Neil.

[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:41.860]
You remember me?

[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:42.340]
No.

[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:42.860]
Charles.

[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.380]
Oh Charles, what do you want?

[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.040]
Go away.

[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.900]
I just want to let you know I'm just going to hear him.

[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.980]
Charles, we already got ready with Charles.

[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:50.360]
Go away.

[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.180]
Call Norm Kett.

[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.320]
Call him in the office.

[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.100]
Come on.

[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.340]
He's anxious to hear from you.

[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.480]
We don't want to talk to you Charles.

[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.040]
You're a past.

[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:56.720]
You're a nuisance.

[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.120]
You're childers.

[00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:58.740]
You're juvenile.

[00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.640]
You're a barricade.

[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.840]
I brought up.

[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:01.800]
Unlikely.

[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.300]
Unlikely.

[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.040]
When can I come here?

[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.400]
You see there he goes.

[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.620]
Two open lines in Broward.

[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.040]
524 WIOD in Palm Beach.

[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.260]
6559463.

[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.060]
655 WIOD.

[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.820]
I can see it's going to be another struggle today.

[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:16.960]
But that's okay.

[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.280]
How about opening up those drapes there Andy?

[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.660]
Do us something useful.

[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.100]
Instead of just stepping in.

[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:23.900]
Stuff on the floor.

[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:24.560]
That's good.

[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.900]
No, that's not the way we do it.

[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.980]
We like to unfold those blinds.

[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.020]
Okay, that's it.

[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.300]
Just give it a little twist there.

[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.500]
That's great.

[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.660]
Anyway, we're going to be doing our show next Monday.

[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.960]
Great job, Andy Fabulous.

[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.400]
Maybe they can use you on the meds with an arm like that.

[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.060]
What was I starting to say?

[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.420]
Oh yeah, next Monday we're doing our show at the Fort Lauderdale

[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.640]
Swap Shop on sunrise between I-95 and the Turnpike.

[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.060]
And we've got all kinds of stuff to give away including now.

[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.760]
As the days go on, we'll have our crap together a little bit better.

[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.140]
Because you know how we do everything here.

[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.040]
Six packs of snapple soda that will be giving away a whole bunch of them.

[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.860]
One day passes to Atlantis, the water kingdom.

[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.780]
Those are worth 14 bucks a piece.

[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.720]
We've got Al Goldstein's going to come by and be our guest.

[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.720]
We're going to have carts there for sure.

[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.220]
If there are no cart machines, I'm leaving.

[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.580]
There will not be a circus.

[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:14.600]
That was a bunch of baloney.

[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.720]
And we'll have a lot of fun.

[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.220]
You can know.

[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:16.720]
What is it?

[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.220]
And subway subs will have to give away.

[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.860]
So we'll have all kinds of stuff for you next to Monday at the Swap Shop.

[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.000]
And of course you can browse and peruse.

[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.180]
And the good news is that most of those French Canadians are already leaving and probably be gone by then.

[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.320]
So we can just have a good time by us.

[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:30.680]
Okay.

[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:36.780]
And we'll be right there in the indoor shopping complex surrounded by those fantastic shops with every kind of merchandise under the sun.

[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.940]
And the International Food Court with every kind of food under the sun.

[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.380]
It's just going to be a 12 day.

[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:46.980]
Next Monday, 10 to 2 at the Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop on West Sunrise between I-95 and the Turnpike.

[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:47.420]
One.

[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.140]
See, I found it.

[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.240]
Wow.

[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.620]
It wasn't easy to find it.

[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:54.140]
It's hard.

[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.220]
It is very hard.

[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:57.800]
Yeah.

[00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.180]
Easy for you to say.

[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.260]
1037 at 610 W-I-O-D.

[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:05.260]
Hello, where will you stop after singing?

[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.800]
And you know what I wanted to ask this audience?

[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.640]
Of course, when I asked something, we never get a response.

[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.840]
Have you seen the walk thing that's been on for the last two years?

[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.940]
Wally Nash with the walk.

[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:15.960]
The handmade walk.

[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.300]
Made in the People's Republic of China that's on like every five minutes.

[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.600]
And if you have a satellite dish, it's on constantly.

[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.460]
It never goes off.

[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.000]
And we have used to be Arnold Morris, the Jewish chef.

[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.000]
Used to be on a push-and-out thing.

[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.420]
And now it's Chef Crowley, Jerry Crowley, who's one of my favorites.

[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.580]
He always, bye-bye for now with that little kind of faith-thing he does.

[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.640]
But the Wally Nash is on there.

[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.420]
The Englishman pushing those walks.

[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.280]
And I love at the end of the thing, they always say,

[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.620]
please remember, because these are handmade, there's a limited supply.

[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.280]
So be sure and call in for yours now.

[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.140]
And this thing's been on for two years.

[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:53.780]
And they show all the poor Chinaman over their banging and pounding with their ball-peeing hammers

[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.500]
and just hucking away on those things.

[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.400]
I'm curious if anybody's ever ball on those things.

[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.700]
No? Maybe nobody's ball won yet? That's possible.

[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.380]
Okay, we have two open lines in date counties, 751, WIOD.

[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:11.360]
You see the reason that that's a bad question is because that would require women probably to answer that.

[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.400]
And women are not ready to call yet today.

[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.520]
We have one open line in Palm Beach, 655, WIOD.

[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.300]
We have a mobile in Palm Beach Gardens.

[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:18.920]
NEO!

[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.500]
Yes, sir. How you doing?

[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.040]
Okay.

[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.380]
I got a story for you.

[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.040]
I was living out in California about seven years ago.

[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.520]
And a friend of mine was the...

[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.180]
Have you seen the walk thing?

[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.620]
As a matter of fact, I haven't bought one though.

[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:31.900]
Okay.

[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:37.300]
A friend of mine was the captain West Hollywood police department.

[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.580]
And I've always been fascinated with law enforcement.

[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.560]
So he asked me one night if I wanted to go out and ride with the guys.

[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:44.400]
Yeah.

[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:49.280]
And so I went out and they put me on what they call the HORP Patrol.

[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.360]
The HORP Patrol?

[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.800]
Yeah, this is a guy's honest truth.

[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:53.800]
They drive up...

[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.400]
They drive up Melrose and then down Sunset.

[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.480]
Melrose for the guys and Sunset for the girls.

[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.940]
And all of a sudden the guys that I was driving with must have spotted something.

[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:09.680]
Because they pulled over a brand new spank in 450 SL.

[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.240]
Yes, sir, was in the car.

[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.600]
Danny Bonedouc.

[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.460]
Danny Bonedouc.

[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:14.860]
Danny Bonedouc, back.

[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:15.720]
Are you serious?

[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:16.440]
I swear to God.

[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:17.880]
I swear to God.

[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.260]
So obviously...

[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.480]
Obviously he has a tough time getting his own magambo.

[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.620]
He's got to pay for it.

[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.020]
Really?

[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.240]
Well, evidently he's got interesting...

[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.080]
Well, I'm not sure what it is, you know.

[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.080]
He's in a closet with a prostitute, a transvestite prostitute.

[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:34.360]
Yes.

[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.400]
He must have got one hell of a surprise.

[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:42.220]
Well, he has a little gender problem because he was on that show and he couldn't figure out which one was suiting him.

[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:42.940]
Which one was David?

[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.640]
Because David always had the better hair.

[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:45.260]
Amazing.

[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:50.300]
In any case, in closing I want to say, the Fred Addy, he's a loving douchebag.

[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:51.860]
Thank you.

[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.240]
Okay, thank you so much.

[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.460]
It's 20 to 11 at 610 WIOD.

[00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:03.180]
I'm not going to make a big fuss about the salad today because I'm sure that it's going to come in on time, early in nice from sunny, right?

[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:08.840]
Do you notice yesterday how he was sucking around frantically about how, oh yeah, I'll send however many you want.

[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:10.420]
Now what the hell was that all about?

[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:18.440]
In the past, and then in the same breath he's saying, I was disappointed because you were giving it to somebody else last week.

[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:18.860]
Remember that?

[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.960]
Last Thursday and Friday you weren't eating it.

[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:25.080]
So in other words, he'll send it over here as long as I eat it and rave about it and salivate and go nuts.

[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:33.420]
But if I share it with beautiful, lovely, uh, Nilda up front or George, the beautiful, lovely, George or anybody else, then he's got a problem.

[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.500]
I don't understand that, sunny.

[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.760]
Just send a chow over here and we'll figure out who's going to eat it.

[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.000]
I know the Cheryl just marching up and down the hall just psychotic and surly.

[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:50.640]
We have an open line in Dave County 751, WIOD. Here's a mobile in Palm Beach.

[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:51.780]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:52.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:57.480]
I don't know about the hand made walk from the people's Republic of China, sir.

[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.480]
They're banging them out right here. There's another one.

[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.320]
I think the worst one is the vacuum hair cutters.

[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.260]
I haven't seen that. Somebody told me about that just yesterday.

[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.680]
Oh, I mean, over and over on prime network again and again.

[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.160]
So vacuum hair cutters?

[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:19.000]
They took up this hair cutter to a vacuum cleaner and a guy claims he's never cut it there before and so forth and so on.

[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:25.920]
Doesn't without a mirror and there's no mask and it's a new revel, it's going to replace the wall I guarantee you.

[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.160]
How do you know how much here you're cutting off?

[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:35.740]
Oh, they have these little things that look like giant combs they put on their different links so it can only hit your head so hard.

[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:36.860]
Oh, man.

[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.980]
You get swatched. He'll be on there and have for it everywhere.

[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.360]
Boy, look out, Miriam. You may be out of business, huh?

[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:42.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.960]
That's all I had to say and Joe's a douchebag.

[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:45.680]
Thank you, sir.

[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.460]
They hear a god almighty.

[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:51.480]
This, they know that 90% of the stuff they saw on TV is crap.

[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:56.160]
I like the ones, the slicers, you know, the little slicers and they have the blades you put in.

[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.000]
Then they have that woman who acts like she's like, well, there's a whole bunch of them.

[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:03.660]
There's the woman with the thing where she makes those sandwiches no matter what she puts in.

[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.420]
They all look the same.

[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.720]
What do they call that thing?

[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.300]
It's snapshot.

[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.420]
It looks like it probably weighs about two ounces.

[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.220]
And it's snapshot.

[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.420]
You know what I'm talking about.

[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.200]
Triangular thing.

[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.920]
Yeah, they make though every sandwich is like a big triangle.

[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:21.340]
And no matter what you put in it, and she's spooning, how about a little mushrooms and a little bit of olives.

[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:25.540]
And it's embarrassing because she's making like pudding and she's putting that crap in there.

[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.500]
But she's making pizzas.

[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.300]
And everything looks the same.

[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.480]
It looks really dried out and gross and like almost stale.

[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.020]
And she sticks it on the plate.

[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.000]
Isn't that beautiful?

[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.340]
And you know who's on that with her?

[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.020]
That big fat guy.

[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:43.120]
What's his name that's on in the afternoon on that stupid show, the big, uh, oh, what is his name?

[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.460]
And he shoveling down.

[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.060]
Oh, how about oh, it's so light.

[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.000]
Oh, and his eyeballs are rolling around.

[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.940]
How about any of those desserts, huh?

[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.420]
It looks like fat rich in heat.

[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.880]
Markets up 25 points, by the way.

[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.320]
Hell, but why told you it was a great day?

[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:57.860]
What is his name?

[00:46:58.900 --> 00:46:59.580]
Damn it.

[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.740]
But anyway, I'm even forgetting what they call that thing.

[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.100]
That's one of them.

[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.100]
And then it is the woman that's got that little, it looks like a, um,

[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.040]
I don't know what that looks like, but it's got a little thing coming down with a,

[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.000]
little tiny blade at the end.

[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.560]
And you stick it in here.

[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.540]
You stick it in the can of peanuts and you make peanut butter.

[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.800]
That's the way I would do it.

[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:23.220]
I would just stick it right in the can of those peanuts and make peanut butter in the can.

[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.520]
She looks like she's been on the can.

[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.620]
But, uh, and then she's making all, oh, it's just incredible.

[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.020]
Now you know that that stuff is all like tinkered toy junk.

[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.900]
And I guarantee that some of you have bought some.

[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:34.740]
What is it?

[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.220]
Snack master.

[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.220]
The snack master.

[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.720]
Thank you, whoever called that in the snack master.

[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:40.620]
Yes.

[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.940]
And you just stick your little thing in there and it comes out with these triangles

[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.860]
and they all you stick them on that plate and the kids like troll match and beat the crap out of you

[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.560]
for trying to pass off that crap as a snack.

[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:53.520]
Miramar.

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.180]
Yeah, Neil, sonny.

[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.500]
I can't bring your salad in but I can bring you a snack master sandwich.

[00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.440]
Well, okay, sonny.

[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:00.860]
Boy, your voice you're changing your hair.

[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.280]
Look at that.

[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:01.720]
You're here.

[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:02.880]
Hey, Neil.

[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.840]
Maybe you need one of those hair cutting vacuum cleaners here by Kirby.

[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.680]
It just looks the hair right off your head.

[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.020]
I can.

[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.120]
It can look like zero mostell in about two minutes.

[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.620]
It's like my ear off.

[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:12.560]
Hey, listen.

[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.380]
Watch this.

[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.600]
About Danny, uh, Danny Bonnet.

[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:17.320]
Oh, man.

[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.520]
I got to have my own card.

[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:18.960]
That's a good one.

[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.120]
I got to have my own card.

[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:20.580]
I'm sorry.

[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.000]
I don't usually steal the terrible.

[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.540]
That's the best belch in history.

[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.740]
What a red.

[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:25.940]
That was a nine.

[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:27.380]
Ooh.

[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.520]
Oh, God.

[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.020]
There's different ones on there too.

[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:30.460]
Aren't there?

[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.780]
I think there's different ones.

[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.760]
Control yourself now.

[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.960]
Boy, listen that.

[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.120]
Don't ever get that card back.

[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:36.700]
Believe me.

[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.220]
About Danny Donnet douchebag, he has to read between the lines.

[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:43.420]
Yeah.

[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:43.580]

[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:43.660]

[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.820]
See, he paid a 20 and it was a transvestite when he asked for the second act.

[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.980]
The transvestite couldn't do it and said, hey, he had to review himself.

[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.360]
And then so Danny freaked out and beat him up.

[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.520]
Man, that could be it.

[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.180]
And as far as I can find it.

[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:58.920]
It turned out to be David.

[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.380]
I couldn't believe it was disgusting.

[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.480]
It's finding a guy in his closet.

[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.400]
How did they get in the house without a search warrant?

[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.440]
Well, you know, you would not, now don't start getting into all these details.

[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.500]
I mean, he probably made the story up in the first place.

[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.280]
Yeah, but it's exciting.

[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.020]
This is the kind of stuff that America loves.

[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.980]
It'll be on a hard copy and soft copy.

[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.840]
And that's what we like.

[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.460]
Okay.

[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.560]
You see hard copy yesterday with Fred Schatz?

[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.420]
No, I didn't.

[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.520]
The alleged doctor Fred.

[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.020]
It's hard.

[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.980]
It is very hard.

[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.600]
That's what he said when that show was over.

[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:26.540]
He can't control himself.

[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:27.600]
He's a very hard copy.

[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.420]
That'll be on the Saturday.

[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.500]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.720]
1045 at WIOD.

[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.280]
We're starting to pick up a little steam now.

[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.420]
I want that snack master.

[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.540]
That's not what they call it.

[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.560]
That's the other one.

[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.520]
Now they have another name for it, don't they?

[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.160]
The snack, the something.

[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.060]
The piece of crap is what they call it.

[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.480]
And what's that guy's name?

[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.800]
The big fat guy always worth that blood, same black sweater

[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.220]
in his eyeballs roll around.

[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.880]
And he puts that stuff.

[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.800]
It looks like fluff.

[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.340]
It looks like marshmallow fluff in a big glass.

[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.700]
And he starts eating that with a spoon.

[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.700]
And he says, you think he's like having some kind of

[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.340]
any emotional experience or something?

[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.340]
What the hell is his name?

[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.040]
Don't you people know anything?

[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.540]
Coconut of Grove.

[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.000]
Same as Go-Sing in the same old talking.

[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.140]
Let's take a call from Coral Springs.

[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:15.600]
Hello.

[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.760]
Hello, Uncle Neil.

[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:17.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:18.960]
Hey, I'm enjoying your radio.

[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.420]
Well, that's great.

[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.300]
Sir, so are we.

[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.400]
We're having a time of our lives without Patrick Williams.

[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.800]
I see the walkman on television.

[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:26.320]
The what?

[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:27.140]
The walkman.

[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:27.900]
The Wally Nash.

[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:28.600]
Yeah.

[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.900]
And you know, he put in all the vegetables and then he puts in

[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.320]
like three little pieces of meat.

[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.600]
And he says, my boss is cheap too.

[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.000]
That's why you don't get much meat.

[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:39.540]
Yeah.

[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.020]
I wonder what he meant by that.

[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:45.340]
Hey, listen, I'm in Ex-New Yorker and I'm enjoying Florida.

[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.680]
I've moved down here for good.

[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:47.400]
The only.

[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:48.260]
Oh, boy.

[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.940]
The only disagreement I have is with these French Canadians.

[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.120]
I have one as a neighbor.

[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.360]
Well, are all even, sir.

[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.260]
Is your neighbor still here?

[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.320]
Yeah, they always here.

[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.100]
Well, driving to the bus station, okay?

[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.780]
Tell them the hockey playoff start today.

[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.780]
It's time to get the races back where they came from.

[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.100]
Okay, Parley Wu, Adios.

[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:04.040]
Hey, listen.

[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:04.500]
Yes.

[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.620]
Could you do me a favor?

[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:06.260]
I doubt it.

[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:07.220]
I doubt it.

[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:07.740]
What is it?

[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.660]
Well, if he can, my sister's here for me.

[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.540]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.400]
Your sister's here from Saskatchewan, from Moosejaw.

[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.860]
Well, I'd like to hear the I-95.

[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:16.240]
Good.

[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.440]
Well, tell her to keep listening in one day we'll play it.

[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.620]
1047 at WIOD.

[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.960]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.660]
524-9463.

[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.600]
That has got to be, I got to confess because it's not mine.

[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.320]
But listen, I'm easy when it comes to steel and material.

[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.500]
That's got to be the greatest card in history, doesn't it?

[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.420]
Got to be certainly one of the top three already and we haven't just started it.

[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.300]
So, you know, it's like a lot of other things they start with it and then we make it famous.

[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.580]
1047 at WIOD.

[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:46.820]
We'll take a little break here.

[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.380]
We'll be right back.

[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.540]
51 at WIOD.

[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.880]
Kind of a furious first hour here today for a Tuesday.

[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.020]
I would say that myself.

[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.700]
655 WIOD.

[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.820]
There's an open line in Palm Beach.

[00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:01.660]
Christopher Hewitt is the big fat guy with the bugging out eyes and a stupid look and all that crap.

[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:05.180]
Anyway, he's on some idiotic show that's on any afternoon.

[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:06.160]
Rewrons or something.

[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.240]
I have no idea what it is.

[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.200]
What is it?

[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.240]
Oh, Mr. Belvedere.

[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:10.500]
That's who that is.

[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.660]
What a slime ball.

[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:12.560]
Pompano.

[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.040]
Hello.

[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:14.760]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:15.680]
Neil, how are you doing?

[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.080]
Okay.

[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.020]
Two things.

[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:24.760]
I was over at Pompano Track last night and first time I saw you in person like I was going to come over and shake you around but you surrounded by fat rich.

[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.900]
Yeah, that's, he's my bodyguard.

[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:27.260]
Yeah.

[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:32.060]
And the other is I've no anti-orong clean from town like but I'm speaking with you.

[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:32.060]

[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:32.920]
I'm speaking with you.

[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:32.920]

[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:33.000]

[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:33.980]
What is your own clean from town?

[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.280]
But if you get chance, will you play spick it in freeway?

[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.300]
What is this request Tuesday?

[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.400]
We don't do requests, sir.

[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.000]
Well, if you get a chance, though, will you play it?

[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:44.400]
Unlikely.

[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.640]
1052 at WIOD.

[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.920]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:48.980]
I don't understand this.

[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.200]
All of a sudden, I don't know where.

[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.720]
We got all these different things in here.

[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.520]
We got our walk up in a year on the stove.

[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.000]
And this guy and he's, we got two in a row there.

[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.320]
Oh, my aunt's in from St. Louis and this guy doesn't have anybody in and I can understand why.

[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:02.300]
Forget it.

[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:02.920]
Forget it.

[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.820]
We're just, we're doing a radio show here, okay?

[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.960]
Put a quarter in the slot.

[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.640]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.420]
655-9463.

[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.940]
We still have no lady who bought a walk.

[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.280]
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.

[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:16.540]
Around here.

[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.100]
Yes.

[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.660]
Yeah, I originally called to tell you Christopher Ewitt but I guess I'm already called.

[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:25.960]
Did you ever see him?

[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:26.940]
No.

[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.400]
He's the producer though.

[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.500]
The movie the producer.

[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:29.720]
No.

[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.840]
You never saw the movie the producer?

[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.220]
Yeah, with Mel Brooks.

[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:34.700]
Right.

[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:35.160]

[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:39.280]
He played the flavor producer, movie producer, play producer.

[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.300]
That's one of my favorite movies, The Producers.

[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.100]
Oh, really?

[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.000]
Well, it was springtime for Hitler?

[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:44.580]
Yeah.

[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:45.060]
Right.

[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.100]
Well, that's what I've called out.

[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.640]
You had an amazing, but I actually remember that.

[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.300]
Because I have a blank in my mind about movies.

[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.660]
Well, it's not my fault.

[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:53.780]
I'm just explaining.

[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.780]
I'm not blaming it on you.

[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:56.700]
You don't get defensive and psychotic about it.

[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.280]
I'm just telling you, I'm admitting it's one of mine.

[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.060]
I was originally in Hollywood now and you're playing me.

[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.100]
By the time I got on the air, Jesus Christ.

[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.640]
Well, I'm not meant to call you to tell you Christopher Ewitt.

[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.680]
Somebody already did it.

[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.320]
Well, I'm glad you hung on to tell us that.

[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.620]
That was very kind of you, sir.

[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:13.380]
Okay.

[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:14.580]
Bye, Neil.

[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:15.500]
See ya.

[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:16.800]
Dusprig.

[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:19.540]
1054 at WYOD.

[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:20.900]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.000]
5249463.

[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:23.700]
And guess what?

[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.860]
The dial line you hear, the dial tone is on Palm Beach.

[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:30.360]
6559463.

[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.840]
They don't know Christopher Ewitt from Martin Ewitt.

[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.260]
Whatever happened to Martin Ewitt, by the way.

[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.460]
Do you remember that movie Endless Love?

[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.900]
Wasn't that the name of the movie with the Brook Shields?

[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.880]
That was a good movie.

[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.300]
That was depressing movie, but a good movie.

[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:44.480]
And he burned the house down.

[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:45.540]
I don't blame him, okay?

[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.260]
That was Pannon-E-As parents, man.

[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.380]
Oh, that was the movie.

[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.380]
Who was the guy that was in that scene?

[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:53.680]
I'm going to lose it.

[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:57.620]
Don played her father, Don Marie.

[00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:58.900]
Was that his name?

[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.180]
Played Brook Shields.

[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:03.120]
She had those real hippie type parents that were smoking dope

[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:03.880]
with all the guys.

[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.780]
And the mother saw them by the fireplace on the living room floor.

[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.600]
Remember, she was coming down the stairs and she took a look

[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.500]
and got all goosey eyed and hysterical and pretty excited.

[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:20.160]
I wonder what she was thinking as she stood there

[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.280]
at the top of the stairway.

[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:21.860]
It's hard.

[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.840]
It is very hard.

[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.320]
We have a caller in Kendall.

[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:27.240]
Um, yeah.

[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:28.940]
Oh, it's the space lady.

[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.400]
Well, like you know that, um...

[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.280]
Yeah, like what?

[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.960]
That snack master thing.

[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:35.880]
You know that.

[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.600]
You snack that is snack.

[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.260]
Yeah, you know.

[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:37.880]
Like your language.

[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:43.560]
You never get a witch radio personality actually bought one.

[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.000]
Probably Greg butyl.

[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:45.660]
No.

[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.900]
Um, Greg were thing.

[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:49.460]
He was talking about it.

[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:50.700]
He did it with the disaster.

[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:52.300]
He doesn't talk to you, does he?

[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:53.360]
Well, he was...

[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:53.720]
Yeah, he was...

[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.220]
No wonder he's been a little repressed lately.

[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:58.740]
I think he's getting Norman Kent to sue.

[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:00.820]
Yeah.

[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:02.360]
I would too.

[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.320]
What do you think about that little pit squeak, Danny Bonadoo-Cher?

[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:06.300]
Oh, no.

[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:06.600]
What?

[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.780]
Oh, God, he's getting desperate.

[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:10.520]
Yeah.

[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.360]
How'd you like to open up your closet and find him crawling around in there?

[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.020]
Yeah.

[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:15.580]
Amen.

[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.080]
Well, have a good one.

[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:18.060]
Bye, man.

[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:18.880]
Okay.

[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:23.340]
Yeah.

[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:24.280]
Amen.

[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:24.980]
I like her.

[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:25.600]
She's okay.

[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.420]
She's my kind of dingy bitch.

[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.880]
We have an open line in a day, 7519463.

[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:34.500]
Do you get to feeling this little psychosis in the year in this building?

[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.500]
Do you get that feeling as you walk around the byways and highways and the hallways?

[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:38.900]
Boy.

[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.600]
I think some of it had to do with those ball games this weekend.

[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.800]
I mean, this town finally did something great.

[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.340]
It really came out through and gigantic numbers.

[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.020]
It was a tremendous experience.

[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:54.360]
It gave us like 75 more strikes up as far as getting that major league franchise.

[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:57.260]
And yet inside this building, there just seems to be a little...

[00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:57.940]
No.

[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.740]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.260]
Hello, Neil.

[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:02.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:03.440]
Hi.

[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:05.100]
This is Mark, first time caller.

[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:05.960]
Yes, Mark.

[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:06.860]
How are you doing, Mark?

[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:07.760]
Not bad.

[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:10.560]
95 is pretty clean.

[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.460]
And on the subject of these TV ads.

[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:13.880]
Yeah.

[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:19.540]
Has anybody brought up the run list stockings that we hear maybe they're trying to do TV ads?

[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.040]
Well, maybe that was the problem.

[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:24.140]
Maybe they had the runs and the closet.

[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.680]
Also, a few weeks ago, you played something by the FUGS.

[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.280]
I think it's called Bloops a Lotter Something.

[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.960]
Yeah, it's not by the FUGS.

[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:35.900]
Was that the right song, though, that I just said?

[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:36.380]
Yeah.

[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.240]
Well, thanks, Neil, for the first call.

[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.660]
And I just want to say that Matt and Jack, you're...

[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:42.140]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:43.440]
What about the song?

[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:43.940]
I don't understand.

[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.660]
As long as great, I used to listen to it when I was a kid.

[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:54.500]
I thought it was a pretty neat, neat rendition of a great classic.

[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:58.440]
Yeah, a great classic along the lines with the I-95 song.

[00:57:58.620 --> 00:57:58.820]
Right.

[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:05.400]
But I had a good chuckle listening to it, and I didn't think anybody else in the South Florida knew about it.

[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.200]
But you're obviously a man of taste.

[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.540]
That's what they call me, sir.

[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:10.560]
Have a great life.

[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:11.060]
You too.

[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.000]
1057 at WIOD.

[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.080]
There's one open line now.

[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.140]
It's on that Starline.

[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:19.180]
If you've got Bellsoft Mobility, man, we'll end up pay the big bucks for a couple of minutes anyway.

[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:20.820]
That's Star IOD.

[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.060]
Here's a mobile in Miami, paying for their own.

[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:24.300]
Hey, Neil.

[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:25.620]
How are you?

[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:26.140]
Pretty good.

[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:26.560]
Good.

[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:31.660]
In the producers, I know the younger guy was with an Eugene Wilder.

[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:32.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.460]
And the older guy was who?

[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.200]
Don De la Weeze, or I can't read it.

[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.460]
Don De la Weeze, that's correct.

[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:38.080]
Is that correct?

[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:38.420]
Yeah.

[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.200]
Great movie.

[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.660]
And Bankrock was in it.

[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.120]
Terrific, terrific movie.

[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:42.800]
It's a little classic.

[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:43.280]
Yeah.

[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:44.160]
Yeah.

[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.220]
That's all I wanted to say.

[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.340]
And also, low-me $50.

[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.280]
Okay, Larry.

[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:47.640]
All right.

[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.120]
See you.

[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.420]
1058 at Goodall WIOD.

[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:51.920]
We have an open line.

[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.660]
Well, it was kind of a sad day when you read that kind of stuff about these trucks.

[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.540]
I hated Danny Bonarducci anyway.

[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:56.960]
Didn't you all.

[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:57.280]
Didn't you?

[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.520]
Everybody hate him and that's you.

[00:58:58.620 --> 00:58:59.240]
Oh, disgusting.

[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:03.560]
I've been like, Dan, Dave Madden, Ruben Kincaid, better than him.

[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.600]
And I couldn't stand him.

[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:06.480]
The Dippy Agent.

[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.580]
Oh, man.

[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:08.400]
Is he a dip?

[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:10.180]
He does some spots.

[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.300]
You notice all these old character actors, they do spots.

[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:16.620]
And they make a lot of money doing commercials, too, by the way.

[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:19.620]
But they sure can't get any other works that they do a lot of spots.

[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.420]
Like Tom Bosley.

[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.320]
Oh, man.

[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:27.580]
There, I swear to you, if there's one person in the history of television who can make me nauseous and too sad,

[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.860]
I'd like to take a gigantic, glad bag and stick him in it, okay?

[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:36.420]
And like, just take that twist on tie and tie it up so tight that no air could possibly penetrate.

[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.320]
And then just like put it in a gigantic incinerator.

[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:41.980]
Oh, man.

[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.280]
Tom Bosley.

[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.140]
There's another one of those TV shows.

[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.300]
Happy day, Scott.

[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:48.280]
Oh, maybe what did you people see in that show?

[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.520]
Fonzie Henry Winkler's total slime ball.

[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:52.140]
Idiot.

[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:52.860]
Moron.

[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:53.980]
And Richie.

[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:56.040]
With his cocoon now.

[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:56.680]
What is his name?

[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.640]
That replied Richie.

[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:58.560]
What's his name?

[00:59:58.560 --> 00:59:59.560]
Come on, get with it.

[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.900]
It's got to be sharp on his show.

[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:02.120]
Richie on.

[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:02.960]
Ronnie Howard.

[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.320]
Of course.

[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.700]
See you knew it all the time.

[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.000]
And speaking of that, look at that.

[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:11.420]
With his body shirt, there's Mani just came in looking like a real sleaze bag.

[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.500]
Clean yourself up.

[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:12.960]
Will you please?

[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.120]
Last guy dressed like that.

[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:14.740]
Here is Ken.

[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.620]
Henry Barrow's got the 11 o'clock news.

[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.860]
The latest on that Alberto San Pedro thing.

[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:25.700]
Boy, I bet you there are people right in this block who are getting emotional and psychotic about that story.

[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.460]
And then we'll come back at 11 o'clock.

[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.060]
Rick and Suds with a mystery.

[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.080]
It says here, Dick and Tater from 2 to 6.

[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.640]
