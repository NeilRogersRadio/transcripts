[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]
So in any of the under 64-demography?

[00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.940]
Woo! In!

[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.760]
Incredible.

[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.840]
Here's a pick report on a starline.

[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.940]
Fail! Yeah!

[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.060]
Hey listen real quick, back out, I'm not there now, but just to get 9 for 75, get on that turn bike.

[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.820]
Yep.

[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.820]
Right at the bottom baby, waiting pretty.

[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.520]
Okay.

[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.780]
Hey listen, I want to say something real quick about the dolphin.

[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.480]
Yes sir.

[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.640]
I'm from the distance Tony from Berk.

[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.100]
I'm not really a football fan.

[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.660]
I mean, the lions were never nothing to be proud of.

[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.360]
But, you know, I live here now, so I start to bruise with a team.

[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.940]
Exactly, get on the bandwagon.

[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.920]
And you know something though?

[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.660]
I got to be honest with you.

[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.280]
When they got to, when they got to touchdown, I was jumping up and down having a good time in the living room.

[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.480]
But when they came back as fast as they did in those three plays, and before you know it, they were already on the 50s.

[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.560]
I thought that they'd choke.

[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.560]
And I gave up my hope.

[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.960]
And my girl told me, well don't give up now, you know, there's still time.

[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.920]
And I said, no, they're going to kick that field goal.

[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.100]
I kind of felt bad because I gave up.

[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.240]
And I guess that was wrong, but I'm flat.

[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.260]
I got to hang in there pal.

[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.660]
I know.

[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.120]
I'm hanging there.

[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.260]
It ain't over till it's over.

[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.160]
Let me tell you something.

[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.920]
That was exciting.

[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.760]
It was phenomenal.

[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.880]
I wish I could have been there.

[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.980]
Just to see everybody going nuts like that.

[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.540]
You could tell if it was just one of the best games to be at.

[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.940]
Ever.

[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.340]
I'm going to ask you a couple football questions.

[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.860]
I know nothing about football.

[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580]
All right, real quick, real quick.

[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.200]
If the dolphins beat the bills, or wind the dolphins beat the bills, that means what?

[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.720]
Did they go?

[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.940]
They play the winner of the Raider Bengal game.

[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.020]
Okay, and that was the AFC championship.

[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.600]
All right, now is that considered the Super Bowl after that game?

[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.380]
Well, whoever wins that game goes to the Super Bowl against the winner of the NFC.

[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.240]
Oh, okay.

[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.740]
All right.

[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.760]
So in other words, there's like three more games.

[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.380]
Right, so there's still three away from you being getting in it.

[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.840]
Wow, this is exciting.

[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.880]
Well, I'm going to be there at Joe Raider.

[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.060]
I'm going to check out that the bar there on Saturday.

[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.780]
Okay, Tony.

[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.640]
All right, listen to me.

[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.240]
Take it easy.

[00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.840]
All right.

[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.600]
Wow.

[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.780]
12.33 now.

[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.100]
Is that from Pomano Park?

[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.700]
Okay, and the piece on this too.

[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.760]
Okay, it's 12.39.

[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.680]
It's just too much stuff going on here today, man.

[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.940]
Why can't everybody be like Miriam?

[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.720]
She's like Lightning.

[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.220]
She came in here and snipped that hair.

[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.920]
She's on here.

[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.120]
She is incredible.

[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.400]
And now Phil Saltsman's bugging me.

[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.600]
Oh, I forgot to mention, by the way, Phil Saltsman picked five winners the day that we were out there Friday at Calder.

[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.000]
Of course, none of them paid over a dollar.

[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.680]
He had the bet three for 20, 20, 20, 20, 16.

[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.780]
Phil, your picking was great, but the prices were a brutal, brutal.

[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.360]
All right.

[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.480]
Well, the first race is over already, so we can't pick that.

[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.500]
Oh, there's Clara's boy in the second race.

[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.060]
That's it.

[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.140]
How can we go against Clara's boy?

[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.580]
Well, I'm going to pick against him.

[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.880]
Okay.

[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.380]
He's got the rail in the six-per-long race.

[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.020]
I'm going with Parsamonius and Heriberto Castillo.

[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.720]
I'm going with Junior.

[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.640]
Parsamonius, I can't pick Clara's boy.

[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.420]
I just can't do it.

[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.980]
It probably will.

[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.440]
All right, 1240.

[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.200]
Let's go to Miami.

[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.600]
Hello.

[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.680]
Oh, yeah?

[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.400]

[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.780]
That guy that was talking to you about the satellite.

[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.560]
Yeah.

[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.040]
It was all wrong.

[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.540]

[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.080]
But I don't listen.

[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.800]
I can't take the luxury of me.

[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.140]
You're like six people in the whole audience.

[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.100]
We have a satellite dish.

[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.760]
And one woman in cross-springs who's still waiting for Denenberg to do something.

[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.940]
I can't put the whole audience into a coma with another terminal thing on satellite dish.

[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.040]
I look as right as satellite today.

[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.560]
1241 at WIlde.

[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.720]
We have an open line at Dave County.

[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.580]
What is going on around here, man?

[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.080]
What is going on?

[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.000]
The phone is ringing and this one is in that.

[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.540]
This place is still not come back from the holidays.

[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.340]
It really has it.

[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.980]
This place is so disoriented and disorganized.

[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.800]
And yesterday, I'm listening to Rick and Sudden Marvin's wandering around a building.

[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.140]
And the traffic is from other stations on it.

[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.100]
This place is like a hysteria city.

[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.020]
Let's all settle down and get back to the realities of the Cool Harsh world, okay?

[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.000]
West Palm Beach.

[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.220]
No, what's up, buddy?

[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.160]
You go out and buy some lottery tickets and we're going to have 27 million.

[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.680]
How's it going?

[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.680]
Pretty good, pal.

[00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.460]
True dolphin here.

[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.500]
I was at the game the other day.

[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.200]
Okay.

[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.900]
And that place was rocking.

[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.600]
It was rocking and sucking, man.

[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.080]
It was like, wow.

[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.560]
You almost had a look around to make sure you were in Miami.

[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.760]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.380]
I really didn't.

[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.900]
Especially when the crowd was like leaving.

[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.480]
Everybody was singing and chanting.

[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.080]
Yep.

[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.760]
Incredible.

[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.680]
It was fantastic.

[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.580]
This also saw that movie.

[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.080]
You're talking about last night.

[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.780]
Great flick.

[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.280]
Backfire.

[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.220]
Backfire.

[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.640]
Hello.

[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.020]
Yeah.

[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.460]
How long ago since I talked about it, I almost forgot about it.

[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.620]
I know.

[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.940]
I know.

[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.320]
You want to talk about it.

[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.820]
Backfire.

[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.120]
It was an outstanding move.

[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.240]
What happened in the beginning?

[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.220]
I kind of got in a little thinking.

[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.140]
Well, I didn't see the very beginning, but just in the beginning came back from Vietnam.

[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.020]
And he kept having all these flashbacks.

[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.440]
I didn't see the first few minutes.

[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.240]
Right, and the eyes and the bed, oh.

[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.940]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.560]
Well, she kept was plotting with her first boyfriend to do them in.

[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.240]
And you know, it worked out perfectly.

[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.220]
And then the first boyfriend chickened out and kind of got really busy.

[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.020]
Very complicated.

[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.920]
She kind of got his head hanging to her.

[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.760]
They're so to speak.

[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.120]

[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.380]
We're eyes on a platter on the bed anyway.

[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.240]
That was pretty well.

[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.700]
Yeah.

[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.260]
How about, you know, what do you think about this Buffalo game coming up?

[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.940]
You think Miami's going to rush a few more people and like three people at a time?

[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.800]
Well, I don't know.

[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.880]
After all these games we've played to suggest we're going to have a pass rush in this game.

[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.440]
I believe it when I see it.

[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.040]
That's probably the weakest link on the team is that we give the other quarterback all day through that ball.

[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.880]
He could ate a ham sandwich back then.

[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.700]
That's the only thing that I just am desperately praying for.

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.760]
But we'll see, you know, everything you never know.

[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.880]
Buffalo's had a lot of erratic games too.

[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.740]
I'm not trying to sound cocky about the game, but they've had a lot of erratic games where they just were off their feet.

[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.380]
If we get by them, I think we'll make it to the Super Bowl.

[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.820]
You know it.

[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.040]
Okay.

[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.460]
Bill, the douchebag.

[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.020]
Okay.

[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.740]
Take care, Neil.

[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.940]
1243 and other ratings are what happened to the old days?

[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.460]
You know, these people don't care about any of their stations anymore.

[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.920]
What do they care about?

[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.320]
Anything?

[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.440]
Man.

[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.740]
Except calling on the bat line.

[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.400]
Who the hell is that on the bat line now?

[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.980]
Who is that?

[00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.220]
Who?

[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.860]
Phil Who?

[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.940]
Phil Who?

[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.720]
Okay, there he is.

[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.620]
Before we just got...

[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.780]
My head is swimming.

[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.780]
I feel like Esther Williams.

[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.180]
Oh, I'm sorry, that was bad.

[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.780]
I don't want to be ostracized.

[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.560]
Huh?

[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.260]
Esther Williams was never this big.

[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.020]
That whole silly crap over there, boy.

[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.100]
Are they desperate or what?

[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.960]
I'm waiting for Alston Ossman.

[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.880]
Tell all the other stuff.

[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.120]
We heard that a million times before.

[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.960]
Let's hear the good stuff, Al.

[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.300]
Come on.

[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.100]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.960]
655-946-3.

[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.680]
And I got to tell you something.

[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.920]
Here's a guy, Norman Kent, who is a friend who's my lawyer.

[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.360]
And he works there doing mornings on light bulb radio.

[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.720]
He has no clue what's going on over there.

[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.400]
Now, your witness, was he not just on the phone here during the New News break?

[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.700]
And everything he told me was garbage.

[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.600]
It was a bunch of crap.

[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.680]
And it wasn't the guy on the phone before, and he's not out of the day,

[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.520]
but he's going to go on with him and buy him on his in Uranus.

[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.400]
And, Norm, you haven't got a clue.

[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.100]
I think the baseball card stuff is getting to your brain.

[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.580]
That rotisserie baseball is starting to affect your mind, okay?

[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.720]
Too many Mike Falecki cards.

[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.960]
1247-1WIO-DN, where we're ostracized.

[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.440]
We're cut short from society.

[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.200]
And if you don't believe it, just take a peek.

[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.700]
Here's the X10W.

[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.420]
It's an accident question.

[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.260]
We never looked at night.

[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.180]
Was Hank on it all during this book?

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.540]
When did Hank go on here at night?

[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.360]
Of course, he's never on anyway.

[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.620]
When did he go on?

[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.220]
In November?

[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.240]
I don't remember it.

[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.060]
Where the hell is nighttime, 12 plus?

[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.800]
Okay, let's have fun with that while we take a call from Boka.

[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.020]
Hey, Neil, what's going on?

[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.440]
We're doing it.

[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.780]
Good, this is Rico Tico train from Boka, down over here.

[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.940]
I want to know what happened in the 20,000 pounds of beef in Kansas City.

[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.200]
Hey, you're on the wrong show, Rico.

[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.620]
Call up Rick and Pud, okay? That's their deal.

[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.500]
Give your beef to them.

[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.300]
All right? Don't even know what the show is listening to.

[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.200]
Let's see.

[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.720]
Where's the 7 of midnight?

[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.460]
Here we go. 12 plus.

[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.720]
Not on the first page.

[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.000]
Wanted to Hank go on?

[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.560]
We don't know.

[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.720]
About a month ago?

[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.100]
We don't know.

[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.680]
Not on the second page.

[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.840]
Coast 3, 4 at night.

[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.600]
IOD 292-333.

[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.600]
That's the highest number at night.

[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.100]
A little while.

[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.960]
We'll give the credit to Hank.

[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.860]
Okay, he deserves it.

[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.000]
Maybe he'll give us a tip someday.

[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.920]
Of course, that'll come in.

[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.020]
We have an open-line in Broward 524-WIOD Miami.

[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.080]
Hello, Neil.

[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:22.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.380]
How you doing?

[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.160]
I'm doing it.

[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:24.940]
Very good.

[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.220]
Neil, I need some numbers for some of the Hispanic stations.

[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:27.900]
Spanish stations.

[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:28.840]
Why is that?

[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.680]
On the FM dial.

[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.060]
On the FM dial?

[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:31.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.540]
Lay it on us.

[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.100]
We can't look.

[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.280]
How did XDJ do?

[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.160]
Money through Sunday, 6th, 7th, midnight.

[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.280]
Okay.

[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.460]
Boy, here's the guys.

[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.680]
Even give me the adenol.

[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.380]
What station do you work on?

[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.500]
Competition.

[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.280]
WXDJ, that's the radio rhythm.

[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.280]
What's that?

[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.280]
4, or what?

[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.400]
2554.

[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.100]
Well, you will first get a 12 plus.

[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:53.520]
No.

[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.140]
I can't give me 12.

[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.660]
Well, no.

[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.440]
One at the time.

[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.340]
I got it right here.

[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.180]
Well, that's a bonus.

[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.300]
Okay, give me 12 plus.

[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.540]
4 out of a 3.4.

[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.420]
Okay.

[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.160]
Okay.

[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.440]
Now, if you work at a competition, you should be happy about it.

[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.360]
How do you have CMQ do?

[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.620]
Well, just a minute.

[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.240]
25 to 54.

[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:07.860]
Here we go.

[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.620]
6th, A.M.

[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:08.900]
The midnight.

[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.240]
Now, what do you want to know?

[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:10.740]
XDJ.

[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.320]
WXDJ.

[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.700]
There are, let's see.

[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.940]
Now, they're from a 4.5 down to a 3.8.

[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.660]
We'll find a CMQ from a 3.1 to a 3.9.

[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.080]
Beat them.

[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:19.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.520]
Yeah.

[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.060]
All right.

[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.240]
Very good.

[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:23.940]
Say hi to Russ.

[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.680]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.780]
Probably Russ Oasis assistant.

[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.300]
We have an open line in Date County 751 Russ is a douchebag 751 WIdeers.

[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.860]
Hank came on November 20th.

[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.860]
So this includes about a little bit of Hank.

[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.700]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.400]
I don't want to say which park because we can't say that on the air.

[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.960]
Well, Steve can say a lot.

[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.820]
Mobile in Palm Beach.

[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:47.960]
Good morning.

[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:48.780]
When is this?

[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.120]
And how are you today?

[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.860]
When is Tarde.

[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.300]
I wanted to tell you, you're right, your buddy that called Chuck E.

[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.200]
He's been, you've been taking a high hard one for the past hour on FDL.

[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:58.940]
Oh, boy.

[00:09:59.220 --> 00:09:59.480]
I am.

[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.600]
Did you know that you are an emotional basketball case?

[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.340]
Absolutely.

[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:11.200]
And I'll tell you, guard has, guard has offer to pay for your therapy if you agree to go.

[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.320]
Oh, I'm so impressed.

[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.220]
Do I have to wait?

[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.560]
Do I have to wear a dress or a skirt when I go?

[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.000]
I just, would you believe that just started taking calls about 10 minutes ago.

[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.340]
And about 75% of what I've been able to hear because I'm up for a point now.

[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.340]
And there's some Del Rey station that's just bleeding all over.

[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.140]
Yeah, it's great.

[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.520]
You'll be surprised at the amount of callers that are saying, you know,

[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.560]
get off your high alert and, you know, leave the poor guy alone.

[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.120]
Yeah.

[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.080]
Or else maybe Alice should make a little statement and kind of clear the air.

[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.400]
Oh, they will, they read your letter.

[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.220]
Or the letter that was mailed to you.

[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:40.680]
Yeah.

[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.020]
And it was a very emotional experience for everyone involved.

[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.000]
Why is that?

[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.900]
We already told a story about Alice at the Palace.

[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.640]
It was a joke.

[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.160]
I mean, then how they're trying to make a big sexual thing out of it.

[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.800]
Well, it's not only that, but they're saying, you know, 22 kids a day.

[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.460]
Yeah, right.

[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.240]
Because they listen to this show, right?

[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:57.660]
Absolutely.

[00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.780]
Let me, let me say this to you.

[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:58.980]
Okay.

[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.500]
I don't want to dignify them by going on too much, but I'm going to repeat what I said yesterday.

[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.900]
When other people, in my position, are as out front and open and, you know, as I am,

[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.840]
and can laugh about it and have a good time and tell other people to do the same thing

[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.680]
and not take any crap from everybody no matter what they are, then we'll have something.

[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:15.980]
Okay.

[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.920]
So why doesn't this crackpot take his time and effort and go after the people who are harassing

[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.520]
gays and other minorities instead of going on a year trying to help WFT, you know, make some waves.

[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.540]
I help Alice get on.

[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.180]
Here's the guy from what I'm told.

[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.500]
He's a personal friend of Ali.

[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.920]
He was on Al Shoa and WS News.

[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.820]
And they're so contrived.

[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:38.920]
And of course, in the back of my mind, I really have to wonder who is behind all of us contrived controversy.

[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.040]
I wouldn't want to suggest by any spirit to the imagination that anybody we all know and love could have whipped us up,

[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.060]
you know, to again manipulate, use Neo Rogers as the battering ram to get attention.

[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.120]
But do you think there's any possibility of that, Steve?

[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.080]
Oh, excuse me.

[00:11:52.820 --> 00:12:01.140]
Well, I guess what they're trying to say is that you're emotionally disturbed and you're just ashamed of what's going on.

[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.340]
That's right. That's why I'm in the closet, right, Alice?

[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.820]
Oh, is that a little backward, I guess, huh?

[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:06.580]
Oh, well.

[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.600]
Have a great life, Phil.

[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.800]
Thanks for the report.

[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.320]
And it's interesting.

[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.600]
We certainly haven't been flooded with reports, have we?

[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:13.880]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.580]
I wonder why?

[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.020]
We have an open line on the Starline, it's Star-I-O-D.

[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.460]
And no, let me just convey a message to Norm.

[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.980]
You know, if you're going to be on a station playing radio and pretending to be a, whatever you're supposed to be,

[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.560]
at least like find out what's going on over there.

[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:27.860]
Will you?

[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.480]
You're giving us some bum information, okay?

[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.000]
I mean, we've got to depend on our conor spies out there to find out what's really going on.

[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.160]
Well, let's see, Norm's office though is building with a lot of heavy cement wall.

[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.480]
It probably can't pick it up in there, right?

[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.260]
Are you still working on it, Henry?

[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:41.840]
Can you get it yet?

[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.600]
No, I can't.

[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.620]
I really can't.

[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.480]
Wow, I'm telling you.

[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.820]
Barrow has been back there, he's been twisting it and turning it, the antenna that is, and just can't handle it.

[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.620]
A pig report on a mobile.

[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.660]
Hey, Neil.

[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:53.600]
Yeah?

[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.680]
They're out here, all over the 95 right now.

[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.140]
Yeah.

[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.420]
They're like sitting in the middle under the bridge and they're sitting in front of solid cars not hiding.

[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.420]
Where is that?

[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.180]
I just between your motto road and glazed.

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.100]
Between your mama road?

[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.760]
I'm out of wood and glazed.

[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.340]
They try to get me, but I slow down too quick.

[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:12.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.640]
Yeah, I was coming in this morning on the turn-flight.

[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.680]
They're on just when you get around the Jorabi Stadium there, you know, there's that overpass.

[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:19.940]
Yeah.

[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.800]
And he's sitting up there on the overpass.

[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.200]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.220]
A pig on the bridge.

[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:24.560]
Huh?

[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.420]
You want to call that dog?

[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.340]
You're a pig on a platter.

[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.220]
There you go.

[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:28.740]
Yeah.

[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.280]
Well, everybody who was driving by was yelling, jump, jump.

[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.460]
Have a great day.

[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.320]
I tell you what, I want to do my civic, all American duty by letting everybody know that they're out there.

[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.340]
They're great Americans here.

[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:39.820]
Thank you.

[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.200]
Thanks a lot.

[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.220]
Okay, slow down.

[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.360]
1258, they had all the new cars.

[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.500]
No, in fact, they didn't have all the new cars on this point.

[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.060]
They were doing a thing on a CBS morning news from the auto show, the big auto show and Detroit that opens in a couple of days like a little preview.

[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.800]
And Leigh Aia Cokum must have bought out the whole CBS network because all they were showing it was basically at least the part that I saw, Christly.

[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:04.820]
The Dodgs, the Viper, which is going to be incredible, which Rick Riley has already ordered two or three, but after he sees the book, he may sell one.

[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.620]
But I don't understand that.

[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.280]
What was that all about?

[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:16.660]
All we kept seeing was Christly this and Dodgs that and I'm sure that we did see like a BMW, a big $75,000 Bimmer.

[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.520]
But maybe I just missed the good parts.

[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.140]
Poor Lauderdale.

[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.240]
You know what's up.

[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:23.900]
How you doing?

[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.860]
Are you at the game setting?

[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:26.940]
The atmosphere great.

[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.540]
It was phenomenal.

[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.140]
It was.

[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.220]
It was unspeakable.

[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.320]
That came out of the ribbon.

[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.440]
In history of mankind.

[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.320]
Could be one of the great games in history of Leigh.

[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:34.900]
So loud.

[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:35.620]
Yeah.

[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.000]
Great.

[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.540]
Hey, how about Sammy, though?

[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.300]
You get pretty good.

[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.100]
That's right.

[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.240]
Maybe he got a wake up call.

[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.560]
The board always looked like he was like speed walking.

[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.140]
You know?

[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.800]
It looked like it was played touch football.

[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.020]
And he was really hitting the holes pretty hard.

[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.420]
You bet.

[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.940]
We definitely need offered all back, too.

[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:50.220]
Amen.

[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.460]
Let's kick their ass.

[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.980]
I just wanted to say, Lou Holtz is a douchebag.

[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.300]
Well said, pal.

[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:55.680]
Thank you.

[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.060]
What a great call.

[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:57.480]
Hey, really?

[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.420]
I mean, he really capsized the entire world right there in about 30 seconds, which is just

[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.420]
what we needed because Elaine is not taking no for an answer.

[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.980]
She's got that news in that newsroom.

[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.740]
And she's not taking a crap from anybody anymore.

[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.840]
That's her New Year's resolution from any of those real old guys.

[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.280]
Rick and Sods with the payphone challenge to the sixth this afternoon.

[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.900]
Sports talk at 605.

[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.100]
Hank Goldberg with quarterback coach Gary Stevens.

[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.560]
I've been trying to get that in all the time.

[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.500]
We'll just keep running the music.

[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.160]
Keep running that.

[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.140]
Seven at W-I-O-D.

[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.660]
And I just want to say this.

[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.860]
I had a couple of calls off the year during the news.

[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.880]
So I know what's going on with Alice and with F-D-L and with Charles, whatever his real name is.

[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:40.540]
And there is no question in my mind who has orchestrated this fiasco, this debacle, this outrage over there.

[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.420]
And quite frankly, most people are not listening to it anyway.

[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.100]
And secondly, you know what it reminds me of when I was on Zeta?

[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.420]
And certain unnamed parties were going after me when we don't talk about it on this station.

[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.220]
And I told you why and we won't.

[00:15:54.300 --> 00:16:01.580]
And certain individuals over here with the initials SK were calling this parties every day and aiding and abetting and feeding it with a lot of crap.

[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.480]
And then when I came over here all of a sudden and tables turned around, wow.

[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.020]
Boy, what a mistake.

[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.880]
And now Steve, you're trying to do it with somebody else because you have this up to talk about neurosis.

[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:20.400]
You've got this obsession with neo-roggers that's like beyond, I mean so far beyond the scope of anything normal or acceptable.

[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.540]
It's just an obsession.

[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.940]
And you really believe you're going to build a whole radio station by neo-bashing every day and talking about neo-roggers.

[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.420]
I got news for that kid's old real old.

[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.480]
I mean, I do a lot of bashing but I like spread it around a little bit, okay?

[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.540]
In addition to which, well, I'm not even doing it.

[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.380]
I wouldn't even dignified by going into it, okay?

[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.820]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.900]
Hey, neo, how you doing?

[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.420]
Okay.

[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.740]
My family jewels are ticklish and Steve can is God.

[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.040]
Let's go to Miami. Hello.

[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:51.960]
Hello, Neil.

[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:52.440]
Yeah.

[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.280]
This is Bob.

[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.060]
Yeah, Bob. How you doing, Bob?

[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.520]
Good. How are you today, young man?

[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:56.520]

[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:05.480]
I just have a problem with this guy as the Miami-Herald Edwin Pope writing down that the Dauphin's man handles the offensive line of the chief.

[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.100]
I think he was a little outraged by saying that, don't you?

[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.680]
Yeah, a little carried away.

[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.800]
A little carried away?

[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.240]
Mm-hmm.

[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.340]
And also...

[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:18.260]
Because Christian Acquie, what did he gain like 80-some odd yards and he only played mostly in the second hand?

[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.300]
Right, right.

[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.560]
I think this guy was watching the rerun of the game.

[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.060]
Well, Edwin the Pope is just...he's in the twilight zone.

[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.480]
He thinks he's a big time sports writer and he writes for the Herald.

[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.360]
So you got to...understand, I'd look the other way.

[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.120]
Yeah, I think he hits the consistent stand in the first half a little too much.

[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.640]
Yeah, like some of the fans do.

[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.640]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.220]
Uh, another question, Neil.

[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.040]
Why don't we do this for the Dauphin?

[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.140]
Not go up there, save the money and put the money to the Camel's house.

[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.940]
Have a great life, pal.

[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.560]
All right, great.

[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.500]
109 at WIOD, we have an open line at Dave County.

[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.220]
So whatever that...do you understand what that means?

[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:51.680]
No.

[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.760]
751-9463, let's go to a mobile in Deerfield.

[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.340]
Hey, Neil.

[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:57.920]
How you doing?

[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.280]
My speaker phone sucks.

[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.420]
Yeah, I can tell.

[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.460]
I can barely hear you.

[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.560]
How's this? Is that better, sir?

[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.120]
That's great.

[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:04.640]
Okay.

[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.040]
Don't worry about these people bashing you.

[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.700]
They've got to get a life anyway.

[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.540]
Well, no, but it's just so pathetic.

[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.980]
I mean, it's so transparent.

[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.940]
There's desperate attempt to make like a whole radio station out of Neil Rogers 24 hours ago.

[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.480]
Why don't they just put my picture on their billboards or whatever promotion they're going to have

[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.240]
and just call it Neil Rogers Radio.

[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.140]
It's unprecedented.

[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.600]
I've never heard of such a thing.

[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.000]
Maybe you get some royalties out of it.

[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.580]
There you go.

[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.320]
Maybe Steve is on the way to the front.

[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:28.760]
All right, it's the new year.

[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.180]
You there?

[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.060]
Yeah, I'm here.

[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.560]
There's a crappy connection.

[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.400]
As far as it's off and go, that was a great game.

[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.320]
And everybody's saying, oh, they're going to go up the buffalo and they're going to go up the buffalo.

[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.880]
I think they're going to ride the occasion.

[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.100]
Well, first of all, anybody who is saying that is some kind of a fan.

[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.580]
I mean, I realize we could get whipped again up there.

[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.080]
It's possible buffalo is a hell of a team.

[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.220]
But, you know, it's a game.

[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.860]
It's one day.

[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.120]
One game, anything can happen.

[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.620]
Okay. So if you're a real fan, you don't say those kind of things.

[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.200]
You're optimistic and you hope for the best.

[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.760]
But you don't say third time to charm.

[00:18:59.020 --> 00:18:59.320]
Okay.

[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.260]
Thank you.

[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:00.560]
Good day.

[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.840]
My way beat him the first time.

[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.640]
Anybody forget that?

[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.920]
We beat the crap out of down here.

[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.660]
31 to 6.

[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.540]
Did anybody forget that?

[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:05.920]
I guess.

[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.000]
We have an open line at Dave County, 751 and one on the Star Line star, I-O-D.

[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:12.980]
Who is that?

[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.780]
Phil Saltsman is on the line already?

[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:16.360]
Yes.

[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.060]
Wow.

[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.620]
I can't.

[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:19.580]
Let's go.

[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.640]
Boy, he must have had a hell of a new year, you know what?

[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.820]
I think he was out in the mushroom field in Ojos.

[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.160]
One 19 at W-I-O-D, Pompo-Doh.

[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.240]
Hey, I had no.

[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.160]
Couple things.

[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.420]
First of all, in regards to the Pompo-Doh, the harness track.

[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:35.800]
Yeah.

[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.120]
When I read on the program, I need a little bit of advice here.

[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.820]
Noritz's SVD dash and then ground, GR-O-U-N-V.

[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.260]
Saving ground.

[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.200]
What does that mean?

[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.080]
It means a horse has stayed on a rail all the way or most of the way in the sl-

[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.340]
That's not usually a very good sign.

[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.740]
In other words, if a horse is second or third and it's a saved ground,

[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.780]
I mean, it doesn't mean he won't run well the next time,

[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.980]
but it means that he might look like he raised better than he did

[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.280]
because he stayed on the inside.

[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.980]
Oh, he'd never made a movie to stay on the inside.

[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.340]
Right.

[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.500]
Well, he'd never made a move off the rail.

[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.120]
Kind of like Osvaldo for me.

[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:12.920]
Yeah.

[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.520]
There you go.

[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:13.820]
Excellent.

[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.580]
Did he ever raise that horse again, by the way?

[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.300]
I don't yet.

[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.180]
Where is it?

[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:18.920]
I don't know.

[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.080]
I think it makes it still be in the barn.

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.260]
Maybe he left town.

[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:27.440]
By the way, when you went to your break, I kind of switched over to Alice.

[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.280]
At Alice.

[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.960]
And I think they made him fake doing what they're doing.

[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.580]
They're getting bad.

[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.480]
I don't know if you're monitoring or not.

[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.120]
No, first of all, I couldn't pick it up here if my life depended on inside the building.

[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.420]
You can hear it in the car a little bit out on 79th, but inside of building no way.

[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.320]
And secondly, I mean, I'm embarrassed for them.

[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.000]
I mean, first of all, here's the guy comes down here.

[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.560]
Oh, I have no desire to talk about Nia.

[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.360]
We're going to talk issues or talk about the Middle East.

[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.180]
All the stuff that's going on in the world today and the best thing to do is to bring this guy on,

[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.840]
who's a personal friend of his, who doesn't even use his real name.

[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.360]
He's such a coward.

[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.260]
And come on a year to attack me and to make up all kinds of crap.

[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.480]
You know, if they want to, I mean, that's all a fantasy.

[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.880]
But if that's what Alice show is going to consist of, I think at least we ought to have a little honesty in there.

[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.720]
So why doesn't he tell us what he's all about?

[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.080]
Okay.

[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.120]
If he's so concerned about Nia and my sex life or alleged sex life and what I'm interested in and what I say,

[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.500]
why don't we hear more about him?

[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.160]
It's his show.

[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.680]
That's what the rash came in.

[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.400]
He has no answers.

[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.720]
Oh, he has no answers.

[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.240]
Well, you know, when the people who work with him on his own station call him a wimp.

[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.120]
And I'm not making that up.

[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.000]
He was called that twice yesterday by people who work in his own station.

[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:33.860]
I think that should give you a good reason why you know, coward sits back there, bring somebody else on to bash me.

[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.800]
Why can't he do it himself?

[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.720]
Maybe you don't have the balls to do it.

[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.300]
Maybe somebody ought to check.

[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.400]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:40.900]
Good luck.

[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:43.580]
Unbelievable.

[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.160]
Just incredible.

[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.980]
But just predictable.

[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:53.800]
You know, like I said, when Steve first started over there, bring all his friends over and start this whole thing and manipulate people and try to get people to do this and say that.

[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.080]
And it's amazing because Norm can't tell me just as recently as a couple of days ago, oh,

[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.620]
has no desire to talk about you and Steve is the one that keeps supposing to do this.

[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.900]
Steve, and of course, we know that's true.

[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.160]
I remember the one of the most embarrassing shows I ever heard in my life was when Steve was over here.

[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.540]
And I was still in Zeta and he brought in Bob Kunst and his good pal Rick Cideman with whom he's joined at the hip.

[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.840]
And they for said it was almost I guess probably verbatim what they're doing over there today with different cast of characters.

[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:26.300]
And making up all this fantasy about who I do this with and who I go dream about and who I do.

[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.020]
It's amazing because these are people I don't even socialize with and never have.

[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.360]
And yet they've got all this fantasy in their heads.

[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.540]
And of course, Steve has spent his whole adult life on a psychiatrist couch.

[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.040]
And yet he has crotes over there telling all the rest of us that were nuts, etc and so on.

[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.180]
At a boy's feet and they're no homeless either. They're all just a bunch of bones.

[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.900]
I mean, King Paul, I got news for you.

[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.420]
Like I said before you just grace to the business, you change format every five minutes.

[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:56.500]
And you turn, you know, the keys over to your station to a bunch of guys to play radio.

[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.000]
I think it's embarrassing.

[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.220]
I was going to buy a car. I'd have to really think pretty long and hard about that, you know.

[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.040]
22 after one at WI OG Fort Lauderdale.

[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.280]
A meal. Yes.

[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:17.060]
The only good thing about FPR is between 11 at night and about three in the morning.

[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.780]
You don't have to listen to any commercials.

[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.800]
Did you know that?

[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:22.680]
Why is that?

[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:27.180]
I guess they just work for free. Who knows?

[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.220]
Well, Craig is on from 10 to 2, isn't he?

[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:29.940]
It's very good.

[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.160]
Well, you'll never hear me not Craig. Craig is a good friend of mine and a good guy.

[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.480]
He's not you either.

[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.160]
That's right. And you never will hear it either because Craig is not a phony baloney and not a

[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.140]
not a desparado. He's a good guy. He's got a he's a good talent.

[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.160]
He's like WSTER. He just doesn't say that.

[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.660]
Well, I wouldn't say that. But yeah, he just goes in and entertains.

[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.900]
He's got a good sense of humor and you'll never hear me not Craig. That's for sure.

[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.040]
Neil, I'm going to Vegas again on Monday.

[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:53.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.800]
I went in August.

[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.500]
Yeah. A couple of years ago, I had serious illness.

[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.380]
And I listened to you talk about your trip when you stayed at the Trappocannis.

[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:02.580]
Right.

[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.440]
That if I ever get better, I'm going to go.

[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.200]
Well, I went in August and I had a great time.

[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.560]
How can you not have a great trip?

[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.640]
Absolutely. The nicest people in the world.

[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.700]
The nicest, I've been 20 years in the Air Force.

[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.020]
As they say, as they say in Vegas, you bet.

[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.360]
Even the guy, I don't care if they had their own nights.

[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:18.940]
You bet.

[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.700]
And this time I'm going to be saying at the Aladdin, I did stay at the Trappocannis like you said.

[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:26.780]
You stayed.

[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.180]
Yeah.

[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.080]
Which was nice, but didn't have a horse room.

[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.620]
You know, the sportsport.

[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.260]
Sportsport.

[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:33.600]
Yeah.

[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.920]
Ali Aladdin's got a decent sportsport.

[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.920]
Not great. It's okay.

[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.680]
But let me tell you what happened to me, Neil.

[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.580]
I was tired and run down when I got there.

[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.240]
From all my surgery.

[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.780]
But the second day when I found the sportsport got to the Aladdin.

[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.560]
I had four tracks going in between races.

[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.760]
I was running out playing roulette shoot.

[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.340]
Right. That's what I had to do.

[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.460]
I was running back.

[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.640]
My friend who went with me said, try if you look like you never spent a day in the hospital.

[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.900]
I just got finished with 100 days in there.

[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.480]
So I have to thank you a little bit for my recovery.

[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.880]
Okay. Well, go on.

[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.200]
If you make a big killing out there, just remember us.

[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:09.500]
Okay.

[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.760]
Well, I remember Dr. Joe Greer, Dr. Millicope.

[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.380]
Okay.

[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:14.080]
Do it that way.

[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.000]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.940]
No, I sure don't.

[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.040]
I'm very appreciative of what you're doing.

[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.120]
Okay. Good luck to you, sir. Let us know how you make out.

[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:19.460]
Okay.

[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.000]
I know. Okay.

[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.180]
124 Mr. Riley's in a building.

[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.220]
Mr. Riley.

[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:27.180]
What?

[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.040]
Got kind of a quimp.

[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.080]
Now, if you heard any of this attack that's been going on,

[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.320]
come on in here for just a second and let's play the game a little bit.

[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:36.620]
Okay.

[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.180]
Let's give them what they want.

[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.880]
Let's give them a little bit of attention because I look in that I'm scoured.

[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.740]
Those pages and I can't find hide in her hair.

[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.640]
I'll hold 65 plus.

[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.560]
I think they got a pretty decent number like about a two.

[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.720]
What is it now?

[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.000]
About about 125 in the afternoon.

[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:53.380]
Yeah.

[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.380]
It's about 82.

[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.100]
You got it.

[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.460]
You know, you've been in the business long enough.

[00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.380]
You know the market.

[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.280]
Your summation is perfect.

[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.000]
See, there are some people with good intentions like called it off the year.

[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.540]
And I appreciate getting a little spy report.

[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.100]
I'm not going to get hysterical.

[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.220]
They're being sucked into it.

[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.240]
That's just what I'm trying.

[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.100]
They want me to do is to get sucked into a big screaming war and back and forth.

[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.960]
I mean, Alice is small potatoes.

[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.280]
When I was on I and Z and he was on NWS, I had a nine share.

[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.860]
He had a two seven and most of his people over the age of 200.

[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.240]
Alice like a cheap imitation of me and he's been at for years.

[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.100]
He doesn't have an act.

[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.040]
He has no sense of humor.

[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.460]
He certainly is a wimp like his friends call him because he's got no courage.

[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.260]
No balls to stand up and be counted for any cause, whatever it is.

[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.400]
And here he's over there bringing egg in the sky.

[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.320]
I was got an organization of three people.

[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.360]
Three people.

[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:38.700]
Yeah.

[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.260]
And Steve Bosch and the Broward Herald has evidently given the sky a lot of coverage.

[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.060]
He's got him convinced.

[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.520]
He's whatever he is.

[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:44.780]
You know.

[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.940]
And it's just it's ridiculous.

[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.800]
Like they're going to tell me what I'm going to say and what my sense of humor is going to be.

[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.000]
It's a joke.

[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:54.880]
It's embarrassing.

[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:55.540]
You're right.

[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.500]
And like I said, with all the things that are going on in the world that they're supposed to be detox station.

[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.660]
And they're still clamoring away to try to suck me into what big contrived radio war.

[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.140]
I mean, this has got to be like the third time.

[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.600]
Well, I don't know what terms they're putting it in because I haven't heard it.

[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:14.120]
But I know I did hear somebody said Steve said I'm declaring war on neo-rodgers.

[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.520]
And now that was like two weeks ago.

[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.500]
And if it no shots have been fired yet.

[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.580]
And then Norm came on a couple of mornings ago and I did hear it.

[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.400]
I'm declaring war in a person of funny way because Norm and I are a friend.

[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.480]
But I mean, there's this ain't the war.

[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.740]
There may be a war next Tuesday or thereafter, but this ain't the war.

[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.340]
Listening to you, you make it sound interesting.

[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.640]
So I punch over there to see what's going on.

[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.680]
Yeah, and it's boring.

[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:36.280]
Yeah.

[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.820]
You know, you stick with it for a minute and it's boring.

[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.120]
It's the same old proud.

[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.040]
Yeah, how many months that I sit here in the summer and have MTV on and talk about the Nelson twins.

[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.960]
I don't deny what my tastes are.

[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.100]
Okay, I'm not interested in minors in spite of whatever crap they're given over there.

[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.180]
But, but, hey, I'm interested in good looking young guys.

[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.720]
Just like a lot of guys, my age are interested in good looking young women.

[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.980]
I have no problem with them.

[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.840]
I've talked about it and joke about it for years.

[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.060]
Right on the air here.

[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.960]
Now, there are other people on the air in this community who have very similar tastes

[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:08.460]
who used to put up pictures of what's David Kishon Cassidy back at WNWS

[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.880]
and other young Peter Barton and people like that.

[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.480]
If they want to talk about it on the air, that's their business.

[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.340]
Okay, if they're ashamed of it and embarrassed and cower in a closet, then they got a problem.

[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.660]
I don't have any problem with it.

[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.400]
Well, in between the time they wrote the letter and the time he made the appearance on the show,

[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.140]
I think they forgot about that freedom of speech deal.

[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.960]
So they kind of backed off a little bit and said, well,

[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.300]
and they're going to disavow you.

[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.500]
You can't be one of them anymore.

[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.240]
Well, I'm ostracized.

[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.080]
Yeah, I can't be a day.

[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.320]
You can't be one of them anymore.

[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:34.740]
Are you sure?

[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.160]
I think so.

[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.260]
Well, I feel so sorry about that.

[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.400]
What does that say?

[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.860]
There's crap about kids committing suicide.

[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.860]
You see, it's people who are persecuted by people like this Charles Peak or whatever his real name is.

[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.940]
It doesn't have the bulls use real name.

[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.980]
And this kind of crap isn't interesting.

[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.820]
We have witch hunts from people on the far right.

[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.640]
And you expect them as unpleasant as they are.

[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.260]
But when people who are members of groups who have been persecuted start doing the same crap,

[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.060]
it reminds me of Joe McCarthy and Roy Cohen and the 50s witch hunts.

[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.440]
You know the whole same kind of crap coming from within your own so-called people.

[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.920]
There is no gay community here and there never has been.

[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.520]
This is not a city like in San Francisco or New York where there's like this big body.

[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.460]
There's a population, but there's no such thing.

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.040]
Okay, in addition to which even if there were, I'm not interested in that.

[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.640]
I'm interested in being me as a human being, making my statements, living my life,

[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.260]
and having my sense of humor, and not having somebody else dictate to me what I can say and what I can't.

[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.800]
And that's just the way it's going to be.

[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:34.520]
Exactly.

[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.100]
And they can do the same crap every day for the next 10 years.

[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.120]
It's not going to, certainly the audience isn't going to be impressed by it.

[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.540]
They're going to be revolted and turned off by it and embarrassed by it.

[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.220]
Your summation was totally accurate.

[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.000]
It's a contrived.

[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.300]
Yeah.

[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.320]
And you know, it's something that they figured they could evolve.

[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:50.720]
And let me say it again.

[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.280]
Well, if they're going to contrived something, what are they going to go after?

[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.520]
And let me say it again before he even gets on the year.

[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.960]
This station, as you know, we had gigantic kiss in September in the year ratings.

[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.340]
And hey, we joke about all the time when they're great.

[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.420]
We'll take credit when they're bad.

[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:04.860]
We'll cry.

[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.680]
But they bounce around.

[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.220]
But the fact is you've got solid numbers in there.

[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.180]
You bet they dropped.

[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:10.920]
Okay.

[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.520]
Mine dropped.

[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.520]
Reenerees dropped a lot.

[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.460]
The fact is they're still solid.

[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.280]
I look the rest of the numbers here.

[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:16.900]
I've got all the sheets.

[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:17.700]
You see them right there.

[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.020]
35 to 64.

[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:20.840]
I can't even find.

[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:27.520]
Now, Steve has gone from a one to last month in the trend to a one three, which is hardly any two months out of the three in the book.

[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.000]
That's not exactly something to write home about.

[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:36.200]
In addition to which, when you look through the demos, there is nothing there in any of the demos under 64 male or female.

[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.940]
So obviously that one three is almost all 65 plus, which is the FTL audience.

[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.540]
Now, I realize they've only started the thing a short time.

[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.520]
And it's going to take some time.

[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.380]
I'm not going to be unrealistic.

[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.960]
But as far as making this gigantic impact in a third baby.

[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.640]
So if he wants to come on to the, oh, gee, they took another hit over their recon suds.

[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.680]
They really suck and try to sell it like he's taken the audience away.

[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.340]
Well, I got news.

[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.260]
It has it ain't in here.

[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:58.480]
Yeah.

[00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:58.760]
Okay.

[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.820]
Everything settles in.

[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.580]
And to come on like they're doing and trying to get a big thing going like I say, I punched over there.

[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.740]
I was ready to hear you know something good happened.

[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.360]
Just something just lively, something interesting.

[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.400]
It's boring.

[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:13.760]
A minute and a half.

[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.740]
And you want to tune away.

[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.240]
I don't understand how they can keep it going for two.

[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.260]
One time decadent.

[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:18.880]
I don't know.

[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:19.960]
I have no idea.

[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.540]
And that's, that's got to be like almost a world record.

[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.680]
And all of a sudden, like I said before, he did a couple of real good ones over here.

[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.180]
Yeah.

[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.320]
Well, he had the unmanagementable one on one time for three hours doing basically the same thing.

[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.660]
And then he did that show with cider and coins, which I can't even describe how gruesome it was.

[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.360]
It was just ridiculous.

[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.140]
And again, just making stuff up as they go along.

[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.740]
These are not people I socialize with or have anything to do with.

[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:41.940]
Yeah.

[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:46.380]
In addition to which stuff that they would like to dredge up from 15, 18 years ago.

[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.740]
Okay, that's ancient history.

[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:48.260]
Okay.

[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.800]
Ancient history.

[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.280]
Like times that I worked with Rantel.

[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.860]
How long has it been since I worked with him?

[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.620]
I left WNWS in December of 83.

[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.600]
So it's been like seven, almost eight years, seven, over seven years since I've left there.

[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.760]
I had, I think I had dinner with him once or twice in the interim, spoke to him once or twice beyond it,

[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:06.680]
having nothing to do with him.

[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.540]
But I'd sure like to find out.

[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:15.460]
You know, if he wants to start doing this about delving into things, I'd be fascinated to hear him tell us more about himself.

[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:20.620]
And about the people he's lived with the last seven years since we've kind of parted or gone different gateways.

[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.540]
And you know, let's find out just instead of this cow.

[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.820]
You know, my mother's on the phone.

[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.620]
She's crying.

[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.560]
I mean, grow up already.

[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.220]
Well, yeah, geez, I gotta understand what you're like a little punk kid.

[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.100]
But now the guy's got about 35 years old.

[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.300]
He's got to be 34, 35.

[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.160]
Time to grow up already, Alice.

[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.160]
And stop being a, a whim.

[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.140]
I mean, when your friends are calling you a whim, behind your back, there must be a good reason for it.

[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.060]
Butch up.

[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:45.560]
Oh, it's up.

[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:45.820]
Sorry.

[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.000]
But not supposed to say that.

[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.060]
No, I think that is the message.

[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.520]
Isn't that from his guest supposed to putch up?

[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:50.940]
It takes a lot.

[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.560]
See, where these people are coming from, and I had no idea who they were.

[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.780]
And of course, this group, like I said, is like three or four people.

[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.760]
They are like macho case.

[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:03.060]
In other words, they're like football player types and jot locker room.

[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.020]
That can't mentality.

[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.680]
And that's fine.

[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.220]
But they're evidently talk about neurosis.

[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.240]
They have a real problem with the stereotype of case.

[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.520]
And I have a problem with that too.

[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:16.840]
But nonetheless, if it's being done for fun, like you hear it done all the time, that's one thing.

[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.980]
If it's being done to create terror and loathing, that's another thing.

[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.600]
So that's where their problem is.

[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.660]
Well, it seems to me when you discriminate against people who are a feminine or who are transvesti or whatever.

[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.220]
I mean, that's all in the same category.

[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.480]
You know, it's just a matter of degree.

[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.940]
Just like there are straight people who are into whips and chains and leather,

[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.340]
and there are straight people who are wearing their wives underpants.

[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.000]
I mean, hey, that's life.

[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.220]
But in the context of what I hear, you don't do it to other people.

[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.200]
You do it to yourself.

[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.520]
Yeah.

[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.480]
And if you can't poke fun at yourself, you can't poke fun at anybody else.

[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.640]
Well, you know, I have the letter.

[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.340]
You know, it's interesting to me.

[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.300]
Where's that letter?

[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.060]
Here I brought it in.

[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.700]
I haven't touched it all day or the letter either.

[00:33:54.420 --> 00:34:00.260]
But there's a line in here that says, when you call a man a female name,

[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.480]
many people conclude that gay men were home to put their panties in the wrist.

[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.360]
Now, Alice is my reference to Al Rantel,

[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.820]
and has been for many, many years.

[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.300]
And she's natural to stir about Alice at the palace when we didn't dinner at that poor,

[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.180]
luxury restaurant, which is what I heard him mention.

[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:13.420]
Okay.

[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.160]
Now, let me say this to you.

[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.720]
Al Rantel is neither fish nor foul publicly, okay, as far as on a year.

[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.820]
Now, if he were out of the closet homosexual, and I would call him Alice,

[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.800]
then it would fit in the context of this letter, even though I wouldn't agree.

[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:26.620]
But it would fit.

[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.260]
But in light of the fact that I don't make reference to any known gay people

[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.160]
by any female names, that I don't know what this letter is even talking about.

[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:34.540]
Exactly.

[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.600]
Unless there's some announcement coming that we don't know about.

[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.780]
And the other word that I have is that Mr. Manipulator over there, Mr. Ego,

[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.680]
is trying everything in his power desperately to prod that announcement to come.

[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.780]
With certain, really, well, that's what I hear from inside from one of his best friends

[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.940]
who also happens to work there.

[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.100]
He's Mr. Manipulator.

[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.600]
He's bad news.

[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.180]
Oh, yeah.

[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.060]
He's bad news.

[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.900]
Well, that's why any of them.

[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.080]
And again, a guy who I, and the reason they wanted his ass out of here badly

[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.340]
was because he has no clue as to where to draw the line.

[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.360]
And he's proven that over there.

[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.360]
It's only been there a couple of months.

[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.380]
He's proving it beyond the shadow of a doubt.

[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.980]
The crap he pulled on you personally with a crap about your wife.

[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.420]
And now this stuff that he's orchestrating over there on the air,

[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.460]
which I'm sure he's loving every second up, he has no clue as to where to draw the line.

[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.740]
This is why I have pointed myself from the ring.

[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:29.540]
And when King Paul starts getting the fall, fall out from the crap that they're going to wreak

[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.500]
upon the airwaves of their light fog over there, I don't think he's going to be too happy about it.

[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.240]
You know, it's one thing to talk a good game, just like they did over at God Gana when I was at I&Z and Zeta.

[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.460]
Anybody can talk a good game, but then when a fallout starts coming in,

[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.200]
and you have to pay the piper, that's another story.

[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.180]
It takes a lot of money to back up these arguments.

[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.820]
And for a station that was on the verge of bankruptcy before they made the change.

[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.000]
I don't know where that money is going to come from.

[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.760]
Could be a very short talk.

[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.900]
So talk is like a lot of the ten years of the format over there could be very quick.

[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:57.520]
Could be.

[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.020]
In addition to which I do want to say this while you're sitting here,

[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.100]
another one of these, let's start some trouble with the Hank Goldberg stuff.

[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.520]
Mike Disney was in here after the numbers came out during the news break.

[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.700]
And congratulating me on the numbers was even though I dropped a little bit.

[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.040]
They're still solid and so on.

[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.060]
And he said, you know, I'll reconcile dropped a little too, but he said, I like him.

[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.940]
They're doing a great job. And I said, yeah, they're doing great.

[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.780]
And the people, the listeners love him.

[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.760]
So that comes from the general manager of the radio station.

[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:26.160]
So there's really any this crap going on that they were getting Hank Goldberg's in training.

[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.700]
And we got him warming up in the locker room and he's in the bullpen.

[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.000]
It's a bunch of crap.

[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.640]
Hey, they fact the same person who I don't want to get norm into a lot of trouble.

[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:39.980]
So I won't mention his name, but the same person who works over there with Steve told me several days ago

[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:44.080]
that all that stuff about Hank is just contrived again to try to start or rift over here.

[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.380]
I mean, Steve, when are you going to grow up already?

[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.880]
Put something real on the year.

[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.520]
Okay, whatever your act is, find it and do it.

[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.760]
But man, anybody who can't see through that is got to be blind.

[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.020]
You know, they got to think that Sophia Coppola is like Sophia Lorenzo.

[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.840]
But anyway, have a nice day.

[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.320]
Well put.

[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.640]
Thank you.

[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.360]
See you.

[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.180]
Bye.

[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.340]
136 at WI Oscarsized D.

[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.020]
It will be right back to WI-D.

[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.180]
Well, we don't have time to play the whole thing a thousand times,

[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.180]
but let's at least keep the feeling alive.

[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:14.520]
Okay.

[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.580]
As they say over there.

[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:17.580]
North Miami.

[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.620]
Tell us a reporter dummy's over there.

[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.760]
There's no first thing as a policeman's nine-millimeter service revolver.

[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.040]
What is that?

[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.500]
Report is over where?

[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.260]
Oh, at the coast.

[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:28.600]
Okay.

[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720]
Look at all over.

[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.040]
We'll jump on Mary's answer.

[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.120]
140 at WI-O-D.

[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.340]
We have an open line indeed.

[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.940]
Johnny made a face when I said that.

[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:42.480]
At 751-9463-751-W-I-O-D.

[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.220]
That was bad.

[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.180]
Okay, it was bad, but I thought I liked it.

[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.140]
Pompano.

[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.260]
Hi, Neil.

[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:47.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:48.360]
How are you?

[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:48.820]
Okay.

[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:49.420]
Great.

[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.840]
I just, was that your remote Friday?

[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:52.300]
Yeah.

[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.800]
I was the Puts who came up to the table with the beautiful little girl in my arms,

[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.600]
and showed you the winning ticket for the first race.

[00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.120]
Right.

[00:37:59.340 --> 00:37:59.860]
You picked it.

[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:00.920]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.860]
Man, that was a $20-some-dollar horse.

[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.180]
It was $12 bet and $148 pay off.

[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:07.500]
Woo!

[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.560]
Bring that little girl back.

[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.840]
She can be our handy crapper.

[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.360]
That's it.

[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.480]
I didn't want to rub it in the hang too badly.

[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.260]
Let me tell you a hang.

[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:16.680]
I like cancolod.

[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.320]
It's a great guy, but a hang is, like most gamblers, a real BS artist.

[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.100]
When he up at the Dolphin game, they all he's talking about is how he hit the bet three.

[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.620]
Stuck around hit the bet three, but it only paid $20-60.

[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.000]
He didn't tell you about the $80-jillion he lost on the pick six and those first two races.

[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.680]
Okay, so he plunged his guts out there on Friday.

[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.220]
Believe me.

[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.700]
I've only been to a call to any horse race.

[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.780]
This is a second time.

[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.280]
I don't understand the racing forms.

[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.720]
I, as a matter of fact, the first race Friday, I tried to bet a Quinella.

[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.100]
Good luck, Quinella.

[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.220]
Save that for the dog track in Hyra.

[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.860]
Highlight, which I thought you had that remote also.

[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.280]
I didn't do it as well.

[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.420]
But the thing is, I just go over and look at the horses.

[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.780]
Let your little girl pick him.

[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.220]
Okay, let her pick the color she likes and all that stuff.

[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.460]
Now, wind up retiring in five years.

[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.980]
I was at A-list and let's see if Diane P.

[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.740]
The less you talk about him, the sooner he's going to die.

[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:17.240]
Isn't it embarrassing, though, to keep going back to the same old crap over?

[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.760]
I mean, one day I heard him a few days ago talking about,

[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.680]
well, let's turn it into a sports station at IOD and all he'll talk about

[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.680]
between the Godfather and sports.

[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.240]
And yet, you'd think that they've got something to talk about

[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.740]
and it always reverts back to Nearodgers.

[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.780]
So if there's so much else to talk about and I'm so boring,

[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.800]
how come it is they keep talking about me?

[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.080]
That's exactly what you're all like listening to about horse races

[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.120]
and the Godfather.

[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.760]
And whatever is timely, you know what I mean?

[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.080]
A hurricane thing was timely, the dolphin thing is timely,

[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.800]
and other Godfather everybody was talking about.

[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.740]
We talk about whatever is going on, you know?

[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:46.340]
Exactly.

[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.340]
And if he don't like it, tough potatoes.

[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.080]
And the number show we enjoy it.

[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.260]
Have a great life.

[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:51.900]
Have a great life.

[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.680]
142 at IOD.

[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.380]
Let's go up to Joe Brennan right now and Metro traffic.

[00:39:59.540 --> 00:39:59.940]
Joe?

[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.120]
You know what you guys ought to do?

[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.400]
Seriously, Rickinsud's out of Starrot today.

[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.820]
I know Reniri would never do it because he's like asleep in the morning.

[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.900]
But you guys ought to start going to Tom, what's his name?

[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:12.820]
Tom Robinson.

[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:13.940]
Robert?

[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.240]
Well, who knows? Same difference.

[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.380]
It's a phony name like mine.

[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.760]
Tom Roberts, like it, like it, like it times when he don't expect it at all.

[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:20.660]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.260]
Like it for 21 or whatever.

[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.660]
Yeah, like a 407.

[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.660]
Oh, hey, how about we go up to Tom Roberts right now?

[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.160]
Metro traffic. Check what's going on with Skywatch 610.

[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.600]
But yeah.

[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.180]
And then just open the pot and you can hear Molly's doing traffic

[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.180]
and why 100 or something.

[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.660]
I love that yesterday at 530.

[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.480]
That was, I was just doing it right in my car.

[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.620]
I'll tell you, I had to wipe the stains off the seat.

[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:44.500]
It was just incredible.

[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:46.340]
Man.

[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:51.200]
Well, Ellen, the Metro traffic is about my beer and on the Palmetto,

[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.120]
they're eating bugs and bugged this time.

[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:54.500]
Okay.

[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.260]
Man, you people are between him and Soapa.

[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.060]
We're going to have a contest in 91 to see who's not there the most time.

[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.800]
Soapa's got an excuse. He's on tape.

[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.480]
Okay. He can't help it if the car doesn't recute.

[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.840]
Do you know that when you watch Bob Soapa on Channel 7 on the weather,

[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.780]
that's also on tape?

[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.280]
You didn't know that, did you?

[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.260]
Do you know that?

[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.780]
They've got like 10 tapes.

[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.280]
And what they do is they kind of like look out the window,

[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.720]
because they got big windows here next door.

[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.960]
And they check out how the weather is.

[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.980]
You know, if there's a little sunshine and they pull out like number one or number three,

[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:23.620]
he's on tape.

[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.700]
Bob Soapa, radio and TV.

[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.840]
In fact, nobody has seen a guy like in 20 shows up at the parades on the weekends.

[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.080]
He's a good guy for that stuff.

[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:31.740]
Waterhill.

[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:32.500]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.100]
Okay.

[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:41.380]
I've been a dolphin ticket holder for 22 years and I'm right on the 50-yard line also opposite you.

[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.700]
Yeah, I saw you there the day you were going nuts.

[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.540]
Well, what happened was during the fourth period,

[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.580]
I thought I was going to have a car and I was going to have a car and I was going to have a car.

[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.740]
Oh, I was pacing back and forth.

[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.300]
In fact, a couple of people knew who I was, were you shouting up like they thought I was going to just kill right over.

[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.760]
But what I kept doing, I did it if I was alone.

[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:00.440]
I kept looking at the binoculars across it, you to see if you were as tense as I was.

[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.460]
And we were both thought if you had peanuts going there, didn't you?

[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.120]
Peanuts.

[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.620]
I thought you were chewing on peanuts.

[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.460]
No, I was chewing on my fingers.

[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.920]
But the, is that what you say I was chewing on peanuts?

[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.220]
Say that very carefully now.

[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.600]
We don't want to give them any more material over there.

[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:14.820]
Yeah.

[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:15.680]
Peanuts.

[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.340]
But the stands, the up and deck was actually vibrating.

[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:19.920]
Yeah.

[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.200]
Oh, don't say that either.

[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.280]
We were just talking about Channel 7.

[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.500]
Don't get Sarah all upset.

[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:24.920]
Yeah, but listen.

[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.020]
You answer real name, by the way.

[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.260]
Sally Fitzsend name is Sarah.

[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.200]
Sarah.

[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.560]
Play a little song for Sarah if the Sarah Fitzs.

[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:34.040]
Where it?

[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:34.580]
Go ahead.

[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.880]
They was either thirsty or friday and Steve was with fashion as alvans as they were going to get destroyed.

[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.660]
Oh, Jesus, you back on that crap again.

[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:46.460]
See, here's another guy doesn't give it in, but anything in the community is always whatever I do.

[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.080]
He says the obvious like a little child.

[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:48.980]
Neal says it's day.

[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.160]
He says it's back in the early 80s.

[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.000]
Remember when we had the great AFC championship, we beat the crap out of the jets and AJ.

[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:55.920]
Do we had the big day?

[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.740]
We had the killer bees.

[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:03.820]
And I was playing a stuff on the air in the fight song and I played some of the Dick and Burke stuff from NBC and tried to whip up some enthusiasm in his horseman or town.

[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.360]
And he went around the same station on WS News and he comes on the next day.

[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.540]
Oh, it's boring.

[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:13.020]
I mean, his whole life is based upon whatever Neal says I do the opposite.

[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.360]
He liked the godfather.

[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:15.140]
I say it sucks.

[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.620]
He's enthused about the dolphin.

[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.740]
I say it's boring.

[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:18.180]
They suck.

[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.440]
I mean, come on Steve.

[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.440]
Grow up already.

[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:20.820]
Will you?

[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.840]
I mean, be a man like El Martino.

[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:23.760]
Let me say one thing.

[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.320]
King Paul, you know, his card dealership is not doing well.

[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.240]
It's all called dealerships aren't.

[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.640]
And as soon as he starts to get heat and he sees he's losing sales because of what's gone over there.

[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.360]
You're going to see back to the 40s music again.

[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.460]
Well, they changed formats like people change your underwear.

[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.500]
So stand by.

[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.540]
Paul is desperate.

[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.000]
Stand by for the next one.

[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:42.400]
Thank you.

[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:42.900]
See you.

[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.360]
146 at WIOD.

[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.320]
We have an open line in Broward, 524 and one on a star line.

[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.200]
It's star IOD.

[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.040]
I want to be a star.

[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.840]
I feel so left out now, you know.

[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:56.920]
I do.

[00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:00.980]
But I go home tonight and get ready to go to Pomona with my purple panties.

[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.240]
In my pink slippers.

[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.100]
I want to be a star.

[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.840]
And my cigar.

[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.380]
Can you be a star with your cigar and your purple panties and your silk slippers?

[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:19.560]
Hmm.

[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.200]
I wish I had satin sheets.

[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:23.880]
Homestead.

[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.940]
Yeah, it's Hainee El.

[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.500]
How you doing?

[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:28.600]
Fine, listen.

[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.540]
I'm a long time listener and this is the first time I've ever got up the nerve to call you.

[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.020]
Wow.

[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:41.540]
I want to talk about the sports channel on channel 43.

[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.620]
At least that's what it is down here in Southgate.

[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.920]
Yeah, you don't mean to want to stop the year, do you?

[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:48.920]
Channel 43.

[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:49.960]
Sports news network.

[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.780]
They went off the year.

[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.420]
No, they're not off the year.

[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:52.760]
Okay.

[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.660]
We came to them last night.

[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:54.140]
Okay.

[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:58.760]
So the overheard of the sports writer or I think that's what he is named Bill Gleason.

[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.100]
Yeah, oh, I love that show.

[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.140]
Sports writers on TV.

[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.520]
Well, you should have heard it last month.

[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.000]
Yeah.

[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:09.000]
It was around 1135 and I was kind of, that's always taped in Chicago, by the way.

[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.100]
All those guys are working in Chicago where he's from the Bill Gleason's from the South Bend to his paper.

[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:21.300]
Well, it's in there where Bill Gleason, a Bill Jaws, a John somebody from sports illustrated and a Ben Bentley.

[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:21.700]
Right.

[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.920]
And when I turned it on, this is what I heard.

[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.400]
They must have been talking about the Buffalo Dauphin thing.

[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:28.940]
Yeah.

[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:33.060]
And they said the weather will be a factor.

[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.980]
So let's play for rotten weather.

[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:41.120]
Then they got to talking about how Chicago can't play on artificial turf.

[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:46.020]
So the pair at News4, Chicago barely got by the Saints in the Saints are like a little league team.

[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:51.200]
Well, anyway, they picked a giant and also they picked, of course, the Raiders.

[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:57.540]
And they said that the Raiders and San Francisco will end up in the Super Bowl.

[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.640]
And of course, San Francisco will win.

[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.020]
Yeah.

[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:11.220]
And then Bill Gleason, he's such a nice pair and he said he almost cried when that field goal fell short.

[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.000]
That Laurel could.

[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:14.660]
Why is that? He have a bet on it?

[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:21.820]
No, he said that he felt that Steve DeBurg, he loves Steve DeBurg and he should go all the way.

[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:22.700]
Yeah, right.

[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.540]
And he cried.

[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.120]
Isn't it? Well, listen, we'll send him a crying town.

[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.380]
And also...

[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:27.780]
Poor baby.

[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.100]
But you got to remember Bill Gleason is from South Bend.

[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.420]
Okay, now, do you know what University plays in South Bend?

[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.360]
Oh, what?

[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.460]
Noter Dan.

[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:35.460]
Oh, really?

[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.500]
See, and they do a lot of crying up there.

[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.100]
Every time they don't win by 30 points, whatever kind of sport it is, they do a lot of crying.

[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:42.880]
So he probably rubbed off on him.

[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.740]
He's used to crying.

[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.580]
Well, anyway, the show, I guess they talk about a lot of different things.

[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.400]
I like the show, though.

[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.500]
It's one of my favorite shows and when they're not knocking at dolphins, it's usually a pretty interesting show.

[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:55.040]
Oh, my God, you should have heard what they said about the hurricane.
