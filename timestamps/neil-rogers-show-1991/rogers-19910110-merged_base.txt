Yeah, there you go. Hey, I also wanted to ask you you still have your computer

[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.260]
My computer. Yeah, no, you know, you got rid of it. I never used it

Whoo, is it smoking there or what man? Oh, I got it

[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.520]
That was exciting. That's the most excitement we've had around here at a long since Rick Sanchez came in

[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.920]
Burned a big hole in that sucker right in the waist basket

[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.560]
Whatever happened to his boy that was great. He's hitting stuff or whatever. He's hitting sock

[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.080]
What are you talking about when he hit that guy at the dolphin game?

[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.300]
I have no idea. He's got malaria now. So he's got an excuse. That'll be his excuse for anything that happens

[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.740]
I was I was hyperventilating. Oh, yeah, man. Is it stinking here now or what?

[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.100]

Yeah, you know, they win the Super Bowl. That's the title of it

[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.400]
What is it? It's called Wind That Super Bowl. Yeah, and CBS told me they would play it

[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.060]
Providing we make it to the Super Bowl

[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.060]
Well now what sir, let's back up a little bit. I know you're just bubbling over with enthusiasm, but what the hell is this song? What is it?

[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.020]
You

[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.780]
You wrote it

[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.460]
Here's poor e-ju. Great. Yeah, whatever you say

[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.560]
So you want to hear a little bit of it? No, I want you to send it to me. I don't want to hear it on the phone. We don't do stuff like that

[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.920]
Well, we don't do it over the phone

[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.180]
We could sing it in English

[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.660]
Yeah, send it to me in the mail, sir. Okay, and uh, you see Val on not slanting. She's got some good green pills for you

[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.020]
1056 it boy that stuff smells really good. I could get into that man

[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.200]
I'm looking. I thought something electrical under the table here was like smoking

[00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.040]
And I looked down and they're in the waist-basket. I see this that red glow and it's spreading like a wildfire like smoky

[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.600]
The bear is gonna come in and hose us all in a second

[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.100]
Mobile in Miami

[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.420]
Hey Neil. Yeah, okay

[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.100]
Neil I listen to CNN this morning. They mentioned that

[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.300]
Super Bowl thing that you've been talking about yeah, some officials from the

[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.200]
NFL said that don't play the game and they play games like that before in the past. Hey, listen

[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.480]
Like I said the NFL will be the last thing to cancel anything. Okay, believe me when I tell you that because they believe that

[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.280]
National Football League is more important than anything. I can't imagine why channel 10 would do that

[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.000]
You know say those things get everyone off freak. What what do they say exactly what they say? I don't know

[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.400]
I didn't listen to channel 10. I listen to CNN. You know, good good thinking

[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.220]
I mean channel 10 just gives you a bunch of propaganda if you want to know what's really going on to in CNN

[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.280]
Yeah, that's right one other thing. I saw you with

[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.260]
remote at what at the call the remote yeah, and I thought that maybe when you go to the Gulf street one you have a

[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.140]
Tell them in ahead of time to get you a monitor so you can see what the hell is going on

[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.000]
I already told him that I mean that was you know, it's fun. It was funny

[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.200]
But I mean, yeah, I'm sitting here. I'm looking under the tent and I can't see anything. It was kind of like

[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.480]
Yeah, frustrating horse manure. Yeah, okay, NL see what is the when is that golf?

[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.040]

[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.280]
Yeah, it's nice over there. You know, love it. I was there for

[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.240]
What do you mean I'm gonna love it like I've never been to Gulf Street? Well, we can't come to open on Monday. Well

[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.080]
Gulfstream is like a big-time

[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.700]
Beautiful place with palm trees. It's fabulous. Let me tell you what I did time they wanted I went to their breakfast buffet

[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.040]
Yeah, it's a morning workout. It was wonderful

[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.340]
95 beautiful losses world class losses. Can't be to with a stick. It's gonna be a great meeting

[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.820]
Yeah, okay now. Okay, I have a great one. Bye-bye 1058 at W.I.D. Yeah, Calder's last day is Sunday and Gulfstream opens on

[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.680]

Man, I can't wait for that

[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.100]
Have those great double headers on the weekend. You know like Saturday go over to Gulfstream, punch your brains out

[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.460]
And then get in the car and zip over to pop it out for another 13

He's calling there just get out of that paper get your nose out of the paper and get on a stick. What is it sir?

[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.660]

[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.780]

Anyway, we have an open line and brown that man is just but he's coming around a little bit

[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.780]
He's like the Giants fan. You know he's starting to come around a little bit, which is what I'm afraid of

[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.040]
Cory hasn't called yet. Has he thank god

[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.980]

The opinions expressed with all the who say things we got. I love it. You know, I love it because I love that coach spot

[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.220]
You don't the where's that tape we got the Rogers got if we can steal from Reneerie who's on permanent vacation

[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.020]
Man, he's unbelievable. What a contract. He must have

[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.620]
I like to see what he does is he goes like I'm two weeks and then he does the two weeks again

[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:17.000]
Because that's the way he does everything. Where's that tape with the coax spots? I love that my favorite one is a one with the fortunes

[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.820]
That we used to argue about all the time about who's saying it God is that here it is. Okay

[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.420]
Okay, we'll get to that when we have a momentary a lull but in the meantime here's Kendall

[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.000]
Neil how are you today? Okay, sir. Hi, you be listen. I don't want to get too personal

[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.740]
But I hope you do a better job on saying your diet this time. You're right. No, hey listen

[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.400]
I'm the first one to admit but you know something most of us who fight this all our lives

[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.760]
Well, you know pretty weak because you have a hard time keeping your word on the fact that you sit over the rear

[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.000]
That you no more eating on your program and the system was it forever. That's right and

[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.720]
We really would like to have you around for a long time at least another couple of weeks anyway

[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:02.660]
Anyway Kelly said in the paper Kelly, mr. Jim Kelly. Oh Jim Kelly mr. Laugh. How's that the razor blade doing by the way Jim?

[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.360]
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. He said that

[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.020]
It's up to him to make the decision whether he plays or I pray he plays boy

[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.040]
Let's set him letters say all of us down here remember those great years at UM

[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.620]
We love him. We want him to play. We want him to be a star

[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:21.580]
Well, this is the link it kind of equal because Kelly will have a brace on his knee and marino will have a brace on his knee

[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.100]
Right

[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.640]
Marino's always got a brace on his knee or it kind of makes it will make it even like a higher

[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.360]
He's got like a sore mouth now to understand. He's got a little problem. We'll stick to your diet. We hope you lose a lot of weight

[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.500]
I'm gonna stick it pal. Okay, see you

[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.360]
Yeah, he's right no matter of fact

[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.220]
I got a call yesterday on the show that inspired me to do my thing about light bulb radio and a guy was right

[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.980]
I mean when I'm wrong I'm wrong which is most of the time and

[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.400]
He was right and that's what kind of awakened me to the fact that just a bunch of crap and this guy is right

[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.500]
Look at Oprah though see at least I didn't do that

[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:06.660]
I mean Oprah lost all that weight on drinking at puke and then she you know came on I'll never forget they kept showing that on the news

[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:13.080]
And she's spinning around and ripping off her little jacket and she looks like a twiggy and heat and look how skinny

[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.680]
I am and you know here she's on national TV

[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.360]
You know like setting this great example and she's talking up how she did this great job and now she looks like a balloon and heat

[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.620]
She looks like a cross between dead game Debbie Ellis and the moon man. I mean she is brittle

[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.860]
She's a cow and now she's saying oh don't talk to me about anymore

[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.100]
I just I don't want to hear about it anymore. Yeah nice job, honey

[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:43.200]
And she's got billions of dollars not millions billions with a bee which is really frightening when you stop and think about it to begin with

[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.180]
I wouldn't you think with her money. I mean what does she need what does she want?

[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.820]
What the hell do you want Oprah?

[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.280]
Anyway, we have an open-lump getting emotional 751 WIOD and Dave we do have one sitting there

[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.800]
I don't like that one do you it's all right?

[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:23.500]
Okay, let's take a Miami call. Hello, hey, how you doing? Okay, pal. How's your day going so great? That's good. We're glad to hear it

[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.180]
That's the only way we can make spuds watch the game is have them up in a saloon give him a couple of belts

[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:15.540]
We have an open line in date County 7519 463 751 WIOD the real key to

[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.280]
Adjacent on not slanting what a tour this kid is that he wears suspenders which means someday

[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.180]
I'll probably get into radio be a program director

[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.100]
He's a jackass. What can I tell you boy? He'll be perfect anyway now. We have two open lines in date

[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.480]
Wow, where are these ladies? We heard the not slanting lady did we have one other lady today?

[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:39.420]
You see let me tell you a little clue Christmas is over the holiday shopping Hanukkah new years all the parties it's over

[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.460]
So all the excuses we know you're out there if we did well in women in this time on this show

[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.460]
We went up a little bit actually so we know you're out there and when we go to those remotes

[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.460]
Are you amazed by all the women who show up including many?

[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:56.240]
I want to just make a little plug for a Miriam by the way cuts my hair. She is a knockout when she would agree with that

[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.300]
She's beautiful. So if you horny guys out there want to get you a hair trim and

[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.080]
Have a good look close to Miriam and kind of like cuddle up and give a little elbow while she's trimming your thing

[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.880]
I'll write across this to read that they her about take she is just gorgeous. She really is

[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.260]
And

[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.640]
Evanelli nobody got her the message because she keeps like like fondling me and stuff like that while she's cutting the hair

[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.260]
And anyway the market's up about eight and a half points

[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.820]
It's 12 minutes after 11 she does she's like ready too. I think it will be right back

[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.040]
Can't believe I forgot to mention that the Friday night tomorrow night

[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.360]
Pompato Park 10th race Christmas list our stable horse is gonna be going out of the 7 hole in the 10th race Joe

[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.620]
Pavia is still driving and

[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.540]
And this time Kevin Wallace is back because he had a three day suspension

[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.080]
He got sit down for going too fast, I think and so he's coming back

[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.440]
So he'll be in there with some horse that'll leave out of there in about 26 seconds and open up a nice hole and Joel

[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.860]
Driving the tool get a perfect trip and come out of the stretch and wind him on I we're new for a win

[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.200]
You hear that Alan or else we're gonna talk about what's the name of that horse again?

[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.480]
If you got the program because I got mine here somewhere too that Jeff Gregory a piece

[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.980]
Yes, awesome wait, but here he comes hit him again Jeff. That's it

[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:15.020]
Here he comes he got his hands in easy as crawling to the line and this is like a day and a half later

[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.780]
Next time they put a horse out there in a track years ago. There was a horse dick McCombra

[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.480]
I'm sorry dick you're a great guy. Love you. He had a horse called chicken picker

[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.220]
Seriously chicken picker is like a cheap claimer. He came out on track

[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:34.800]
The horse looked like he wanted to lay down they bet him down based on the program to like three to five

[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.600]
And he ran just like Jeff's exactly the same way only worse

[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.260]
Jeff's awesome in the 10th race theory is

[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.080]
Renee and a Don

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:51.060]
Renee it's big holiday in Quebec. You better go back and don't miss out pal. We got your bus ticket right here my Annie

[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.600]
Yeah, look boy, you can get on the same bus. How you doing fine stuff great?

[00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.220]
Yeah, I wanted to tell you something about callers. Yeah, I went out there with a friend of mine

[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:06.920]
He lived there at the track so it was a pretty good handicap. Yeah, and this one horse goes off 20 to 1

[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:13.860]
We've been losing all day best two hundred dollars on the horse. Yeah, you said they can't lose. Yeah, it takes off

[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.460]
Yeah, wired or yeah, 18 lengths ahead up a few this qualified

[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.980]
Oh going into the stretch

[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.900]
Force balls jockey falls everybody fall horse loses

[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.160]
What do you think about that? What do you mean what do you mean the horse was way ahead of the field?

[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.640]
Ney fell trest he tripped last turn wanted to stretch

[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.600]
$4,000 you would have won yeah

[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.860]
Well, I don't want to get you depressed, but you know what I would do if I had that situation

[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.020]
No myself

[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:55.020]
Yeah, okay, yeah, just like somebody's trying to tell you something to who my brother Craig was out there listening serious douchebag

[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.160]
Have a great day foul. All right. Okay. Don't do it again

[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.360]
A fool and his money are soon parted. We have an open line in day 751

[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.740]
Well, we got a lot of we're getting a heavy duty tomorrow

[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.700]
We're gonna go nuts with the dolphin song. We might even play Cory song tomorrow

[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.500]
Do you think so should we take a vote on that?

[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:16.220]
All right, let's do a poll should we have a Gilbert on the show or should we have Cory song that she beat

[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.560]
Well, we'll get to the one that I like in a second

[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.800]
This is like a montage of all the different the big coke spots that Roger has on her for some reason

[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.500]
Let's go to a mobile in Miami. When is this I?

[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:39.840]
Great

[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.400]
Reason I call is I went to school with Jim Kelly actually I was a freshman when he was a senior

[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.800]
But we live in the same building are you sure you mean you am yeah, the you of M

[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.820]
Class of 86 that's me classes the word sir for you em football believe right?

[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.120]
All clear when I went to school there. What's our view about that?

[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.780]
I'm friend of mine from high school was the back of quarterback there is first name was Mark and

[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.460]
When I tell you that there was nobody

[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.280]
Yeah, you're right

[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.800]
That's right

[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.520]
I mean when you can't even get it when you can't even attract the student body if I can use that expression man

[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.920]
You got problems well, you know if you ask if you ask the

[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.440]
University why that is because it's an off campus ability

[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.440]
Can I ask you a question can I ask you a serious question before you get back to your point?

[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.940]
I don't want to divert your attention. How come how come so many of the students at UM are so ugly is there special reason for that?

[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:37.640]
Yeah, because a lot of them come down from Connecticut. Oh, yeah, okay bridge for it like

[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.620]
Everyone from the city of bridge, they must know that kid Joey that calls Rick and suds from Connecticut all the time

[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.760]
I must be related to him cuz he's like he doesn't have zits

[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.040]
He just got one like on his neck just one big one

[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.380]
Yeah, right is it

[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:55.000]
But anyway as they say is they say in Rhode Island. He's got zit for brains now. What is it sir?

[00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.540]
Well, when he you know remember you probably do when he had a shoulder separation or he broke his arm or something

[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:05.560]
Yeah, and then he also had that little problem with his foot. Yeah, but he had his arm this thing for a while

[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.860]
Yeah, that's right. He was hanging out and he was drinking a few beers

[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:14.100]
Yeah, and then like he went into the pros and he became this major asshole right not to mention

[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.680]
He's ugly. Oh, Kelly you bet

[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.420]
Well, let me ask you this question of the I don't want to give you a whole thing here

[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.860]
But you have quarterbacks for example test of birdie's got to nose the size of rosanne bars ass

[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.800]
Coasts are has got to nose the size of the Pope's ring

[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:35.600]
I mean really you're talking really ugly people Steve Wall she's grotesque looking and can't really play that well either and

[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.860]
The only hope we got is Erickson if we can patch up those holes in this face heat

[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:43.140]
And this seriously if he had like no holes in his face he looked great and he's actually playing great

[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:48.480]
I can't believe it. Yeah, but he's got like no upper lip. You ever notice that no one know Sophia Coppola stole it

[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.760]
Oh, yeah, that's right. She's got that triple lip

[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.540]
Yeah, she's got somebody else's lip and the Craig got a little bit out of shape cuz before after the game and all that controversy

[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.460]
A coach told him keep a stiff upper lip and he got upset about that

[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.040]
But I don't know what happened to Jimmy was pretty cool

[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.760]
But an other thing I wanted to touch on other words. He's an assholes. That what you're trying to say well

[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:11.300]
Yeah, well good then I hope these starts on Saturday and I hope we just drive him into the ground into the frozen turf at rich stadium

[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.200]
I fat rich stadium

[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.900]
But I think if you you went to the game right I have a track named after me in Ohio

[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:26.100]
It's called me will that wheel down I'm losing you still there. I say I have a track named after me in Ohio

[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.420]
It's called kneeled down. There was a little joke sir. Now. What is it? No, I'm fading out of my phone there

[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:39.420]
You want to the game right? Yes, sir. We didn't leave the stadium until about someone was not the word for it

[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.820]
It was just one of the events of my lifetime. I'll tell you that I loved it

[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:48.580]
Well, I hate the game and I watch it when I got home because I was seriously dolphin intensive right and

[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.740]
Did you watch it the game on TV at all? I watched well

[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.640]
I I was saying before I somebody told me you're taping I watched parts of it last night and watch the whole thing

[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.200]
I watched the highlights okay

[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.300]
Well that one of the highlights was like

[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.100]
Marino when he was coming on to the field when the score was 16 to 10

[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.720]
Yeah, look in his face. Oh, yeah, yeah

[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.640]
And to be honest, you know something I got I got to tell you this now really mean it

[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:18.440]
I'm gonna try to be a shield for the dolphin Dan Marino is great as he is has never gotten the credit that he deserves in his

[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.520]
Town he has done so much and I know he pissed a lot of us off a few years ago when he held out and we lost the Houston game

[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.960]
And you know, but the bottom line is he is so good and so cool and so confident and

[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.300]
It's just incredible what he did

[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.880]
Saturday the last ten in a row and eight for eight and a fourth quarter in the clutch

[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.360]
You took the words right out on and then it goes back the game

[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.860]
We had to have a month ago against Phil adult. Yeah, he did the same thing when the chips are down

[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.380]
He gets the job done

[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.160]
You know, he didn't have a supporting cast for a while and let me tell you

[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.400]
I'm not a dolphin maniac like certain people

[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.740]
But you got to give Marino his do and I really think

[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.200]
That if the chips are down this Saturday and we can hang in there

[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:05.520]
Marino is gonna get the job done if there was anyone I would rather have Marino now than Montana taking care of this because Montana

[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:12.180]
Is God like superstars all around him, you know and quite frankly the rest of the dolphins are you know 75% of the rest

[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:18.180]
Team mediocre. Yeah, well, I wouldn't say 75% but he certainly didn't have you know a lot of young players

[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:24.600]
He is incredible. That's all I can tell you yeah, he's just I'm looking forward to it plus I have a feeling

[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.660]
Washington is gonna kick the crap out of the 49ers now

[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.060]
We're not really no. I hope the 49ers win. I hope we play the 49ers in the Super Bowl

[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.240]
Let's not get carried away. I hope Steve Young starts

[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.920]
Let's not get carried away. We don't want to see the 49ers anywhere for about five more years

[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.960]
Okay, I'll buy that less the walls comes back and starts at center. Right have a great day, sir

[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.120]
We're gonna kick some ass. We hope we hope see you now. You're not gonna go away. Are you Alan J?

[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.860]
I'm still here waiting for you. Okay, well, you'll always wait for me

[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.760]
Hold on a second. We're gonna do a little commercial break

[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.640]
You can understand that I'm sure Alan J. Finkelson is on a line

Okay, 1126 this better be good Alan because that a full board of calls and half of them drop

As soon as I said you run along. What is it? Neal? This is good. You asked for something the other night

[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.860]
Went upstairs and spoke to the judges. Yep. They're doing something about it

[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.400]
They would like it you would come with me when you come Friday night for Christmas list race

You bet you'll come upstairs with me. Yep. They're both. Yep. We'll sit down with them

And they'll show it to you and then I believe by Monday when you go back on you can release it to the public great

[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:41.400]

Poppano Park a lifetime record of 52 and one he was off for a while

[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:53.620]
He needed the last start and he could be tough here. So I would say a two seven seven two perfect a box would be it for our fans tomorrow night

I just to take it and stride. I don't get upset

[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.480]
But when I see a horse that's 400 lengths behind the field and

[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:46.040]
Gasping for oxygen and that's at the start. That's at the start. Okay, let's go to Coral Springs

[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:52.700]
Hey Uncle Neil how you doing sir welcome to the real world okay welcome to a real nut house

[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:58.160]

They're there with a napkin. Now is that is that in the glass? Oh

[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:17.440]
I saw a old bag the night she was eating a piece of minced meat pie in the glass the teeth were in a glass

[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.760]
Yeah, it was good. I said mince this something they were asking

[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:27.660]
I saw a guy take a whole tray take the plastic tray into his car. What's that? Oh, he's eaten that a little later on

[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.240]
That's for a

[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:35.140]
He has a whole closet that's for that he's got a closet full of something I bet we on a sand these bags up the Buffalo

[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.780]
Yeah, and have him pick that city's bones clean

[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.380]
What do you think? No actually what we're gonna do channel 4 understand is doing another thing with these

[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:46.400]
Colorectal tests where you send the samples in yeah, and I think we ought to set them all up to rich stadium and

[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.280]
Our slogan for the game can be it's in the bag right on open them up right next to Jim Kelly just before the game

[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.740]
There you go give him a little ether. All right. Hey, sir. Let's hope we kick some ass. Okay. Let's hope it's not our own

[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.700]
1130 at W. I. O. D. I mean read like I said regardless

[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.100]
Saturday what happens? It's been an incredible

[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.700]
Uplifting year and in this time of course anything could be an improvement

[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.200]
We have an open line in Broward 524 and Palm Beach and we had a call on Palm Beach today

[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.940]
I mean we're not complaining because we're doing great every place else all

[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.860]
Fowlers back from vacation are waiting for

[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.660]
1130 at W. I. O. D. We have an open line in Broward 524 9463 524

[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.440]
I or we don't W. I.

[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.520]
D. Well, I don't have the right carton machine. I'm sorry Miami

[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.840]
Hey Neil. Yeah, I still and I have a few things you have a few things

[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.780]
What that school teacher would be a good start. Who is it?

[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.320]
What that school teacher at the game?

[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.660]
Yeah, she sure was and you know something she's come down a lot

[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:52.500]
I think the word is getting back to where she's making a jackass out of herself. She really got the word

[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.140]
She only went

[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:54.920]
three times

[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:04.540]
Marina through that tight place. I put your hands right out flat on top of the chair and just cut the crap. What is it?

[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.560]
And then the other thing there's a couple other things number one

[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.920]
I think we should take

[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.840]
Dopp and Denny's unit

[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:20.900]
Or put it on Gilbert. Who is this Mitchell by any chance? No, okay. No, you don't know Mitchell do you? No, I don't by the way

[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:26.320]
We have a Alan was just on the line. I wonder if they're listening over there to Pompano because Gary Sebel's a great guy

[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.400]
There's a great job announcing the races and is also lost a couple of pounds you get in the start

[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.820]
I'm gonna look like Dave game on a bad day, but Mitchell I mean Gary's got some interesting friends

[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.840]
He's got Mitchell from the bizarre and bizarre I think speaks for itself and

[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.760]
Super day was hanging around with him up there the other so Gary

[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.500]
I want to tell you something it explains a lot when you work for Alan think also

[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:53.340]
I guess it starts you know spreading to your friends well I think you're bringing I'd like to say to you

[00:27:53.340 --> 00:28:00.000]
You do every year such a wonderful job for a mille of south my friends who's big

[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:10.300]
Big man, you go to the big man. How big? Yeah, and you do a great job couple other things number one. Yeah

[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.440]
I think that

[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:14.600]
Yeah

[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:25.500]
I'm down. I don't get excited. Let us do the over here sir. You just keep pressing on I'm just excited. Okay

[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.520]
Henry Bittles said he was thinking about bringing you a drink today

[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.840]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, um

[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:39.940]
Get who is on today show one of your favorite yet? Yeah, I know, but we don't talk about them sir

[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:47.920]
So we don't really care piss on that 1132 at W. I. O. D. We have an open line in date counties 7519 463 and one in Palm Beach

[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.400]
Palm Beach ought to do something pretty soon. What are you in here sucking around for is there some special reason?

[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.600]
What are you looking for information in here Palm Beach 655 9463?

[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:03.020]
This is the walking leak is a matter of fact over here. So maybe he'd fit in on that thing keep a scheme

[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.900]
Yeah, yes sir. How you doing?

[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.860]
I've been procrastinating long enough for the

[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.040]
Well, I was just gonna say it's funny. You should you took her right out of my mouth

[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.260]
We have a hundred eight thousand six hundred and one dollars

[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.860]
We had a couple of checks dribble in here today

[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:23.900]
So we need another a 1400 to get to 110 which I think would be just a real nice rounding up total

[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.980]
Listen, can I get a t-shirt to if I send in the

[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.560]
Contribution and enough to cover postage. Yes. What would that come to a hundred bucks a

[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.620]
hundred and the tape and the t-shirt right

[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:44.520]
Did you follow any of what was happening? Why did my sir at long in other words don't hold my breath is that what you try to say?

[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.740]
Oh, no, just writing it sounds like you're breathless at that point come out to Pompo tomorrow

[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.040]
So we'll give you a couple of steps you can make some money. Are you gonna have the t-shirts there?

[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:57.780]
What it's just a joke. It's just a little joke. No, you got to send in through the mail

[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.160]
All right, I'll get it or if you come by the where do you live?

[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:09.740]
Well if you come by the station like when we're open during business hours for 40 bucks they'll sell you a t-shirt and a tape out front

[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.280]
You have the t-shirts there and the tape. Yeah, I'm not exciting. That's great. Yeah

[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.500]
That's better than a hundred but I'll listen to me. Well a response. I got obviously I don't want to squeeze you too hard

[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.840]
Okay, if you're part of that expression

[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:28.280]
I mean it sounds like a hundred would be asking you much and we only expect people to you know give what they can afford

[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.480]
Who's the tiger broadcast?

[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.540]

Ernie Harwell Ernie Harwell this year

[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.240]
The people at WJ by the way, man, it's made a very good plan. Man, it was right on top of the story

[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.580]
Did they have the wrong call it or so Jim WGR is in Buffalo?

[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:52.380]
Okay, WJ are is in Detroit and you think that a guy who went to the University of Michigan and an Arbor would know the difference between

[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:59.040]
WJ are the great voice of the great lakes and WGR and I've got for second toilet called Buffalo on the shores of Lake Erie

[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.100]
Yeah, I heard it first. It was Shemba in fact reached stadium

[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.600]
I know they got to be going crazy. I hope the people at WJ are get a hernia. Okay. I want to wish them all

[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.900]
I want to wish all those

[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:26.600]
Two stacks up there at WJ are a happy new year. Yeah, I hope their thing freezes to the tower in the middle of February

[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.680]
Ernie Harwell is great as a matter of fact Ernie Harwell

[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.200]
You know that thing I have played by play on a radio that we play sometime

[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.940]
Ernie Harwell is on that so I'm gonna would dig it out and

[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.680]
Okay, have a great day sir

[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.300]
Ernie Harwell Hall of Fame broadcaster would be all-time greats even though he's getting up there and here's

[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.840]
He's still has a great job that would be like WGN in Chicago

[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:53.880]
I this would be an exact parallel it would be like WGN in Chicago saying why do you get a little bit too old Harry

[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.960]
We're gonna retire you after this season

[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:58.880]
Right

[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.960]
It's 1136. We have an open line void you realize how many weeks now to spring training about five or six something like that

[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.880]
Are we gonna cancel the season because we're going to war?

[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.620]
See I don't understand that I mean there's nothing funny about war and obviously it's a horrendous thing and a lot of people

[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:19.580]
Disappointed they yesterday's meeting brought about nothing all well that wasn't too much of a surprise when you know who you're dealing with over there

[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:25.480]
But I mean just like this show I'm not gonna stop here and sit and sob every day because uh, you know

[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.600]
I mean, that's just the insanity of life. That's the world we're living in okay

[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.680]
So life has to go on

[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.740]
We have an open line indeed

[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:35.440]
751

[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.060]
Philosophy 751

[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:44.140]
W.I.O.D. Hit him again, Jeff come on one more time here. He goes now. He's smoking in the stretch. We'll be right back

[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:49.220]
Must be loaded. Oh excuse me 20 till noon at WI O.D. Here's a mobile and beautiful fart lottery

[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.740]
That's Palm Beach now Neil well good luck to you sir

[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.820]
How about we put you back on hold we can talk you about Daytona Daytona to be pretty exciting

[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.800]
Now I just want to tell you there's a cop throughout there everywhere a big report

[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.780]
Yeah, they're everything to figure everywhere

[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.800]
Yeah, all up and down 95 what are they doing?

[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.480]
Probably each other what is it?

[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:15.040]
Great isn't it nice to know that you're safe sir? Yeah, what think about this time boy?

[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:20.880]
There are never any crime never any murders no drug problem because our friends in blue and black are out there doing it

[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.840]
These are black and yellow out here

[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.660]
Anyway, oh fhp pigs. Yeah, okay. I

[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.180]
Got your tape

[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.560]
Yeah, that's a great tape. It is great even loaned it to my

[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.320]
douchebag friend from New York. You know that some of the troops are listening to that tape over in Saudi Arabia

[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.120]
Like huh? Yeah, they'll do it for good. No, seriously. That's true

[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.180]
I sent a complimentary one to

[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.520]
Saddam and saying you know, yeah, that should do it probably now we're gonna send him Gilbert

[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.420]
I think that may make our last minute last minute agreement instead of Jim Baker yesterday

[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.160]
They should add Gilbert over there with Aziz

[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.740]
Just change to the capital of Kuwait

[00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:00.880]
No, I think they can get the hell out real quick or if not that still sounds like good idea

[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.980]
Anyway, I loaded to my douchebag friend from New York and

[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.320]
Every time I mention now I was in the New York. I don't listen to anything

[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.760]
I have no longer in the Howard Stern for years. You know nothing's good

[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.400]
That's he really enjoyed it. Well, even Howard likes this show. So tell him that that may butcher him up a little bit

[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.960]
True. Anyway, uh, if most they enjoy the tape okay

[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.740]
And look out for those pigs have a great life. Thank you

[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:27.720]
Great American with a pig reported 1141. There's an open line on the star line star out there

[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.060]
I'm not giving poppy channing workers nobody calls on it north my Annie

[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.160]
Hello a lady

[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:42.100]
Yes, this is Sophie. Oh, Sophie. How you doing Sophie? Well, that's close enough to a lady for us

[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:49.400]
Yeah, and that's a good truth. I saw you at the card shop in many places. Why is that well? I have diabetes too

[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:55.960]
But I asked the woman once it evident here about that system that you're going on and she says it's not for diabetics

[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.340]
Wrong

[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.420]
Sophie my doctors are already giving me to slip. There's no one has nothing to do with diabetes

[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.360]
So instead of just asking some woman in the bizarre

[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.080]
I think I talked to a doctor first. No, no

[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:15.100]
I go to the doctor's once a month. Yeah, and I'm on a thousand calories today

[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.700]
And my husband takes my blood every morning for my finger. What was this morning?

Yeah, front of TV once

[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:49.860]
With days. Yeah, but um anyway, I another thing I want to mention is that you were talking about women's drivers about two weeks ago

[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:55.220]
And it was so funny because I was coming out from work one night down a turnpike golden glades there

[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.660]
And I'm trying to get over it to pay my toll

[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:05.220]
As you get on right on the turnpike there and who comes whipping down on a long side of me and I've got my blinker

[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.140]
I'm trying to go over but you

[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:12.140]
Really and you wouldn't give me a chance to get in there to pay my toll. Hey, I don't monkey around

[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:16.540]
I was just trying to get I was trying to get out of your way. I know I said he talks about women's drivers

[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.420]

[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:05.200]

[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:12.400]
There's some idiot in front of me who's asking for directions to Nebraska and got the 116 receipts and the oh, it's just

[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.180]
this morning I called the

[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:13.760]
The towing company and they said do you have my car there? They said yeah, we sure do have your car there and

[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:19.980]
uh, it was authorized by the owner to get towed. So I called the owner. I'll pissed off the owner of what? Huh?

[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:26.140]
The owner of the gas station. Oh, I see. You know what I mean? So I called the owner. I told them, hey, you know, I had a flat tire

[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:30.940]
You know, why are you gonna tow a car away? I was gonna be right back. You know, I'll stop. I guess we'd do that

[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:35.140]
Excuse me. What kind of a geek would do that exactly? So what happened? I called you

[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.600]
I was talking to the owner and he said wait wait a second. Wait. I didn't call anybody

[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.840]
I didn't call no tow truck to tow anybody's car away

[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.800]
You know, I'd I'd wait a couple days to see if they pick it up or they don't pick it up

[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.560]
Don't away sound like one of the strangest stories ever towed now

[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:55.240]
No, but listen to this but listen to this it gets better. I called the tow company then I told the tow company ain't

[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.520]
You know you guys are running in legal business here. You guys can't be doing that

[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.640]
First of all when a car is on private property, right when I when I cars are private property

[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:10.280]
They can't tow it away unless they get permission from the owner of that property. Yeah

[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.960]
Well, let's say we're owner requests it

[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:20.260]
Well, they have to have a sign received they got the owner has to sign a receipt to tow it to tow that car that particular car

[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.960]
Right, but he's got to ask him. He's got to ask him to tow it away and he's got to sign it

[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.540]
They can't just come there and do it arbitrarily

[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:30.680]
No, it's exactly and that's exactly what they did. You went and they went inside they would they they went in

[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.740]
They took the liberty of they've towed in the car. So what's the upshot sir?

[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.680]
The upshot is I don't know what the hell to do

[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.820]
I've called these city attorneys office they'd there's give me the runner-out. I called the cops they're giving me the runner-out

[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.800]
I don't know what the hell now where is anybody out there? Where is this? Where is this?

[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.480]
This is right out the palm head off 58th Street

[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.920]
It's a mobile gas station and I left the car there and

[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:57.700]
If anybody knows anything that I could do I'd really appreciate you. I have one suggestion. You might not like it. What's that?

[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:02.440]
Something to think about good luck found all right

[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.200]
Thanks, okay. What a pilot craft. Why are they so why are there somebody nasty?

[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.320]
Surly rotten

[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.980]
Disagreeable this towing thing. That's one of the biggest scams going anywhere

[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:17.220]
Remember when in Fort Lauderdale where towing everybody's car away and it turned out there was this gigantic scandal

[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.040]
And everybody was getting kickbacks

[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:23.820]
You showed me one of these uh deals where they give one of these towing places a contract

[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:31.540]
And I'll show you one of the greatest scams in the history of mankind. It is the biggest joke and the biggest ripoff

[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:38.260]
And some of the pigs you know get kickbacks on this stuff. I I don't want to go into it. It's depressing right Betty Betty

[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:44.800]
Yeah, uh, I think we do need a campaign to get rid of dolphin Danny. Let's get the double-eyed

[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.320]
The

[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:54.860]
How dog George Lorenz the W I O D how dog what was that that's before my time well that's been

[00:50:54.860 --> 00:51:00.560]
In the orange bowl they used to have the how dog the dolphin mascot on the sideline

[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:08.300]
We don't need dolphin Danny. Yeah, amen. Let's run a campaign to run dolphin Danny's ass up to buffalo and stick it in the lake ury

[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:13.220]
Good deal good deal because I guess everybody hates him like poison huh right kind of useless

[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:20.220]
Right and go dolphin. Amen Betty. Thank you. Have a great life. We're with you 100% that's Betty from a steward by the way

[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.860]
Okay, send anybody wants to look her up

[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.360]
We have an open-minded brown or five two four nine far bitchie dolphin Danny wants to look her up

[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.280]
Stick around a tower and one end. Oh

[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:35.240]
He grabbed it. I can't believe you go ahead. I'll I can handle it anyway. Let's go to a pompano

Think of time have to do something

[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:46.620]

[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:54.360]

[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:08.540]
No

[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:14.840]
Come on. I saw Raymond Scholler win a race once I even saw Donald Brainer would have raised but I think it's about 10 years ago

[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.120]

[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:23.780]
Well everybody's got to make a living you know they got a little horse out there and the how about Richard can't happen 56 and four

Look out there. He goes

[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:31.200]
No, I wish I would have been I might have but no I would have lost some money. I think Mark Metzger had two winners last night

[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.240]
Didn't he yeah, not for me

[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.280]
He's in a Donald Brainerd school at Vernon down

[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:37.540]
He is

[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.160]
Better than he is

[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.960]
Michelle like I said Michelle Sue

[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.240]
I did years ago

[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.820]
Yeah, I heard you in Detroit

[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.320]
Indeed choice. Yes, sir. Do you have any love for them?

[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:07.320]
Well as matter of fact I used to go to the Mount Elliott soup kitchen for dinner so that you can get idea once I got into it

[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:11.200]
It was it was fun, but the little expensive you know to the expensive game

[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:15.760]
Because I think in maybe they are Iod could yeah something like that have a nice life fell

[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:24.860]

Pretty good. I saw the godfather. Yeah, and I have a dumb question. Okay. Who is Eli Wallace? Which one is he?

[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:14.560]
He is the old Don Ducebag the guy who's with the cane who's kind of like the snake in the grass the old man

[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.160]
Who gets up and runs out when it before they have the big hit?

He's in any goes to the assassin to take care of Michael Corleone. Oh, yeah, the guy that eats the canollis

[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.780]
Okay, yeah, one one can only too many

[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:34.080]
Well, I went to go see him the steerer. Yeah, and as soon as Corpola's daughter came out somebody behind me

[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:39.980]
It's a couple of guys started you know laughing as to the about ugly. She was. Yeah, I thought it was so funny

[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:44.520]
Same thing happen when I saw it the second time because I've got everybody prepared for this now

[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:50.340]
So I know so soon as she comes on they all start tittering and puking and throwing up their popcorn go nuts

[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.580]
Well, continue me a favor. Sure anything for you

[00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:00.300]
I'm looking around for the soundtrack the part one and it is discontinued. Yeah

So if I send you a tape could you tape it for me? You bet. Thank you

[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:10.440]
And in fact remember the guy called me that which is where you got this idea from? Yeah, never sent me the tape really good

[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.620]
Die everybody together here we go

[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.460]
I could have been a contender. No, it's a wrong movie Marlon come on

[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:31.380]
Pro 32 at WIOD we have an open line. That was a great movie on the waterfront with Eva Marie Saint

[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:36.880]
Lee J. Cobb one of the greatest actors in the history of film how come Bill Cosford never talks about Lee J. Cobb

[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:43.120]
One of the great actors. He was good in Ephraises too. Remember he was the police inspector. Do you see exorcist?

[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:49.140]
He was great. Remember the scene where he's he's going after the priest he keeps trying to uh drum some information

[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.060]
He says answer the question father paranoia

[00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:57.120]
That's my favorite one of the favorites next to of course the scene where the bar the priests are in the bar

[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:02.260]
And they're playing rambling man by the almond brothers in the background. That is a great scene even Chuck Meyer

[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:08.600]
He lost his mustache during that scene. It fell right off his face like Jerry Colona remember Jerry Colona dead or alive

[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.640]
Good one for you. Excellent

[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:19.660]
What was I talking about Lee J. Cobb dead or alive not even warm anymore Lee J. Cobb very dead but a great actor tremendous outstanding

[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:26.080]
On the waterfront I could have been a good tender. That's all I remember and then it was Marty

[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:31.580]
What do you want to do Marty? And what do you want to do that was like for two hours

[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:36.480]
That's all they said what do you want to do? Who was in Marty or in his borg9 and somebody the bunch of folks

[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:41.660]
We have an open line in date counties seven five one war seven five one nine four six three

[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.640]
Hey, what do you want from me? Okay, I'm gonna get the national football league

[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:51.500]
Let me ask you this Chuck if we were about to play the world series the pirates and the a's for example

[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.600]
Don't you wish and we were about to go into war

[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.000]
Okay

[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.800]
Playball playball okay my kind of guy

[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.720]
Uh like I said that's of course the credibility of our news department ladies and gentlemen

[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.120]
Just got a real good insight into it

[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:05.420]
751

[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.340]
Kill the bastards is our number in date and we'll be right back

[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:15.720]
Like a consumer problem and jack atherton and I he does a good job on channels for us

[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.080]
But he's kind of like doesn't he look like people used to look in the thirties

[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.020]
Not a bad looking guy, but he looks like he's in the wrong decade

[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:31.280]
He talks like this. Yeah, right all the time does he but uh let's put him on joy 107 who just declared chapter 11 by the way

[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:36.660]
Did you know that oh yeah the whole company did chapter 11 over joy one oh sorry. I guess there's no joy at 107

[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.880]
So he's gonna be on jack athert

[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:43.880]
He's gonna be on from eight to nine and I guess we'll take calls, but we're talking the other day about how

[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:50.420]
The whole consumer action thing is kind of falling down in a lot of places. It's a great way to get stuff done

[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:56.520]
It's a great kind of feature to watch because you learn stuff and um he may be doing the best job

[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.480]
Yeah, he does a real good job. He does

[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:04.500]
Did you see the number they did on by wise one day last week? Yeah, why they did a wild number because the guy had tried to buy the

[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.820]
TV said from the ad in the paper precisely. Yeah, oh man

[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:12.980]
And he injected a nice job and followed up on it and just had all his stuff right out there

[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:18.880]
So he'll be pretty good and as I understand he listens to this station and he's uh, you know, he's kind of a fan

[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:25.700]
So it'll be nice to be by that everybody. You know that doctor is why do I keep calling him a doctor Steve Greenberg on six is he a doctor?

[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.760]
Yeah, oh, yeah, well, I guess I see the related Fred shots

[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.840]
Oh, but uh, Steve Greenberg listens and that's where you found Jeff at pizza locked in his wife

[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.860]
Where we're getting the feelings out of their teeth and put them on TV to give him some more publicity

[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:38.340]
Which they need like hemorrhoids, but yeah, yeah

[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:45.280]
Uh, so Jack should be okay and then I've got this other guy on who um has done 50 ways to pave over the earth and

[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:49.440]
And you know, we're all pretty in mind. This would be a good time for it by the way exactly drive over the bag day

[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:54.120]
Exactly. It's gonna be eight lanes. No waiting. Yeah, all green lines the new auto bond and though

[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:58.520]
We also have the dead or alive playoffs again this weekend in preparation for the football

[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:02.200]
I would pencil in not for this week but like in about to 10 15 days

[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:06.900]
I put it a saddam Hussein analyst dead or alive. I think it'd be a real good one. You seen the Iraqi calendar

[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:12.460]
Yeah, and you saw that the Baghdad weather forecast is for partly cloudy 2000 degrees

[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.300]
So yeah, all that those jokes are making the go around you know, they are gonna get bombed in the dark ages

[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:22.420]
You don't understand that well, you know, you did you hear Rick and so I was on with Rick and suds for an hour yesterday

[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:27.900]
The only reason I preface that is because I said I don't believe there will be a war. I really don't know. I don't you think

[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:33.200]
Perez the quay are is going to uh, no as I'm gonna threaten to unleash all the Mexicans on a rack is that what's gonna do?

[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:39.520]
Well, Perez the quay are in Hussein don't get along anyway. I guess he's bashed who's saying in the past about human rights and they don't get along

[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:44.060]
But I just think that there's there's time left and um some cooler heads will prevail

[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:51.040]
You know, I think there's one on the if time you must be I think I'm the only person who believes that but I really do you see what happens when you're a Pirates fan

[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:52.940]
Pulled against the reds like that

[00:59:53.700 --> 01:00:00.320]
You're speaking of spring you realize it's just a few weeks. It's incredible. Isn't it and we didn't have spring training last year to speak off

[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.480]
So it'll be right and it seems like only yesterday that the cubs choked against the

[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.040]
Giants and the pirates choked against the red so the day before yesterday will come to june

[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:15.560]
I can't wait. I want the cubs are gonna be great this year. We are they are all you have to do is get at least one picture back

[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.940]
Well, you know, but I can make a cover like he will probably come back if he could be anything

[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:25.120]
I thought that's scary with bell and Dawson in the same outfield. Yeah, I mean it is they dug a descenzo

[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:29.340]
I hope they never have like a three-way collision in the outfield nobody ever see descenzo again. Yeah

[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.040]
I'm worried about the pirates. They're too cheap

[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.400]
They've lost no supreme so many first baseman out there they could have gotten and they didn't get anybody

[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:42.080]
And they're gonna they resign Carmelo Martinez. I saw they were doing. I one of those on a satellite

[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.040]
They they were interviewing Bobby Bonilla. I gotta be honest with that he is

[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:53.300]
Out of uniform. He is a bright. He's a good-looking. He's an intelligent guy articulate and in uniform

[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:58.020]
He looks like buster brown in the uniform. It's two sizes too small looks like a goop ball. Yeah

[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:06.260]
Yeah, he does amazing. It's true on camera and off the field. He's really a funny guy. Yeah, real perceptive. I hope they keep him

[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.260]
He's you know, you see you got to have some you got to sell some tickets. Yeah, see that's the problem up there

[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:16.480]
I want to bring up something about about the town as a bush league thing and I basically I agree with that

[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.400]
But you know do you realize how many cities had trouble selling out their playoff games last weekend?

[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:22.520]
Philadelphia

[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.700]
Needed the extra day to sell out for the wait a minute

[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:30.960]
Philadelphia need the extra day because they had the same deal we did they didn't know until like a couple of days before

[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:37.560]
When it was gonna be and those fans are fanatics and they usually sell a taco didn't sell out until like an hour or two before they had deadline

[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.840]
They have a hundred tickets like exactly and they just sold out and they did sell them. Yeah, no

[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.400]
Is the argument? Well, they're so used to play off that they can't get excited for new Orleans in a wild card game

[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:53.560]
I don't know. Maybe that's an argument, but the fact is that a lot of cities have had trouble selling out how many people does soldiers

[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:59.420]
Feed old seats 64 was that all yeah, why is that not used to be a huge stadium? That's an archaic place

[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:04.660]
Well, you know when they built that place was like over a hundred thousand seats. Yeah, they cut off what I was thinking

[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:08.660]
Yeah, oh, they cut off their end. Yeah, they cut off their end. I think Tom's that kind of problem

[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.580]
Allah, hey, I feel sorry for him because he's like lost

[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:16.760]
He had a couple of good moments in that game and against the Saints. That's all you need is a couple of good moments

[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.680]
But you know what the giants are gonna do them. Do you think you're gonna eat them up?

[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.460]
I eat them up. I mean, they don't only got to do a show up and that's it

[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:26.220]
That could be a real physical fun game to watch though

[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.900]
There is a pretty weak, but if they had a hardball, I might have a shot

[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.360]
But do you remember years ago

[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.880]
Soldier Field was the place remember where they used to play the college all-star game every year

[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:39.560]
The NFL champion would play college all-stars. It was a charity game in Chicago

[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:43.580]
And one year that game was lightninged out in the third quarter

[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.400]
They had a huge rainstorm and there was lightning hitting all over the stadium

[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.800]
And they canceled that game in the third quarter. It's a little soldier field trivia for you there

[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:59.060]
Like I said jack Athens is gonna be like a brush your fresh air

[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:04.220]
On while we're just killing time you'll baseball season that's all I thought we were killing fancill two o'clock

[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.140]
No, no, I got we got a lot of calls here

[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:09.300]
But I just wanted to give you because jack Atherton is a nice job

[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.940]
He may not be rick Sanchez

[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:15.120]
But at least the people know who he is and it's a but you may not let people call in and do their things

[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.680]
What is the purpose of him gonna be here just a show just a shield for his show and channel four?

[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.820]
Absolutely. What the hell have they done for us? That's all the problem

[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.660]
Let me point something out to you

[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:27.680]
I do this thing every year and I don't look for any publicity and I never get it so I'm not disappointed

[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.440]
But we raised a hundred we're gonna go over 110,000 for Camilla South

[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.400]
Do you think that's worth like a 10-second blip on the local newscasts?

[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.260]
I can't believe that there hasn't been some coverage of it zero

[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.880]
Nobody in this town could do zero

[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:44.400]
What I'm over here ripping the hurricanes after that and the right away they send a pet the Harrington Jr

[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.560]
Whatever his name is over here. I'm right away about it. Yeah

[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:51.860]
But I'm done. It's just a sad it really is a congratulations on that incidently because

[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:56.600]
Well, thank you so much for tough and but look at the numbers you went way over last year

[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.640]
And you were gone for a while anyway and I thought it's nice

[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.240]
I think because we did so well

[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.460]
I think another couple of weeks will be deserved right now until baseball starts

[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.060]
Yeah, no, I mean no, I don't mean that I mean vacation because when I've gone for a little while

[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:15.360]
It starts the sympathy dollar storm. You want to do the spring training circuit this year go to some some other games out of town

[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.120]
Or just going to hang out and fort lauderdale and root on your favorite Yankees

[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:25.940]
In other words, you're asking do I go to spring training games? Yeah, I don't go to spring training games. I don't I'm not interested

[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:31.400]
How about Mesa Arizona's note. How about a Neil that was trip to Mesa? Oh, that would be great

[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.480]
You know, that's a good idea, but who now wants to go Mesa Arizona spot

[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:41.780]
Out how close is it to Phoenix? How close? 10 miles? Oh, so it's like a suburb. Yeah, exactly

[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.600]
Basically, that's not 100,000 people great. They got a dog trekking Phoenix. They do

[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.780]
How much else don't know if turf paradise is still open? No. Oh, yeah, it is

[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:55.040]
It is yes, it is I was opposed now. It's reopened. Yeah, your paradise is open Phoenix is nice. Good thinking

[01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:00.860]
We could go to a steve stones restaurant out there. Yeah, you could go up to pinnacle peak over in Scottsdale

[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:06.180]

I should have asked him about Dave Barry

[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.780]
Did you notice in Hank's promo Hank was like floundering to try to find something to say about Dave Barry

[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:09.800]
Hank you be to just said that twerp Dave Barry see the reason Dave Barry is gonna be on it's because he writes for the hero and Hank's

[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.540]
agency handles the hero and Hank's great and all of that, but he probably feels sorry for Dave because he's so short

[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.960]
Anyway, oh, we got some good. We're gonna go over 109,000 today

[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:40.440]
but

[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.860]
Totally bogus he doesn't live in this town. He listened jersey almost all year

[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.800]
He's never here. He's either at a film festival or in jersey. Oh really?

[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.040]
Secondly, he knows nothing about movies

[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:56.120]
Thirdly, he writes these reviews based on pseudo intellectual crap not on what the average viewer would say

[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:01.200]
So the best thing to do with cost for is the fewer stars he gives the faster go run out and see it

[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.140]
Well, I took his advice is top 10 list reddit crybaby last night. Oh man

[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:06.660]
Wow

[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:16.700]
That's why I stopped by now. I'm curious how many minutes did you last before you put it in the part off position part two is on tonight if I can make it through

[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:21.420]
Part two I couldn't make it through last night. I just couldn't make it all the whole thing

[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:25.380]
So in other words you what you're in other words you're that cheap that you're gonna watch the whole thing no matter how bad it is

[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:31.460]
It was blockbuster sure you know I get it from tonight, yeah, but I was wow what a movie

[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:39.040]
The worst with the pigtails and the stupid gross like all like hatchet face. Yeah, no wonder he'd like to trace it

[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.400]
He likes all these bizarre and gremlins to he's into the yeah crap camp

[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:51.040]
Yeah, it's what it is. Yeah, like can't be like the midnight thing like the event's the one throwing the um

[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.500]
Rocky Horror picture show. Exactly. Can't exactly well

[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:57.480]
I think because if you look at the people at cost for hangs around would like George

[01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:58.900]
What's his name?

[01:12:59.540 --> 01:12:59.940]
The

[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.340]
Movie guide George Capewell and all these silly people can't I think is the opportunity they're camp crowd and

[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:12.920]
Somebody out of sentiment can I have it really watch Johnny definitely good. I know my show on morning

[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:16.560]
I'm waxing we were having a great time and all these teenage girls were calling in and getting

[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:21.360]
Getting their hormones were just exploding. I imagine I felt the same way sitting there. Yeah, he's good looking

[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.960]
He was like right over on the other side. Yeah, well like I've said he is a good looking guy

[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.560]
The interesting thing about Johnny Depp is that he is um

[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.220]
Remember the not the news picture in Rolling Stone

[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:35.320]
But once before they had a centerfold of Johnny Depp and he looked like a woman with an earring and like a straight

[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.480]
He looked bizarre. Well, he has like got a pretty face

[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.860]
No, I don't mean that but I mean he looks like different people no worries in actor because even without makeup

[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:48.220]
He on a different day depending on how he gets out of the sack and I guess who with with no one or somebody else

[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:53.680]
He just has these bizarre things. Well, you see that's what's bizarre because I told you I saw him in that interview

[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:58.660]
And he doesn't say two words. He's like this James Dean real quiet. Why did they you were whipping him on the air?

[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:04.480]
I wasn't ripping him. What I was what no, I like you great what the comparison was is he's such a great actor

[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.340]
I can't see this guy doing what he does. Well, that's why they call it acting

[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:11.340]
There are a lot of people in show visitor. How about Marlon Brando?

[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:15.540]
Once the last time you saw him say anything. He's like a hermit him and Michael in the uh chicken

[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:21.360]
But he still kind of plays those same roles. He doesn't get animated like Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp was singing in this movie and I mean he just

[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:29.560]
Just totally out of character, but what a movie come on. I'm really curious what all the big deal is about James Dean

[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.240]
You know it over the year goes to show you that the world is so much crann well memory, you know

[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:36.880]
It's it's out of James Dean first of all wasn't all I create looking number one number two

[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.940]
He smelled real bad and he was a lousy drive number three. He was a slob if you read I mean he was just a oh yeah

[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:46.920]
And a good driver too and matter of fact what we're gonna do to save a lot of blood shit

[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.880]
No, seriously what we're gonna do is when we have this last minute meeting and they will have one

[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.940]
We're gonna send Ted Kennedy and

[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:59.040]
There he is James Dean Jr. Over to what Geneva to drive Saddam Hussein to the meeting exactly and that would be good because a lot of

[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.700]
Bridges Ted doesn't want any war man

[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:07.780]
You know, I hate to say this all my life. I've been a Democrat. I don't hate to say that but I have been and I've been watching this week's like some on the C

[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.480]
Span Ted Kennedy and

[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:18.020]
Some of the other I can't think of the moment of summer who they are and the and Biden the course who can't remember what his real name is and where he went to school

[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:24.960]
But or whose speech he stole last week and they're just infuriating me. I mean what the hell do they think this is like we're gonna

[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:29.860]
Let's have a debate for about 20 or 30 days. I mean, where the hell they've been the last five or six months, okay?

[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:34.960]
And they got like four five hundred thousand people over there in the middle of the sand and they're like oh jee

[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:39.920]
I don't think it let's wait a little while okay, and you can't do anything with a I thought and I'm not gonna go into it

[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.300]
I'm like good political well, I didn't want to yesterday either but these news conferences kept interrupting things

[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.700]
So we lost the flow and just went with it and you're right

[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.660]
Not the time to do it. It's not like they can't hear yeah

[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.520]
They don't understand

[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:54.660]
Well

[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:01.740]
Then they're too busy doing something making veils that's that's that's the right you read about the two-life crew

[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:04.500]
albums and all the stuff that they have on sale over there

[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:11.500]
Overware in Saudi Arabia, but they like thank you hear that sheriff Nick man get on the first plane baby

[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:16.180]
What the bizarre part is is they black out the cleavage and they black out all the women and all of that

[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:20.200]
Say I that's another thing. I mentioned this a few days ago. No, this does bother me a lot

[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:24.240]
I mentioned it during the holidays during Hanukkah and Christmas school these Saudi Arabian

[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:25.480]
assholes

[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.760]
I mean we're over there to protect them

[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:32.160]
So now I'm could probably wipe them out in about 30 seconds because there are a bunch of Neanderthals and all the

[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.580]
Asheaks have got all the money and the rest of them are like in the dark ages and

[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.080]
Here we go who we put all our people you know the rest of the world is standing behind us and hey

[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:45.240]
We're all behind you, but you said all your people right and we're all over there and we're putting our ass on the line

[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.600]
And they're gonna tell us oh you can't celebrate to this you can't yeah, they're out there in the middle of the desert

[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.100]
What the hell is it their business for that to be kissing our feet?

[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:57.980]
They ought to be bringing mizuzas and crosses out there during the holidays to help everybody celebrate

[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:03.700]
You're right. What a bunch of as a courtesy in addition to which all is 50 billion dollar windfall that they got from

[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:08.040]
Goosing up all these oil prices and they're just sitting back wow well here's about 10 billion for right now

[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.840]
And you know, we'll see what happens see how well you do

[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.160]
But they were gonna pull two live crews album off the shelves because somebody's seriously just told them what it man

[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.140]
What they were saying in the album yeah, they blacked out the cover

[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:24.160]
But they didn't know what the album was saying so everybody was buying it and they say oh it means that yeah

[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:30.780]
So they're gonna pull it off well in the study back to Saudi Arabia these to still think like mother is a member of family let us sit and nick over there

[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.740]
You mean sheriff Nick exactly one 14 to w.w.o. D

[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:40.060]
And let's talk about our good friends at Pomato Park now. I know you'll be out there tomorrow

[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:42.460]
I stopped by my way in

[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:46.880]
In fact the lights went out Monday night because we heard the rumor rick and spuds were coming out

[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.840]
We didn't want to lose any money so we cancel a race in four how much did you guys lose of coder Friday not too much?

[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:54.040]
Only the one race I

[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:59.300]
No one to stop. Oh, okay probably not again soon. I wanted help and and I got

[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:04.040]
I didn't listen to Phil Phil had five winners didn't pay anything but he was picking him like crazy

[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:09.460]
Well, that's always a should of listen. I told you I walked out next to a guy who won a hundred and forty bucks on one race in

[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:14.060]
Any left any had to tell me about it all the way out to my car. Yeah, screw him

[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:19.540]
Anyway, we don't like wise guys who win and talk about it tomorrow night at Pomato Park our six 10 w.w. I. O. D

[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:20.580]
Pop it a harness fan race

[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:25.240]
Because I may in the paper address it at a future date

[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:33.220]
Oh, geez. What what do I gotta say to you to make you understand stop being a hothead stop being forget about time jicka

[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:34.560]
He hates you like poison

[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:40.800]
He doesn't like your show or even if he did like it would make any difference because he's got a personal thing with you like a feud going

[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:44.860]
What do you care? Why do you care the odd see that's another thing?

[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:50.500]
Yes, today I came to this realization the audience doesn't care about all this other silly crap that was going on

[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:56.100]
So why should I you know get sucked into a bunch of crap that nobody cares about and the same thing what you're talking about

[01:18:56.100 --> 01:19:02.800]
Nobody cares and you're allowed your you're wasting your energy life is too short to waste your energy

[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:07.660]
Okay, you're not gonna manipulate him and the more you start sticking your nose in and making a big deal of it

[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:12.420]
The more hard-headed he is gonna be and the more you're gonna have like a big thing is that what you want no not at all

[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.240]
And you're getting something going

[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:21.140]
What by mentioning it now? No, I'm not. I mean, it's it's common knowledge that you guys like hate each other like poison

[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:26.360]
And it's like I don't hate him. That's the problem. Well, you stop it. Yes. I hate you don't like him

[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:32.000]
You just like him a lot. You think he's a jackass. Well, exactly. Okay. Well, I'm glad you said it that way

[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.540]
21 after one we have an open line on a starline where somebody probably Tom was on starline just drove off the road

[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:41.580]
Sorry, Tom. You're okay. I like Tom. He's full of crap sometimes, but I like him

[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:47.300]
I'm not gonna pick a thing with him because he's like you I don't do that. I like Tom a lot even though he's usually full of crap

[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:48.220]
Kendall

[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.280]
Okay, uh, Sherry making a while this is for him

[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:56.940]
I'm listening

[01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:58.260]
I'm listening

[01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:58.800]
I'm listening

[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:02.400]
Let's go. I'm looking. Oh, that's not it. Where is it? I'm listening

[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:09.200]
Yeah, excellent. Okay. Thank you, sir

[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:13.000]
21 after one at W.I. By the way, I forgot to announce we just went over another

[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.900]
Hege we just jumped another hurdle

[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.240]
109,176 dollars for Camino's house 109 plus boy, we're gonna do 110

[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:28.520]
Unbelievable. I just was the demo uh, Tuesday the 15 well, I picked that because I know it was a major date

[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.140]
I want to tack along for a little publicity

[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:37.080]
I think we got a better chance of making 110 by Tuesday then Saddam has a CNX Wednesday

[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.560]
Well, it's an appropriate date

[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:46.420]
I think that's why they're basing their tosses. I think doing like a movie on it all so proper that he stars and I'm

[01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:49.480]
NBC. I think this weekend dark ages or dark shadows

[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:55.480]
A lady in Coral Springs probably your wife hello

[01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:00.720]
Neil how you doing good. How are you great great? I listen to you. There's no way

[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:05.020]
possible that we can afford to get rid of

[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:05.860]
baffin denny

[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:07.520]
yo

[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:14.860]
Yeah, am I gonna be caught in the middle of this now? I don't even pay any attention to dolphin denny

[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:18.440]
I mean he's I go there and I build up my own enthusiasm because I'm enthusiastic

[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.580]
He's a die-hard fan and they're far

[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:25.140]
He and in between. Well, that's true. You know, we can't afford to lose one of them

[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.000]
I don't know about the die part but the other part is

[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:33.600]
Um, I'm a single mom and my little boy wanted to go to this game real bad to play off game

[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.760]
Yeah, and I took off work early

[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.920]
Went down to the stadium got two tickets

[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:45.400]
our parking ticket and I'll tell you it was the we had of uh, oh yeah

[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:48.780]
I thought you were gonna give me some story that you couldn't get there or something

[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:53.620]
I'm glad you were there was one of the greatest experiences of anything that has ever happened in this town

[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:59.480]
And I realized it's only a game and it's sports but even so it was one of the most positive things that's ever happened in this city

[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:04.060]
Absolutely, absolutely my my little boy has to put up with jet fans at school

[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:06.860]
I mean, I think it's the only baffin fan there

[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:11.640]
Um, but tell him that if he has any friends in school or jet fans if they're smaller than he has beat the crap

[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:17.380]
Yeah, you're right. I hear you. Listen, do you know how much they cost to go to a game at rich stadium other than a playoff?

[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.860]
Somebody showed me some tickets they had it was 30

[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:23.040]
Well, those are the playoff game. That was 30 bucks, but that could be like an Enzo

[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.860]
I have no idea was 30 bucks. Okay. Alrighty. Well listen, go dive in. Okay. Thank you. Thanks

[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.860]
There we have an enthusiastic dolphin person. That's what we want tomorrow

[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:35.760]
I'm just letting it all hang out. I really mean that. I mean the dolphin, but oh

[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.960]
We might even play Cory now. You're gonna put him on again. I'm glad you're in here now

[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:43.800]
I mean, I don't want to chastise you and take you to task and sound like Tom jikka and heat

[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:49.280]
But what the hell is it with you and Cory? You got a little something going there. What is the deal again? Cory's a pain

[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:56.100]
He's a pain in the ass. Take a pull on Cory and stick him on it. He's half it. Yeah, run him up

[01:22:56.100 --> 01:23:02.120]
Just like that lately. Thank you. One the bad guy. He called yesterday. Remember I was asking about dolphin enthusiasts because on the bat line

[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.500]
I wonder if you think fat rich gave him the bat line number

[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:07.520]
Who gave him that number on the bat line got me

[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:09.660]
I

[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:13.360]
Mean I don't even know it. I do and here it is

[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:19.820]
Um, I'm serious. What's the deal more people could be like dolphin Danny and and Cory

[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.100]
We'd be fine. If more people were like Cory and dolphin Danny

[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.280]
We would tell us that I'm with saying he's got a pretty good point

[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:31.480]
We say okay, we surrender here's Elvis. Give it like little bullseye shirts return to surrender

[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.680]
You know tell him this is like the ultimate fan dolphins on the front

[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:40.880]
Cory has nothing to do so he wants to be like a past and even if the remote at Calder Gilbert is starting to really

[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:44.860]
I mean all the other most Gilbert puts on a show and we kind of keep him on a leash and he you know, he's okay

[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:49.600]
He's starting to get on my nerves. Cory is kind of our Gilbert. He gets on people's nerves. Oh

[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.260]
I see

[01:23:53.960 --> 01:24:00.700]
I got it. Do you get your card from Africa? I show dead hands on the safari yet. Yeah, I mean the fun safari

[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:03.200]
He was

[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.540]
He was the animal he saw

[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.160]
Swing and to fight get it down. Ha

[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:12.060]
I'm starting to sound like him now. I wasn't even putting on an act that was just scary

[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:19.800]
Markets up 21 points. Look at that. How come is it we're getting closer to war? How come the markets going up? Boy yesterday

[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.940]
I said I give you knots. Well, it was going way up when the talks were still going on because they all thought something

[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:26.180]
Then as soon as he came out and said no way Jose

[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.860]
right in the old cramper

[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:31.860]
I need to come more of those talks now put a bunch of money in it

[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:32.760]
Yeah

[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:36.680]
You like the other thing I don't know when the number starts with a minus in other words

[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:40.880]
When they pay you to take the stock 126 at W.I.O.D

[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.020]
Where Cory will be honest to a clock with Rick and said why didn't you make him the idiot on the corner?

[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:46.420]
Isn't he?

[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.140]
Instead of Marvin. I mean Marvin doesn't have to put on an act doing it

[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.960]
I think it out of long handers. It's pretty funny though

[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.500]
What? Well, I just noticed that. But that's been on there for days

[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:05.720]
And it's no longer applicable okay. No. What was the word that Bush used yesterday? Oh man. He did a number on a word um

[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:08.380]
obfuscation

[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.980]
Opus gate well the way he said it's opus gauge, but he said oh opus gate they're trying to opus gate

[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:18.940]
I said I've heard of watergate, but opus gate that must be a new was gamble

[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.120]
Opus gate

[01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:25.020]
You're gonna watch how you say that no seriously

[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:29.100]
He said that I don't in the minute and here I'm sitting there and everybody's watching and it's a serious thing

[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:35.020]
And a world is like spinning on a dreidel like hang by a threat and a president comes on and says obfuscate

[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:40.840]
I think they're gonna have a super ball of damn quail school. What you think they're gonna have a super bowl if we have a war

[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.880]
I don't understand the question maybe they ought to do that like on the fort why wouldn't they have a super ball if we went to war

[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.520]
The war could go on for days or weeks or months

[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:52.800]
Do you want to be serious?

[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:52.960]
Yes

[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.460]
What do you want a serious answer? Yeah

[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.660]
Because who's gonna want to celebrate with the loss of lives that we have if it goes on

[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:06.620]
It's not a time to super ball is this celebration? Let me ask you this question was Vietnam a war

[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:09.180]
It went on for years everybody got used to it. Dirk

[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:13.660]
No, they didn't get used to it the longer it went on them or they protest until they finally cut the crap

[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:15.960]
But my point is why were at war

[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.880]
Like Korea with career war

[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:23.120]
Yeah, did we stop all the sporting events and everything else we had super bowl then

[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.580]
We stopped super bowl base ball

[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:31.200]
Did we stop the world show I wasn't alive now we did yes you were what do you mean you weren't alive then 51

[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:38.240]
I mean I was born in 51. Okay. Okay. Boy. I wasn't socially conscious at that time

[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:44.400]
So what are you just playing even kind of what else is exactly? Uh, I think you're full of it to be honest with well, thank you

[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.400]
I just I don't see the connection

[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.600]
I mean the fact that there's things going on over the I don't think we'll have one

[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.280]
I think the American people would cry out if we tried to have one is say can you have a super bowl and celebrate when we're losing our

[01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:02.240]
Are people over in well if that's the case then why you aren't you on here every day talking about world war three and about the Middle East

[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.880]
I mean, I'm gonna do about it exactly

[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:10.400]
Exactly. I mean, that's the part of human events. It's ongoing. It's happening. Okay, but if there is nothing that's going to change

[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.460]
And I think that if we all become more, but you're what do you mean it's too close? It's super bowl worth February

[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:21.000]
All right, so let's call the White House and say start invade on the 28 exactly. That's what I said or super bowl on the 14

[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.480]
I see if Baker and Aziz could have come to agreement that fast yesterday. We'd have this whole thing well. Let's us go over there

[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:28.960]
You first nevermind

[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:35.760]
I think that little shrimp in Israel is going to take care of everything to be honest some good point yesterday

[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:41.980]
Did you listen it's rock Shamir well? He said he reiterated them with you have you ever seen him and Bob mayor together by the way

[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:50.120]
It's a hot Shamir who now what is it Chuck Meyer? Yeah, who's got what's his name from Channel 4 on on Sunday? Yeah, yeah, what

[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:54.380]
Saturday, he doesn't think it's gonna happen. He said that here before is that where you heard it?

[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:02.340]
Now what I just said yeah, he also said that the guy they picked up was not the gamesville murder or two that you had a money

[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:04.560]
I was ordered so bring Chuck Meyer in here anymore

[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:08.160]
Anyway, it's one twang. That's just a little joke. He's a pirate well

[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:14.140]
I saw through all right. Let's take a caller to these people are probably foaming at the mouth Miami

[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:19.100]
Neil yes, sir. How you doing? You think we should cancel the Super Bowl? Hell no, okay

[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:24.340]
Um, I don't think I think people need something to get their mind exactly

[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:28.820]
I mean, what are we gonna do sit around worrying black and be in mourning all of it? I was played over there. I don't know

[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:32.460]
Yeah, let's play it in the bag dad. Yeah, the desert ball. Yeah, there you go

[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:36.300]
I probably have that next year look it's taking me a long time to find you

[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:44.380]
I moved two years ago and I came back and used to be on Zeta. Yeah, and used to have that guy with you that I used to call up

[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:47.400]
I don't know if you remember make fun of his laugh on the nerd. Yeah, the bird

[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.020]
Yeah, he was always phony

[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.760]
So you're here now, huh? I'm here. I've been here for over two years

[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:59.160]
No, let me let me tell you a question and let me answer you an answer

[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:05.780]
The reason that you weren't able to find me is because this station has no concept of what promotion means and so our billboard say

[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:14.520]
News weather and traffic which every other AM station in the history of radio is also had and they don't tell you that Rineria and Rogers and Rick and suds and hang Goldberger on the year in the sports people

[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:22.760]
They just keep us a secret. You want to post red check so you have to go out there and kind of fiddle around till you find us. Yeah, and I'm glad I did right there in a red check

[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.940]
It's written you're the middle one. Yeah, check this

[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:32.760]
So anyway, so Neil yeah, let me let me give you a little bit of a cup tidbit information. All right. All right

[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:39.920]
Now we're talking great first baseman. Yeah, I got a brother named Kevin. Yeah, he's gonna be the new third baseman starting this season

[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:47.800]
Are you serious? I'm serious. Yeah, Pacific coast Pacific coast league last year. This is named Kevin Kevin Grace. That's right

[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:51.780]
Mark Grace I tried before the game we can say grace. That's right

[01:29:52.280 --> 01:30:01.720]
Savings Pacific coast league. He batted 285 26 home runs and he was a gold glove because I always wondered you know his grace slick

[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:23.360]
great

[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:29.360]
Yes, sir, Doug the Sanzo should be our center fielder stick that you're on Walton in the desert

[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:32.200]
No, he just did a home run what happened at the way to Smith

[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:36.360]
I thought they were gonna trade Dwight Smith because he had a terrible year this past year

[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.600]
And he seems like lost out there like the land of the lost

[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:41.900]
But maybe you'll make a big comeback maybe it was the sophomore jinx

[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:46.900]
The Sanzo's like a backman kind of guy. You know, he just sends. Oh is a great fielder. He's a clutch hitter

[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:50.580]
He slaps that ball around and he's good. He's a player. You don't want

[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:55.940]
Now with Bell and Boston. You don't smash it into make a pizza out of them. Oh, that's true

[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:59.780]
Well, it's great talking again and go Cubs and go to Austin

[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:03.660]
They need to play a five-man line to do anything against Buffalo. You're a great American, sir

[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:07.740]
Let's send you up there to do a little pass where it's a little blitzing this week a little blitzing definitely

[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:11.700]
Okay, have a nice one. See you a little blitz Kreegan Buffalo

[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:15.040]
That's what we need stick that Jim Kelly in the desert and don't give him a map

[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.840]
Maybe give him a razor blade

[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:23.580]
132 at W.I.O.D. We have an open line. Look at that boy. We are sizzling today. This is incredible

[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:39.020]
That he's gonna make your day that he's here. He's gonna be out

[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:43.360]
He is no he's gonna be here George Hadeson George says

[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:48.320]
Well, how can you blame him? He's got to sit through eight hours of crap. I know. I know that's a fate worse than watching

[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:50.420]
What's that movie with Johnny Depp?

[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:54.400]
garbage

[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:59.420]
What's up Johnny? How come it is now Johnny Depp? He made crybaby and falls it immediately with that

[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:00.660]

Edward Burger yeah, she's her hands. Yeah, how come he can't like just be himself on there

[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:10.840]
Just take some clothes off for something. I mean, why is he gonna be all dolled up like some goofball? That's right. What is that a new deal?

[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.260]
He's gonna be a goofball

[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:18.220]
Why don't he was on our show? He had a leather jacket on he just come from a some bar with Greg Alman who was calling

[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.480]
Ron on his hands and he's throwing up and couldn't make the show

[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:26.120]
dog give crybaby thumbs down, but I think that's where he's going to be supposed to be Greg Alman couldn't make the show

[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:30.800]
He was like he had all these share pictures. He was scribbling on oh he was gonna be on your it's eight

[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.040]
Well, they they were out together all night and somebody arranged to bring them in

I mean this was like at 6.30 in the morning. He was on do 10 Johnny Depp and you booked Greg Alman at 6.30 in the morning

[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:48.300]

The 205 the saftoon we got the idiot on the corner on the sheet, but not on the show

[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:03.100]
Hey, if you can't be on the show at least be on the sheet. You missed the party line. That's what they say in

[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:04.180]
Davie

[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:07.240]
Oh, yeah, they had a little party last night and of course my luck

[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:12.840]
I started my new trips just to me yesterday. Oh, I had to do I had to do my blood sugar was much lower this morning

[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:16.180]
I feel much better. I really do. I mean like a measurable difference

[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.820]
Because I was starting to become like a Dave gaming and

[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:24.820]
Feeling it please part of it and a stress from that horse that's still running out there and Alan thinkelson called

[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:27.060]
They're gonna look and they've looked into that. They're gonna take care

[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:30.280]
I just don't want to get into a whole thing about that again. I don't mind losing

[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.260]
I really don't because I'm used to it most of the time

[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:35.380]
But when all the horses start going this way and mine is going that way

[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:38.720]
I that does bother me a little bit. Well call me quick. I'll give you some money for it

[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:39.900]
We have an open line indeed

[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:41.680]
751

[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:44.720]
W. I would do so I mentioned the party and you started talking about horses

[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:50.640]
51 well, I figured probably a lot of horses answers their last night. Well anybody show up. I heard it wasn't much

[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:54.760]

[01:33:55.340 --> 01:33:57.480]
Oh, man plaster
