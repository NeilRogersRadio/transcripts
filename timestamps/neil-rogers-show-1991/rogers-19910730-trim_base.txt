[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860]
Fort Lauderdale, our lonely, Broward Call.

[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.160]
Hi Neil, this is Bailey Herman.

[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.160]
How are you doing, Billy?

[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.640]
I'm a good woman, say, I'm silly!

[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.760]
Ha ha ha ha!

[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.980]
Okay.

[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.960]
All the Broward lines open up like a SIV.

[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.380]
524, WIOD, the ladies, we had one lady in that first hour today.

[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.040]
We're like right back, we were yesterday, it's like Desi Rue all over again.

[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.060]
Isn't it?

[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.200]
This is just like an instant replay.

[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.840]
Boca on the award line, hello.

[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.020]
Neil?

[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.500]
Yes.

[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.500]
In honor of Peewee, bring back the lightning round.

[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.100]
Yeah, bring back this, sir.

[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.520]
We need the license, okay?

[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.280]
One open line and Broward, two of them, 524, WIOD, maybe that cloud cover is covering

[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.320]
up in Broward again, maybe they can't hear us.

[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.360]
Or maybe Greg's talking about how he pressed he is in suicidal or wants to quit and

[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.980]
just evades him like poison and everybody in Broward's listening, I don't know.

[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.540]
Hey kids, if you thought Peewee was fun tune in this Saturday morning for Aini's Playhouse.

[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.340]
Drop your eyes, get out of bed, bang, bang, bang, the bed guy said it's time for Aini's Playhouse.

[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.980]
Hi boys and girls, welcome to Aini's Playhouse.

[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.260]
Today's word is oozy, watch.

[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.040]
Wasn't that fun?

[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.400]
Meet some of Aini's friends like Terry the Teradactyl.

[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.900]
Hi Aini.

[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.000]
Hi Terry.

[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.660]
Consider yourself extinct.

[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.180]
Wasn't that fun?

[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.240]
The fun never stops at Aini's Playhouse.

[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.460]
Now, let's go over to the talking head.

[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.940]
Hi head.

[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.500]
Yo.

[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.140]
Okay head, tell us the future.

[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.860]
Okay, your next movie is going to stink.

[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.720]
Oh really?

[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.100]
Okay kids.

[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.460]
Let's sing.

[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.720]
Hi head.

[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.860]
Hi head.

[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.300]
It's time to eat some lead.

[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.940]
Don't know this Saturday morning madness on Aini's Playhouse.

[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080]
Don't go away.

[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.680]
We'll be by.

[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.820]
That's what I'm afraid of.

[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.020]
Look at those phones popping right off of there during that.

[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.580]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.500]
Man, something to sit here and watch those babies pop off.

[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.720]
Two lines open and Broward, 524 and we were all filled up there for a second or two but

[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.560]
that don't last long.

[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.880]
They're just not with us anymore.

[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.820]
See they hate Rick and Suds and they hate me too but they don't have the gumption to call

[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.620]
in here and say that because they're not listening anymore.

[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.840]
1-800-944-WIOD on our toll free Florida line.

[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.820]
Miami.

[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.760]
Neil.

[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.540]
Yes sir.

[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.620]
Listen, maybe you can tell me if this rumor is true.

[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.000]
Yeah.

[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.580]
Alice Rubin is going to Sarah Thodeur to get him off.

[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.480]
No, I don't want to get into Ellis personal life.

[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.100]
We have an open line at day, 751 and 1 in Broward, 524 and went on the world famous WIOD,

[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.900]
see the world line.

[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.320]
Neil.

[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.720]
Yeah.

[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.080]
I need the P.E. music.

[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.900]
I gotta phone for you.

[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.680]
No, it's going to be something gross.

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.620]
Everybody's a musician today.

[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.680]
Everybody's a comedian.

[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.640]
This is when a show starts taking a turn for the Worsh.

[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.560]
Oh no, it's not gross.

[00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.240]
Oh, okay.

[00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.680]
You sure?

[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.180]
Yes.

[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.780]
I know.

[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.360]
Okay.

[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.620]
That's it.

[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.400]
I need it from the beginning.

[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.680]
That's it.

[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.500]
I like to watch movies.

[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.280]
Every time I see a side, I feel like grabbing my sign up.

[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.200]
Him.

[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.020]
I wanted to ask who I to film the next episode.

[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.040]
Oscar Award in Show.

[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.040]

[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.060]
Listen to me here.

[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.080]
That is not smashing anyone because I am in my voice.

[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.100]
Yeah, that is a bunch.

[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.100]

[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.260]
시다 of the record, if someone in my voice would be a unit piece of丁 urban in the

[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.520]
I don't know y'all sound like they're on drugs.

[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.260]
Listen, I owe you apologies.

[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.320]
For what?

[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.980]
For yesterday.

[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.100]
What happened yesterday?

[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.020]
Well, you hung up on me.

[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.060]
I called back and the guy answers and said I said the slang word for-

[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.340]
You didn't say any slang word.

[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.420]
You said a disgusting four-letter grotesque word that begins with SNNs with T.

[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.760]
Uh-huh, right, right.

[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.540]
So would you accept my apology?

[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.020]
No.

[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.160]
Well, I-

[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.260]
This is a radio show.

[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.580]
This is kind of a pornographic payways P house or something.

[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.120]
I didn't know if this is.

[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.420]
Well, I don't care how you're admitted.

[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.060]
You have to be a little more careful when you're on the radio because we live in a fascist

[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.320]
world where everybody's so concerned about words, okay?

[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.260]
Yeah, I know.

[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.540]
I- well, I've listened to you about a handful of times and I've heard other words-

[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.940]
No, they're worried about a handful, too.

[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.740]
That's over in Sarasota or half a handful.

[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.240]
I mean, it's just- it's pathetic.

[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.740]
It's tragic.

[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.700]
It's embarrassing.

[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.880]
And I wasn't pretending.

[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.560]
We live in a fascist, we are the way-

[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.120]
What about with a William Kennedy Smith trial to take time out to worry about these things?

[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.840]
Oh, I know.

[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.680]
When does it start?

[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.860]
I don't know.

[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.040]
No.

[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.760]
But I recently-

[00:04:50.760 --> 00:05:12.540]
And also all of you who don't have a satellite dish-

[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.060]
So anyway, what were you saying?

[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.460]
Oh, boy, I originally called you about the lobster season yesterday.

[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.220]
Oh.

[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.120]
This is not the micronary show.

[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.660]
I'm not interested in lobsters over there.

[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.880]
Oh, that's what I have to call me-

[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.900]
Not interested in fishing or golf or lobsters.

[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.300]
I'm not interested in that.

[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.080]
How about beefball?

[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.080]
What about it?

[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.200]
Well, you told the game that they- he hit the ball and they missed and-

[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.980]
If it opened a lot and groward by the way, 524WID.

[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.100]
What is it?

[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.980]
Hold on a second.

[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.520]
Yep, it's working.

[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.280]
I'm just checking.

[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.940]
Okay.

[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.700]
Well, your team won by the guy missing the ball.

[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.760]
I'm not into baseball, but I know you are.

[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.880]
Well, last year, I don't know what the opposing team was, but the dolphins won a game like that.

[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.300]
The opposing team kicked-

[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.380]
Well, you don't want to go back to last year.

[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.040]
What does that mean?

[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.040]
Oh, nothing.

[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.840]
I had a thrill over it that-

[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.400]
Well, I'm glad you had a thrill, okay.

[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.480]
You know, the thrilling game that they won by them-

[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.060]
I don't know.

[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.740]
I heard something on your show yesterday about the winning-

[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.100]
You know, the guy posting the baseball games-

[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.260]
Hosting the baseball game.

[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.820]
Oh, whatever.

[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.080]
I think your sports knowledge, ma'am, is full of-

[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.740]
Right, you're right.

[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.780]
Like what you said yesterday.

[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.860]
Exactly.

[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.500]
Right.

[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.280]
Well, hey, I told my husband-

[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.280]
The controversy was, anyway, I wanted to call you up when nobody was lighting up your lines yesterday.

[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.460]
Yeah.

[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.540]
So I gave him-

[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.380]
What have I had to break that was?

[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.500]
Yeah, I get home and wait on the line for an hour.

[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.900]
We had a great conversation going-

[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.740]
You were late on the line?

[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.400]
Yeah, and then you got the news going and then I get, you know, shut off because of the-

[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.060]
The, uh, in-a-word.

[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.300]
You know?

[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.740]
The in-a-word?

[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.740]
Hey, I got recommended by my brother-in-law by saying that word to a little kid by accident.

[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.720]
And I just felt bad.

[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.240]
I got recommended by your-

[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.440]
Do you have any idea what you're talking about or you just do-

[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.740]
Like every morning at about 10-

[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.340]
No, I have two children.

[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.140]
I'm lucky there being a white right now.

[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.040]
You have two children?

[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:15.960]
Yes.

[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.300]
Get HRS on the phone, George, and trace this call immediately.

[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.920]
Okay, well-

[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.480]
Have a great day.

[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.020]
You too.

[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.580]
See ya.

[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:23.820]
Bye.

[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.460]
Don't ever, ever darken this phone again.

[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.360]
Hey, Billy!

[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.860]
Blow my finger!

[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:29.440]

[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.380]
Tonight on ABC, it's America's most heavily armed singing sensation, the cartridge family.

[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.380]
I'm sleeping.

[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.720]
There's a prowler in my bedroom.

[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.020]
So I'll spring up in my bed, and I'll pump him full of lead.

[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.360]
I think I'll shoot you.

[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.800]
No seven-day waiting period for this family.

[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.400]
Is surely-

[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.120]
Yes, Rubin?

[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.780]
I've decided to up my feet to 20%.

[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.160]
Come to think of it, ten will be fine.

[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.720]
Then when Danny falls for a rather macho-looking woman,

[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.040]
it's LA law Susan Day to the rescue.

[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.920]
Can't talk my brother, you ACDC Miss Fetter.

[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.060]
Oh!

[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.380]
And you like Godbrok, you'll love the cartridge family.

[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.700]
It's domestic violence and it's musical bass.

[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.080]
Travel along with our business and whistle,

[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.740]
We're here at B.

[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.140]
We're here at B.

[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.060]
The cartridge family.

[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.080]
Tonight on ABC, following the final episode of The Brady Boo.

[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.620]
1126 at Good old WIOD, where we unveil our big new sign out there, man.

[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.980]
I bet you there'd be like millions of people just flocking by crowding the cause way to see that on Friday.

[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.140]
This Sunday night, it's history's funniest home video.

[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.320]
We have a classic clip on the Lincoln family that they fall getting ready.

[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.080]
Hurry up, babe.

[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.540]
We'll be late for the theater.

[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.800]
So late.

[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.120]
What are they gonna do?

[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:56.760]
Shoot me.

[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.940]
Watch as escape artist Harry Houdini runs into a little trouble at home.

[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.300]
Harry telephone.

[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.760]
He writes down.

[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.760]
Hey, stop it, stop.

[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.400]
I'm not dead.

[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:11.340]
Woo!

[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:19.200]
And we'll go all the way back to the Revolutionary War to check out this hilarious video sent in by Mr. Patrick Henry.

[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.380]
Give me liberty.

[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.700]
Oh, give me death.

[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:26.620]
Death.

[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.120]
I meant death.

[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.500]
Give me liberty or give me death.

[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.760]
Yes, it's history's funniest home videos.

[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.040]
Sunday night at 830, catch you now before it's history.

[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:38.760]
Hello.

[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.460]
Hello, Neil.

[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:40.880]

[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.260]
Hello.

[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.860]
Yes, are we having a problem on the phone today?

[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.040]
No.

[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:46.960]
Can you hear me?

[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.120]
Just barely.

[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.640]
You can barely hear me?

[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.460]
Just barely.

[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.780]
No, you're, you're full of it.

[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.140]
Okay, look, I have a question.

[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.960]
A couple days ago, you were on the air and somebody started talking about these two books.

[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.560]
And I don't remember which one was called the plumber.

[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.980]
And the other one was called something else.

[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.760]
You're the electrician.

[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.600]
No.

[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.500]
Sins of the, you see, you don't want to listen?

[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.180]
Sorry.

[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.460]
Sins of the father.

[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.680]
Sins of the father?

[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.080]
Yeah.

[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.220]
I meant to write it down.

[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.840]
I was remembering it on the drive home and then I got home with God.

[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.700]
Sins of the father was great.

[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.160]
Which one was better?

[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:20.540]
Did you read the plumber?

[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.380]
I didn't read the plumber.

[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.120]
No.

[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.720]
I had lunch with Gordon Litty but I'd not read the plumber.

[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.200]
Are you going to waste your time and read it?

[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:26.500]
Yeah.

[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.100]
Really?

[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.640]
If I can find it.

[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:28.820]
Huh.

[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.840]
Anything with all this Peewee stuff?

[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:31.420]
Yeah.

[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.680]
The show is not that good anyway.

[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.920]
It's no great loss.

[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.420]
Really?

[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.240]
Peewee?

[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.300]
Peewees play house?

[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.700]
I'm afraid I don't catch it.

[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.840]
It's not a good, I'd be the set for my neighbor's kids.

[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.820]
It's not a good show anyway.

[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.220]
So who cares?

[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.300]
Well it's something for people to get all excited about, okay?

[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.220]
I guess so.

[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.440]
I suppose it would have been Dan Rather than we really could have gotten into it.

[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.400]
Oh, just...

[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.920]
And if it would have been Dan Rather dressed up as Peewee then we really could have been great.

[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:02.920]

[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.560]
Would that have been great?

[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:04.680]
Great.

[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.120]
All right, well that was it.

[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.920]
Well, believe me, read them both.

[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:09.840]
Read them both?

[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.360]
Kill a lot of good time for you.

[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.140]
Do you know what happened to the author, would you?

[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:13.420]
No.

[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.840]
Somebody you'll call in.

[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:15.520]
All right.

[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.680]
Some wise guy who's smarter than we are will call in.

[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.180]
Oh, boy.

[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.280]
Have a great day.

[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:19.760]
You too, boy.

[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.840]
Cool springs.

[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.500]
I know how you're doing.

[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:23.860]
Great.

[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.300]
Listen, I just got back in California.

[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.720]
I was in San Francisco.

[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:28.600]
Yeah.

[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.160]
And I had a video accident.

[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.460]
I turned on and there was Alex Benin on the...

[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.200]
On the tube?

[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.880]
What an ugly fuck.

[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.840]
Oh, what?

[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.700]
Yes, ugly that guy.

[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.720]
And he had a radio...

[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.440]
What did you say the first time in ugly one?

[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.520]
Ugly sucker.

[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.720]
Oh, sucker.

[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.180]
Okay.

[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.280]
Well, my ears are plugged up.

[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.660]
Okay.

[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.480]
Now you're trying to take advantage of me.

[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.780]
I don't know why I asked you to repeat it.

[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.460]
It would have only made it worse, but it could have been interesting.

[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.100]
He had an audience.

[00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.280]
Yeah.

[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.480]
Well, at least he's got an audience.

[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.880]
Okay, it's more than I can say.

[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.640]
Well, only a minute.

[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.080]
We got a bunch of deadheads out there.

[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.100]
Oh, boy, we love your audio.

[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.800]
Yeah, a bunch of spastic's is what we got.

[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:11.680]
Spastic's.

[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.460]
Listen, a couple things.

[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.500]
I don't want to...

[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.380]
I want a quick one, Peewee.

[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.620]
I just want to know one thing.

[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.300]
We lay off a Peewee already for crying out loud.

[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.460]
Jeez, lay off the Peewee.

[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.520]
I just want to know how many crimes were committed while there's police and we're in that theater.

[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.840]
There were probably rapes and murders and arson's and drug deals probably within a 30-foot radius

[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.300]
of where they were peaking.

[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:34.820]
Peeper.

[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.000]
I know you're being...

[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.940]
No, I'm not.

[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.660]
I'm serious.

[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.360]
No, I'm not.

[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.060]
You are too.

[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.380]
I'm dead serious, but nobody cares because in this country we have a bunch of

[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.100]
hypocrites and everybody's worried about who's touching below the waist.

[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.640]
It's all the biggest bunch of crap I've ever heard in my life.

[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.060]
It really is.

[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.440]
What if they just leave everybody alone for crying out loud?

[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.980]
And I've got to tell you, I've never seen that.

[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.700]
We've got the touch yourself police and the sidewalk police and across the street police.

[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.100]
And oh, yesterday I'm driving at the store on sunrise in plantation and there's the

[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:08.080]
most pathetic motorcycle pig sitting on a corner of Nabhil and sunrise under a palm tree

[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.140]
waiting for somebody to do something naughty and not nice.

[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.320]
I mean, just a pile of crap just sitting there with a surly red neck look on his face,

[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.640]
give me a break.

[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.400]
Well, you go do something constructive.

[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.100]
Go sit with Peeper yourself.

[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:21.980]
You know, get out of here.

[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:26.200]
We broke down some day now on the turnpike and luckily I had a mobile phone.

[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:26.580]
Yeah.

[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.300]
But I got to tell you, we were there an hour and a one police and came back.

[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.900]
I could tell you how high my blood sugar is right now, sir.

[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.780]
You would probably have a stroke right on the phone just from hearing the number.

[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.700]
My head is swimming.

[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.660]
I feel like Marlena Dietrich on a bad day.

[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.140]
Well, I got that problem.

[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.260]
I feel like Mark Spitz.

[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.440]
Yeah, give me some of that coke.

[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.040]
That'll do it.

[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.640]
Give me a little sugar.

[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.440]
That'll do it, George.

[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.940]
Well, why do they do this to me?

[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.960]
Why don't they stop?

[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.860]
I'm telling you, before 2 o'clock I will find out the name of the person responsible for bringing

[00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.540]
that slime ball back here with the food and sicking him on me with that crap that I don't want.

[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.100]
I've screamed.

[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.680]
I've yelled.

[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.380]
I've hollered.

[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.460]
I don't want it.

[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.320]
I can't eat it.

[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.800]
I've been sick, the stressed, the food, and they just keep insisting.

[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.780]
I'm going to sue this place.

[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.400]
I really am.

[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.880]
I'm getting a good crooked lawyer and I'm going to sue the pants off of them for food malpractice.

[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.200]
Listen, one other thing.

[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.460]
As soon as they pay me off, yeah.

[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.920]
How come when you go to a movie theater and you sit behind or in front of these older

[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.360]
people?

[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.540]
I don't know what it is, but it's moving.

[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.000]
Yeah.

[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.620]
It's like you would swear that you need to be in front of older people.

[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.060]
I said, be in front of young people.

[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:32.660]
Okay.

[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.320]
I'm going to be with you.

[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.220]
They're in the movie with you and they're together and I don't know what it is, but it's

[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:40.480]
moving.

[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.100]
And then of course you got to find out what it is.

[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.080]
What is it now?

[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.040]
Why is it the older people?

[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.700]
They're together, okay?

[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.540]
But they keep describing the movie to each other as if the other one's not there.

[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.540]
Because they don't care about anybody else.

[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.080]
Don't you understand that, Sonny?

[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.420]
It's their time.

[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.900]
Don't bother them that the only ones that's like on the road, the same thing.

[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.260]
Get out of their way.

[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.060]
It's their time.

[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:04.860]
Oh, look at that.

[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.740]
Look at that.

[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.840]
I'm watching MTV now so you have to excuse me.

[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.560]
I'm just being a pervert on the radio and I enjoy every second of it.

[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:12.820]
Okay.

[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.620]
And if it offends anybody up yours, okay?

[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.920]
I'm tired of all you phonies out there with your closet lives.

[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:18.840]
You make me sick.

[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.220]
Right?

[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:21.860]
Sir?

[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:23.620]
Sir?

[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.340]
Yeah, me.

[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:24.940]
Yeah.

[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.460]
You're not listening to anything I'm saying.

[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.220]
Yeah, I am.

[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320]
This isn't a conversation.

[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.240]
This is like, I don't know what it is.

[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.660]
Listen, I take luke control.

[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.440]
Do you take anything?

[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.260]
I take luke control also, sir.

[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:34.880]
Oh, okay.

[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.980]
But unfortunately, when you haven't taken any, I'm not saying I shouldn't eat before noon

[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.500]
anyhow.

[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.740]
Do you understand?

[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.100]
Yeah.

[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.340]
And I've been having a problem and it took me four days to get my sugar down to where

[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.400]
it ought to be this morning, not too bad a level.

[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.340]
And I felt great.

[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.180]
It felt sensational.

[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.400]
You know how it is when your blood sugar gets real high?

[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:51.720]
Yeah.

[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.540]
And you feel like you're dying over there.

[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.840]
And that's, and then the guy brings the food.

[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.660]
They bring it back here.

[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.440]
Oh, here's some goofball got a bunch of food.

[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.340]
This guy could be like an ax murderer.

[00:15:59.340 --> 00:15:59.860]
I know.

[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.880]
And they just wander back here.

[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.120]
I'm telling you, this place, if they'd ever get their act together and here, and stop

[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.760]
worrying about how much show the billing is, if they'd ever, you know, run a real radio

[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.500]
station, this could be a fun place to be.

[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.660]
It really could have, once upon a time it was for a couple of days, I can't remember when.

[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.860]
And it's tough because it's a matter of money.

[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.920]
What is wrong with them?

[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.860]
They got like 8,000 people here and nobody takes any responsibility.

[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.320]
It's like they're all just shuffling around in the hallway.

[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.880]
Like, where, what's going on?

[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.520]
Where are we going?

[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.400]
Let's, you know, like they're lost.

[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.580]
Like the land of the lost.

[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:34.300]
Why doesn't somebody assert himself or itself in this place and say, no, we don't just

[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.620]
open up those adraps by the way, George, there's a lot of commotion out there in the hallway.

[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.000]
I think we're going to find out who brought that asshole back here.

[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.460]
Well you have a great day, sir, and keep, uh, what?

[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.020]
Did you bring that person back here?

[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.000]
Stephanie and Gwen?

[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.960]
No, they did not do it, but they did eat some of the food.

[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.280]
Well, I'm not blaming them for that.

[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.800]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.420]
An open line in Broward.

[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.960]
524 pissed.

[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.080]
I am.

[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.460]
I'm just, I'm smoking.

[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.660]
Smoke is coming out of my ears.

[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.040]
This is Tom Brooks, John New York, President Bush House, Paul, a surprise news conference.

[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.660]
We suspect that he may have changed his mind on the Supreme Court nominee.

[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.800]
We now join that news conference, O'Reary and Poverty.

[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.640]
So, in my mind about the previous nominee.

[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:28.560]
So, instead, I've decided to nominate three women to the Supreme Court.

[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.820]
Right, girls?

[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.660]
You mean it's the three's court?

[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.460]
Hey, this court's a white enough.

[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.580]
It's like this to the white enough.

[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.380]
Everybody's having a listening to you.

[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.660]
Now we're getting down.

[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.960]
You can't turn it off.

[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.280]
No, you just have to wait.

[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.080]
We're too busy singing.

[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.860]
There's no time to measure sleep.

[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.340]
We rock that in the Senate.

[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:53.820]

[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.180]
Now the wind will black steps in the face.

[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:58.960]
Probably not.

[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.800]
Let it make me look real good.

[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.360]
No, no, we make fun of.

[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.180]
That should fit.

[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.060]
You have flat.

[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.280]
Yeah, well, Diana, I've got the same flat than B flat.

[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.100]
Don't you get me.

[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:10.840]
I just need some way.

[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.600]
Yeah, well, Diana, you out of the band.

[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.260]
No, you wait on right now.

[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.240]
This is your own bull job.

[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.940]
I'll soon meet.

[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:19.680]
Hey.

[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:21.020]

[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:23.900]
Hey.

[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:24.880]
Hey.

[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:25.400]
Hey.

[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:26.660]
Hey.

[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:26.660]

[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.020]
Hey.

[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:28.800]
Hey.

[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:29.420]
Hey.

[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:29.960]
Hey.

[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:32.780]

[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:32.780]

[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:32.780]

[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.660]
Another IOD emergency staff meeting ladies and gentlemen

[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.820]
to address the serious problem of these male contents,

[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.240]
these miscreants, these slime balls that muscle their way

[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.400]
into the building mysteriously with arm loads,

[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.280]
butt loads and truck loads of food,

[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.640]
WIOD deer field.

[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.180]
It's the wonderful day in the neighborhood.

[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.460]
Can you say master bait?

[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.320]
Sure you can.

[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.780]
How's it going Neil?

[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.540]
I am telling you, man, the whole world is so riled up by this.

[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.700]
It's just incredible.

[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.740]
Isn't it wild?

[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.640]
I think it's about time for somebody to take this into hand

[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.500]
and get a hold of it.

[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.680]
That's right.

[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.220]
Before it gets out of control.

[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.080]
You know, thanks for your show today.

[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.980]
It's a relief, a lot of stress for me.

[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:17.400]
I know you.

[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.980]
Yeah, I'm sure that that's great.

[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.140]
The meantime, I'm going to have another stroke here on the air.

[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.860]
People are taking up office pools right now all over town to see what time it happens.

[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:25.380]
Yeah.

[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.100]
Well anyway, Neil, you're the greatest.

[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.360]
That's a good one.

[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.320]
See ya.

[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.400]
And I'll put it in the corner.

[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.340]
Open line and Broward, 524 WIOD.

[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.200]
My head is swimming.

[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.980]
I feel like Gertrude Italy.

[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.740]
On our way across the English Channel, as in what channel are you on?

[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.640]
Hey, A.

[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.980]
Open line and Broward, 524 WIOD.

[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.200]
Let's get some women on this phone.

[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.860]
Let's get some living and breathing people WIOD.

[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:57.940]
Hi.

[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.700]
You don't sound like a woman.

[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.460]
I'm the most good thing.

[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.300]
Would you like to dress up like one?

[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.160]
I do, at least.

[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:04.780]
Okay.

[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.980]
Listen, I wanted to say,

[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.740]
and bear with me a P.

[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.380]
We would say.

[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.780]
Uh, even more P.

[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.020]
We material, more P.

[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.540]
We material.

[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.100]
Look guys in there, wankin' it.

[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.280]
What do you leave them alone, will ya?

[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.240]
This isn't about P.

[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:17.500]
We are.

[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.480]
This isn't about one of those.

[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.700]
No, but I mean, what is everybody?

[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.420]
You know what it reminds me of?

[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.340]
It's like, uh, it's like the thing I touched myself.

[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.200]
It's like this song, like these little punky kids that are listening to Power Night.

[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.460]
They just invented that.

[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.440]
You know, they just discovered it.

[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.480]
We discovered it a long time ago, kids, okay?

[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.660]
I didn't have to sing a song about it.

[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:40.580]
I think even though the crack addicts are running rampant and throwing elephant turns through the windows in a water deal.

[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.040]
Yes?

[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.780]
Yanking people's arteries and chains from their necks.

[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.320]
Yes?

[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.220]
I think it's just great that Nick Novorow took the time to go in and brush that lady for having sex in her own bedroom.

[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.640]
I want you to find me.

[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:59.340]
And I think if he gets Rick Sandchest for his press agent, he could probably make the next Supreme Court nomination.

[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.620]
Good stop, oh pig.

[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.000]
Right, you got it, pal.

[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.520]
Heinrich Himmler lives.

[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:10.160]
I hope these people wake up before they wake up one morning and realize that they're not going to be here.

[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.340]
When they get that new Supreme Court justice confirmed, I be right wing.

[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.960]
That'll really a cap it all off.

[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.360]
I don't think they can get any further than a right.

[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.460]
They're going to make a round circuit.

[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:19.900]
Right.

[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.740]
Look, those around comes around.

[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.940]
You got it.

[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.340]
Listen, keep up the good work.

[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.540]
Keep your passport handed.

[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.880]
I'm going to try.

[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.560]
See you.

[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.580]
And your trench coat.

[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.960]
1242 at WIOD.

[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.780]
See, that's our motto for this week.

[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.040]
Keep your passport in one hand and your trench coat in the other.

[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.520]
Can't get in too much trouble that way.

[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.020]
It's the Pillsbury Du Bois.

[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.460]
He looks more like the Pillsbury Du Bois if you do.

[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.040]
I'll say that.

[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.560]
Poppin' still.

[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.540]
What a day.

[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.520]
Do you want to start at one?

[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.300]
Oh, man.

[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:52.840]
You got a lot of cars.

[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.660]
Yeah, 1 a.m.

[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.080]
How come they're giving it a nice and quiet?

[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.940]
How come they're giving the time on the Channel 4 news now at 5 o'clock?

[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:00.840]
And it odoses.

[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.880]
It's 5 minutes after 8.

[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.680]
It was actually 508, but he can't read the clock too well.

[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.020]
Really?

[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.060]
Why are they giving the time?

[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.280]
I can't see that.

[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.940]
There's another chance to screw up.

[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.060]
Well, that's not a clue.

[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.500]
People call it and rip you to your face.

[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.160]
Oh, right.

[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.460]
I don't like that.

[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.320]
I'm ripping behind the back.

[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:17.640]
Really?

[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.280]
And so what if you are divorced?

[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.600]
I mean, I exactly.

[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.460]
I don't understand what the first of all is.

[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.180]
It's nice they send their condolences.

[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.160]
It's nobody's damn business number one.

[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.260]
Secondly, most of you idiots, if you're not divorced,

[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.840]
now you will be by the end of the week.

[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.580]
And what's the big deal about it?

[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.500]
Like it's somebody's business out there, and all of a sudden

[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.540]
you used to be an ice guy.

[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:34.920]
Right.

[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.060]
You know I got a divorce.

[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:36.620]
Yeah.

[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.480]
15 years.

[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:37.960]
Oh, man.

[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.220]
Next thing you'll be walking around with a trench coat.

[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:42.660]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:43.460]
Neil.

[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:43.980]
Yeah.

[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:44.680]
How you doing, buddy?

[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.480]
I'll go into it.

[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:46.320]
Good.

[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.540]
I want to say something about the big property.

[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.700]
Or we turned to the blue lagoon as coming any day in a theater near you.

[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:54.640]
Boy.

[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:56.680]
Neil.

[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.100]
Oh, some hats.

[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.880]
Thank you so much.

[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.640]
I thought that was food for just a second.

[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:08.040]
Oh, sir, I want to tell you you almost just were a part of a radio accident.

[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:08.380]
Wow.

[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.520]
The young lady from Florida just came by and she had a bag.

[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.300]
Yeah.

[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.260]
And I thought there was more food in it.

[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.000]
And I was just about ready to have a cardiac arrest.

[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.920]
We were going to make a cardiac arrest.

[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.420]
I want to get off the P. We hermit, sir.

[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.500]
I want to get off the P. We hermit for a minute.

[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:27.920]
Who was on them?

[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.680]
Oh, these are florist pizza hats.

[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.960]
What does that mean?

[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.120]
Okay, go ahead, sir.

[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:33.540]
I'm sorry.

[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.080]
We're very confused over here.

[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.440]
People on South Florida stock.

[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.660]
Yes, we know that.

[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.440]
Last week, this is my first time to be able to call since last week.

[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.440]
Some guys called up.

[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:43.420]
Yeah.

[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.540]
Some guy called up and he was a bitch and already about the hats for the Miami Marlin.

[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.620]
And they weren't even out yet.

[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.160]
I know.

[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.720]
He just was looking for something to bitch about.

[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.300]
I know it.

[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.120]
And the amazing thing to me, the one legitimate gripe they've got all through the years,

[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.620]
I hear all these belliacs about the stadium in the parking.

[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.280]
The one legitimate gripe that they have, which we talked about the other day,

[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.640]
about the price for the exhibition games being ridiculous.

[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.060]
And you would think that we were commonistas now because we said that.

[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.300]
I mean, that's a legitimate, right?

[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.020]
I know.

[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.160]
It's a beautiful stadium.

[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.080]
We got a great team and the support all of this.

[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.360]
But for a crappy exhibition game, those prices are ridiculous.

[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.940]
And we have the audacity to say that.

[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:17.720]
Now we're bad guys.

[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.060]
Okay.

[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.100]
I don't understand this type of guys.

[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:20.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.240]
Are you serious?

[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.420]
Do boy?

[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.480]
I went on and on.

[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.280]
I'm a dump boy.

[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:26.660]
I know.

[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.240]
I did too.

[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.160]
It's ridiculous.

[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:28.980]
What is?

[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.680]
Any people are just looking for something?

[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.340]
I'm behind the dolphins as much as anybody.

[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.400]
You've got to cry it out loud.

[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.820]
You got to, you know, call it as it is.

[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.060]
You don't care about the dolphins, sir.

[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:38.420]
Who?

[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:38.800]
You.

[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.360]
I love my dolphins.

[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.520]
I love my dolphins.

[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.840]
Cheerleaders.

[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.080]
Well, that's part of the packet.

[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.400]
Yeah.

[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.780]
Let's get to the meat of the man who got the crap.

[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:51.500]
All right, Ross.

[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.460]
I am divorced, you know.

[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.860]
Relatively speaking, how?

[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.040]
He wouldn't know Dan Moreno from Marinara Sauce.

[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.120]
Go ahead.

[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.200]
How?

[00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.460]
He does make a good Marinara Sauce.

[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.840]
Yeah, he does in that restaurant.

[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.140]
Yeah.

[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.300]
I wish he'd change his lips, though.

[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:03.580]
Sure.

[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.240]
Call her otherwise.

[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:04.640]
Yeah.

[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.000]
That Joker look with those lips has got to go, Danny.

[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.740]
What is it, sir?

[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.880]
Relatively speaking, how quick will the Marlins be?

[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.740]
Will they improve faster than heatwell, being a new franchise?

[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.220]
He probably, yes.

[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:17.520]
Yeah.

[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.160]
Oh, definitely.

[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.380]
Good, definitely.

[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.000]
Because it's a whole different ball game.

[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.860]
I mean, you know, baseball is different than basketball.

[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.480]
They'll be competitive within your lifetime, not mine.

[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:25.940]
Yeah.

[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:27.180]
Good.

[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.060]
Thanks for the call, Neil.

[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.440]
Okay, we'll call you again.

[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.540]
Neil, you're a great American.

[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:30.960]
I know.

[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.380]
See you.

[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:31.640]
Okay.

[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.940]
He's doing all of my lines.

[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.740]
Boy, oh boy.

[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:41.600]
I see I got all screwed up right off the bat this morning because it's Tuesday and Grave Line was over at the mailbox, pilfering stuff.

[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.100]
And I thought it was Wednesday.

[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.040]
And now I don't know what the hell's going on.

[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.000]
But you got nice hands.

[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.780]
And then I ate that.

[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.620]
We got, thank you, Flores, for the nice hats.

[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.360]
They're nice people over there.

[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:52.860]
They're great.

[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.860]
They're wonderful people.

[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.640]
And they're not a pain in the ass and they don't bug us and they don't send food.

[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.400]
Well, we don't want it when we do want it.

[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.260]
They do, boy.

[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.960]
Holy cow.

[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.200]
It might be.

[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.300]
It could be.

[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.500]
It's the one to two hour with Neil Roberts.

[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:12.820]
And now back to chicken's deputy and your host, Alex Fabiz.

[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.520]
We move on now to double jeopardy.

[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.660]
Penny, you had the low score at the end of the last round.

[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.200]
Choose a category please.

[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.600]
Extra terrestrials for 200.

[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.340]
It makes strange noises in the chicken coop late at night.

[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.520]
Yes, bonus.

[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.500]
Frank Perdue, no.

[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.800]
Cajun.

[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.600]
No, what is a poultry guy?

[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.360]
A poultry guy.

[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.880]
Penny, you still have control of the board.

[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.960]
To beak or not to beak for 600.

[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.600]
He was the star of the Omen.

[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:42.440]
Bonus.

[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:43.700]
Correct.

[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.300]
We'll return with my own chicken, jeopardy.

[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.040]
Where a category will be choking the pecker.

[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.040]
Right at this.

[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.580]
106 at WIOD, the Marlon caps, understand her in the building.

[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.400]
Incredible.

[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.620]
We have an open line at Broward, 524 WIOD and one on the star line at star IOD.

[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:03.460]
The

[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.920]
All the way from Deerfield Beach.

[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.700]
Here's a gentleman with a Marlon cap.

[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.560]
What is that thing that he's got on the trailer?

[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.840]
I don't know what it is.

[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:12.260]
Boy.

[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.120]
Yeah.

[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.040]
But it's moving.

[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.080]
I can't believe it.

[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.960]
What is that candle?

[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.640]
As soon as I got off the phone with you, Veggie called me.

[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.440]
Oh, Veggie from Bocca sent us over a candle.

[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.060]
Look at that.

[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.680]
I hope that Lord doesn't see that.

[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.860]
And some great caps here.

[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.760]
Some Marlon caps.

[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.360]
Let me be the first one to grab it.

[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.240]
Look at that.

[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.160]
Not bad.

[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.460]
Commemorative July of something your other 1991-19th Florida Marlins.

[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.100]
Thank you, sir.

[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.280]
A gentleman in the scholar.

[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.760]
I'll leave these to your discreet.

[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.200]
Thank you.

[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:42.660]
Great.

[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.600]
Thanks a lot.

[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.260]
Appreciate it.

[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.880]
You almost got one over by Rick Sanchez.

[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.820]
Well, it would have been worth it.

[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.080]
You made the five o'clock anyway.

[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:50.640]
Thanks a lot.

[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.700]
And thanks to Veggie from Bocca.

[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.520]
Look at these beautiful flowers with a nice little note.

[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.980]
Some nice boogan velias or whatever.

[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.080]
I know nothing about flying.

[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.380]
And a couple of pansies over there.

[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.140]
Some flowers, too.

[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.840]
Open line on the star line at star IOD.

[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.500]
It's as hope things get better in this God for second town.

[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.460]
You light up our lives.

[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.800]
Veggie from Bocca from Strictly Roses, Flourist and Flowers.

[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.860]
1335 South Federal Highway in Deerfield, Sweet One.

[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.640]
And I noticed that Alex just came in here and appropriated for himself

[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.640]
a whole bunch of Marlon caps.

[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.120]
What is it?

[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.500]
One's for me and one's for Mitch.

[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.620]
It's just a joke.

[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.480]
When you relax, man, these people are so uptight.

[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.560]
See, the audience thinks it's me.

[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.460]
This is just a radio show all the way and pissed about the food thing.

[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.100]
But God, you people are so sensitive.

[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.620]
I wish you ought to come in here and do the show just one day.

[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.920]
Like Rick Raleigh comes in.

[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.440]
Oh, he called me Don't Boy.

[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.700]
Don't Boy because he's upset about the, you wanted to guys in the bikinis.

[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.540]
I don't care what you got in bikinis.

[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.000]
Okay.

[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.500]
Ring dogs in bikinis.

[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.400]
I could give a crap.

[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:51.820]
All right.

[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.880]
Everybody is so damn uptight and so full of crap in this town.

[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.720]
Why don't you lighten up and have a good time?

[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.260]
Stop being so concerned about your masculinity and you women too.

[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.660]
Let's go to Kendall.

[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.000]
Hello.

[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.000]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:05.760]
Just great.

[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.320]
Neil, why in the world do Channel 7 have Sally Fitz do a bit on Pee Wee?

[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.220]
Well, maybe the story fits.

[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.620]
Maybe the story fits.

[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.080]
She was shaking in her seat.

[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:16.800]
I'll bet.

[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.120]
Did you see it?

[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:18.480]
No.

[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.860]
Well, I just wanted to.

[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.060]
Was she carrying a trench coat?

[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.120]
Maybe there's a little more there than meets the eyes, sir.

[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.000]
She might have had it under the counter, I don't know.

[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:28.600]
You never know.

[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.040]
Well, I just wanted to see if anybody knew what was going on with that.

[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.380]
I'm closing a light to call somebody douchebag.

[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.120]
Yeah.

[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:36.580]
May I?

[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.140]
Yes.

[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.380]
You don't have to ask me.

[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:39.040]
Okay.

[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:39.520]
Miami.

[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.260]
Hey, Don't Boy.

[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:41.920]
Do Boy.

[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.780]
He's not in here.

[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.840]
He's out in the hall.

[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.680]
How are you today?

[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.720]
He's taking orders.

[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.880]
Neil, you have a major sugar problem.

[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.560]
And I have the cure.

[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.000]
Yeah.

[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.120]
Get the salt shaker, unscrew the top, and pour it down your throat.

[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.260]
Five minutes, your pH balance will be normal.

[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:00.580]
Okay.

[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.900]
And as far as Peewee, I think we need to start a defense fund.

[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:05.400]
Yeah.

[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.180]
Lend Peewee a hand.

[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:07.740]
Right.

[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.360]
Lend Peewee a hand.

[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.200]
Outstanding.

[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.040]
See you later.

[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:11.520]
Okay.

[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.140]
Good job.

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.680]
That's what Peewee said.

[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:14.600]
Wellington.

[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.040]
Hello, Doctor.

[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.240]
I'm dying over here.

[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.480]
Okay, hurry up.

[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.880]
Open line on our Florida line, 1-800-944-WIO-D.

[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.220]
Here's the lady in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:25.880]
Hi.

[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:26.480]
Hi.

[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.120]
Hi, Neil.

[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:27.940]
How's by you?

[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:28.880]
Fine, how are you?

[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.880]
I'm a little better.

[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:30.420]
Good.

[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.400]
I'm recuperating from whatever happened today.

[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.140]
Good.

[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.060]
I'm working today, but I'm not that calm to see how you're doing.

[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:37.840]
Yeah.

[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:38.800]
Doing good?

[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:39.360]
No.

[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:40.220]
No, why?

[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.480]
Well, you haven't been listening to the show.

[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.720]
I haven't listened to the show about Peewee harm, I think it's good.

[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.460]
And if I forget about Peewee harm, and forget about Peewee, I'm talking about that food that they keep saying.

[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.240]
They're sending in here, they're keeping making me sick.

[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:51.840]
Get new food.

[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:52.620]
What?

[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:53.780]
Get some more food.

[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.020]
Get more food, new food, different food.

[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.160]
Okay, let me try to, before I get, have a stroke on here.

[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.600]
Let me try to explain it to you, okay?

[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.120]
I know.

[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:05.940]
I have diabetes.

[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:06.920]
I understand.

[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:07.320]
Okay.

[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.520]
I can't eat all this food.

[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.120]
Do you understand?

[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.440]
I'm over, I had a stroke a year ago April.

[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.720]
Okay, which everybody finds very amusing, all right?

[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.060]
I can't eat.

[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:16.540]
Right.

[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.440]
Okay, I have a little salad that the people across in sunny days

[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.840]
are nice enough to bring every day.

[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.520]
That's all I want for lunch, okay?

[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.400]
Just a little salad.

[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.540]
Healthy, nice little crap, okay?

[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.140]
Okay.

[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.340]
I don't want food.

[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.800]
I've been screaming and yelling and puking on here, no more food.

[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.100]
What are you going to do, just drink fluid.

[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.860]
You do that?

[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:44.800]
Neil.

[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.080]
So.

[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.500]
Dumb bitch.

[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.360]
127 at WIOD.

[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.100]
I mean, how is it possible to be so stupid?

[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.900]
How is it possible you, you like practice?

[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.580]
I've heard of practice makes perfect, that's the motto in serosota.

[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:13.980]
But you're like a new dimension of stupidity.

[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.200]
New food.

[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.740]
How about some old food, honey?

[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.500]
Miami.

[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.780]
Here's the head of young man.

[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.660]
Okay, Harry.

[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:25.380]
Miami.

[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:26.900]
Neil.

[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:27.280]
Yeah.

[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.800]
How you seeing Gilbert and David together?

[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.100]
I was thinking about that.

[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.520]
The life is very close.

[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.360]
All right.

[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.160]
Yeah.

[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.220]
Well, I don't have any more material.

[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:37.740]
Okay.

[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.800]
There is Martinez guys.

[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.300]
Later.

[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.380]
Two open lines, both in Dade County.

[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.300]
751-9463-751.

[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.880]
Here's a mobile in Port St. Lucie.

[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.720]
Driving home.

[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.120]
Let's go to where's George?

[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.100]
Oh, there he is.

[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.760]
You kind of get lost in the mail stream in there.

[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.180]
Man, it's like a circus in there today.

[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:56.640]
God.

[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.740]
It's like Barterman Bailey, aren't they in serosota?

[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.380]
Yeah.

[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.780]
Let's do a remote.

[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.840]
That's what I say.

[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.380]
Rick and Sets can do two to six from the donut shop.

[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.220]
And I'll do a 10 to 2 from up the road a piece, okay?

[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:13.920]
Bring your trench coats.

[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.460]
Four lotter down.

[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:16.480]
Neil.

[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:17.040]
Yeah.

[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:17.740]
Hey, man.

[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:18.840]
Just calm down.

[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:19.320]
Will you, sir?

[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.100]
Don't be a parrot.

[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.420]
No, sir.

[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.540]
My friend here is exposing himself to me.

[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.220]
I wonder if I can make an assistance arrest on him.

[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.280]
Yes, sir, right now.

[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.520]
Brad's the high.

[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.060]
Hey.

[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.220]
No, I'm sitting here.

[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.460]
I've got lots of things to talk about.

[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.520]
Let me just say this, too, sir.

[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.860]
Nothing that small could ever be admitted into evidence.

[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.300]
I hear that, man.

[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.200]
That's a problem I've been having.

[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.680]
I don't want to break up on their minds.

[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:39.620]
It's a story.

[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.620]
Hey, but you're going to hear that.

[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:41.980]
Oh.

[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.700]
Make sure the radio's down.

[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.120]
Yeah, crank that baby down.

[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:45.480]
Hey, crank.

[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.920]
Turn that, get that thing down.

[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.740]
And the radio, too.

[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.720]
And, uh, hey, I'm going to medical school in a couple of weeks.

[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.140]
Great.

[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.500]
You got any advice for me?

[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:53.500]
Yeah.

[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.260]
Like, don't go.

[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.020]
Be as dishonest as possible.

[00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:01.220]
If you have no scruples, no ethics, if you're nothing but a blood-sucking money-hungry douchebag, go right ahead.

[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:01.920]
And good luck to you.

[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.800]
I got dollars, sir.

[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.720]
Doctors are douchebags, sir.

[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.540]
They're full of crap.

[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.100]
They don't know what they're talking about.

[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.560]
Does that make me a pre-duche bag?

[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.120]
Yeah.

[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.440]
You're going into pre-duche.

[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.760]
Hey, if I told you I spoke to a dead person last night, what would you say?

[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.940]
I talk to him every day.

[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:17.540]
No big deal.

[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.400]
I mean, for real.

[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.100]
I spoke to him for two and a half hours on the old Weegee board.

[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:21.560]
Yeah?

[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.060]
On the Weeney board?

[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.340]
It was a guy who died as tutors in a parachute accident.

[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.000]
I knew him.

[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:26.920]
I got a friend of him.

[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.080]
I swear to God.

[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.260]
I swear to God.

[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.060]
It was so incredible.

[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.420]
I could tell you the whole.

[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.200]
I don't know what it is, but it's moving.

[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:33.700]
Yeah.

[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.380]
Oh, and Brad, he wants to know something.

[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.780]
I mean, he's a little upset about this whole Pee Wee thing.

[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:40.200]
Yeah.

[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.000]
And you know, I mean, he wants to know.

[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.840]
It doesn't cap the kangaroo and give a truck ever to rank off, you know.

[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.080]
They never got half before it.

[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.980]
I'm sure the Pee nut gallery.

[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.140]
Why do you think they call them Captain Kangaroo, sir?

[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:51.460]
Right.

[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.940]
Have a great day.

[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.700]
130 at WIOD.

[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.900]
This whole thing with Pee Wee's getting a little bit out of hand.

[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.980]
We have an open-line at Broward, 5249463.

[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:04.980]
5249464.

[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:08.460]
I never even knew they had such a horrendous place of ill repute in Sarasota.

[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.620]
I would think that a bunch of upstanding old farts over there wouldn't even permit such a disgusting, degrading place.

[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.560]
I'm going to go out and check it out this afternoon.

[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.020]
Homestead.

[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.340]
Homestead's gone?

[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.200]
Yep.

[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.140]
Oh, there you are.

[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.180]
Are you at Homestead?

[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:23.700]
Yep.

[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:25.040]
Well, I'll be dang.

[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.240]
Yeah, I'm at first time, caller.

[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:26.800]
Great.

[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:27.780]
How is it so far?

[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.280]
I don't know.

[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.120]
You're pretty ridiculous.

[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:30.740]
I tell you.

[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:31.240]
Yeah.

[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.160]
That's your idea.

[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:32.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.360]
You did pretty much to these people, huh?

[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:34.840]
Yeah.

[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.560]
Yeah, I was born down here.

[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:37.500]
And?

[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.200]
And I'm telling you.

[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:42.600]
And you're pretty bitter about it too, about all these slime balls that have come in and destroying it for you, aren't you?

[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.980]
I'm very extremely bitter.

[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:44.960]
I don't blame you, sir.

[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.120]
Stand up and be counted.

[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.080]
Don't be another do-boy.

[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:48.840]
Do-boy.

[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.320]
Who's the do-boy, Rick?

[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.120]
Rick Raleigh.

[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:52.460]
Yeah.

[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.480]
He's the 1991 do-boy poster child.

[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.000]
Do-boy.

[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.160]
Yeah, well, I just like to tell everybody that.

[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:05.460]
In fact, he's going to be on, if CBS makes a hit with bringing back the, what you call it?

[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.580]
What's the show they're bringing back?

[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.680]
The Car-Bullwinkle and Rocky.

[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.520]
He's going to be a Dudley do-right do-boy.

[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.180]
Yeah.

[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.620]
Well, I'll just tell everybody that's not from Florida and Rags on those Floridians.

[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.160]
You all are do-spatts.

[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:17.480]
Okay.

[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.320]
Thank you.

[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:18.580]
Amen.

[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.660]
131 now, W-I-O-D.

[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.200]
I just stay.

[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.920]
I don't understand it at all Tuesday.

[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:24.780]
I really don't.

[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.980]
I somewhere along the line, we just kind of lost control.

[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.020]
It slipped away from us.

[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.220]
And we can't get a hold of it again.

[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.040]
Let's try Lake Worth on the Starline.

[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.100]
No, not going to talk about P.W.

[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:35.580]
Good.

[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.340]
I'm just going to ask a question.

[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:37.640]
Yeah.

[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.480]
If the Marlins and the Dauphin's play at J.R.S.

[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.660]
Does that make it the fish bowl?

[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:43.360]
Yeah.

[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:44.760]
Not bad.

[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.160]
I give it about a two.

[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.000]
Thank you.

[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:47.460]
See you.

[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.960]
132 at W-I-O-D.

[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.460]
We have an open line on the Starline.

[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.580]
It's Star-I-O-D.

[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.540]
Games in Tokyo this weekend.

[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.380]
But we'll have it.

[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.420]
Mr. Weaver and Mr. Goldberg.

[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.000]
Now, I question, of course, is, aren't they leaving today, I think?

[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.660]
Who's going to be doing Hank Show Wednesday Thursday and Friday?

[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.900]
While he's in Tokyo, y'all get it up with Mr. Weaver and all the boys.

[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:10.840]
Who's going to be doing the show?

[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:11.200]
Do we know?

[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.280]
Who?

[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:14.840]
Miami Zone.

[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.340]
Oh, Miami Zone.

[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.220]
Well, better than Graveline.

[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:19.840]
Tamarack.

[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:22.780]
Tamarack?

[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:24.940]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.160]
I just want to tell you something.

[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.900]
Wait a minute.

[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.320]
Wait a minute.

[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.180]
Are you in Tamarack?

[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:28.620]
Yeah.

[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.180]
And I had to say it three times so you could say the Cubs suck.

[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.560]
Oh, and I wanted you to talk a little bit about the Reds.

[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:36.560]
Get it like the Reds.

[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.000]
They're really hot.

[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.700]
They're going to beat your butt this week.

[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.160]
Yeah, like they did last week.

[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:41.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.160]
Yeah.

[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:42.680]
We'll see.

[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.620]
I'll call you back after the game.

[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.220]
Good luck.

[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.140]
You'll need it.

[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:46.800]
What are they like?

[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.300]
45 behind other Reds.

[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.260]
Man, you noticed that nervous twang in his voice?

[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.320]
I'd be nervous too, spewing crap like that.

[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.040]
You can get arrested in this town for spewing propaganda like that, sir.

[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.320]
Miami.

[00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.700]
Hey, Neil, how's it going?

[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.680]
OK, it's almost over, sir.

[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.580]
Thank God.

[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.040]
Can you do me a favor and pass a message to Rick?

[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.100]
Rick who?

[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.100]
Rick Riley.

[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:07.740]
Do boy.

[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.200]
Yeah, tell him that Peewee is more of a man than he is for Christ's sake.

[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.980]
All he's doing is whining, whining.

[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.480]
Such got more repulsed.

[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:17.960]
Call him up and tell him that.

[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.880]
OK, you'll be, you know, all these macho guys that call me and rag on somebody else.

[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.220]
Call him up and tell him to his own ear, OK?

[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.440]
You spineless jellyfish.

[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.820]
But he does have a point.

[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:30.540]
Miramar.

[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:31.940]
Hey, welcome, Neil.

[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:32.600]
How you doing?

[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.820]
Hey, let me ask you something.

[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.340]
What the heck is a finger popping crazy?

[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:38.920]
You know something?

[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.880]
It's amazing that you asked that question.

[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:41.360]
Wait a minute.

[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.920]
OK, do you want to hear one?

[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:45.380]
Go ahead.

[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.260]
All right, here you go.

[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.980]
Hey, Peewee, blow my finger.

[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:50.920]
There it was.

[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.700]
Now I'm talking about the traffic promo.

[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.260]
OK.

[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.700]
Yeah, I know what you say.

[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.660]
Hey, listen, don't play.

[00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:01.360]
Don't get me involved with those disgusting grotesque promos that the audience are puking from from coast to coast.

[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:01.940]
Oh, man.

[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.840]
I have no idea.

[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.800]
We just, they just will not get the clue here.

[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.260]
The more you scream about it, the more when they put on the ear.

[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:13.220]
And Larry Bessler keeps screaming louder and louder about the weather geeks and the finger popping crazies.

[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.560]
And I don't know.

[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.640]
Who knows what they're talking about.

[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.060]
Stupid.

[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:16.820]
I know it.

[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.780]
It's like an insult to all of our intelligence.

[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.480]
No way.

[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.700]
Anyways, Peewee Herman is OK in my book.

[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:22.460]
OK.

[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.080]
Bye.

[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:23.540]
See you.

[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:24.880]
Pervert.

[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.460]
142 at WIOD.

[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.120]
What does it say?

[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.580]
Oh, we have a new promo minute and 22 seconds long for what?

[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:34.260]
What is it for?

[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.180]
Music, yes.

[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.120]
For the news, let's go to Miami on a Broward line.

[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:40.960]
You know, two things.

[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.500]
Did you hear the Peewee Herman's going to start writing Jackie wacky?

[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.700]
Next thing.

[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.280]
And what do you think about the Mike Tyson of Andrew Hosefield?

[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:49.760]
OK.

[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.420]
Let's go to Miami on the star line.

[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.160]
How are you doing, Neil?

[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.580]
OK.

[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.840]
Who do you think was right?

[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.280]
The Empire or Dawson?

[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.860]
Joe West is a pig.

[00:39:59.040 --> 00:39:59.940]
How do you like that, sir?

[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.060]
Well, he is a pig.

[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.840]
I just think that I need a pig.

[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.560]
With a crappy smirk on his face.

[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.080]
Somebody needs to wipe that smirk right off his fat, stupid face.

[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.700]
I'll bet you Peewee Herman will do it.

[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.340]
There you go.

[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.920]
Listen, now I just wanted to change the subject a little because I'm sick of hearing about this jerk.

[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.200]
Oh, that's all we're hearing all day long.

[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:17.480]
I know.

[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.080]
These people are like one note charles.

[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:19.660]
I know.

[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.680]
I mean, once they get a hold of it, they just can't let it go.

[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:22.540]
I hear him.

[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.760]
I hear him.

[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.160]
See you.

[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:28.560]
Well, 145 at WIOD, we have an open line in Broward 524.

[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.860]
And one on that world famous star line.

[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.980]
If you have Bell South mobility, pick it up and give it a little tickle.

[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.100]
Star IOD.

[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.480]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.280]
Well, George paid me to say this.

[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.060]
He has got.

[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.120]
Oh, come on.

[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.840]
George is out of control.

[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.200]
Well, always.

[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.340]
George's vacation start tomorrow or there's, oh, tomorrow.

[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.240]
So this is his last day before vacation.

[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:48.800]
Oh, George.

[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.060]
Yeah, he goes on vacation for a week to.

[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:51.700]
What is it?

[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.000]
We're told he could go on vacation.

[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:57.820]
Are you there?

[00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:58.340]
Yeah.

[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.660]
I just wanted to be betchy today.

[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.420]
Oh, well, why should you be any different from anybody else?

[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.600]
Exactly, exactly.

[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.740]
These people are around.

[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.160]
They're like on a suit-a-fit.

[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.640]
They're like, man, they're nuts.

[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.740]
Did you see the new people magazine?

[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.180]
It's in the waste basket.

[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.560]
Those pictures inside are the...

[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.580]
Well, save your money.

[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:17.040]
Really?

[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.920]
The pictures inside are the grubby-ist.

[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.640]
It looks like they took the Nelson's heads off and put them on Evander Holyfield's body

[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.020]
or something.

[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.020]
Just disgusting.

[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:25.620]
Oh, really?

[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.440]
Forget it.

[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.300]
Save your money, honey.

[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.360]
Oh, man.

[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.420]
What a letdown.

[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:29.820]
Yeah.

[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.740]
I mean, I thought I was so excited when I saw it the other day.

[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.020]
And I was like, oh, I got to go get one.

[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:36.660]
Don't do it.

[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.640]
Forget it.

[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.460]
Been for a small disappointment.

[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.640]
Oh, well, I'll save my money to eat them.

[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.100]
Okay.

[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.100]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:43.980]
Have a good day.

[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:44.360]
Bye.

[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:46.380]
146.

[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.260]
At WIOD, the end is in sight.

[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.180]
We can see blight at the end of the tunnel.

[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.680]
751 WIOD at Open Line and Dade.

[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.000]
And one in Broward rhymes with coward.

[00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.480]
5249463.

[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:00.360]
West Palm Beach.

[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:00.820]
I know.

[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:01.480]
How you doing?

[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.480]
It's got a good story for you.

[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:02.920]
I'm...

[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.300]
What is it?

[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.400]
My mother told me this story.

[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:05.620]
You ready?

[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.080]
Yeah.

[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.340]
You know, it's about the folks at a cemetery village.

[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:11.720]
Hello?

[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.260]
I'm here.

[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.420]
I'm listening, sir.

[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.500]
I'm listening.

[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:14.900]
Okay.

[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.420]
You know, once a week, they all get on the bus and they go do their shopping.

[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.160]
Uh-huh.

[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.440]
The public's a wind mixer where it is.

[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:20.900]
Yeah.

[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.040]
On a recent trip.

[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.560]
They all have gone in and done their shopping.

[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.120]
They're about...

[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:25.840]
They all got on the bus.

[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.400]
They're ready to go.

[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:26.940]
Yeah.

[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.220]
And the manager steps aboard the bus and says, okay.

[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.620]
One of our employees, somebody in the bus, deals some food.

[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.320]
No, I'm not going to embarrass everyone.

[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.460]
And I want that person when you get back to just leave it on the seat.

[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.900]
We're not going to call the police or anything.

[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.860]
Do you know how many times I've heard this story, sir?

[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:43.960]
Is it that great?

[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.600]
They all got up and got off the bus and every seat there was stuff left behind.

[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.360]
I'm not the Phil II shopping basket.

[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:49.760]
Right.

[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:50.840]
That's great.

[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.920]
A Tiscuit of Tascuit, leave it in my basket.

[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.100]
Okay, but you haven't heard this one.

[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:54.640]
Okay.

[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.140]
As Teewee was being read out in handcuffs.

[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:57.480]
Okay.

[00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.760]
152 at WIOD.

[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.420]
Boy, they got that beat scene on MTV again right now.

[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.600]
And I don't have time to be bothered with this stinkin' show.

[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.540]
Okay, look at, was this the one that I was watching yesterday

[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.560]
and about the same time?

[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:09.860]
No.

[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.620]
Different cast of characters.

[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.400]
Not bad.

[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.800]
Anyway, let's go to Miami Beach.

[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.140]
Hello.

[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:16.960]
How you doing?

[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:17.540]
Okay.

[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.680]
Bonk's more entertaining than that, Rayce.

[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.440]
Yeah, that's good.

[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.860]
Okay, I boxed this.

[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.120]
Hi, Johnny.

[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.460]
Have a nice day over at the coast.

[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.920]
Pember of Pine, hello.

[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:26.840]
Yeah, what's up, Neil?

[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.360]
How are you?

[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:27.680]
Great.

[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.740]
I'm talking about Las Vegas.

[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:30.340]
Yeah.

[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.680]
I lived out there for two years and I tell you,

[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.160]
I always hear you say what a great ton it is.

[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.260]
I hated it out there.

[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:36.980]
Why is that?

[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.340]
Nothing to do.

[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.600]
I mean, except drinking gambling.

[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.280]
You gamble out there, you get into a board.

[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.540]
Oh, bring it out of here.

[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.620]
Nothing to do but drinking gambling.

[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.420]
Go away, way up.

[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:48.620]
What else?

[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.880]
What else besides that?

[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.460]
I was here for two.

[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.200]
I made great money.

[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.400]
I was a bartender out there.

[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:53.880]
Yeah.

[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.120]
But I made great money.

[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.900]
But I don't drink, okay?

[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.500]
So there must be something else to do out there beside drinking.

[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.420]
Well, you tell me one thing since you've been out there

[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.200]
so many times.

[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.380]
Tell me one besides drinking.

[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.700]
How about the big name entertainment?

[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.760]
How about the show?

[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:07.780]
How about the food?

[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:08.360]
How often do you go to that?

[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:08.660]
What?

[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.500]
I mean, if you live out there, how often can you go in?

[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.760]
There's a ticket, there's a ticket for it.

[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:13.000]
I'll go out there.

[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.680]
But you don't understand.

[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.960]
The point is that at least you have the option.

[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.560]
When you live somewhere, you have a series of options.

[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.900]
People live in New York City.

[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.440]
Don't go to a Broadway show every day of the week.

[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.540]
But once in a while when there's something they want to see,

[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.040]
it's there and they go and they enjoy it.

[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.360]
They don't understand that, but at least out here,

[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:33.480]
I mean, at least you don't wear a towel or you can do the football thing.

[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.680]
We've got baseball crumbles.

[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:35.420]
We've got basketball.

[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.900]
I mean, there's no sports out there.

[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.420]
I mean, you know, there's no sports out there at all.

[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.140]
They're all on the big screen in the sports pool.

[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.900]
I don't go and see whatever the hell you want.

[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.140]
But that's not the same thing as watching it on the bigger.

[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:46.660]
Yes, sure.

[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.680]
So life is more than just a ball game, okay?

[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.360]
Then just waiting for a ball game.

[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.840]
It'll be great when we have baseball,

[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.560]
because baseball is just about every night in the summertime.

[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:56.400]
That's great.

[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.400]
We used to get so bored out there, we would go out and look for deserts.

[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.860]
Well, you're the only person I have ever spoken to in my life,

[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.220]
who gave me a song in a dance like this.

[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:05.380]
Wait a second, there's a different song.

[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.080]
I'm talking about, I'm talking about people who lived there.

[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.820]
I'm not talking about people who visited there.

[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.840]
No, I can't understand it.

[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:12.780]
I mean, it's a hundred percent.

[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.860]
In addition to which this is supposed to be a tourist town, okay?

[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:21.360]
Professional sports is not what a tourist town is all about, okay?

[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.000]
That's not what it's all about.

[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.000]
What is it all about?

[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.380]
It's having things for people.

[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:33.720]
What do you think you go out there and retire and gamble?

[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.180]
I mean, they end up spending every nickel.

[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.420]
Oh, sir.

[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.680]
Go have a Hershey in them, will you?

[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.820]
Get out of my life.

[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.100]
They go and spend every nickel.

[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.380]
I'm talking about tourist places, places for people to go places and do things.

[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.680]
Dumbbell, no wonder you're here.

[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.600]
God almighty.

[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.260]
If you didn't like it there, I'm happy for you, okay?

[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.820]
North Miami Beach.

[00:45:59.120 --> 00:45:59.460]
Uh, no.

[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:01.920]
Me, coheron, estrangle, and wait.

[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.920]
Only in English, okay?

[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.220]
On the show, only in English.

[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.920]
Let's try Miami on the Star Line.

[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:09.240]
Hello.

[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.380]
Mr. Rogers, what's your blood pressure there?

[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:11.820]
I know.

[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.040]
These people are nuts today.

[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:17.940]
That guy from Vegas, that man is the biggest dipspit I have ever spoken to in my life.

[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.280]
Anyway, there's nothing to do there.

[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.680]
Yeah, it's exciting here.

[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.060]
We're going to sit around and wait for the marlins for a year and a half.

[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.640]
Okay, it'll be great when the meantime.

[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.900]
You had to go live in Des Moines or someplace like that.

[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:28.980]
Oh, God.

[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.000]
Anyway, I spoke to you earlier this year.

[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:34.320]
I'm not one of your scum-sucking bandwagon jumping cups fans.

[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.040]
I'm a Dodger fan.

[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.220]
I'd like to thank your cups for beating up on the braids.

[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.280]
It was an exciting series.

[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:39.600]
Yeah.

[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.280]
Uh, that's...

[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.120]
Well, we'll try to help you out tonight, but you guys are going to have to get some hits.

[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.700]
You know, you have three hits in two games and I'm getting the job.

[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.860]
We hit our way out of a paper bag.

[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.100]
It's just pitiful.

[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.080]
We almost got no hit three times in the past six days.

[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:57.780]
But, uh, keep it up and good luck and I'd like to see you guys beat up on the reds.

[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:58.460]
It's quite that early guy.

[00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.600]
Well, we're going to try it.

[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.100]
Thank you, sir.

[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.160]
We're going to take Bring Our Bats.

[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:01.740]
I'll tell you that.

[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:02.040]
All right.

[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.880]
See you.

[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.260]
Not necessarily for the game.

[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.900]
156 at WIOD, Miami.

[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.180]
Rick and Suck Suck.

[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.140]
Okay, thanks.

[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:11.820]
Miramar.

[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.060]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.060]
I went and got my head over a blockbuster and I love it.

[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.580]
Go Marlins, Dennis, and Joe, your major douchebags.

[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.080]
Okay.

[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.180]
Good job.

[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:20.960]
Right to the point.

[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.720]
He got it all in.

[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.560]
He touched all the bases in Halleluia.

[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.140]
Miami Beach on the Star Line.

[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:26.680]
Hello.

[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.160]
Neil.

[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:28.600]
Yeah.

[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.200]
You got a minute to talk sometime off the air.

[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.380]
About a fundraiser for a commemoration house.

[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.320]
What do you mean about a fundraiser for Camilo's house?

[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:45.380]
Well, I was introduced to something last night that would be, I think, very interesting to you

[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:48.160]
in Camilo's house to raise money for Camilo's house.

[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:48.920]
And regard to what?

[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:49.680]
Doing what?

[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:50.760]
Racing money.

[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.300]
But I mean, what is it?

[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:57.980]
Well, you could tie it in with your end of the year if I meant you always do to raise money.

[00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.760]
Okay, hold on a second.

[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:00.000]
Sure.

[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.900]
Why do these people call me on the air with stuff?

[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:04.080]
Why don't they talk to we event?

[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.400]
Why do they talk to boy Kurt?

[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:07.340]
I think I'm losing it.

[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.180]
North Miami.

[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.940]
Whatever happened to Ron St. John, Jr.

[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.120]
Good question.

[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.060]
And Benny Goodman had a big smash hit in 1945.

[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.180]
Yeah.

[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.840]
Call it got to be this or that he actually sang on the record.

[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:20.240]
Wow.

[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.220]
And novelly vocal by the man himself.

[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.800]
Okay, call up Stu Goldstein.

[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.300]
He'll be right over to compare notes with you.

[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.000]
Well, that's going to do it for us and none too soon.

[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.500]
Let me tell you that boys and girls.

[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.560]
Carry your trench coats even on a sunny day.

[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.940]
That's the message we learned today.

[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.520]
Rick and Puddle, I'm sorry.

[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.960]
A Duboy and Puddle be along after the two o'clock news for four exciting hours.

[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.080]
Joe Zagaki and Sunny Hirsch will be here on Sports Talk to do their usual Tuesday evening.
