[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.940]
Baby white things, the white things that you get in a box to act to clean their face and stuff with.

[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.420]
They're shaving without shaving cream and things like that over there.

[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.680]
They're all doing well though, they're ready to come home or do something.

[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.620]
But I just wanted to let everybody know, you know, they do have phones set up over there now.

[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.340]
AT&T has a satellite dish that they put up in Foddy.

[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.700]
And where my son is, he's got there's a huge tent there with about 60 telephones.

[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.480]
So he was able to give me a call and I spoke to him for about an hour.

[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.920]
Great.

[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.760]
So I can't wait to get my bill.

[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.400]
But it didn't matter, it was great here and from himself.

[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.720]
You got somebody over there and you're not sure what to send.

[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.860]
You know, what I mentioned is good because I can all use that and keep the mail growing

[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.180]
because it's all I got right now.

[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.960]
Okay. You hang in there.

[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.700]
You have a good day.

[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.080]
Thanks.

[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.720]
1043 at WIOD, we have an open line in Broward 5249463, 524WIOD,

[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.740]
a pig report on the mobile?

[00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.700]
Yes sir.

[00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.720]
How are you doing?

[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.900]
Okay.

[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.720]
Good day today.

[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.220]
There's a trap down there between Mercy Hospital and the sky on South Bay shores about five

[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.760]
kilometres in the side of the road.

[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.180]
Great.

[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.400]
It's your little radar trail.

[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.840]
Hallelujah.

[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.380]
Oh yeah, just wonderful.

[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.100]
Great Americans are out there doing it.

[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.040]
Nothing better to do.

[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.780]
Doing their duty.

[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.120]
For God in country.

[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.780]
Uh huh.

[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.160]
Paying those bills.

[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.900]
Yes sir.

[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.380]
Good show today Neil.

[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.040]
What?

[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.800]
Good show today.

[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.980]
Good show about what?

[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.480]
Huh?

[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.580]
Good show.

[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.660]
We got two different shows.

[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.960]
We got one show that I'm doing.

[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.060]
Another show the audience is doing.

[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.620]
I agree with you.

[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.120]
I agree with you on the TV stuff.

[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.180]
But now nobody has anything to say about it.

[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.520]
You know?

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.140]
For a while there, that's all they wanted to talk about.

[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.500]
We had like 7,000 calls.

[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.360]
It was ponderous.

[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.620]
Now that we have, that it's just really created a major thing in the world and in the whole world.

[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.640]
Now it's like, well, you know, we already went over that.

[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.040]
Let's go on to something else like whatever.

[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.900]
I know.

[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.620]
I know.

[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.580]
Let's pick our nose.

[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.840]
It's not new anymore.

[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.040]
You know, everybody wants something new.

[00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.700]
That's right.

[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.820]
Have a great day.

[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.120]
You too.

[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.780]
1044 at WIOD.

[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.500]
We have an open line on the star line.

[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.380]
If you have Bell South mobility, good luck to you.

[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.780]
Star.

[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.060]
I OD.

[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.240]
I'm not going to get upset about it because I know human nature.

[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.460]
Boy do I know it by now.

[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.320]
Anyway.

[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.060]
16 pounds.

[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.880]
Encouting in spite of that in temperate day.

[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.500]
Was it on Monday?

[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.180]
Was Monday.

[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.720]
We had that in temperate day and here it had a little eating frenzy.

[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.240]
But in spite of that, I've done 16 pounds on neutral system.

[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.020]
And Roger, the world famous micro-neuritio also were dead even.

[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.340]
We're in a dead heat, folks.

[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.880]
We're right at the finish line together.

[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.400]
At 16 pounds, well, not really at the finish line.

[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.960]
We're still at the top of the backstretch.

[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.420]
But at the time we get to the finish line, we're both going to lose plenty.

[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.020]
Because neutral system works.

[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.760]
Look at that Slob Johnny dark at the coast.

[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.020]
32 pounds.

[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.660]
Uncle Neal, John, yeah.

[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.940]
I lost 32 pounds.

[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.440]
So I just said, I bought some nice new clothes.

[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.980]
You want me to give you the name of my clotheier?

[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.620]
Please.

[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.620]
So we can all forget to go there.

[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.780]
OK, this man, a fashion plate, the Lexi of which you've never seen.

[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.460]
Anyway, once you've lost the weight, you can go out and buy some real clothing.

[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.560]
And a real store can't forget about Johnny dark.

[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.480]
This week a neutral system, lose all the weight you can in three weeks for just $59 for program services.

[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.980]
So stop putting it off.

[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.340]
Get your big, large ass up out of the chair and go over right now and call them.

[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.840]
Get started.

[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.000]
1-800-344-thin.

[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.560]
1-800-344-THI-N and be sure and tell them that once gigantic Neal at WIOD asked you to call.

[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.920]
Neutral system.

[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.460]
A wonderful fact about Neal, Rodgers.

[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.900]
You should know that's a major cause of stiffness and swelling.

[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.200]
And it's starting to happen right now.

[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.980]
1049 at WIOD.

[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.400]
We have an open line in Dave County, 751.

[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.800]
And, uh, oh, geez.

[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.160]
I'm really sorry that I said anything today.

[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.440]
OK.

[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.540]
What do you want?

[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.900]
I kind of town Chicago is.

[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.360]
Hello.

[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.520]
What do you want?

[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.980]
Just called to say hi.

[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.440]
Hi.

[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.420]
How you doing?

[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.540]
Good day.

[00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.740]
Good day.

[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.980]
What?

[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.240]
How's the show been?

[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.040]
I've missed you.

[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.220]
She always been just fine.

[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.140]
Up until today.

[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.980]
Wow.

[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.240]
Because I had the audacity to say something about the war and about the median.

[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.640]
Get serious again for about five minutes and they're just so they can't handle it anymore.

[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.760]
Wow.

[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.120]
They go from one extreme to the other.

[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.460]
And then you call in that kind of like is the frosting on the cupcake.

[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.100]
Well, maybe I should hang up there.

[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.780]
Paul Harvey, Jr. ladies and gentlemen.

[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.760]
A man who just, uh, so what are you doing up there?

[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.480]
I'm working my ass off.

[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.980]
Doing what?

[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.340]
Are you peddling your ass?

[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.220]
I'm working on a big audit up here for insurance.

[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.140]
Great.

[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.880]
Yeah.

[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.660]
Let me tell you the weather up here sucks.

[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.640]
Anybody down there who would ever complain.

[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.000]
It's got to be insane.

[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.640]
Yeah.

[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.120]
Got to be.

[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.920]
I got news for you.

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.620]
There are a lot more people up there than there are here.

[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.120]
There must be a reason for it.

[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.020]
Well, anyway, um, here for a couple more weeks and then I'm going to be back home.

[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.120]
I miss it.

[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.660]
Great.

[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.640]
Boy, we sure miss talking to you.

[00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.240]
Oh, awesome.

[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.220]
Yeah.

[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.480]
I'll bet you do.

[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.620]
I'll bring a Jim and Tammy feedback with you.

[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.840]
They're going to be big in the news again.

[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.120]
She's got those earrings the size of a month.

[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.360]
I thought Tammy's around you right now somewhere down there.

[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.640]
I have no idea where she is.

[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.680]
All I know is she's wearing those gigantic button earrings the size of Vermont.

[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680]
And they're just embarrassing.

[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.680]
But it would be great to kick their ass around a little bit again.

[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.380]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.520]
And he said if a miracle does occur and he does get out, he's going to start his ministry again, right?

[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.880]
Right.

[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.020]

[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.500]
Don't mark.

[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.960]
Yeah.

[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.320]
Anyway.

[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.900]
Yeah.

[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.820]
I know I found some money with everybody up here is so excited about getting Eric Kumaro as

[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.780]
they're back up quarterback.

[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.120]
Well, I'm glad they're excited.

[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.480]
I'm glad that they have important things to talk about like Eric Kumaro.

[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.680]
Can you imagine that?

[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.120]
Mm-hmm.

[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.780]
Other than that, everything's fine.

[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.980]
Are they in for a big summer?

[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.760]
How about ready for another snowfall?

[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.400]
Great.

[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.220]
So.

[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.280]
Well, say hi to Harry and all my good friend up there at War of Eat and anyplace good?

[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.300]
Yeah, I have.

[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.280]
We went to Harry Carrey's.

[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.400]
The food was so so but the ball was really neat.

[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.800]
We ate at the Tang Dynasty, which was excellent.

[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.500]
Did you go over to the palm?

[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.300]
No, I haven't been there yet.

[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.200]
Oh, boy, is that a good place?

[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.820]
Yeah.

[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.700]
And Gino's East and West.

[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.660]
I went to Gino's.

[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.120]
I've been there like three times right now.

[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.000]
I've been there like three or Uno and what's that Italian restaurant we kept talking about

[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.900]
begins with an S.

[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.800]
There's a good cheese.

[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.340]
There's a good cheese.

[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.420]

[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.360]
Is that a scoosies?

[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.280]
Scoosies?

[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.120]
Yeah.

[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.580]
I'll go to scoosies, believe me.

[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.040]
Okay.

[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.300]
The food up here I got to tell you is better than anywhere else I've eaten.

[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.620]
Yeah.

[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.780]
Food in Chicago is some of the best in the world.

[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.980]
But the people, one thing I have noticed, the people here are not very friendly.

[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.260]
The service is excellent.

[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.280]
People are not friendly?

[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.980]
The people out on the street.

[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.240]
Well, I don't agree with that.

[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.580]
I don't know where you've been hanging out.

[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.980]
Well, that right downtown.

[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.260]
Right downtown.

[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.620]
I don't, I didn't find that.

[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.640]
People here are pigs too.

[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.980]
When the snow melts it's unbelievable.

[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.840]
How much garbage is on the sides of the roads and on the sidewalks and everywhere else?

[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.380]
It's unbelievable.

[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.920]
You know, people down there complain.

[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.080]
I don't understand.

[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.480]
But the city I love, the weather sucks.

[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.240]
People suck.

[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.560]
What the hell?

[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.960]
Well, you sit right in.

[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.180]
The money is excellent.

[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.160]
Like I said.

[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.440]
Anyway.

[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.080]
Good day.

[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.220]
Just one call and good day.

[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.640]
1052 at WIOD.

[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.500]
We have an open line on the long distance line.

[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.740]
655 WIOD in Palm Beach.

[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.360]
Let's go to Isla Marotta.

[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.680]
Hello.

[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:22.460]
Martin Eel.

[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.560]
How you doing?

[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.500]
I'm doing great.

[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.200]
At a little momentary lapse there, I forgot where it was, but I feel okay now.

[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.920]
It's okay.

[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.380]
It's lesions on the brain.

[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.720]
Yeah.

[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.060]
It's a casualty of 60s.

[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.100]
Anyway, it's interesting to hear you talk about the apathy in the country.

[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.580]
I'm sure you've seen it every day on here.

[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.200]
They don't give a crap about anything.

[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.100]
And about 80% of the people who claim to care about the troops in the war, and they don't, you know, they do it because it's a happening.

[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.800]
It's an in thing.

[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.060]
They don't give a damn about anything, but their own little meaningless, pathetic lives, sir.

[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:53.540]
That's really good.

[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.000]
It's all they give a crap about.

[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.600]
In fact, that should be the new national slogan.

[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.400]
I have no life.

[00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:58.980]
That's right.

[00:07:59.380 --> 00:07:59.560]
Yeah.

[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.380]
That's true.

[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.040]
And imagine if the apathy is at this level for an international conflict.

[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.740]
Because it's size.

[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.080]
Right.

[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.600]
Imagine what it normally is for a regular voting.

[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.840]
Oh, man.

[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.380]
For men.

[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.360]
They don't give a crap about anything.

[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.360]
And then they belly it.

[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.740]
It's like, oh gee, look what we got.

[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.360]
We got to bumping eyes.

[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.480]
I mean, what do they expect?

[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.020]
Okay.

[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.920]
You get out of something, whatever you put into it.

[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.320]
And these people put nothing into anything.

[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:24.740]
Okay.

[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.120]
They're a bunch of slime balls.

[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:26.820]
Truly true.

[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.460]
We can sure be proud that we got 100% volunteer force over there.

[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.440]
And they've made some decisions.

[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.180]
And they've got to be out there.

[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:32.340]
Yeah.

[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.660]
Thank God for them, boy.

[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.540]
Thank God for them.

[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.520]
And then all these cowering little, uh,

[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.280]
Snivley douchebags that are right, oh, we're going to have a draft.

[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.340]
Oh, we're going to have a draft.

[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.540]
They're carrying us on the track.

[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.020]
Do you only think we can be proud of us at Amt Troops that are over there?

[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.760]
The American public makes you puke.

[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.360]
That's the fact.

[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.320]
I think you're right too about the, uh, about the Kennedy thing.

[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.280]
I was just listening to that.

[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.660]
I just turned it on when you said that.

[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.280]
And I don't want to get into big conspiracy theory or anything like that.

[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.140]
But I think you're right.

[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.100]
I mean, no question in my mind that there were elements of the CIA

[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.040]
and others higher up in the United States government that were responsible

[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.960]
for the assassinations of John Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King.

[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.320]
I would know.

[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.460]
And yet when it comes yet, we were so high for Luton and we're so, uh,

[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.760]
oh, there he is again.

[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.700]
I can't take any standing in the dark.

[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.160]
You'll never guess who's on CNN right now.

[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.940]
With that look like Dracula on a bad day with the needs of a haircut over his neck.

[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.840]
Man, stick him in the desert and give him and put him together with Rick Sanchez.

[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:27.820]
Yeah, well, yeah.

[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.920]
Let him stand out in front of Rick Sanchez's newsmobile, okay?

[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.700]
It's sure not above the saying to put a bunch of people on top of his bunker

[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.420]
and other types of bunkers, too.

[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.780]
I mean, we can't, you know, we said here we worry about 300, 400 people in spray.

[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.820]
It's nice to have that concern.

[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:47.140]
But as you said before, the millions of people that have died both just as victims of war

[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.200]
and fighting for the Arab.

[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.600]
That's right.

[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.960]
How about the people in the civilians in Israel who died and were severely wounded?

[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.900]
Many of them were discussed.

[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.280]
They're not even involved in the war.

[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:55.680]
Exactly.

[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.800]
And yet they, you know, they got to stay out.

[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.920]
Everybody's got an eye up in the sky waiting to get hysterical with them.

[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.000]
But all of a sudden, here's the country that the whole world is fighting

[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.660]
and some of their civilians are being killed.

[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.980]
And we don't even know the circumstances.

[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.480]
And right away, our whole media is turning up.

[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.500]
Oh, we're doing it wrong.

[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.640]
And we're just not being careful enough.

[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.920]
It's not surgical enough.

[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.260]
That's the biggest pile of crap I've ever heard in my life.

[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:18.820]
True.

[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.300]
Well, on a woman standing on top of that rock pile.

[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.100]
I keep thinking of that picture shaking her finger.

[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:24.940]
You would do this.

[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.800]
You would do this.

[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.080]
Yeah.

[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.520]
I'm sure the people in Kuwait like to take her and pluck her eyes out.

[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.080]
Right.

[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.320]
And stick them where the moon don't shine.

[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.740]
Anyway, I wonder what she'd see.

[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.660]
Go ahead.

[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.340]
On a smaller note, it's closer to home.

[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.820]
Seriously, did you ever think about that if you did pluck somebody's eyes out

[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.980]
and stuck them where the moon don't shine?

[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.820]
What would they see?

[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:42.620]
Well, I don't know.

[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.940]
It'd be like that headlights bang on it.

[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.700]
Probably like being deep in the bowels of the University of the gigantic black hole, I guess.

[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.180]
I'm sorry.

[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.340]
Okay.

[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.540]
I'm talking about a different type of pig rapport.

[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.940]
I was watching that flipping through the channels on regular television the other night.

[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.280]
And they came out with this commercial.

[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.800]
And I was called the up months or months or so ago about to count down the crisis spring.

[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:02.880]
Oh, anyway.

[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.380]
This is another kind of thing like that.

[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.640]
Although I think it's really much more serious.

[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:12.040]
I saw a commercial about a guy walking down a prison row like he's going down either death row

[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.760]
or he's going to go into prison for life.

[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.460]
It either shows him his choice as the electric chair or prison for life if you kill a cop.

[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.180]
But the average person that commits a murder I think in the United States against a citizen

[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.440]
they're looking at it probably 10 years.

[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:25.780]
Yeah.

[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.340]
I'd never been able to understand it.

[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.760]
Like the life of a cop is somehow more valuable in life of somebody else.

[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.820]
This guy's dissection between authority figures and the people that pay the taxes.

[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.240]
Yeah.

[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:41.140]
Is this tremendous harbinger of the separation between the, you know, between authority and totalitarianism?

[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.120]
And I want to take care of it on that issue.

[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.620]
But it's really true and they date.

[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.700]
Well, let's not get too carried away, sir, because the audience is that this is not the date for this.

[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.940]
They're in dupervality and fun and games and we don't want to destroy a rain on their parade.

[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.040]
Yeah, well you're right.

[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:54.660]
Okay.

[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.640]
It's sad.

[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.400]
It really is.

[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.500]
Well, and it's never going to change.

[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.740]
I can't imagine how, I mean, I understand your job and I listen to you.

[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:07.600]
If I haven't been listening to long time but I sure am thankful that at least we've got some type of an outlet for the freedom of speech and first amendment.

[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.820]
At least information distributed in different ways other than the Harold and South Florida.

[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.840]
I can't imagine how you can tolerate the after-day via just a matter of time.

[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.140]
Well, that's why I don't do it anymore.

[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.740]
That's why I don't do that stuff anymore.

[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.900]
And then I lapse back into it or get stuck back into it like in this case and all of a sudden I get a rude awakening.

[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.940]
They don't want it.

[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.880]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.380]
They just want to watch MTV.

[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.140]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.600]
Okay.

[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.080]
Okay.

[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.060]
I'll be going F on.

[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.300]
Give pieces a chance.

[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.420]
See you later.

[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.780]
1057 at WIOD.

[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:43.220]
We have an open lane and died at 7519463 and one in Palm Beach 655 WIOD.

[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.800]
655 9463 Hollywood.

[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:47.880]
Now.

[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:48.720]
Yes, sir.

[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:49.740]
Yeah, I have a question.

[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.600]
I was asking in a review with Alexander Heyg on T-Span yesterday.

[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.100]
Yeah.

[00:12:53.720 --> 00:13:00.080]
And somebody called me at a good point that since we're sending these pamphlets over to our rack, you know, to them to turn themselves in.

[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.080]
Why don't we send pictures of how well we're treating their prisoners as an incentive for them to turn themselves in?

[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:06.920]
What do you think about that?

[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.380]
Pictures of how do you send pictures of how well you're treating their prisoners?

[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.180]
I don't understand.

[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.580]
We've got over a thousand EPWs and understand how you do that.

[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.280]
Well, I mean, I have the suit that they're eating, how to be treated.

[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.860]
Yeah, well, yeah, that's a good idea.

[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.640]
Well, I'm sure that there'll be more.

[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.720]
I'm sure that this is just the beginning of the dropping all these leaflets by air with hundreds of thousands of them.

[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.080]
Right.

[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:34.980]
And another thing, Alexander Heyg, I don't know, this sounds ridiculous to me, but he said, why don't we give them a reward incentive?

[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.220]
When they turn their pamphlets in with themselves, I mean, you give them a reward.

[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.560]
What do you think about that?

[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.660]
Yeah, give them a pound of hollivar or something.

[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.220]
They'll do it.

[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.900]
All right now.

[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:44.840]
Have a great life, pal.

[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:45.540]
Okay.

[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:52.780]
1059 at WIOD, we have an open line at Broward, 524 We Don't Care, 5249463.

[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:53.980]
I'd be honest with you.

[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.260]
It's really kind of pointless to sit here and read about these rallies and these different things going on,

[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.320]
because it's obvious that this audience, or the most people, I don't want to say this audience,

[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.540]
because I'm not going to take that rap.

[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.560]
People in general don't give a flying crap.

[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.600]
Okay, they really don't.

[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.920]
There's a small percentage you'd do, and most people don't give a crap.

[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.320]
And that's...

[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.900]
And I know you can argue with me about that all you want, but I know that, because I know human nature.

[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:15.920]
I know the way people are.

[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.580]
People are in our own dream worlds, and they don't give a damn.

[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.640]
They're oblivious.

[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.060]
And all this jazz about their so concerned about the lives of the troops in human life,

[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.360]
don't feed me that crap.

[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.840]
Human life has been devalued at the point.

[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.400]
It's like stepping on cockroaches.

[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.540]
It's a sad commentary, but it's true.

[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:36.260]
Anyway, on that uplifting note, it's time for Henry Barrow and the 11 o'clock WIOD news.

[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.940]
And then we'll come back and put on a happy face for you.

[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.240]
Okay?

[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.980]
Yeah, we're going to do that for three solid hours today.

[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.560]
Rick and Scuttle be here from 2-6 this afternoon.

[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.380]
Joseph Gackie and Jim Mandage on Sports Talk at 6-05.

[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.920]
Jim Palmer and his underwear with Hank Goldberg 8-11 tonight.

[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.160]
It was a bombing night in downtown Baghdad.

[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.040]
Everything's under control now.

[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.420]
I've come back to the real world after a little flight into the twilight zone.

[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.240]
When you see what happened during the first two weeks,

[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.900]
we had enormous numbers of people who came over and tuned to this radio station

[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.740]
because there was enormous interest.

[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.800]
There was a lot of news coming out every day, and we were passing it along.

[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:21.060]
And all the discussion was about what was going on, pro and con, in and out, whatever.

[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.520]
And now that that isn't going on, because the trickle of information is down to like a slow leak,

[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.940]
those people are mostly gone.

[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.260]
Because when a hunger round had found out we don't do that every day, then they're gone.

[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.100]
Or they would have been here in the first place.

[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.100]
So that's basically where we are.

[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.360]
We're not going to dilute ourselves into believing that anybody who cares about anything is still around.

[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.840]
Okay? So I feel better now.

[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.920]
It's 11-08 at WIOD.

[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.520]
I think what they ought to do really is just fight the whole damn war

[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.640]
and tell nothing about it, get it over with, bring everybody home safe,

[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.120]
and then they can give us a report.

[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.640]
Because otherwise it's impossible.

[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.900]
Let's go to sunrise, shall we? Hello.

[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.520]
Hello, Nene.

[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.620]
We love you.

[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.040]
We'll hang up if we discuss the Gulf War.

[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.120]
What is that?

[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.460]
I said, will you hang up if we discuss anything?

[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.160]
I won't hang up if we discuss anything.

[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.700]
But I mean, it's obvious that what I said is true though, isn't it?

[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.220]
Very short attention span.

[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.840]
I really know a lot of people are still very concerned.

[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.380]
They're concerned, they're concerned, they're concerned.

[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.020]
Okay, could I say that in the first few days of the coverage,

[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.700]
or the first few days of the war, I feel at least two articles

[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.460]
buried within the newspaper about the cozy arrangements CNN had

[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.800]
with the Iraqi government.

[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.100]

[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.660]
And Peter on that's been doing this kind of reporting since North Vietnam.

[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.760]
He was chasing around the North Vietnam guerrillas

[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.860]
and making the same kind of stupid reports.

[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.500]
I don't watch CNN now if I can help it,

[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.600]
because it sets me too much of how to demoralize everybody.

[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.440]
Isn't just demoralizing, but they're actually interfering with the war.

[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.900]
They're interfering with the Allied Forces conduct of the war,

[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.920]
and they're interfering with the balance of world public opinion.

[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.920]
It's one thing to report it, but it's another thing to allow themselves

[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.460]
to be used as a propaganda to alert or achieve certain objectives.

[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.100]
And they just pretend, oh, we're just presenting a balanced picture.

[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.700]
We're just going to keep on doing it.

[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.900]
Peter, that's a great reporter.

[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.440]
I mean, that people ought to be outraged at them.

[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.640]
They ought to be foaming at the mouth over what they're doing.

[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.300]
Well, I know.

[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:14.960]
They're disgrace.

[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.560]
There's one point I would like to kind of make.

[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.260]
We'll demoralize the parade when the vets come home,

[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.880]
which they should have.

[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.900]
Wouldn't it be nice if we got a movement going where they invited the Vietnam veterans

[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.180]
to parade with them and get the glory that they deserve to be original?

[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:35.880]
That would be great.

[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:42.080]
They were ordered by the same way these boys were to go and do a job.

[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.980]
Maybe we could get Ramsay Clark to organize.

[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.740]
Yeah, right.

[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.300]
Maybe we could stick him in the middle of the parade,

[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.320]
hang him up in front of all the troops.

[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.540]
It would be really nice.

[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:52.340]
Really nice.

[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.540]
Remember what they do with Mussolini?

[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.780]
Yeah, right.

[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.620]
Take Ramsay and Peter R. Net will use it a double noose.

[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.380]
Well, John Chan was not doing too bad a job these days either.

[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.300]
I've been listening to him.

[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.660]
He's really, really.

[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.320]
He looks so mad about it all.

[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.780]
I haven't...

[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.860]
Well, what is his song now?

[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.520]
What is he singing?

[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.400]
Well, pretty much like he's getting to be found a little bit like Peter Jennings.

[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.020]
He's kind of pants I go for.

[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.980]
He's really furious about what he thinks the allies are doing over there.

[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:20.560]
Oh.

[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:21.480]
Okay.

[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.820]
Like we're fighting a war.

[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.760]
Yeah, right.

[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.500]
On today's...

[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.560]
So in other words, what we ought to do is just send all of our kids across into the...

[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.480]
We ought to just start the ground war right now to be expedient for them.

[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.760]
Let the half a million landmines blow them all up and just get it over with them.

[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.100]
Bring everybody home in a body bag.

[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.140]
Is that what they want us to do?

[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.040]
I just...

[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.280]
The media just suck.

[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:43.920]
They really do.

[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.140]
I mean, there's nothing anybody could say about the media that would be low enough to be honest.

[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.600]
And they're like the doctors.

[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.700]
They're like the doctors.

[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.920]
Yeah, they're bunch of horrors.

[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.060]
They're bunch of horrors.

[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:59.260]
Well, on page 4a of the Sun Sentinel today, there's a small article, Anticeean and Coalition forms.

[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.080]
If with your connection is maybe getting it to information on where people can contact this coalition,

[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.760]
they're going to try to get Peter on that removed from Iraq.

[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.400]
Great.

[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.000]
In fact, I have that in my hand.

[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.160]
Or where's the article?

[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.080]
Or a on the left.

[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:13.660]
Well, there it is.

[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:14.400]
I've got it right here.

[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.020]
Thanks a lot.

[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.200]
Have a great day.

[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.600]
And one more point, please.

[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:19.660]
Yes?

[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.520]
Oh, there's going to be a power play after this is all over between Iran and Syria.

[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.800]
And now the man behind the throne in this country is...

[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.180]
It was only made public a couple of times and very small articles.

[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.400]
Our John Sanuno is a two-in-one Syrian.

[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.020]
So I don't know how much influence he's having on this whole thing anyway.

[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.240]
And I'll hang up now.

[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:37.560]
Okay.

[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.060]
Thank you.

[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.440]
See ya.

[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:46.280]
12 minutes after 11 at WIOD, we have an open line in Broward, 5249463 and 1 in Palm Beach, 655 WIOD.

[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.720]
She kind of led me into this and we'll move that thing up, George, to this break.

[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.640]
No, seriously, because on page 4a I have it right in front of me.

[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:02.500]
And it's not a big article, but it's in the Digest where they have a bunch of columns in the Sun Sentinel

[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.920]
and the third one down says anti-CNN coalition forums.

[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.920]
And it's about a coalition of conservative groups.

[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.940]
Far be it for me to be conservative in this case, but this transcends partisan politics.

[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:20.000]
And they're working desperately to get the CNN and its correspondent Peter Arnett removed from Iraq

[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.320]
to stop the propaganda voice.

[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:27.680]
If you want to read it and if you want to make 8 million copies of it and kind of help spread the idea,

[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.440]
pick up today's Sun Sentinel, okay?

[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:30.640]
And we'll be right back.

[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.420]
Now we're in good shape.

[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.680]
Peter Jr. is in here.

[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:40.740]
Now you're right.

[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:46.020]
They have just, they're lost, but I know you're going to say something I'm going to get hysterical about.

[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:46.620]
No, I'm not.

[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.280]
Okay.

[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.900]
I'm laying back on this.

[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:55.480]
I spoke my piece a while ago and we'll just let it go.

[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.820]
You have your piece of a while ago.

[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.260]
And yeah.

[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.420]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.760]
You just got saying not only do they have short attention spans, but they have bad memory.

[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.820]
Very short memories, yeah.

[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.420]
Like what?

[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.740]
Well, okay.

[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.100]
What are we talking about here?

[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.420]
The press or the war?

[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.300]
I don't know.

[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.680]
You made the state category.

[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.720]
I know what we're going to do with you.

[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.900]
Pick up me and then that bad said and don't give up a map.

[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:30.180]
No, I'll tell you, the Peter R. Net thing, you still feel the same way.

[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:30.860]
Yes, I do.

[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.180]
You think it's great that he's there showing all this.

[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:33.460]
I do.

[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:33.920]

[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.480]
And I, and that they're manipulating that.

[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.980]
Well, I'm not saying that.

[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.020]
In other words, if civilians get killed in war, that's something that's we should feel bad about.

[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:43.980]
Is that what you're saying?

[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.280]
Well, of course we should feel bad about it, but it's, it's all.

[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.580]
In other words, it'll be better for our troops to get killed.

[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.180]
That would be okay because that's us.

[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.540]
I'm not saying anyone should be.

[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.320]
I say no.

[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.680]
That's what I say.

[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.400]
No, drop wheels on them.

[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:56.680]
Yeah.

[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.880]
I've had it.

[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.380]
So I'm here for a few days.

[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.540]
I thought you were going to say something intelligent, but I should have known.

[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.340]
Oh, I doubt that.

[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.220]
Okay.

[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.920]
Well, at least I got you to give it off on issue instead of wasting your own valuable time with it.

[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.000]
Four hours on pussy cats yesterday.

[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.160]
Alex Bennett was upset about my dog almost died that day with the pendulum.

[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.920]
He would have really loved that show on cats.

[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.220]
I don't know what the problem is.

[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.160]
You people have a problem with cats in the neighborhood.

[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.380]
Almost everybody's got a microwave nowadays.

[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.980]
You do it on the day that the maid is coming.

[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:30.940]
You do it early in the morning.

[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.160]
And when the maid comes, she just swabs it out of there.

[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.240]
You got no problem at all.

[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.540]
Well, see you there once again, though.

[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.320]
I'm 45 seconds on slow cook.

[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.240]
I think it would be good.

[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.820]
A lot of the blame put on the cats, but it shouldn't be on the owners.

[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.500]
It's like kids, you know.

[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.700]
What do you do?

[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.660]
He's got ding dong school.

[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.080]
I love it.

[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.400]
How the progier this morning.

[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.160]
You guys like smoked something like the carpet?

[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.180]
He's smoking a Persian carpet.

[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.140]
I wonder what that means.

[00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.100]
Well, it's not too tough.

[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.320]
I wonder what that means.

[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.380]
He's smoking a Persian carpet this morning before he goes in for his big meat with boi giri.

[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.880]
By the way, Al Goldstein sent me a giant salami in the mail.

[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:10.380]
Oh, he did.

[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.260]
And also sent something else with it, too.

[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.980]
He said, take me to your ruler.

[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:15.940]
So he sent me your ruler.

[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.480]
Give me this big salami.

[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.300]
I think it was wishful thinking.

[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.260]
So anyway, go and see if you can find some of that around the building.

[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.660]
We did something special for you.

[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.620]
We spiced it up a little bit.

[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.020]
All right.

[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:25.420]
Okay.

[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.360]
Enjoy it.

[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.060]
Thank you very much.

[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:27.860]
Okay, there he goes.

[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.940]
Off to ding dong school.

[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:29.980]
I really regret that.

[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.220]
It's 11.19 WIOD.

[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.300]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:33.740]
Hello.

[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:34.280]
Hi.

[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.060]
Several things.

[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.880]
First of all, did you catch Saturday night live the beginning of it last Saturday night?
