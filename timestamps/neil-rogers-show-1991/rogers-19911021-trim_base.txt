[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:19.400]
mile you sing that sagrado put the piece on twice on his on his sports i mean the sports is only

[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:25.380]
three or four minutes long showing some sports not about this exactly exactly what i mean how much

[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.620]
do we see did he have any peace on the breeders crown this week at all oh man now i'm going to go

[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.340]
nuts it's not bad enough we know zagaki and mandature never going to put anything on because they

[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.920]
know nothing about it they don't give a crap right except what they you know are interested in

[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.780]
which is strictly a one-dimensional but i mean here's the guy who's supposed to be the only time

[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.020]
Tony sagrado ever really got interested in the harness racing with the couple years he drove in

[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:52.080]
the media race and we had to see himself promote showing him driving in a media race and he's out

[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.280]
there at pompadopark but unless they're promoting themselves and tuning their own horn and

[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.740]
tuning something then they won't give anybody any publicity and it sucks and you talk about bush

[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.820]
league that's bush league Tony okay i don't know what i'm like a mimey girl who's getting worse

[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.400]
than uh channel seven or channel four what do you want channel six right i want six a lot yeah

[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.020]
yeah because i'm all the way in campbell camera comes out and do the sports though my picture

[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.780]
starts wavering a little bit but i mean it's good sports anchors and talent on tv who are they

[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.080]
that's what i want to know i don't know i wish they the gaki man did sagrado good to port of my

[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.140]
mme and i take a boat somewhere we're not picking on you hank we don't consider you and hank

[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.180]
all right we'll meet thanks a great guy hank is a great guy i mean he and i disagree in a lot of

[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.180]
things we have our go around but i i like hank even though he thinks i hate him like boys and i

[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:45.080]
think hanks a super guy i'm a big hank goldberg fan but sometimes he just full of crap and he gets

[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.760]
upset yeah well and sometimes i'm full of crap and he gets upset and then it's usually him

[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.260]
oh he's usually right okay have a great day thank you well okay i like hank a lot

[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.800]
spider what he thinks well he thinks that i the reason hank gets upset with me is because manny

[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.460]
comes in here and gets him all but you notice how psychotic manny is manny used to be a great kid he

[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.260]
was a group he used to come running around zeta and hang around to be a pain in the ass then all

of a sunny decided he wanted to get into the business stick his nose and he's like it was bored

[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.480]
off and then all of a sudden he's hot shot producer and and now all of a sudden the uh since gray line

something right why is manage on sports talk instead of sunny harsh which used to be on sports talk

[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.940]
good question i had the answer to that manage that's a pompous ad at least sonny's got a sense of humor

[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.780]
you know it's sunny understands it's just a ballgame then take it also seriously what was the story behind

[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.160]
Joe is excellent on the air and I wish we had him here on i.o.d i think Joe Rose does one hell of a job

[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.420]
he tells it like it is yes sir that's probably why he was fired that's why he's not here because he's

flesh and imperial

[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.780]
and by Arthur was so scared and in period order.

[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.740]
Hello Canada and hockey fans of the United States and Houston lands

[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.360]
and I'd like to make hello to Canadian servicemen over safe.

[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.800]
You are your way, you're that's all.

[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.880]
Yeah, and the question for the A is will the Leafs ever win another game?

[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.800]
Unlikely. Okay, now I feel better. 146, that's another thing you'll ever hear about in this time because they know nothing about it.

[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:54.200]
146 at WIOD, Paul's hair and nails on the water next to shooters and the intercostal mall will do a tremendous job.

[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.240]
Cutting your hair, making you look almost human.

[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:07.040]
And right now Paul wants you to try his services by offering you because he knows that money is tighter than a drum, than a snare drum offering you a half price on a haircut for all our neelies out there.

[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.060]
Just 10 bucks for guys, 12 54 ladies.

[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.900]
And at Paul's you're not going to get these little punky kids that just came out of hair cutting school that are like 10 years old.

[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:22.580]
They are really guys who have had years of experience experience stylists to give you full consultation to a great job whether you want a full cut or just a little trim.

[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.600]
They won't rush you in and out like those quick cut, quick cut places. So come by boat or car to Paul's hair and nails.

[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:34.600]
They're open seven days a week on a weekend. You need an appointment 949-9701. 949-9701.

[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:44.440]
You'll find them right between Ruth's Chris and shooters on the intercostal and the 163rd street to thing in the intercostal mall actually in North Miami Beach called 949-9701.

[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.700]
And be sure and mention my name for a half price special at Paul's hair and nails.

[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:53.700]
And 147 maybe a Steve Ziegler is going to go over there and get his cut. 147 at WIOD.

[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:59.920]
Paul is here and although leaves don't fall at Zin Mazda, prices do.

[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:07.260]
Prices are falling at Zin Mazda, a brand new 1991 Mazda B2200 LE pickup loaded.

[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.700]
Includes AC, Claude Seed's Chrome wheels and more just 79.95.

[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:21.140]
It's Fall Savings at Zin Mazda, a new 1992 Mazda 3.23 with AC, only 79.95.

[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.560]
And check out the sleek stylish 91 Mazda Miata.

[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.160]
Fall price at just 12.95.

[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.760]
Test drive, the new MX3 sports coupe.

[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.420]
Fall price at Zin Mazda. Test drive, the new 929 luxury sedan.

[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.560]
Fall price at Zin Mazda.

[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:42.320]
What's more, all Mazda's carry the Zin Mazda 3.50,000 mile warranty.

[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.860]
And if the car you want at the price we advertise isn't it stock?

[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.200]
You'll get the same deal when it comes in.

[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:53.940]
It's Fall Savings at Zin Mazda, 1810.60 i8 five minutes out of the falls.

[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.520]
Okay, you're in next. This is this game, our edition number 25.

[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.340]
Whenever you're ready.

[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.240]
Hey everybody!

[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.420]
The ship between the local sports riders and sports casters and the dolphin coaches and players.

[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.200]
It disqualifies them as unbiased broadcasters on television.

[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.060]
No objectivity whatsoever.

[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.640]
That's my point on that score.

[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.440]
Now for Tim Robbie, if he ever gets wind of this and out over to Chris Christ's mind,

[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:23.000]
if he could either get Don Schulat either resign or fire him or request that he resign,

[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:30.000]
not as a general manager, just as a coach, and then trade Marino Smith in a few more overexpensive players.

[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.020]
Here's trade Marino.

[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.200]
Now hear me out, Neil.

[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.000]
Hear me out.

[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:40.460]
Trade Marino Smith and a few guys who haven't produced to the other people don't have to do it.

[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.060]
No, wait a minute.

[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:41.720]
I'm listening.

[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:50.480]
Okay, but use that money that he's going to save by these changes to go into a rebuilding program.

[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.020]
I think the Fancy tolerate.

[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.820]
Oh no, rebuilding.

[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:54.620]

[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.620]
Let's face it.

[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.080]
How long has it been since we've been really close to a super ball here?

[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.360]
Wait a minute.

[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.080]
Let me say this to you with all fairness.

[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:04.540]
Okay.

[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:10.040]
As media ochre as the offense has been with all the injuries we've had, with all of the Marino have it on off here.

[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:15.680]
In spite of all of that, we are two series away from being five and three.

[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.880]
First in goal on the three at Detroit, we blew that series and then get the ball in.

[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.200]
And then one play yesterday at the goal line.

[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.420]
Were that much away from being five and three?

[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.440]
Well, like I say, I have to say.

[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.700]
So the idea that we don't have the talent there, we have to just like dump everybody out and start rebuilding.

[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.860]
I think it's ridiculous.

[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.060]
Well, like I say, I don't profess to be a professional fan or a coach or I mean I'm just a frustrated fan as what I am.

[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:43.380]
And I'm trying to look for ways that maybe we could get some semblance of a contender going on.

[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.020]
But you want to throw the baby out with a huggy's blanket and that's not the way to do it, Steve.

[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.920]
Well, like I said, I don't know.

[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.220]
I think I can make it out there and oh, I heard about it.

[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.460]
The little babies crawling on their hands and knees about two inches at a time.

[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.320]
Well, they're Pennywise.

[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.520]
Well, I will say one of the babies looked pretty ugly.

[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.040]
Might have brought that kid in for that one play, you know what?

[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.260]
Just scrap that ball to his chest.

[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.140]
Well, like I said, maybe I'm Pennywise and pound foolish, but that's my observation.

[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.960]
Well, you've always been thrifty, Steve. Make no mistake about it.

[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.140]
Okay, never great day.

[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:12.740]
He's too nearby.

[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.220]
127 at WIOD. He's a good guy, just a little cheap.

[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:17.380]
Jupiter.

[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.160]
Neil.

[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:19.860]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.380]
How you doing?

[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.320]
I'm doing okay.

[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.520]
That baby race would have been okay if we would have had a little wadering on it, maybe if I could.

[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.240]
There you go, wait.

[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.480]
Did that numbers on the back?

[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:26.820]

[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.160]
Numbers on the back.

[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.160]
It's just good.

[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.620]
Went on the whole halftime.

[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.680]
We got little kids crying.

[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.220]
And not only were they not crawling, they weren't even moving.

[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.580]
That was the worst part of it.

[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.640]
The mothers kept, come on, come on, come on.

[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.280]
And they wouldn't even move off the line.

[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.160]
That was bad.

[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.320]
That was really bad.

[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.360]
Well, anyway.

[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.220]
It was a woman of things to come later.

[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:44.800]
Yeah.

[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.120]
I'm a Washington fan.

[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.520]
I don't want to rub it in anybody's face.

[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:48.960]
Okay.

[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.140]
We won't talk about Ernest Biner or John Bonner.

[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.140]
That's right.

[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.000]
That's right.

[00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:00.100]
But my point is that if this guy played in Washington, I don't think he would have made it out of the stadium.

[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.720]
I mean, much less just chanting.

[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.180]
Yeah.

[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.240]
These people are really sad.

[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.080]
They're vocal.

[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.340]
Oh my God.

[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:07.800]
Yeah, I don't understand.

[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.120]
I mean, the guy just totally, I just don't understand these people on the earth.

[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.340]
But all the way on this station, you got to understand there's no objectivity at all, like so many of the callers have said.

[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:23.540]
You'd be know with guys who are like personal friends and the virtual shules for anything that goes on and they have no credibility.

[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.280]
Mm-hmm.

[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.260]
None.

[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.340]
Well, there was one other comment I wanted to make.

[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.500]
I've gone to a couple of golfing games.

[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.220]
I've been down here about a year now.

[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.280]
And there's a big difference between the Orange Bowl and Joe Robbie.

[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.020]
I'm not patting Tim Robbie or Joe Robbie on the back by any means.

[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:50.220]
But I would rather, so I think I spent $22 for an Orange Bowl ticket and $28 for this ticket that's...

[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:50.320]
Right.

[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.080]
Both were in the In-Zone cheap seats.

[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:58.640]
But I would have rather seen that pathetic game yesterday than see the great hurricane in that stadium.

[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:03.060]
You know what the fascinates me to show you what a bunch of phonies so many people are in this town.

[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:09.060]
The Orange Bowl, all I ever do, was... they used to bitch about it and scream and there were no toilets in the sewage.

[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.840]
I mean, everything was a dump and it still is a dump.

[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.820]
And the people used to belly-ache and carry on.

[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.520]
And man, we don't want to come in the Orange Bowl.

[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:25.760]
And now that we've got one of the finest facilities anywhere in the world, they talk about, oh, Jesus, I enjoy those hurricane games so much better.

[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.920]
Sure they do because they win every goddamn home game.

[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.560]
They play all these girls' schools and they want a 40 or 41 in a row at home.

[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.500]
So they enjoy it all when the girls' schools come in.

[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.640]
Only half the seats are filled in the Orange Bowl.

[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.060]
The Orange Bowl is a dump. It always was a dump.

[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.760]
And anybody who wants to make a story for the Orange Bowl, how it has...

[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.700]
And that's another thing.

[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.580]
They talk about the Orange Bowl has more character. There's a different atmosphere.

[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.680]
Well, the atmosphere is only created by the people who are in there.

[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.060]
Exactly.

[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.340]
The things that the ones who make the atmosphere...

[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:53.840]
That's right.

[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.120]
...what kind of crap is that?

[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:55.640]
That's right.

[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.880]
I would have much rather been at Robby Stadium.

[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.320]
I mean, I took my wife yesterday and she was at the Orange Bowl game that I went to.

[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.360]
I think they played Houston.

[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:08.600]
And it was kind of a blowout, but this game yesterday as sloppy as it was...

[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.740]
I mean, anybody to pay 19 bucks to go watch the University of Miami beat up on a girl's school.

[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.640]
I mean, they must have, you know, nothing else to do.

[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.180]
Must be boring and they have no life.

[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.300]
That was my point.

[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.420]
Which is why they have 40,000 people.

[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.300]
They're okay, have a good one.

[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:21.980]
Okay, you too.

[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:22.380]
So, yeah.

[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.240]
Oh, we have another somewhat celebrity on the phone now.

[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:32.200]
What has baseball come to when you can just yank the guy off the base and tag him out?

[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.720]
It's come to the three blind mice.

[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.560]
I'll tell you something.

[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.580]
Like, if you slide into second, who's to say the shortstop's not going to come over there?

[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.480]
Kick your ass.

[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.960]
Throw you off the base and tag you out.

[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.300]
I mean, this is getting out of hand.

[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.080]
Well, maybe that maybe we need a little more physical activity in baseball.

[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.180]
Maybe the people who are more, you know, in a hockey and football would enjoy it better.

[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.580]
We have a little more history on it.

[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.220]
A little more physical contact kicking and playing a little more grab ass.

[00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:00.580]
When you talk about covering up for your own, did you hear that umpire up in the stands talking about,

[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.120]
oh, well, he didn't have possession of the bag and all this.

[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.800]
Yeah, we're out.

[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.600]
Possessed this.

[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:12.540]
I mean, Tommy LaSorta was like, even his comments, I mean, did you take a look at Tommy's face?

[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:18.000]
I mean, his eyes were popping out of his head for crying out loud.

[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:18.980]
He couldn't believe it.

[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.580]
As far as Sammy Smith goes.

[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.580]
The guy is although he didn't play like it.

[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.980]
He's a professional ball player.

[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.000]
He gets paid.

[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.000]
I think that he should expect the criticism.

[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:38.380]
And I think he's, if you probably talk to him, he say, hey, man, you know, I mean, he probably doesn't know what he's saying.

[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.940]
I don't know what he's saying, but the guy's getting paid millions of dollars to go out there and perform.

[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:47.940]
I mean, that's business about how he's got feelings and he was hurt and he was crying and like, hey, that goes with the territory.

[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.400]
That's part of what it's all about.

[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.320]
If you can't, I mean, we don't need to call him a man.

[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.380]
I'm not going to call him a defendant.

[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:53.720]
I'm not going to get paid.

[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.620]
What about the childish crap with a Zagaki and Mandage and all these other guys?

[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.400]
Just juanile.

[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.100]
About out of control.

[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:00.540]
Yeah.

[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:04.560]
But you know, it comes with a territory you got to expect it when you have a bad game.

[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.140]
You're going to get some abuse.

[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.880]
And if he wants to stick up for himself, he can prove it next game.

[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.080]
Right.

[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.980]
And not only that, but let me say this to you.

[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.740]
The first quarter they were all chanting because he wasn't getting anything done on the ground.

[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.120]
We want higs.

[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:17.700]
We want higs.

[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:24.200]
And the fact is that in the fourth quarter when he was getting some good running plays off and making five yards, eclipse, seven yards,

[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.560]
the people were enthusiastic.

[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.380]
Nobody in that crowd who's a dolphin fan wants to see Sammy do bad.

[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:30.900]
See that?

[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:31.880]
That's the point.

[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:36.820]
In other words, if he'd go out there the next game and run for 150 yards, people would be ecstatic.

[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.940]
But the fact is that he doesn't get the job done and people have just had it.

[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.440]
Do you remember when nobody is rooting against him?

[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:49.640]
And you'd get that idea by listening to Manage and these other guys that the people are just making impossible for him to be voting.

[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:50.860]
They run him to do well.

[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.220]
They want us to score some points.

[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.080]
They want to win.

[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.880]
That's what professional sports is all about.

[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.640]
Do you remember when Shwadeys mishandled a punt?

[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.940]
And then they put him right back in there next play?

[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.200]
For next time he was going to take a punt and he mishandled it again.

[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:04.740]
I sure do.

[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.400]
And that's basically what we have happening here.

[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.460]
I mean, I understand trying to rebuild somebody's confidence.

[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.060]
Not when a game is underlying.

[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.580]
Not when there's three and a half minutes left in the game.

[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.120]
It's not time for confidence building.

[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.520]
It's time to score that touchdown, stick it in the end zone and win the game.

[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.580]
I think we're about confidence next time.

[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.900]
The Higgs probably would have hit his head on the goalpost if they let him take it.

[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.820]
But you know what I'd like to see?

[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.480]
I'd like to see him go straight through the goddamn line instead of over and just for laughs.

[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.640]
Yeah, that would be nice.

[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.700]
When they opened up a hole there, you could have driven a Mack truck through by the way.

[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.140]
But nobody talks about that.

[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:36.900]
Have a great day.

[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:38.380]
134.

[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:44.100]
At WIOD, I understand we'll get this out of our system today and then we'll just forget about it.

[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.140]
We got to buy next week.

[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:45.940]
We got no game.

[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.400]
We just talk about the lottery because I'm going to win it.

[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.320]
Nobody is called to give me the information on I-95.

[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.040]
I mean, that's important stuff.

[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:59.500]
People that are like half the drive and have to commute every day would like to have some idea what the hell's going on.

[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.020]
Does anybody know?

[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.200]
Did we get any call on that?

[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.300]
George?

[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.120]
No?

[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.260]
That's probably because nobody knows.

[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.340]
Except the DOT.

[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.860]
We think the people at the DOT, by the way, make us nauseous and they suck.

[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.780]
Anyway, if your dog food sucks,

[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:28.060]
if you just keep trying one different brand after another and your dog keeps sticking his nose up in the air and takes a little bite and says,

[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:28.820]
I forget this.

[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.320]
Are you kidding?

[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.720]
How about trying something that evidently the dogs must love the taste of because my dogs are going nuts over it?

[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.520]
Twenty-two-two at W.I.O.D., North Bay Village.

[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.640]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.180]
Okay.

[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.560]
Neil, a little history on Sammy Smith.

[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.940]
Okay. His junior year of college,

[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.380]
he played the University of Miami up in Tallahassee.

[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.240]
Florida State has the lead.

[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.500]
He fumbles it.

[00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.380]
Miami takes the ball and Michael Irving scores a touchdown. Miami wins the game.

[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.220]
Oh!

[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.660]
Last year,

[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.340]
I went to Patriots game here on the Thursday night.

[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.920]
Burrito drives him down to field, throws a beautiful pass, Clayton,

[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.480]
who stresses outboarding catches it on the one.

[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.860]
Give it to Sammy.

[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.740]
He fumbles it.

[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.220]
Last week, you saw what happened.

[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.820]
And yesterday, this is another great...

[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:24.500]
Another chapter.

[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.580]
Yeah, you know.

[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.060]
The thing that gets me is that, you know,

[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.680]
he puts them in there again after what happened last week.

[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:38.680]
I look at opening day and see Mark Kiggs jump from the like a four-yard line into the end.

[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.500]
Right, right.

[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.440]
You know, the calls that he's been making,

[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.160]
Shula's been making this year isn't bad.

[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:44.900]
They're unpredictable.

[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.060]
I was sitting in the stands with my friends.

[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.780]
And I could...

[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:53.200]
You know, we were there saying before the ball was either snapped or the dolphins were going to do offensively.

[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.720]
You know, it's getting prondest.

[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:56.240]
Right.

[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.060]
It's very bad.

[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:57.700]
Totally predicted.

[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.580]
And then, you know, we're not going to win another game.

[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.080]
At least we got the two draft picks, but, you know,

[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.300]
it would be nice to see them be competitive for once.

[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.940]
Well, they were competitive yesterday.

[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.620]
I mean, Houston's stuck to join out.

[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.900]
Houston is a lousy...

[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.500]
Houston is a lousy road team,

[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.380]
and they lived up to their billing by being played a lousy game yesterday.

[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.140]
Our defense played well very well.

[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.720]
And we should have won a ball game.

[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.780]
Yep. We should have won.

[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.640]
Not a question not being competitive yesterday.

[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.020]
It's a... or even a line game.

[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.520]
I mean, we're a much better team than a line.

[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.720]
And then we were competitive, but we just blew the big play.

[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.860]
You know, nothing.

[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:35.560]
When Higgs was in there, you know, he only gained, I believe, was 13 yards.

[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.680]
In five curries, yeah.

[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.820]
Yeah. But in those five curries, he showed me a lot more than Sammy Smith did all day.

[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.400]
Well, the first two, I mean, he had absolutely nowhere to go.

[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.960]
And, you know, nobody would have gotten any yardage out of it.

[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.940]
It was like Sammy in the first quarter, but then he started...

[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.320]
They started opening some little holes, and he made the extra effort.

[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.680]
And got, you know, makes a three or four yard gain out of what could have been a loss.

[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.700]
And they never gave him a chance.

[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.020]
I mean, he curries the ball five times.

[00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.200]
We come out for the second half.

[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.860]
And at the beginning of the second half, everything was Sammy.

[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.320]
It was like all Sammy offense.

[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.080]
And I don't know what the hell is Shuva thinking about.

[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:06.720]
I really don't.

[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.520]
But of course, in this town, you're not supposed to criticize him,

[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.480]
because we keep living in the past, and you can't do that.

[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.840]
And another thing.

[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.680]
You know, he keeps bringing back all these players, like Paul Langford and all these guys, you know, and, you know, he always...

[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.200]
Well, let me ask you something.

[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.220]
How is it possible?

[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:23.620]
I mean, no, we've had all these injuries.

[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:28.660]
But how is it possible that he actually took Brian Soche back and put him on a squad

[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.780]
and then after a week or two of total ineptitude had a cut him again?

[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:32.620]
How is that possible?

[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.420]
I don't know.

[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.160]
What are they thinking about?

[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.500]
You know, and another one that doesn't have any balls is that Tony Martin.

[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:45.780]
I mean, just last week he proved it when he caught that big pass right before the half.

[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.660]
They ended up in the one.

[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:48.120]
Yeah.

[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.720]
If you looked at the instant replay, real close, if you look at that instant replay,

[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.980]
he was more worried about getting hit and scoring an end.

[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.200]
Well, Tony's the main thing is no catch at the ball.

[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:58.960]
That's the main thing.

[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.860]
Yeah, and if that was Clayton behind that, that would have caught that pass.

[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.120]
It would have been six points.

[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:04.460]
Yeah.

[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:13.280]
But, you know, just, you know, Sammy Sucks, and I want to call my friend BD who's a Florida State...

[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.200]
142.

[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.160]
What's all that Knaqin going on next door there now all of a sudden?

[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.280]
Man, sounds like the world is coming to an end.

[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.360]
They have another fistfight in production again?

[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:29.560]
Or did Wendy Bennett read more than four lines from her three by a five card on the coast

[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.880]
and is taking a beating from Fleetwood Mac Groover?

[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.220]
Something's going on next door.

[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:33.920]
They're going nuts.

[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:35.320]
Hollywood.

[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:36.860]
Hi, Neil.

[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:43.480]
First time caller, long time listener, two out of all the stations you have changed in South Florida.

[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:43.920]
Yes.

[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.200]
I'm a former soccer fan.

[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.160]
I adopt a football now.

[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.880]
Let me tell you, they complaining about Boeing.

[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.100]
That's for children.

[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.020]
That's for ladies.

[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.520]
In Europe.

[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.100]
In Europe they go out there and kill each other, right?

[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.600]
Italy is not as bad as Scotland or Germany or other countries, right?

[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:06.000]

[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.120]
You know what they do?

[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.260]
They're real friends.

[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:13.220]
I mean, professional friends that they mortgage their home to go see a game, you know.

[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:13.240]

[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.300]
And then they get killed.

[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.000]
I went to see that USA playing it, the World Cup, you know.

[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.580]
I pay $45.00 at the last row.

[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.400]
I almost touched the sky, you know.

[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.740]
I need a binocular to see it.

[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:25.020]
Right.

[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.220]
So over here they complain $26.28.

[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.040]
That's a bag of peanuts.

[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:30.540]
Right.

[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.040]
That's a couple of bags of peanuts.

[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.020]
There's also 36 bucks now that you mentioned.

[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.260]
Well, anyway, the real friends, you know, they don't boo.

[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.140]
They wait on the street corner.

[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.220]
I mean it.

[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.400]
I'm done with myself.

[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.180]
With basketball of Rocky tomatoes.

[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.140]
There you go.

[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.900]
Now, these are the mile one.

[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.840]
Then if they get to out that heavy big rocks, you know.

[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:56.700]
Many, many players are known to be to be sent to the hospital, you know.

[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.640]
Throughout the years, you know.

[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.440]
Well, that'll teach him.

[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.000]
Yeah.

[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.640]
Okay, you have a great day, sir.

[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.300]
Thank you.

[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:03.720]
I'll read it there.

[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.680]
Now, what the hell is this?

[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.500]
Susie's got a new bunch of rock comedy CDs.

[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.080]
The size of my never-st in here.

[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.260]
Where the hell are all those coming from?

[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.040]
You've been holding back on us, I think.

[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.300]
Just knock that TV off the edge there anyway.

[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:23.460]
By the way, whatever happens, speaking of wasting money, you know, that thing with the key and the whole bit when the TV set.

[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.220]
No, I understand that, but you talk about wasting money.

[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.620]
Oh, man, this is what a joke.

[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.540]
What a joke.

[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:32.700]
Right.

[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.500]
Here's a payphone in Palm Bay.

[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.100]
Now, yes, sir.

[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.120]
I'm feeling sick.

[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:39.320]
Give it.

[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.600]
Hey, I got to go to the next day.

[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.800]
Thank you. I feel better now.

[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.160]
Okay.

[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:44.700]
Okay.

[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.760]
I wanted to tell you the new solution there for Sammy.

[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:48.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.120]
Okay.

[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.400]
This is the deal I've been talking about over with the offense.

[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.280]
The offensive line there.

[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.480]
We've all been watching that.

[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.500]
Maybe the longest yard.

[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:56.500]
Yeah.

[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.260]
With Bert Reynolds.

[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:57.740]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:01.340]
I remember when the offense decided they'd take care of that defensive line.

[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.120]
We're going to put Sammy over on the defensive practice tomorrow.

[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.720]
And we're going to open up the line and let him come in and catch that ball right down there.

[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:10.700]
Yeah.

[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:12.120]
Right down there.

[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:17.160]
I'm just a little distracted because it sounds like they're having World War III next door here on the other side of the wall.

[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.760]
What the hell has been going on over there?

[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.800]
145 at WIOD, a mobile and sunrise.

[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:22.320]
Now.

[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:22.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:24.320]

[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:30.920]
Hey, listen, you know, unfortunately, the sad thing about it, I think Shoe was going to end up winding up like Tom Landry.

[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.220]
Great coach in his day.

[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:33.940]
Well, respect.

[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.540]
No, it doesn't know when to hang it up.

[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.180]
Doesn't know when the game is passed him by.

[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.000]
You know, and that's the sad commentary, but he's going to wind up the same damn way.

[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.640]
We could make a song for Don sometimes.

[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.540]
I feel the game is passing me by.

[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.340]
Well, like I said, he's a great coach.

[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:49.700]
Right.

[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.260]
No question.

[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:50.780]
Was.

[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:51.540]
Was.

[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:51.600]
Was.

[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:52.340]
Is this the thing?

[00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:00.160]
And he needs to retire and play golf and go fishing and back on what he can treat me.

[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:00.620]
Exactly.

[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.760]
And have a great life.

[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.240]
That's it.

[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:02.880]
Okay.

[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:03.560]
All right, thanks.

[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.220]
Is Mitch Lewis going to change the life next to it at production studio or what?

[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.300]
Man, we haven't had that in a long time.

[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.440]
Well, he probably wants that to the ambiance of just an all around great day.

[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.280]
I see Adam is in here with a big speed speed even grin.

[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.560]
Davey.

[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.560]
I know.

[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:23.260]
How you doing?

[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.500]
Has anybody given the bill washed fire?
