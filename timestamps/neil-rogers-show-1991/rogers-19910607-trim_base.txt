I am just in shock

[00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:06.830]
We have an open line of date County listen you can be another one of the dead heads that they got nothing to say man

[00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:12.010]
They have no material you can't complain about their material today because they don't have any none

[00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.670]
Zipini doda

[00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.930]
God almighty. I had a fact this morning and I forgot to mention it for obvious reasons

[00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:26.250]
From a lady in deer field who says please talk about the Bufo frogs and tiny some more

[00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:32.690]
Too bad you can't keep the set cat sound sustained like you can with CDs you make my life great from 10 to 2 lady in deer field beach

[00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:38.310]
I think she's right. We ought to talk a lot more about frogs and tiny or tiny frogs or tiny bubbles or something

[00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:43.670]
Man oh man. I mean just absolutely. I'm ready to fall asleep from these calls

[00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:54.570]

[00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.190]
Yep, I want you to elect me

[00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.150]
I'll grab your cross

[00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.350]
Like a panicked Kennedy

[00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.570]
I might not use a cues

[00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:10.730]
The bisexual the foul play my dad's white girl drunk across three lanes of the expressway

[00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.450]
Well the cops would cost up to anybody else

[00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.730]
When I get a trouble, but I use my well

[00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.150]
And I don't care about

[00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.950]
Anybody else. Oh no

[00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.350]
I'm back to the fridge now senator

[00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.390]
Now bridge up for somebody say bridge

[00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.110]
You're the one that keeps making power

[00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:37.590]
Hey even though I misuse my ties

[00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:42.210]

[00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.410]

[00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.650]
Well the cops would defust anybody else

[00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:54.450]
When I get in trouble left it I use my well

It's good to see you again. That's how was your family. Let me write you a personal check right now

[00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:14.850]
Appreciate that it was a quiet death a family weekend. Anyone see my handsome

[00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.730]
What I do with that card. He said there's another cut on it. It's almost intelligible

[00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:22.650]
Hi

[00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.270]

[00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.870]
Because I got an important stuff to tell you I got spyry

[00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.730]
Well, why didn't you do that when you were on the phone?

[00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:46.150]
You rush me. You rush me. No, I did not rush you you said put me on hold so I can hear what's going on

[00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.290]
Well, that was good. I enjoyed that

[00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:51.330]
Yeah

[00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:55.350]
The news coming up or no we don't have the news coming up. We got 80,000 other callers waiting

[00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.490]
I'm lying. We're going to get the well. How did we find one pretty soon?

[00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:05.290]
Hey, well you figure out 80,000 is at least three good. Come on. Come on get to it. Okay already already

[00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:13.250]
I was up here and I went over to Washington DC. Yeah, and I went by the museum the Smithsonian and they had this

[00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:20.150]
Display where you can put up messages. Yeah, and what message had somebody put up right on there in the Smithsonian

[00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:26.350]
How many you want me to make a guess? No, I don't think you get it. No, I think I will wait a minute. Let me just just second

[00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:33.070]
Sometimes I got to find a right okay. Here's my guess. Are you ready? Sure

[00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:38.270]
Okay, here it is. I'm dying over here. That was close. What is it?

[00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.530]
Bloodload really can you believe that in the sure I can do it. That's our crowd

[00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:49.730]
But that's just like a DC spy report. Okay. Have a great life. Hey, don't forget Dave is a douchebag later

[00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.850]
Oh, man. Don't put any more out of town calls on or any in town calls

[00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.410]
1141 only shipped to shores

[00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:03.870]
655 W.I.D. got a heavy heavy box. This must be the cigars from Alam constantly sucking around Goldstein

[00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.990]
What does he want? What does he want?

[00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:12.190]
He's starting to get out my nerves now. He's a good guy and all of that. He's fat. Not as bad as he used to be but he's just

[00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:19.790]
Oh, man such a chronic and he's got rick and suds over at the house and Steve arena over at the house. He just

[00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:26.270]
Got more money than God. I just don't think he knows how to enjoy it now that they took his Cheerios away from him

[00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:34.030]
I don't even want good cigars. I like cheap cigars that you hack and cough and choke and get the deadly diseases from

[00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:40.890]
Oh, man. Look at this George is excited about it because he's he's pretty he's in a crappy mood today's gonna be at a six o'clock

[00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:47.350]
You don't have to be here Marvin's working Alex. Oh Alex's working boy. He'll screw that you up good

[00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:54.350]
At a boy Alex. I'll give you all the information out of doing 1151 at W.I.D. for the good news and the bad news about Al Goldstein cigars

[00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:59.230]
The good news is there's this huge box. I've never seen a cigar box this big 75

[00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.990]
Dunhill aids cigars from the Dominican Republic the bad news is

[00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:10.610]
It's like smoking the arm of a wooden antique chair. I mean they just absolutely

[00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.930]
dry and tasteless so when it says aids cigars

[00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:20.010]
I wonder what century they were from and where they were aged and ever and not in addition to that

[00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.270]
Of course, you got a poke a little hole in the end before you start puffing on them too

[00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:28.550]
Well boy Al thank you so much, but these are just tasteless bland

[00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.250]
And you got to suck on them so hard. It's like it's like smoking

[00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:35.970]
Parliaments or parliament lights

[00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.790]
God

[00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:46.330]
Hmm, these are the I hate to say it because is that tacky to do that if somebody sends you a gift and you said really sucks

[00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:53.030]
But see when somebody is sucking around big time like that if you could I would have much rather had like a

[00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.570]
dozen good ones, you know what I'm saying then 7000

[00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:02.390]
Wait, I want you to try one of these and see if it's just me. I mean these I've got if these aren't the worst

[00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.470]
I'd rather have some old Dutch masters right out of

[00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.870]
Accords that have been sitting there for two years. They're like a brick. I'd rather have that these are

[00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:13.730]
Sorry, oh, you're still a great guy, but your taste in cigars is a week

[00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.910]
Oh, we have a fake old lady in Pembroke pines

[00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:22.410]
Hello, hello, Neil. Yes, it's me. Yo, I'm uh, it's who I'm a brown boy

[00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:31.130]
You know me. Uh-huh. Yeah, I have my FCC license in my right hand. What should I do with it? Yeah stick it in your left hand and put it where the moon don't shine

[00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:39.210]
Okay, we usually don't make requests from inside the building, but we had a special dedication

[00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.530]
No, this is for you honey

[00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.690]
That lunch dog without all cutting

[00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:46.770]
Oh

[00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.170]
Well, I was driving down 95 the other night

[00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.510]
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road

[00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.590]
I decided wasn't going to do any good to get mad

[00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.130]
So I wrote a song about him instead

[00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.430]
It goes like this

[00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:13.690]
We're in asshole or did you work it your whole life

[00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.590]
Either way

[00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:21.690]
Because you're an asshole tonight

[00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:31.730]
Yes, you're an a ss. So Ellie and don't you try to blame it on me

[00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:39.870]
You these are all the credit you're an asshole tonight

[00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.230]
You're an asshole yesterday

[00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.930]
You're an asshole tonight

[00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:58.370]
I've got a feeling you'll be an asshole the rest of your life

[00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.210]
Oh

[00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.530]
That was talking to your mother

[00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.370]
Just the other night

[00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:50.410]
I told her I thought you were an asshole she said yes, I think you're right

[00:24:54.030 --> 00:25:00.690]
And all your friends are assholes because you know that your whole life

[00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:08.650]
And somebody told me you've got an asshole for life

[00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.670]
I

[00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:14.230]
Oh

[00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:19.050]
Or did you work it your whole life

[00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.730]
Either way

[00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.790]
Because you're an ass

[00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.710]
Unbelieveable hold tonight

[00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:36.490]
Oh

[00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.390]
Okay, a little dedication for nildo who probably too busy eating to hear it

[00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:44.990]
It's 1209 at WIO day and I just don't understand anything now you haven't lit up that cigar yet

[00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:46.850]
Get with it

[00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:51.710]
Get with it. I want the world to realize that I'm not just trying to be a heart ace here or ungrateful

[00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:57.730]
I mean if these were even mildly interesting amusing or useful for something

[00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.110]
I guess they are if you have an elephant

[00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:04.070]
But boy these are just horrendous Al

[00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:09.170]
Hollywood hello, yes sir. Hey Neil. Yeah, I

[00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:16.350]
I used to listen to you in high school and now I'm at gamesville yeah, I'm down for the summer and I wouldn't go back anytime soon

[00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:20.650]
Yeah, I know this is it's crazy up there. Yeah, they thought they had a guy and

[00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.130]
Obviously if someone else is crazy too, but

[00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:28.770]
Or there or there's more than one. Yeah, yeah, I wanted to ask you a question

[00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:35.870]
I used to listen you had this guy on the bird. Oh history. Yeah. Yeah. I was wondering what happened to him. He laid a gigantic egg, sir

[00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.870]
Okay, yeah, we sent him off to El Cali's working at the you float him

[00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:48.910]
Yeah, but you know the good news though what because this will probably ring a bell inside your body when you hear this even though the body is gone

[00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.930]
Wait a minute the mammary lingers on

[00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.170]
Feel better now. Yeah, Tim. Yeah, that's it

[00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:03.610]
Yeah, there you go. I want to ask you another question. I was driving up the school. Just pull a questions today a little inquisitive

[00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:09.250]
A calling that's good. We like that. We like people who are inquisitive. Yeah, I'm in college still my brain still works still learning something or

[00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:15.830]
alleged. Yeah, well I was uh turn it up the volume yesterday and I'm accidentally pushed the scan button and it went to

[00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:22.830]
640 on the dial which is it's like W bigot or something. I couldn't believe it. I thought it was like one of your little

[00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.130]
bits, you know, it was this guy going

[00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.370]
This man has been afflicted with this homosexual

[00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:34.570]
Anti-Christian scourge or something like that. I couldn't believe it and then then I said wait this guy's trying to raise money for this

[00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.530]
And do you know anything about that? No really? Where can I contribute?

[00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.330]
What a six 40. Yeah, it's like some

[00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.250]
Christian station and the guys like oh

[00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:51.550]
He was probably another one of those good Christians trying to help everyone along in life trying to drag them out of all of their problems

[00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:56.530]
And make them an offer they can't refuse or else that's great. Yeah, I think he's related to Jim Baker. Could be

[00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:57.290]
Yeah

[00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.850]
Yeah, um, one more one last question probably related to Joe McCarthy. Yes, sir

[00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:08.730]
Um, what do you think of Spike Lee? I mean that new jungle fever move that movie he just made uh is out now

[00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.990]
Not my cup of tea sir is the queen would say and not my cup of tea. Yeah to reach its own but not my thing

[00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.390]
You got your thing and I got my thing. You know how it goes

Well, listen have a great time and uh

[00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:23.430]
Just when you go back this fall go real slow, you know like one step at a time and then by the time you get there

[00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.770]
Maybe something will happen okay, okay hang in there sound kind of depressed and me

[00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:33.290]

[00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:09.650]
Assholes for justice

[00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.070]
Assholes for crime

[00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:14.610]
Assholes for assholes

[00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.990]
Assholes all time

[00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.730]
We got assholes making money

[00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.990]
They're making all the rules

[00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.530]
Taking all our jobs

[00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:40.250]
Feeling a far school assholes on the water assholes in the sky

[00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.450]
Sign the Central wanted only assholes need to fly

[00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.070]
Oh teach you won't you tell me

[00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.150]
I really made the grave

[00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:06.210]
My head my class or am I just another asshole on the grave

[00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:33.590]
Oh

[00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.990]
Assholes get the orders and assholes wrote a boat

[00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:41.850]
Assholes get elected because assholes get to float

[00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.650]
I once turned it firm that all that's all never died

[00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:50.910]
They just lay in bed and mouthed fly

[00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.610]
Assholes in the morning

[00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.070]
Assholes every night

[00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:00.750]
Assholes to land and assholes to the grave

[00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.430]
That's 20,000 assholes and assholes from the native

[00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.970]
Step aside good people let the assholes operate

[00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:22.130]
Okay

[00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:27.890]
Okay, like I said it sure feels some good time it was good for you was good for me 1248 at WIOD

[00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:31.350]
We lost some calls during that period of time, but you know something that's the brain now

[00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:38.970]
We're up to our long distance dedication and this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand

[00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:44.890]
Whether we have kids or pets or neither it's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio and here's what he writes

[00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:52.590]
Dear Casey this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere and it'll need a lot if you play it

[00:32:53.050 --> 00:33:00.690]
Recently there was a death in our family. He was a little dog named snuckles, but he was most certainly a part of let's come start again

[00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.130]
From coming out of the record play the record, okay

[00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.190]
Please

[00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:15.450]
You see when you come out of those uptempo damn numbers man is impossible to make those transitions

[00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.770]
And then you got to go into somebody dying

[00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.270]
You know they do this to me all the time. I don't know what the hell they do it for

[00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:25.850]
But damn it if we can't come out of a slow record. I don't understand it is down on the phone

[00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:34.650]
Okay, I want a damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a being uptempo record every time I do a damn deaf dedication

[00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:40.590]
Now make it and they also want to know what happened to the pictures. I was supposed to see this week

[00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:47.370]
It's a god last damn time. I want somebody use this in brain to not come out of a damn record

[00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:52.090]
That is that's up camp or I got to talk about a control dying

[00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:58.170]
Well, it's just in ponderous man ponderous and ponderous

[00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.850]
Well, I don't know about you but you sound like some stupid idiot

It's a one to two hour

[00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:35.470]
Oh

[00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:41.150]
Well, I'm the type of guy who will never settle down where pretty girls are

[00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.130]
Well, you know that I'm around

[00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:51.530]
I kiss a man. I love him first to be there all the same. I get so washed on him and I don't even know their names

[00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:58.450]
Because I'm a philanderer. Yes, a philanderer. I sleep around around around around around

[00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.410]
Well, my views are on the left. God of them born the right

[00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:07.510]
Only God will know where I'll be passing out tonight

[00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.570]
And if you want to ask me which girl I love the best

[00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:16.850]
I'll tear open my shirt cut mother rosy on my chest because I'm a philanderer

[00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:22.590]
Yes, a philanderer. I see for round around around around around

[00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.890]
Well, my bones been all around

[00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.510]
I put sharp and lots of flair

[00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.110]
And you know I've stood so many girls

[00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:39.230]
Did I make very hard look like some kind of a queer?

[00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:44.670]
We are the type of guy he likes to roam around

[00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.490]
I've never been one place

[00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:48.850]
I roam from town to town

[00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:52.530]
And when I find myself going for some girl

[00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:56.230]
I hop right in that car of mine and I take a poor world

[00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.530]
Desire of opportunity

[00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:59.890]
Yes, I'm the entity

[00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:03.610]
The cost is round and round and round and round and round

[00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.590]
What if he knows the old bridge tender?

[00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:12.170]
Think so

[00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:13.650]
It's a 108

[00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:18.310]
See it would have been a lot better if I was prepared but you know when your mind is starting to slow down

[00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:19.870]
I wonder if he knows the old bridge tender

[00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.830]
Stupid stupid stupid idiot

[00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:23.530]
See that would have been better but

[00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:28.550]
I just wasn't prepared. I'll write it's Friday. What the hell do you want six five five W.I.O.D

[00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:29.790]
There's an open line in Palm Beach

But they're all probably busy up there hanging around a compound waiting to see what kind of scandal we can stir up for this weekend

But that man is so terminal

[00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:54.050]
He could put all the Mexican jumping beans in Mexico to sleep in three seconds

[00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.470]
He was

[00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:59.370]
Terminal Blue Jaguar that way. Yeah, that's the guy used to call up with a beach weather report terminal

That's well. What's one of Joey's friend? It in Joey. He looked as disgusting as everything

Well the guy is something's wrong with him his body. It's just I don't know

[00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:10.310]
He's been dead for 20 years. Nobody bother to tell him when is he starting on super-surfed?

[00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:14.790]
Like a sandwich board telling everybody to be sure to listen. Yeah, he and boom boom together, right boy

[00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:19.990]
Yeah, that's true. He's alleged. Wow. Who knows? Yo, can I ask you to do me a big big big favor?

[00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.370]
It's not a request. It says

[00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:27.250]
suggestion no, it's not it's a request. Why don't you admit it? Okay, but it's good. I'm just been inundated

[00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:32.510]
I feel I feel like a like a squeezed out dish rag here. They like a limp sponge

[00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.510]
Okay, but I promise it's gonna be something different. I'm used and abused

[00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:41.350]
Okay, they'll have been had. Yes. It's the Alex Bennett Steve Kane altercation

[00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:44.350]
Do you have that? Oh

[00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:47.190]
God, and I'm just into a break now here

[00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:51.470]
I'm starting to see this is the time of the day. I started putting carts away

[00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:57.010]
I don't start yanking them out. I haven't heard that maybe six seven months. Well, I got it here for you

[00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:03.790]
Okay, I got it because you're so you sound so depressed and so despotted like you're gonna slit your wrist if I don't do it and

[00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.270]
Putt loads there butt mode back on you

[00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:13.610]
We'll do it eventually here in a second one while 121 and WIOD we have an open line in date at 751

[00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:18.250]
Joey is slim 751 WIOD, but first we'd like to tell you in fact

[00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:23.670]
You want to keep Joey out of your house or business get a great system from IDS and Trudor detection systems

[00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.250]
Inc. In fact, I think they got a special little chip they put in there

[00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:31.930]
And if Joey is like within 15 blocks in a direction the thing goes crazy and just starts screaming and carrying on

[00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:38.230]
It's a better you there. Yes, Mr. Kane. Hi. I wanted to explain express my displeasure

[00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:41.950]
It's uh you announcing over here. I've been killed in an auto action

[00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:48.230]
I have friends and family down there that were deeply upset and one would think that even a talk show host

[00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:52.470]
If your caliber would have more judgment than to do something like that not really now

[00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:57.130]
I was I got some wrong in which made it I was believed I got wrong information Steve

[00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:02.930]
He said it was only for you were believed but I speak to the an A3 as vain. I mean do you have any idea what it's like?

[00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.410]
I don't pull your watch show crap on these games

[00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:11.570]
Not get off. This is you know, not what are not coffee talk show crap

[00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.190]
This is a talk show crap

[00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:17.690]
What do you mean Mr. Bennett? I do not approve of this

[00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:18.170]
Hmm

[00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:21.150]
Well, I can only tell you that it's kind of a stupid thing

[00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:24.030]
No, no, no, because of the way you do the way you know you know you know why

[00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.490]
You know what I want to see?

[00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:32.230]
It was that tasteless way in which you begged me at the neutral system thing and not even knowing why I was very ill

[00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:33.770]
The referee in the same room

[00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:38.730]
I wonder what why I say when you ran out with some phoney story that you wouldn't be able to get

[00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:43.110]
Was no phone a crash or a traffic. Uh, no phoney story. They were having that

[00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.690]
That's that's a mile and a half a horrible art

[00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:50.370]
You know, I was gonna throw it on even though the paper appears that nobody could get to their house that day

[00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:54.750]
Huh what never mind anyway Alex, you know, I'm doing they count it

[00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:59.410]
I don't know the rules well on but to do something like that is really well, but don't back

[00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:02.770]
Well, don't back me when I'm not there. Don't talk behind my back

[00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:08.510]
Well, I don't know the beauty of telling in New York. You'll run it's trying screw me over Mr. Bennett

[00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.750]
You you don't need anybody to help you

[00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:12.290]
You don't need a little person

[00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:17.750]
But you know you can say whatever you want to say and you can talk behind my back

[00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.430]
We don't have more concern for the feelings of people

[00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:24.450]
Wonder you know, I have family in the air the decision like that you dumb jerk

[00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:29.890]
If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now. Take your goddamn teeth in

[00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:36.150]
127 by the way, I got some exciting news and we haven't even mentioned this yet. W.I.O.D. starting on Monday

[00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:41.670]
We're gonna be building repeater stations every 10 blocks to make sure that everybody can hear our signal

[00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:45.850]
So like we're starting up on the quarter of biscayne and 82nd

[00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:51.130]
And we're gonna have like a little tower on top of each roof like all the way up to um Jacksonville

[00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:55.730]
And then all the way down to Key West every 10 blocks just to make sure we can goose up our signal

[00:43:56.370 --> 00:44:02.910]
It's a 127 a W I O D. Alex is in a building did not get his hair cut and everybody is just a laugh in their ass off

[00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:07.010]

[00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:11.210]
West Palm Beach. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. How's it going? Okay

[00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:17.310]
First of all I gotta call Scott up there in West Palm. No, that's at the end. Uh, well. Where's the start off good?

[00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:20.570]
Okay, let's get it out of the way right off the bed. Scott's a douche kid. Okay

[00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:22.650]
That's a variation of it

[00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:27.710]
I'm amazing on cars. No so much about very little bit

[00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.850]
That's a bad boy thing. That's a surfer thing isn't it?

[00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:37.390]
Well wait a minute don't say that you know what that's like saying that's like my saying to you the president is George Bush isn't it

[00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:44.170]
Well, I mean pretty good when you when you first be rate the other callers for being dodo birds and then you say it's a surfer thing isn't it?

[00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:49.490]
Well, I thought you would know as well. I thought you was like what the hell do I know about that crap all I know is the more a boogie's

[00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:54.890]
Board spot. That's all I know about surfing. All right. Well, it is that's where it is. It's a surfer thing. Is it a surfer thing Alex?

[00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.750]
Bad boys

[00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:01.690]
He don't know, buddy. He's got a pony. Oh, Timber three. Yeah

[00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:02.790]
They did that song

[00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:07.030]
Future so bright. I got to wear shades a couple years back tonight. They did what?

[00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:11.710]
The future so bright. I got to wear shade beats me. I don't know anything

[00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:17.510]
Well, I'm trying to educate you a little bit. Oh, that's good. So we got the surfer thing and

[00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:20.510]
In that in our guys measure it. Okay

[00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:24.570]
And got your douche kid. Okay. All right. See you

[00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.870]
Wow

[00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:30.830]
129 all guys measure it. How about you Alex ever measure it?

[00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:34.550]
Not gay. You're so full of crap. Come on. Get out of here

[00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:39.370]
First thing he said when he came in this morning was take me to your ruler. Yeah, down to his ankle, huh

[00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:45.370]
Well, he just came from the bar. He went into Taiwan on we have an open line in Palm Beach

[00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.010]
559463. Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir

[00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:55.290]
How are you this day? I'm doing pretty well considering we only have 30 minutes and 46 seconds left out that I'm counting

[00:45:55.870 --> 00:46:00.730]
Well, I don't blame you. I wanted to bring up a subject concerning physicians and

[00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:05.130]
How they are investing in diagnostic centers that they

[00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:07.350]
buy stock in

[00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:15.590]
Then yeah, well, that's great. That's right up our alley and then send patients for diagnostic tests that aren't necessary

[00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:24.550]
As if they're not making enough money for the procedures. If you look at the cost of procedures in the United States versus Canada, they're almost tripled

[00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.990]
You

[00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:29.690]
So much. Yeah

[00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:33.490]
That's it, Neil. Thanks a lot

[00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:35.590]
Have a great life you too

[00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:41.490]
You too hate you too. That's gotta be the worst then he's the only guy. I know it likes you too the crappiest

[00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:43.490]
I was like a bagpipe music ba-ling

[00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:50.530]
It's horrible. You like you too? Yeah, even Alex don't like them and he that's right up his alley should be he hates him

[00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:51.390]
He's into like

[00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:57.730]
He likes a deaf leopard stuff like that real crap, you know, he's like a punk. It's a schmuck. He'll grow up someday

[00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:03.330]
Alex is gonna be running the board this afternoon by the way Marvin's out there doing it in the Georgia

[00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:08.270]
So George is in love with Alex today only because the George don't have to hang around he'll six o'clock

[00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:10.990]
He said thank God for Alex. He's been saying that all day

[00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:13.870]
We might even give you one of these great cigars to sit on

[00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:16.710]
130 at W.I.O.D. Hollywood

[00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:21.210]
Yeah, Neil how you doing? His eyes lit up like a Hanukkah bush when I said that. I'm doing okay

[00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:27.670]
What's going on in this town? I don't know here. All the even the losers are out of town as you can tell by these out of town

[00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:32.510]
Caused we've been getting everybody's left. It's like a ghost town. It's like a waste vast land

[00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:33.710]
Like the last little

[00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:38.030]
Fanny I had was like the escape go going down to the keys, you know

[00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:42.530]
It's the only place I get way way far as long as it's gone in this town

[00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:49.250]
And I just wanted to tell you I went down there last week, you know, I put the old fish in pole over the bridge

[00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:55.190]
Yeah

[00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:59.410]
Oh, listen, I got a better one than that even though that's just a joke. Let me tell you something

[00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:06.170]
Listen, listen to me the other Wednesday night. I listen to me. I'm listening. You got to clear it out now

[00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.990]
Well, yeah, okay, listen

[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:10.730]
I go to poppano to the track Wednesday night

[00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:16.490]
So I stop there's a um in a mirror first uh honor, you know 24 hour

[00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:20.690]
ATM thing there to get some cash out on the honor card. Yeah

[00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:24.690]
This is in poppano beach right across from the racetrack

[00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:31.750]
And you look on the thing and you put your card in and the first thing that comes up you want the transaction in English or Spanish

[00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.330]
This is in poppano beach, Florida

[00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.590]
But it's like it's like the other time

[00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.210]
That would be like going getting lost in Columbia, South Carolina is somewhere

[00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:46.270]
Going to a bank to an ATM to get a couple hundred bucks out to get your car towed away

[00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.650]
And the things as you wanted in English or Spanish

[00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:49.250]
I

[00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:55.930]
Think we've got a silent take over here in Georgian Alex are both smiling about it. I just I think they're in on it

[00:48:55.930 --> 00:49:02.510]
It's just inconceivable for me to realize that the keys are only 200 miles from here and there's such difference in life

[00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:04.750]
Yeah, it's just scary

[00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:12.130]
Well, sometimes I feel that life is passing us by you know what I mean

[00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:17.290]
Been passed that a lot time now. Okay. Take care. Oh, do we do have a y100 story?

[00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:21.210]
Absolutely. Well, thank god. It's just a publicity stunt

[00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:23.410]
There's nothing to it. Oh

[00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:32.030]
I want to tell you something I to me that is when I first heard it across the back of my mind

[00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:34.110]
And I thought nah that couldn't be yep

[00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:37.510]
They said they have to clean up their image or change their image and there's gonna be a big

[00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:39.370]
Add in sundays paper

[00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:47.550]
And they're doing this just a college entrance that is the lamest crap when any station is that desperate to pull a publicity stunt

[00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:48.390]
It's like when uh

[00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:53.950]
You know, they pull somebody off the air and then the audience is all calling in big. What did you hear about this Johnny dork?

[00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:54.750]
This is a mr

[00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.750]
Fowler junior on the phone with a report

[00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:02.210]
That the a y100 thing allegedly about the morning guys being the act off was just a publicity stunt

[00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:09.250]
All right, I'm gonna have a big thing. Yeah, and that oh man you to that is the lowest and and all they do is lose respect of the whole audience by

[00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:14.330]
Doing that I mean even the punk kids who listen to that thing are gonna be just barfing all over each other

[00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:18.350]
And everybody's calling up crying yesterday. Oh, no, no change. Don't listen

[00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:26.930]
Oh, man, why 100 is out. I want you to spread the word. That's perpetrating a hoax exactly. It's a hoax and a farce and

[00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:31.390]
The hell with them. Yeah, we're gonna send him all these cigars too. They deserve it

[00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:35.670]
Thank you, sir. You bet. Bye boy. One more thing. Yes

[00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:38.270]
Like to call Arnold Lambert a giant keeping

[00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.950]
festering douchebag, but then again, so would everybody else unbelievable

[00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:44.090]
Keep the pace see you

[00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:48.150]
Debbie Ellis look at that a monster in the Nashville. She's big at Asheville

[00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:53.150]
In fact when I first took that picture somebody said that to me and a male is an ad for WLAC

[00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:57.810]
Do you think and I thought she was wearing a momo and then I realized those with the sounds coming from the picture

[00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:02.150]
Do you think 50,000 Watts is enough for well? I don't know. I think she's sitting on each one of them

[00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:07.950]
Yeah, in fact the ad says she covers the Midwest and they're not talking about that signal either

[00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:16.290]
So it's a big hoax at Y100. It's just another big publicity stud another one of these phony baloney deals to get the audience

[00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.530]
whining and build up their sympathy and on

[00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:23.770]
Oh, that's that's the lowest. I mean there are a lot of that's even worse than contrived controversy

[00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:30.770]
That's just the worst kind of crap and to me it smells of desperation. Yeah, there's an aroma

[00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:33.890]
That shows no respect for your list. There's an aroma coming from

[00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:39.170]
100.7 out of my FM dial and says L stinko, which I think is the name of these cigars

[00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:46.450]
No snapple by the way. I think next week we better straighten the interact out you realize that because I'm getting as angry as you are and I'm not even a freeloader

[00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.470]
But
