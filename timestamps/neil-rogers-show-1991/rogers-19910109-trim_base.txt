[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980]
751 WIOD from day in Broward at 524 WIOD.

[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.640]
Palm Beach 655 WIOD.

[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.460]
And Bell South mobility customers make it a free call by dialing star IOD.

[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.300]
The opinions expressed by the guest-host are callers are not necessarily those of this nation.

[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.780]
Now here's Neil Rogers, a new doc radio assistant WIOD.

[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.420]
United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people.

[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.960]
Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator and with his aggression.

[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.500]
Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait, just the way it's going to be.

[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.100]
We like to be Adam who stays and hits him with a fight.

[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.500]
His target was his head and toes like a male and white to life.

[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.920]
He tried to steal away Kuwait and beat the OUG.

[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.180]
He called us to his head and blow away the G.

[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.740]
He wanted to be a child and he wanted to be a kid and play an apple jam.

[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.600]
I love life with him and I'll see you in the next video.

[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:30.940]
He's going to play Adam who stays and blow him away.

[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.420]
Well, is everybody happy that's all I want to know?

[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.140]
It's 10.07.

[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.880]
Wow.

[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.100]
What a miserable murky day.

[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.200]
I feel like Sherlock Holmes in How to the Bass Pee Rills.

[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.780]
Anyway, here we are.

[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.460]
Just one big happy family.

[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.620]
The book is out.

[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.800]
We did pretty well.

[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.100]
Can't complain here between the 10 and 2.

[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.020]
We did pretty damn well as a matter of fact.

[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.100]
In fact, usually when books come out in ratings, I want to dwell on those.

[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.540]
But from a year, instead of comparing to the last book, most people in the business,

[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.700]
including agencies, look at the last corresponding period of time.

[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.400]
In other words, from fall 89 to fall 90.

[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.840]
So fall 89, they show had a six.

[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.200]
Fall 90, we got a six three.

[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.800]
So I'm pretty happy about it.

[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.760]
I think the good demographics and the people are out there.

[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.540]
Naturally, we have to keep reminding them they have to have that fierce, rugged determination

[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.640]
at a loyal IOD listenership because if they don't, it turns into another one of these ethnic voting

[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.060]
for this station and voting for that.

[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.140]
And right away, all the ethnic stations have got like 90% shares and the rest of us have no audience.

[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.880]
Nobody cares.

[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.120]
And that's the thing you constantly have to work at at this market because otherwise you're like,

[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.440]
you could have like half the audience listening like we do right now.

[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.460]
And if they don't care enough to send in their very best, nobody finds out about it.

[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.040]
I know the reason we got half the audience look because this is basically when one talk host

[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.700]
and one show can be the format for an entire radio station, then you know everybody in the world

[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.800]
is listening to the show.

[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.960]
And I think it's kind of interesting, a concept all-neil all day.

[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.380]
I think that would be a great bumper sticker.

[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.580]
I mean, he's not on our station, but we talk about him all day because we know that he's like the crux of talk radio

[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.520]
in the market and has been for the last 15 years.

[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.980]
And so if we just talk about him all day long and taunt him and harass him and abuse him and compliment him,

[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.780]
just do a whole stick geared around Neil as they're doing over there on light bulb radio, then that's where it's at.

[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.600]
Now I did something this morning that I haven't done it a long time.

[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.360]
I called in on a talk show on another station. I haven't done that in years.

[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.420]
In fact, I haven't even been inspired to do it in years.

[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.120]
The reason I did it is because, well there's a multitude of reasons, market by the way is a 26 and a half points

[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.200]
as those meetings go on in the Middle East and they're hoping for the best.

[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.020]
So that's why the market's supple see what happens.

[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:10.360]
I did it because I feel embarrassed for people, one of whom is a friend of mine.

[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.860]
Okay, Norm can't say good friend of mine in addition to being my attorney.

[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.020]
And he's a good guy. He's got a heart of gold.

[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.340]
And he generally stands up for all of the things that I believe are right, you know, like freedom of speech and a first amendment, all of all of good stuff.

[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.920]
I told him this a couple days ago before he ever embarked upon this all-neil all day format that he's many loving kisses.

[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:39.580]
That he isn't in a possible situation. He gets in no way because he is part of the manipulated masses over there.

[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.140]
And no matter what happens, he's eventually got to come down on their side.

[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:54.520]
So anyway, I finished 10 minutes on the year within this morning in response to all of this Charles Peak, a K.A. Beto and Alice Randall, so this stuff.

[00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:03.120]
And at eight o'clock, like three seconds after his news came on and I had to say bye-bye, my phone rings, he's back on a phone.

[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:12.200]
And I'm, I'm excoriating him for the lack of balls in terms of just saying things on here that he knows aren't true, that he told me the opposite.

[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.160]
I've spoke to him about six times the last two days. The first time just tried to find out who this group was.

[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:27.320]
And let's go back. Mainly my hysteria this morning has nothing to do with Norm or Al or any of that situation that has to do with Pompano Park, where I was last night.

[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.980]
And I'm not beginning to realize the reason when I had my stroke back in April, it was after a very depressing, frustrating evening.

[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.280]
Not a night I lost a lot of money. I didn't lose a lot of money last night.

[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.020]
And Kelly Shepherd, thank you. Kelly had a winner last night.

[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.100]
Seven to one, when I bet him he was bettown to nine to five, so didn't exactly get rich, but at least thank goodness for Kelly Shepherd.

[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.060]
Okay, it's a good guy.

[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.700]
And I don't know how to say the things I want to say about some of those people out there in horse racing in general, not just at Pompano Park,

[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.960]
because they put a dark mark on a sport that I happen to love dearly.

[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:12.540]
And by their antics out there and what they do to the public, they damage the ability even with good PR people like Alan Finkelson or Joe Tannenbaum or Roy Slanoff and the others.

[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.940]
People that go out there and do grotesque things are put dead meat on a racetrack for the public to burn their money on.

[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.920]
It's an embarrassment. It's embarrassing. So I want to talk about that in a minute.

[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.860]
And I really don't know where to start. So let's start by taking a break because I got so many things we've got to cover today.

[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.640]
We may not be able to do it in four hours, right?

[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.020]
We may have to have Steve orchestrates some guests for us because that's another thing.

[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.780]
He believes that he's going to book the guest not only over there, but over here too.

[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:45.820]
He's back to that old business. I'm going to orchestrate the show and you really have no guts if you don't have this kind of like somebody writes me a letter

[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:52.000]
so that in criticize, which I read on the air, how many times have I read letters on the air? Many, many times over the years from goofballs.

[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.860]
Well, not recently, but over the years several.

[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.100]
Does that man going to invite these people on the air to attack me for four hours?

[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.280]
See, I don't do contract controversy, Steve. I don't have guests.

[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:09.120]
I have like Al Goldstein, Tom Jicke and Bill Cosford. That's three that I can count and Hank will stop it once in a while.

[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.680]
So maybe I got like four or five people a year who come in on his show.

[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.980]
I don't do that kind of a show. So there's no reason for me to bring in somebody here in stage a contrived debate because Steve thinks it would be exciting and make good contrived debate.

[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:30.080]
I don't want to be a contrived radio. But I do like the concept of all Neil Alde, but I do want my qualities and what I OD and my picture on the bumper sticker, Steve.

[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:37.440]
It's 1013 at WIOD, spell it right. That's WI ostracized D and we'll be right back.

[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:45.680]
1016 at WIOD on this, whether our Camilla Sauce total 107,821 dollars.

[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:53.380]
And it'll continue trickling and I'm hoping we get to at least 110 would be a nice even number by our deadline next Tuesday.

[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.520]
A lot of deadlines on the 15th. I guess ours isn't quite as important as he used to be.

[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:07.040]
Anyway, where do I start? Now a lot of our audience is totally in the dark on this because they can't pick up light bulb radio, especially if they live in Dave County or parts of Palm Beach.

[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.060]
And I got this letter in the mail a couple of days ago in a one to two hour.

[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:21.160]
And I had no idea who the person was from was on a letterhead from a an organization called Guard Incorporated.

[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:28.180]
And the very first paragraph says the Guard organization was created a strike back at those who shame the homosexual community.

[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:35.880]
Our actions are intended to inject into society that if one casts the gay community in a negative light, we will go after them with a vengeance.

[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.700]
And that goes on to talk about the things I say on the air and expressions I use, etc. etc. etc.

[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:54.280]
But it would start right up and we're going to go after them with the vengeance and the not so veiled threat is there that if I don't knuckle under and stop using this expression or do an ad or whatever that they're going to come after me with the vengeance.

[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.800]
So, can I write on the air and I said it was a bunch of crap and it was I left here two days ago.

[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:05.700]
I called Norm Candid's office on a way home from my car because he generally knows who these various organizations are to different people.

[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:12.980]
And sure enough, he knew that Charles Peake was a guy whose real name is Charles Beto by the way who was involved in a supposed organization.

[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.960]
They really only had like three or four members and maybe a half a dozen people and they were going after people.

[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:24.000]
And his opinion really had no right to be gone after you deserve to be and that they were misguided and he wasn't too fond of them.

[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:36.420]
At that point the next day I came on yesterday and I mentioned it what for like four seconds in the beginning of the show because basically yesterday we're talking about the dolphins or ratings were coming and we had a lot of stuff going on.

[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.760]
I mentioned it briefly.

[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:48.100]
We had a full board of calls. One of the lines was flashing. George was talking to somebody on the line and I picked it up and here's the guy who identifies himself as the same author of this letter.

[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.600]
Now for a couple of seconds I told him along with me, thought he was talking to George. He wants to speak to Neil and pop up.

[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.240]
I mean, let me finally after 30 seconds realized he's talking to me.

[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:03.300]
At that point he says, well, if you're if you're going to adopt this attitude about it, I'm going over to FTL right now.

[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.980]
I'm going over to Elrantel and pop out in there. He was gone.

[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:13.240]
There wasn't any discussion about my bringing him on the air for a debate because I have no desire or interest or intention.

[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:21.700]
There's nothing to debate. He's not going to tell me what my humor is going to be. He's not going to accuse me of being a homophobic gay.

[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:28.700]
I mean, that's just lunacy to begin with because it's ridiculous. I don't know what he wants to accuse. But obviously he's got problems.

[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.820]
At least that's my opinion.

[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.260]
So that was my that was our involvement with it starting around noon.

[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.080]
And after that point off the year during the news break, a norm can't call.

[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.940]
Well, norm, by the way, is a lawyer, good friend of mine also does mornings on FTL and norm I got to tell you.

[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.260]
I'm not even going to repeat it because I've said it before you won't listen to me.

[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.920]
I mean, you listen over there and between trying to I mean, we have problems getting the traffic guys on the air because they're not there.

[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:01.500]
But I mean, the technical, the abortive things that are going on in the name of being a radio station, it's embarrassing.

[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:09.260]
It's like the King Paul school of broadcasting, which has been going on ever since he's on that station, by the way.

[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.940]
It's like a laughing stock to joke.

[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.720]
Technically and in many other ways and I, you know, I feel for guys because I know what it's like to have to go through that.

[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:26.320]
We have our own technical things here once in a while, but never in the in our wildest days in the league with the stuff that goes on over there.

[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.740]
It's like it's like try to put it together when the director said, can we still say that director said.

[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.520]
So anyway, I get to call and he said it wasn't the guy who was on a phone who called you and the blah, blah, blah.

[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.200]
And he's going to go on with Al at some time in the future and like much to do about nothing.

[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.400]
Then comes to find out in the next hour getting frantic calls, both on and off the air.

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.260]
This guy's on the air up there. They're doing a number on you.

[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.540]
And let me say this right up front. I've been attacked. I've been abused. I'm not making a martyr man.

[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.500]
I can handle. I've been handling it here for 15 years. Okay.

[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.180]
The only thing I do is that when people do it, I come back. I strike back.

[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:08.660]
I don't sit here like a wimp for five years or five minutes. If I feel a wreaths worth responding to, I do it.

[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:15.040]
That's all because I don't sit, you know, life is too short to take a lot of crap from anybody.

[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.300]
That's why my one message for everybody. Don't take crap.

[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.580]
Whether it's where you work, whether it's at home, just don't take crap from anybody.

[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.760]
And I don't. And that's one of my main philosophies in life. I won't do it.

[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:38.480]
And here is this ongoing bashing, which evidently Al Rantel now has had the muzzle taken off.

[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.660]
He's no longer muzzled by Jefferson Pilate. He no longer has an excuse for being a wimp.

[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.220]
So now he's going to really butcher up and strike back at what?

[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:52.320]
At the fact I've called him Alice and played a little song and made mockery of him over the past many years.

[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:57.420]
Same stuff I did, by the way, when we worked together on that radio station, which didn't seem to bother him at all then.

[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:04.460]
But evidently, in the inter-em in between has nod at his conscience and his being just remembered evidently.

[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.380]
And in his mind, the way of responding is not to go on a year and to compete, because he can't do that.

[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.800]
We've already went around on that when I was at I&C and he was at NWS, and I had a 9-shear and he had a 278-can't compete.

[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.460]
Or do a productive show or do something interesting.

[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:34.420]
The way to do it is to invite somebody not to do it himself even, but let's bring his good friend Charles Bato, aka Charles Peak, on a year, to attack Neil Rogers as being, as using these terrible phrases and being a bad role model.

[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.880]
And maybe indirectly causing teenage gays to commit suicide because they have a negative impression about themselves etc.

[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.420]
A bunch of crap.

[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.560]
Goes without saying, a pile of crap.

[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:57.940]
Every time I turned on yesterday, and obviously the reasons I did, even in the house, which it unheard of for me to turn after the emotional guiding light with Rivas over there in Italy, I mean, who can believe that?

[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.580]
She floated across the Atlantic, she's alive in Italy allegedly.

[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.140]
And after that, I turned on and here again, it's all Neil all day.

[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:13.440]
And as I was on my way home, you know, one thing about Steve, when you're full of it, at least be consistently full of it.

[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.000]
And then he is full of crap.

[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:26.040]
Just never, it's like opening up a faucet and the washer gets broken and you can't shut it off like the valve is broken and it just comes flowing out and never stops like a toilet that never stops running.

[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:36.280]
The amount of lies and myths, myths truths that you hear in one day coming from that place, more than most of us here in a lifetime, and I hear a lot, and I tell of you occasionally too.

[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.520]
What is necessary?

[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:54.940]
But the idea that boy Gary and Disney go in their into breaks and try to get Neil to stop talking about us and I hear that from my answer, let me say this, maybe you don't lie Steve, maybe just I'll be very generous, maybe your informants in this building just have bad information they're feeding you.

[00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:01.800]
Mike, Disney and boy Gary and nobody in the building has ever ever come to me and said, don't talk about it to you.

[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:11.780]
Don't talk about Steve King. Don't talk about anything. There's only one person and one subject matter we don't discuss. Everybody knows who and everybody knows why.

[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.800]
All the way, did you get a chance to mention him on the ear on the phone this morning over there, which is kind of exciting.

[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.200]
I may call more often in the morning.

[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:29.640]
1023 at W.I.D., let's do a break and then we'll come back because I got a lot to say and I know that I'm whining and I'm a martyr and I keep a bunch of crap out.

[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:35.420]
Now, okay, now there's only one thing I can say to you and I say it from the bottom of my heart. Butch up.

[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.060]
The greatest football team and the other thing.

[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:45.620]
Excuse me, the other thing I'm here yesterday, you know, here again, a man who's really a part of the community, Mr. Pain, Mr. Rico.

[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.940]
And I'm sure that Neil, it's always something that Neil would do.

[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.820]
You know, not just it's always the average person out there, the fan, but always we got to bring Neil into it too.

[00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.200]
He may be a fan, but if you paid him $5,000, he just as soon as he the dolphins lose the game this way.

[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:06.280]
Now, first of all, that's got to be the most assent I think of. It's an excuse for not being a fan of your local professional team.

[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.340]
That's all that is.

[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:14.260]
And hey, if you're more interested in cash and a bet, more power to you. You're not a fan, you're a title, okay? That's not where I'm coming from.

[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.960]
I mean, if that's the case, it would be like the Cubs play 162 games every season.

[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:25.380]
And it would be like somebody said to me every day of the season, would you rather have $5,000 today, or would you rather see the Cubs lose?

[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:33.820]
Hey, 5,000 times 162 at the end of the season, I could buy the Cubs, okay, then I would have to worry about it.

[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.300]
As an I, ridiculous.

[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.660]
I don't even know where to start, I mean, I could do like the whole four hours, I could do a monologue.

[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.100]
And I don't even know if it's worth it because I'm dignifying. You got to understand the all the all day.

[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.740]
There would be those people who would say, well, you should just totally ignore them because nobody's even listening.

[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.980]
I hear the old Jan from Hollywood this morning. I hear it. And here all this stuff has gone on here.

[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.340]
I was called in there. Alice called in for 20 minutes. Norm is hysterical. He's telling me one thing on a phone off the air. He's calling me at home.

[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:12.220]
Then he comes back on. Says just the opposite. Oh, yes, the system organization. They're a fledgling organism. I've changed my mind. I had dinner with the L.A.S. manager.

[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:23.160]
And in an off the air, he's telling me something entirely different. He says, yeah, you're right. It's not a group in this guy's a bad guy, but norm just, you know, again, you're caught in between a rock in a hard place.

[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:29.420]
And you got to take sides over there because you work there. You're on the air over there. You can't tell the truth.

[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:40.060]
You can't repeat on the air what you said to me off the air because that would spoil the whole party. That would ruin all day, all the all day radio.

[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:53.860]
And I don't care. Then bother me personally. I can handle it. But the only reason I called in there in the organism talking about it today. I'm just not going to see. I believe in setting the record straight and seeing my peace when I feel like it.

[00:17:55.420 --> 00:18:04.040]
Not sitting back and saying, oh, people are muscling me for five years. And now I want to get even know what a good time. I'm going to start taking the abuse. What abuse?

[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:13.860]
Here's a guy who got dragged out of the closet yesterday kicking and screaming and didn't even do it in a positive way like I tried to do year 16 years ago or whatever 14 years ago.

[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:27.020]
Didn't even try to do that. It's just like, oh, you want me to say it? Okay. I'm great. Wow. What a statement. That's standing up and being counted. So between Steve and his good buddy Charles peak aka Beto. They accomplished what they wanted.

[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:36.180]
And the midst of all this all the all day they dragged out of the closet. Big deal. What does it mean? I mean, it's an empty thing at this point. It means nothing.

[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:47.080]
So what did accomplish? And I want to say something else to I know a lot of people in this business. I have friends who are closet people.

[00:18:48.140 --> 00:19:00.440]
And for their own personal reasons have every desire to remain in a closet. And in some cases, they need legitimate need to be in a closet. Fine. I would never in a million years dream of hinting or saying or suggesting.

[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:12.720]
Because it's really nobody's business. But when somebody comes on a year week after week and day after day and is sticking one toe in and one toe out one day, the door is open the next day. It's shut. Well, naturally, people are going to joke about it.

[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:22.200]
I mean, anybody in the audience to whom yesterday's announcement was staggering by Alice. I mean, has to be deaf dumb blind and like an ostrich. Have his head buried in the same. He got to be in a dream world. Not to know by now.

[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:33.900]
So it's an empty statement. It's meaningless. So don't bring your gay activists on the air lecturing to me about standing up and being counted and not being making.

[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:52.500]
And in flammatory remarks. Here's the same guy who used to refer to me time and time again as instead of king of talk radio, queen of talk radio. Does that bother me? I think it's funny. All of quite frankly, when Alice says it, it comes across as petulant and bitchy. But I think it's funny. Doesn't bother me.

[00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:01.460]
And who yesterday in the midst of a heated three way debate on the phone contrived call with Steve and Norm and Al.

[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:13.620]
And the call by saying he's the biggest faggot of them all see. Okay. So in other words, when Al refers to me or anybody as queen or faggot, that's okay. And I'm sure that his good friend Charles Pek has no problem with that.

[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:24.320]
But if Neil, Neil makes jokes about being a middle age fat queen or something like that, then right away we're going to go after him with a vengeance because he's setting the bad example and kids are going to blow their brains up.

[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.140]
It's ridiculous. It's pathetic. It's sad.

[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:41.280]
Twenty after four yesterday afternoon and afternoon drive on Florida's talk leader, they played back to back PSAs.

[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:53.700]
And the host came on and was whining that there wasn't a person on the there wasn't a call on the board. I wonder why maybe all Neil all day ain't going to work.

[00:20:53.700 --> 00:21:07.140]
You know. It's just amazing to me. The paranoia, the pettiness that you see, there's a way to win in this business. That's to compete. Put something on the air that people want to hear.

[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:15.640]
Be funny, be interesting, be informative, be entertaining, be something. But don't be bitchy. Don't just sit there and why.

[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:27.320]
Oh, I took this for a foot took what took what? All the other people I take shots at all there. Do we have a line at the doors or anybody up there outside outside upset?

[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:38.720]
Is Sally out there sharpening up her batteries? I mean, I don't think so. You got to grow up and be a big boy or whatever soon or later.

[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:55.340]
So Alice, you know, and again, we look at these numbers yesterday and like I said, hey, they just changed format. But the fact is, these been there two months. He's talking about his whole deal is let's talk about Neil and let's tell everybody how bad Rick and suds are. You know what it reminds me of.

[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:06.440]
It reminds me of the clandestine dinner that I was sucked into with joy rentals and Russ Oasis. Were you here that went out when on when joy was still doing that abortion on Saturday.

[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:17.720]
Under the guise of some other business deal I get sucked into this dinner and then the whole purpose of the meeting is for me to go to boy Gary and try to get joy after the drive and get Rick and suds fired because they're terrible.

[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:33.000]
I didn't think they're terrible then I thought they were fine. I think they're fine now. I think the audience loves them. Not the whole audience. They got a big part of my audience loves them. And a lot of people listen to them hate me like poison. That's radio. That's life. That's entertainment. That's your business.

[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:41.440]
So Steve's got the same mentality that if he keeps coming on repeating it over and over again every day that'll make it a fact and everybody will buy it markets up 30 points.

[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:51.740]
And it won't. It just won't. I mean there's got to be more stuff. I mean I know we got the urine lady on which I'm sure everybody's probably doing bottoms up like this. All excited about who cares.

[00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:01.920]
In other words you can't I mean I do stuff in the course of a show day in and day out. There are a few people I haven't taken shots. That's part of my stick. That's what I do.

[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:19.260]
But that's kind of like the adhesive between all the components of whatever we talk about that isn't the whole show. When's the last time I invited somebody on the show for two three four hours to bash somebody. Can you remember in 15 years that I've been on this market. I've never done it.

[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:29.420]
Can you say the same Steve or Alice? Of course not. Because quite frankly if I want to bash somebody I can do it myself. I don't need to invite somebody else on a pretend that they're doing it.

[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.340]
In addition to which when I take a shot at January last like 30 seconds and I may come back do it a couple of times. That's it.

[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:47.760]
But we have a new format in a market in Broward County called all Neil radio all day yesterday a guy calls in to Steve says what do you think about the meeting tomorrow?

[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:59.400]
What meeting? What meeting? In other words we're so and the guy says what are you talking about? He says that you know on the verge of war they're having this big meeting in the middle of the night.

[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:11.880]
And the middle east. Oh. And again these are the people who rip us because we're supposed to be so mindless and we have no substance and Rick and Sons are silly and their ratings are dropping and bop bop bop.

[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:20.200]
But in the meantime six days before we might blow the whole world up next Tuesday or shortly thereafter they're talking about Neil Rogers all day.

[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:30.800]
And what he should say or he shouldn't say any and should he say Alice on the radio that to me is a great topic to take about 15 hours on a year.

[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:38.400]
With all the things that are going on serious humorous in between Alice it seems to me.

[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:46.540]
Kind of epitomizes our times isn't that what you're thinking about isn't that what's on your mind? Is Alice?

[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:59.340]
It's embarrassing. And like I said the other day it's like somebody handed the keys to a radio station to a bunch of Julinos said hey hey go play radio.

[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:09.420]
And Norm let me tell you're playing radio. I mean you're not on the radio. You're not radio. You just playing it. I mean you're lost. You're like the Titanic struggling at sea.

[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:17.880]
And I hear Jack smiles calling I've talked to Jack smiles in years these old worn out voices over the edge of a hundred.

[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:27.960]
Hard eggs and heart breaks heart breaks and heart that's what they got it's like when GBS tried to go talk and they had a signal I have a tremendous signal which is not radio my B 7 10.

[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:42.300]
And all he had was all the old misfits who had been just tossed out Sam all those craggio voices who would warn them welcome out even with the stations of what like Sandy even Sandy wouldn't talk to him anymore that's saying a lot.

[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:51.140]
And they all wound up over there with their point eights and point threes in their ministry and you can say ratings don't count but I got news for it.

[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:58.960]
No ratings mean no audience no audience means no business I mean you can go out with a lot of flash and get some funeral spots on air for wild stuff like that.

[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:17.800]
But when I hear two PSAs back to back in the middle of afternoon drive. I have to begin to wonder just if all Neil all day is working or not 10 36 at W I O D your ostracized station for the 90s and we'll be right back.

[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:25.920]
You're not my type 10 38 excuse me at W I O D markets up 32 and a half points just put you up man you will send you over to FTO with Alice.

[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:34.640]
You know I could like I could do a 20 hours on it's just so amazing the transparency of people are so full of crap.

[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.800]
And just be a crap like it's coming like I said like it's coming out of a broken faucet.

[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:59.280]
On and on with the stories in the it no credibility whatsoever and another thing you know Steve likes to make this big deal about well Neil won't challenge anybody to his face he's basically a coward and I'll take on anybody and invite people to call it in the bash me and he does the same thing over there they did it in WS he did here for two years whatever was here.

[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:04.500]
Every time anybody calls and is going to challenge him it's always.

[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:14.160]
And he hangs up on it you know they're on for like 14 seconds and he does the mouth breathing it then says of course they must be rick and such people it's amazing how many of them are over here.

[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:25.300]
And some of them are mouth breathing but some of them quite frankly sound like pretty articulate people but as soon as he picks up on the fact that they're not going to jump on the bandwagon it.

[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.480]
You know the same sound I mean at least come up with the new sound.

[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.160]
And he becomes the mouth breather and they disappear.

[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:50.260]
So I don't like you know back in the days when I did controversy I did that topical crap I had on every religionist every minister every priest to what they let on a show which was many every rabbi I had on tremendous numbers of people disagree we had a lot of great the discussions back and forth.

[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.400]
But Neil is a coward one minute Neil is brilliant woman at Neil is a coward.

[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:09.140]
Neil is this Neil is that Neil is great Neil is terrible Neil is interesting Neil is boring Neil talks too much about sports but Neil makes sports everything Neil's funny Neil Neil Neil and that's it that's the radio station that they've developed over there.

[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:19.340]
There's thousand what all Neil all day the messages Neil is interesting we got to talk about him because everybody listens to him and Rick and Sud suck that's their message period nothing else.

[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:22.500]
Sad.

[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:44.780]
Now I come with great I don't know how to go into this because I I must again I a lot of things that I omit over the years because I don't want to create a problem and I love horse racing I love harness racing I have all these a per mutual sponsors I love pomp and a park I love Alan Finkelson people up there treat me well.

[00:28:47.080 --> 00:29:14.760]
For years you know you try to tell people certain things they refuse to listen to you and when there are people who have larceny in their hearts and you allow them to keep coming back and stiffing the public I have to I become upset I become very upset or people who put horses out on race tracks that from looking at with the human eye looked like they're okay they warm up okay and then they race like a hot reliance behind the field and people have put their heart in dollars behind the field and they're not going to be a lot of things.

[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:35.200]
I'm not going to find them it's got to stop and I also want to convey a message by the way because the last two seasons at pop and I love harness racing I've been a fan for 32 years I used to own horses and Detroit I mean I really do love it a lot it's a great sport and there are some tremendous people in it.

[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:52.760]
In the last two seasons I've singled out kid named Jeff Gregory who drove in upstate New York which is where I'm from I saw him drive in the table in Hamburg for a couple of summers when I went on vacation I read about his success at burning down he done tremendous up there and he had some successes down here.

[00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:02.240]
Jeff you're making a fool yourself you driving horses out there that couldn't that I could that Spencer could be around the track I don't know what what's going on with this kid.

[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:14.080]
No seriously and I think it's a shame because he's a talented kid but he's taking catch drives on horses that are just no little contendry from the start they start seven lights behind the field and they work their way backward.

[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:22.440]
And I'm not blaming him for the condition of the horse there was a horse in the 10th race at Pop and O Park last night called Jeff's awesome driven by Jeff Gregory for the first time.

[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.720]
Who won two races ago in 159 and one with a good last quarter 29 and two.

[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:36.160]
13 days later the same horse came out on a track driven by Don Harmon is an outstanding driver by the way.

[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:45.040]
Finish 9th distance 9th by 18 lengths at the 3 quarter pole 9th distance would mean like 40 50 lengths behind a field.

[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:53.260]
And it was a pretty fast time in a race you look at the field you say he was only 6 to 1 in the morning line he's dropping down the company may have a shot in here.

[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:59.920]
Good driver race is going to go about 2 second slower which it did by the way it went 159 and 2.

[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:12.060]
Horse started out last backed up at the half to about 15 lengths behind the field by the time they came to the top of the stretch the horse looked like he was from the previous race.

[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.600]
The night before when the lights were out.

[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.780]
Now some of your French Canadian folks out here who put this dead meat on a track bad business.

[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:25.860]
It's going to stop.

[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.580]
And I'm not just talking about it pop but I'm talking about any of the permute rules okay this kind of stuff is outrageous.

[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:42.040]
When I watch racing from the metal lands on a satellite a lot of things they do they keep talking about the fact they want to protect the public they keep doing did they want to protect the horse men and the horses in the old.

[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.440]
But they want to protect the public.

[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:54.120]
Now when you want people to come out get involved in investing their hard earned dollars for sport whatever it is whether it's betting on whatever.

[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.480]
Protecting the public has to be the utmost.

[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.320]
And when you allow people to do these kinds of things.

[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:08.320]
Spencer you got to close that door okay I'm doing a radio show you got you must close the door because people are talking the hallway.

[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:14.640]
And I'm being serious about this I didn't lose a lot of money last night while under under a hundred bucks for me that's like winning.

[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:20.020]
I should be ecstatic I was furious I was like one of those shouting people in the last race.

[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.840]
Because the same trainer puts a horse on a track in the last race.

[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.800]
And when's the last race.

[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:33.860]
In a race where Richard Kent goes to have in a $1,500 purse in 56 and four.

[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.840]
To park out the favorite even more and I didn't even bet the race so I have no axe to grind.

[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.660]
Fat rich had a bet so I sat around and rooted for him.

[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.440]
56 and four Richard where were you going baby.

[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.120]
He finished 8 by 30 lengths by the way Richard Kent I just thought I'd point that out.

[00:32:54.460 --> 00:33:00.460]
And I ordinarily don't even mention these things because I have friends and the sponsor and all this but there's got to come a time.

[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:05.060]
Look if you want people to come out if you want to get new people to come out if you want to be enthusiastic cut the crap.

[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.500]
Take people like that haven't come and pick up their papers and get them out of there and cut the crap.

[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.720]
Let's have competition.

[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:22.820]
And if these things are going to continue to be an insider's game then hey people aren't going to come out and put their heart or a dollar down.

[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.060]
That's all I can tell you.

[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:32.100]
Anyway did I say anything okay 1045 at W.I.O.D. now all the day lines are lit.

[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.720]
I.O.D. star at I.O.D. is lit. Broward lines wide open so I guess they're probably over there now right.

[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.560]
They probably got what's his name on again. What is his name which one is so good today.

[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:51.880]
524 W.I.O.D. in Broward 751 and day star I.O.D. on a star line 6555 W.I.O.D. in Palm Beach. North Miami Beach.

[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.160]
What do I know I'm kind of fueling this thing but I'm not out to do that at all there.

[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:07.160]
You're what I'm kind of I guess I'm kind of feeling I'm not the only I listen just one time over there today and you're right it was everything is said was about you and I.

[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:14.820]
I didn't want to hear that at all. I want to first move. I moved here on this morning and he's talking about me that seems to be the whole topic of conversation on a radio station.

[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.740]
Are our power lines working by the way.

[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:23.260]
I've been sitting here waiting for a way I was waiting for you I flipped over there on my radio it barely came in of course but it came in anyway.

[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:32.160]
And they're already talking about what you said about the ratings five minutes ago I mean that's amazing you know what you said about he's getting you get a nine he gets to he's already talking about that really.

[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:40.520]
Well I how is he have time to be of catching up with me I was on the year I don't understand that I have no idea I thought it was most amazing thing in the world.

[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:51.640]
But anyway I was just going to say you know you're I've been here just about a year now they live in Miami and it took me while to get used to your show because I've not used to quite anything like this kind of radio because I came from Texas.

[00:34:51.640 --> 00:35:21.620]
Well it's different it is it is one fine didn't Texas you know I'm gonna talk radio about the one I really enjoy it I'll call you a couple of times but I really enjoy you know I enjoy your stick I enjoy what you do I enjoy you know I've gotten to enjoy your you know your monologue and your you know you got some great comedy and things like that I'm I'm really getting bored with the talking about them I mean you're number one in the market you know let me say this sir let me say this to you okay I make little comments about them I haven't well done them but when they take almost an entire broadcast day yesterday and invited guy I'm to do a hatchet job.

[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:51.200]
I'm going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[00:35:51.200 --> 00:36:21.180]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.600]
right now now he's not manipulating well he's kind of sitting your

[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.920]
format for the day but i understand you know i'll get my say into that

[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.680]
so back tomorrow you'll back to show and you're saying something great

[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.520]
okay thanks

[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.240]
ten forty eight we have an open line of the all the brown lines are open so i

[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.180]
guess they've got all the brown audience that's good

[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:41.560]
good job guys all new all day is working five to four of those lines working

[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:42.780]
and brown

[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.640]
now what is that mean

[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.140]
only line four

[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:56.760]
i was sitting here with a dead no wonder our phones aren't light enough and

[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.900]
brown we got a dead bunch of a phone

[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.460]
and i'm not so sure that one's working

[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.840]
that's incredible

[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.720]
so i take back what i said about them being a technical disaster

[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.220]
because we have no excuse

[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.140]
this is incredible

[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.200]
let me just try something okay

[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.000]
pambi can't work in either

[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.900]
it is you're on air hold on

[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.900]
okay there are another example remember yesterday we had a guy in a phone

[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:24.840]
it wasn't lit up in brown

[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.940]
our phone systems all screwed up

[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.220]
now how can isn't interesting how do we have a conversation with people who

[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.540]
know what i'm talking about because the only people here over there in

[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.760]
brown and none of our brown lines are working

[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.740]
follow what i'm saying

[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.240]
these other people in the what the hell i'm talking about

[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.700]
they're thinking what what is what's going on over there

[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.120]
what is this light bulb is talking about we can't even see it's not

[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.420]
even flickering by us

[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:48.620]
flicker this

[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.040]
remember my friend flicker

[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.140]
but why is it wait a minute well how do you dial it

[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.940]
just a second now here we go here's the bat line let's see why

[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.600]
fine for

[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:08.800]
yeah you get a busy signal they're all the whole brow bank of lines is dead

[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.380]
now does that come as an interesting bizarre

[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:12.660]
uh... occurrence

[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.780]
how is that possible

[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.340]
you may get a tone on there but it won't ring you get a busy signal when you

[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.980]
dial it

[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.660]
or hey you know what will ring

[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.560]
oh man it is just a pain is so great i want to go back to the track can we put

[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.800]
a couple more races on bring back that horse from the tenth race i think he's

[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.700]
finishing here he comes

[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.960]
hey hit him Jeff

[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.920]
let's have Roger drive him

[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.540]
hey listen it couldn't be any worse believe me

[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.620]
you remember the horse that Rick shoddrow

[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.120]
that's how this horse was in the uh... what race was it

[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.460]
whatever the hell racer was last night in the tenth race just like that one

[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:58.200]
in the stretch he wasn't walking he was on his hand and knees

[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.680]
what there's somebody on that line

[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.780]
well how the hell did that happen

[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:03.900]
are you there

[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.360]
it's i am well how did that happen well you said a few minutes ago you don't

[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.160]
take any crop life to short

[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.080]
yeah okay and is in the same breath you said except from one person i mean

[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.700]
what does it take to get it to get into that one person's class that you said

[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.500]
that you don't discuss

[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:21.180]
in other words if somebody pressures you that much better let me say this

[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.360]
to you i heard your call this morning with norm can

[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.240]

don't waste your time

[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.180]
let me say it again this radio station is company spent hundreds of thousands

[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:35.980]
of dollars

[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.380]
in legal fees

[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.660]
i took two years of crap and we decided that point we weren't going to take it

[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.880]
now if you want to do it

[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.500]
i'll be more than happy off the air to give it the gentleman's name phone number

[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.040]
in address all of it is in the directory and you can start up okay you can make

[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.960]
yourself into a martyr we choose not to do it

[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:58.020]

was right maybe i got sucked in to a whole bunch of stuff and we have

[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.360]
possible i made a lot of mistakes like coming in this morning was one

[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:11.280]
but even so i'm still gonna say my piece okay it's just because i feel it's

[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.640]
appropriate and i want to say and i said it that's it

[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.720]

[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.920]
uh... alice okay right yeah and that you um

[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.880]
you want to you want to face anybody's conscious to face to

[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:55.920]
him you're born you have no balls but then you don't right and then you know

[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.460]
i i couldn't take that anymore i went over to the other

[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.500]
went back to you and your music is that you were saying that he had no balls

[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.720]
well it's kind of a shortage now to be honest with as a matter of fact uh... we're

[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.220]
gonna see if we can't uh... send mail order for a couple but we're working on it

[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.700]
you're more butch than some of the more butch than some of the more and there were

[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.220]
a couple of bb's in it that was about the best we could do

[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.760]
and then um i don't know if you're right i just wanted to make one comment is this

[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.880]
is the phones all working now because this is a really weak start okay we just

[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.620]
turned off the whole audience and we'd like to self-destructed here no when i

[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:33.500]
go to the right place is that what it holds that

[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:37.180]
they're not working they're all still all screwed up see now i feel better

[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:40.000]
because if there's an excuse for it i can understand but after going through such

[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.400]
a melodramatic first hour if the phones were working and i get shined then i

[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.820]
got to feel like uh... hey you know i'm playing with my marbles or my

[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.280]
no it doesn't ever get away working because i want to play well you remember

[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.760]
Humphrey bogeyard and can you certainly see that movie

[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.660]
i think so but i was young when i saw captain of the ship and he was looking for

[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:02.640]
the strawberries and he was crazy to make it roll in those steel balls oh yeah right

[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.080]
so you got to hang out of those balls pal otherwise it's like a security blanket

[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.080]
all i see and of course if somebody takes him away man you're really upset

[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.420]
yeah my dogs have been talking to me about that too lately but well maybe you could

[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.140]
get some wooden ones there you go

[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.560]

[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:13.120]
around desperately like little kids screaming for attention because they got no act you see on the

[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:17.320]
one hand he wants to say that we're the silly station we're for the mindless we're buff your

[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:23.340]
over your suds morath and on the other hand there were they were going to be the the alternative the

[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:28.160]
real talk station but they realize of course that that crap went out that went out with high button

[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:32.960]
shoes nobody cares about it except nine hundred year old people w snows went under they're doing

[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:37.540]
like a one with radio memories and so they're really in limbo they got nowhere to go so that's why

[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:42.780]
they're flailing around desperately talking about me and hopes that just maybe somebody can hear him

[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:46.220]
and we'll get a few people at which we have you know and i think you gotta send me a check for it

had a one five in the morning playing uh barber strison and frank sanitary okay

[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.340]
i mean let's face it that ain't when you've already been in the market before and you make this

[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:19.220]
comeback and i'll give them all a play that i've given them there should be a little something more

[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:23.180]
happening and when all the demographics are sixty five plus and you hear ninety percent of the

[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:27.940]
caller sound like uh muthusla on a bad day i don't think there's like a great case going on over

[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:32.520]
there okay well i agree i as matter of fact i called yesterday afternoon and i wanted to

[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:37.920]
e-s for opinions on the show by called and he cut me off at the quik and yeah he's just you mean

[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:43.900]
Steve yeah did he go exactly and he said everybody you know here's the guy who claims everybody

[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:48.060]
else is a coward and he thinks it's real gutsy to bring people out and do this contrived

[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:52.160]
controversy and scream and yell and go out to dinner with him that night at uh burden jacks

[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:57.700]
but at the bottom line it's all phony because as soon as anybody calls and after 20 seconds of

[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:02.600]
taking issue or showing that you disagree it's the same you must be a rickinson and then you're

[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:08.480]
gone exactly he cut me off what is that it's what is it he doesn't have a show that's what it is

[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:19.440]
it is crap meal about them dolphins hmm i'm excited oh we are pumped to say believe yeah well anyway

[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.060]
now you know something winner lose even if we get our tails beat which could happen but i hope not

[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:28.560]
but he won't really it's just been such a good experience and for those people out i feel sorry for

[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:33.600]
people who don't even understand the experience of being a fan of anything more than just a book you

[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:38.080]
know i mean it's so crash and so stupid but again it's part of that same thing if Neil says this

[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:43.580]
than the other one says you know this is so high meal this and meal that's who you know i don't

[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:49.380]
want to hear i'm like i said i'm embarrassed by people want to hear Neil can listen tended to on

[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:53.880]
w i o d and if they have nothing else to offer but talking about me why don't they just give me all

[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:58.240]
the other time i'll do some spots make some extra money on the side and and that'll be it okay

[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:04.120]
the whole key is when you're on top they want to knock you down that's what the point is you know

[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:09.080]
like Alice been on opposite me before couldn't compete ran off into another time slot like a little

[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:13.320]
coward which is basically what he is he's a limp and when his own people over there call him a

[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:17.600]
wimp and when he comes out with his bitchy crap yesterday like a little pet you'll in child oh i've

[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:21.480]
been picked out and now i'm getting even as really the essence of what it's all hey fine so you're

[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.020]
even uh what does that mean there you go where's the audience where's the signal where's the

[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:33.060]
business where's anything the same place it was on w snow nowhere radio death okay Neil looking

elephant droppings on the anus and was sniffing them in the middle of the six that was the most

[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:36.060]
disgusting thing and he also had mentioned that Dave game had been there before and i don't know if

good morning yes sir i just wanted to tell you that i think that you are absolutely right when

[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:24.740]
you say that this whole thing is juvenile which makes me wonder why you seem to be you sir try to

[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:28.580]
will clean up your act a little bit with i'm sorry i apologize uh why do you give

[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:35.560]
airtime to it i mean let me let me let me let me let me say it again you asked a question you want

[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:41.580]
an answer yeah because i'm not going to let somebody do a three hour hatchet job on a air

[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:50.640]
without responding to it doesn't care doesn't listen to it i don't care who or what or when or how

[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:59.660]
you conduct your business with uh after ten to two you are uh an entertainer you entertain me

[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:06.460]
i like you enjoy you and whatever you do after that is your business well i already first of all

[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:10.500]
that isn't the issue the issue is with how what i say on the air was the issue and people trying to

[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:15.180]
tell me how to say it what i should say and i'm harming people all this other crap but i already

[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:20.160]
said at the beginning of the sour that i probably made a mistake by wasting all that time because

[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.800]
this audience doesn't give a crap about any of that okay they listen to the show to be entertained

[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.480]
to have a good time they don't give a flying crap about any of that you're probably right i already

[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:34.100]
said that well then okay then but you want to perpetuate the conversation you realize that

[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:38.760]
for you 90 minutes into your show and still harping out because you just called about it

[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:43.860]
last guy lu from fiu was talking about uh pig me son of moon about your other crap he didn't

[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:48.460]
make any reference to it you know you don't even know about it he can't pick it up okay and you're

[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:53.740]
bringing it back oh i'm sorry so ask not what your talk coach can do for you but look in the mirror

[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.880]
because you brought it back up as they said at the bad restaurant right have a great life you too

[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:24.980]
if we know you silly

[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.780]
You made another resolution, well you said

[01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:42.780]
You're gonna stop the exercise

[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.960]
You made a total blood transfusion

[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.280]
Because you know

[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.280]
You do one push up and you're done

[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.260]
No I can't, I really can

[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:02.280]
But if you keep sucking down cases of big color

[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.260]
You'll be the first person who's given his own zip code

[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.760]
Because you know you're getting old

[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.800]
I'm playing, you're the same way you're getting old

[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.580]
You're playing over my door

[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.100]
You're fast over the wall

[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.900]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.040]
Wow, I bet you can't top that

[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.780]
No I can't, I really can

[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.560]
It's 1136 at WI ostracized D

[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.200]
And we be coming right back

[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.020]
1139, you know what I was really gonna get into today

[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:39.620]
I wanted to get into Elvis today

[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.920]
So to speak, see with me I prefer if they're at least still a little warm

[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.860]
But yesterday, guiding light was traumatic

[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.880]
And Riva is evidently still alive

[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.900]
And they saw this crowd on the screen in Italy

[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.940]
And some travelogue

[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:55.220]
Oh there she is, there's Riva in the middle of 400 people

[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:56.980]
And anyway, it was really traumatic

[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:59.520]
And then at four I usually turned over to Channel Four

[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.700]
And they had that personalities

[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.760]
And then that other those real flash shows

[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.580]
With all the asmarm into personalities and the scanlec cramp

[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.160]
And all the thing about was like Elvis

[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.000]
Because Rick and Spud did that two-year student name

[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.500]
For like a good part of the show was the Elvis cramp

[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.740]
And I was thinking now when I was coming back from vacation on the plane

[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.200]
I read that the paperback book by Albert Goldman

[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.160]
About the day Elvis died and last day in all the drugs and all those cramp

[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.060]
But they were showing these women

[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:27.880]
And even now when you're all like there were tears and all that kids

[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.700]
And then he's died

[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:35.200]
And you know all these investigations about his death and about the drugs and did he commit suicide

[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.160]
I don't understand it

[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:43.220]
I think there are more people in this country who are obsessed and fascinated with the death of Elvis Presley

[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:46.360]
Than about the assassination of President Kennedy for example

[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.160]
Does that give you a good idea where this country is coming from?

[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.180]
I'm serious I mean you know he was a rock star

[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:56.060]
He was good looking when he was young he was grotesque when he was older

[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.880]
But you know in it like this music some of it

[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.960]
But I mean she's and these women

[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.800]
These hopeless, lifeless, pathetic

[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.940]
And they still right up there to Graceland and they sit on the lawn

[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.260]
And they like Allison wonder than they're crying

[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.540]
They're floating away in their tears

[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:15.740]
What is that all about?

[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.020]
Aren't you about Elvis down?

[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.720]
Look at him a little bit old

[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.440]
You just send me cash

[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.060]
Get on the dial

[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:54.000]
Your tank is square

[01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:58.100]
Okay, you're a ranch

[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:02.300]
I got a fruit taken some plants, paint

[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:02.920]
I'll bet

[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.560]
Where clip is for my nose

[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:09.880]
An old bottle of old spice

[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:13.100]
For a dead I get a hose

[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.380]
He wrote a fondant

[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.620]
Returns a sentence

[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:20.380]
Who needs his junk?

[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.140]
Or this is Christmas?

[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.860]
Or really stars?

[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.400]
He wrote a fondant

[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:31.920]
Returns a sentence

[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.540]
Don't need to be rude

[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.300]
But this Christmas

[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:42.900]
I got screwed

[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:46.740]
Returns a sentence

[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:51.480]
Okay back in the box

[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:55.460]
1143 at WIO Dam, it is getting a little bit old after a while

[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:57.360]
You know? Let him rest in peace

[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.480]
By the way remember the lady you called in and started that whole thing

[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.440]
And I'm not going to talk about it anymore but this big phony feud

[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.580]
And she was giving us the spy report

[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:07.720]
And one of the things that was allegedly said

[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.480]
Was about Blue Lagoon

[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.720]
With Christopher Rankins and Brook Shields

[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.460]
Which definitely one of the great movies in the history of film

[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:16.360]
I can't believe Cosper didn't mention it the other day

[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.260]
And Paradise with Williams and Phoebe Cates not bad either

[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:22.340]
But anyway I was reading yesterday

[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:25.840]
At last night as a matter of fact I opened up the oldest crap somebody sent here in the mail

[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.940]
Return of Blue Lagoon is being filmed as we speak it is coming in 91

[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:34.280]
They did a nationwide search for this phenomenal looking young couple

[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.100]
Who are going to be out there scantily clad

[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:38.600]
And probably a few times in a movie not clad at all

[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:45.060]
And they make Brook Shields and Christopher Rankins look like Henry Barrow and Elena Tor

[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:48.960]
Now that's bad. Did I say that? That was cruel

[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.200]
Can you guys ever forgive me for that?

[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.320]
No I can't. I really can't

[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:56.960]
Come on

[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:01.080]
But seriously I mean they are you are no matter what you like

[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:06.080]
Believe me fishbowl or any other ball I mean they are incredible

[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.960]
I don't even think they're for real they must be like dummies or something

[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:12.260]
People look like that usually are

[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:16.180]
It's 1144 at WIOD and let's go to Miami

[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:16.640]
Hello

[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.380]
Flowneel

[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:17.900]
Yes sir

[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.520]
How are you doing? I'm doing it

[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:20.640]
You're doing it

[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.160]
How about you? You doing it?

[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.200]
I'm doing it

[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:23.900]
Well that's good

[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:26.540]
I just have one question for you

[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:27.260]
What's a question?

[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:31.140]
How can a man look at another man's hairy butt and find love?

[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.160]
Check with your proctologist, okay sir?

[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.280]
It was Adam and Eve

[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.140]
1144 at WIOD it's another one of our Cuban listeners spies from WQBA

[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:44.380]
We have an open line in Dade County 7519463

[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.480]
And of course we know about all those macho Cubans right?

[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:47.020]
Yeah

[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:48.080]
We're a bunch baby

[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:48.740]
Give me a kiss

[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:52.320]
And we have an open line in Palm Beach 6559463

[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.480]
You show me a Latin who isn't bisexual

[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.560]
And I'll show you pimples on Fidel Castro's butt

[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.460]
Anyway let's go to Pompo-no hello

[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.280]
Yeah I see you don't know what that means

[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.740]
And I don't either was purposely ambiguous so you can make out of it whatever you like

[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:09.200]
Yes sir?

[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:13.800]
Yeah I miss the part of your show where you were kind of apprehensive

[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.640]
What is speak up sir? Speak up don't be a coward get right to it

[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:21.960]
What I'll say I miss the part of your show about where you were

[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.100]
Your commentary about what happened to track you last night

[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:26.480]
What happened?

[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:27.800]
What happened to me?

[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:28.300]
Yeah

[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.620]
Oh no it's not just a comment about last night it's a comment in general

[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:37.060]
And for years I have been urging Alan Finkelson to tell some of our French Canadian trainers and drivers and horse people

[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:41.880]
Not to come back to Pompo-no park and to stay where the moon don't shine up there at Blue Bonnets and elsewhere

[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.780]
Because when they come down here it is a disgrace what is put before the public

[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:47.320]
There was a horse

[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.240]
Well this isn't the only one or a couple of others

[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.400]
But last night there was a horse in the tenth race called Jeff's Awesome

[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.420]
He broke down

[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.180]
No it didn't break down

[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.480]
Oh that's the one that got distance last time

[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.800]
Last time he had won the time before in 59 and 1 with an outstanding last quarter

[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:02.180]
Right

[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:05.120]
And last night was dropping down was only 6 to 1 in the morning line

[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.500]
When off I think about 13 to 1 which isn't like 99 to 1 he had a shot

[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.320]
You figure to be in there you knew the race would be slower

[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.260]
Race went to 59 and 2 which he had won a couple of weeks ago in 59 and 1

[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.940]
When they went to the half he must have been 20 lengths behind but when they came to the stretch

[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:22.120]
He was like in the next race in other words he was like in a post parade for the next race was coming out

[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.920]
That's when he finished about 8 minutes later

[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.480]
400 light he did not make a break didn't break down

[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:30.520]
He just was walking on his hands and knees and I would suggest to the emister Finkelson

[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:38.440]
That horses that perform like that one should be forced to qualify before we're asked to indulge our harder and dollars to support tangibles

[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:39.140]
Support again

[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:43.440]
Well they usually are but I noticed that that used to be a pretty good race horse

[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.760]
Jeff's Awesome

[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:53.000]
I mean you know secretary used to be a good race horse too but I don't think he's going to be running an aqueduct today

[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.160]
You know he's not in good shape

[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:56.580]
He's kind of like this one dead

[01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:00.260]
And you're right about pavy he got parked out pretty good in that last race

[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:05.920]
Well I'm not talking about pavy I'm talking about Richard Kent with the three horse which had the 2-0

[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.080]
40 to 1 had no chance to win the race

[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.240]
The horse is never going to happen 56 and 4 in his life

[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:16.060]
And was just puking and whipping for the sole purpose of keeping pavy and then I even money favorite part

[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:22.380]
I didn't even bet the race but I mean it was just a boarded and then the Richard Kent horse finishes 30 lengths behind

[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:24.200]
Doesn't that bother you sir?

[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.340]
Yeah I noticed that

[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:30.660]
If he sits the 2-0 trip he might even get finished second he might get sucked along get a pretty good trip

[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:33.960]
And all he accomplished was finishing last by 30 lengths

[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.960]
Neil let me ask you the effect

[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.040]
You put a lot of credence on the drivers

[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.020]
But in a lot of those races they're all catch drivers they're all good drivers

[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.360]
What does that mean?

[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:48.240]
Well don't you think that the drivers only as good as his mouth?

[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:49.880]
In some cases

[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:55.460]
I'm going to say it again Kevin Wallace who got three days for a little interference suspension

[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:59.860]
But Kevin Wallace is the best driver on that track bar none so don't ever forget that

[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:02.020]
He can drive circles around those people

[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:03.820]
Okay?

[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.120]
I happen to think Peter Reynolds

[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.020]
Let me say this to you again

[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:09.640]
Kevin Wallace is the best driver on that track

[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:14.000]
And if you've noticed Peter Reynolds performances since coming back since he isn't getting my Gorshi's horses

[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.600]
Media ochre, Tenonix and Pizza Good Driver

[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.840]
Not in Kevin Wallace's class anymore

[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.580]
Okay? Trust me when I tell you

[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.740]
Okay I'll bet on Kevin Wallace

[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:22.140]
Okay

[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.920]
1148 at WIOD

[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.780]
I'm glad we got that settled so easily

[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:27.860]
That's what I like

[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:29.840]
Somebody agreeable for a change

[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.200]
We have an open line indeed

[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:35.600]
Maybe we'll get a call today from Renee and they don

[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.720]
The trainer of Jeff saw some last night

[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:43.640]
Good little update on the condition and maybe we'll get a call from the stewards to see if he's crossed the finish line yet

[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.600]
There's an open line a day

[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.200]
I started to say that moments ago before my harness racing hysteria got me wrapped up in a fever

[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.760]
751 I can't finish the race

[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:53.940]
And one in Palm Beach

[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:55.120]
655 stiff

[01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:57.660]
655 WIOD

[01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.220]
And we'll be right back

[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.580]
1151 at WIOD

[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:02.380]
We have an open line a day

[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:03.080]
You know what I need to do?

[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.400]
I need to get that sports section that you're reading right now

[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:09.560]
Because we have no papers in here and Phil Saltsman will be calling won't he and be bugging me

[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.700]
So I'd rather beat him to the horses, but today so to speak

[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:17.020]
And the thick and other loser like that parsimonious we had yesterday that's also still

[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.220]
Here he comes

[01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:19.100]
Hit him, Herbie

[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.700]
Here he is going to make it

[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:21.160]
Okay

[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:22.680]
Better late than never

[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:23.720]
Right Ian?

[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:24.800]
How are you doing, dear?

[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.420]
What do you want?

[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.040]
I don't know just to say

[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.440]
You know I got to be honest with you we got an Ian Spireyport

[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.900]
Kelvin who's a great guy

[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.720]
Came to the track to call her Friday for our remote showed up supported us was enthusiastic

[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:40.320]
He said he is not out here because he's really pissed off in you because what you said about the hurricanes

[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.900]
I thought that was childish in the

[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.000]
Wait a minute

[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.840]
Wait a minute can I finish my statement and then you can correct me?

[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:46.120]
Sorry

[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.280]
I thought it was childish and depressing

[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:50.060]
Are you finished?

[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:50.600]
Yes

[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.200]
Okay that's not the reason I need to show up

[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.960]
But I did disagree with you

[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.780]
But I wouldn't show up

[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:58.580]
Well I see some other words if you don't agree with everything that I say that

[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:01.960]
See now reconcets can take comfort in understanding why you're so fickle

[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:04.740]
Because as soon as somebody says something you don't agree with then

[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.460]
Up yours is that Ian?

[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.620]
That's not why I only wish

[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.760]
That's not why I didn't show up

[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.920]
I had a work with my dad

[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:14.220]
But I guess what we somehow survived isn't that incredible?

[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:17.040]
Yes but well, what can I say about Kelvin?

[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.940]
Here's my horse and the first race ladies and gentlemen

[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:23.700]
Angel mine with early fires strikes again

[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:27.260]
Striking terror in the hearts of parametrile players from coast to coast

[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]
Angel mine in the first

[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:30.280]
Go ahead I'm sorry

[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.580]
Okay, so it wasn't your next remote anyway first of all

[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:34.920]
I had a Gulf Stream at some some time in February

[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.660]
We don't have a day we're postponing the one we were going to have on the 25th

[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:41.200]
Because it was too soon after called or would have been a little bit a little bit horse racing intensive

[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:41.740]
Don't you think?

[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:42.860]
Yes, I'm there

[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:44.160]
One thing about Kelvin though

[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:46.820]
You know how Alice came out of the car yesterday?

[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:47.760]
Yes, ma'am

[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.060]
Kelvin hasn't announced me later on this week

[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:50.400]
Really?

[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:51.640]
And that's all right

[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.420]
I sure hope he's sitting on my knee when he makes it

[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:55.320]
I don't know, the other day we were out

[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.040]
You don't know?

[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:58.980]
He started talking how he wants to grow a tail long and blonde

[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.100]
That's all I got now

[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.100]
How about on his head?

[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:05.080]
No, one thing about ratings deal about Steve came

[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.900]
If you ever went away like to New York for a couple months like he did and came back

[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:12.100]
You knew your ratings would blow his away

[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.620]
Like you would, no matter where you are, you would have a more than a 1.3

[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:16.720]
Can I say this to you?

[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:17.340]
Okay

[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:24.320]
The fact that Mr. Ego was in New York talking about Neil Rogers on the year and the morning on WABC

[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:28.280]
Having the urine lady in the same old chronic guests on

[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:32.800]
Indicates to me that he has a very limited repertoire as in

[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.200]
Mouth breathers

[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.340]
I mean that's not having a clever debate or sparring with the caller

[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:43.260]
Okay, I'm not talking about mouth breathers and there are some of those

[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:46.760]
I'm talking about people who sound relatively intelligent who have a different point of view

[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:50.660]
And as soon as they spend about 20 seconds saying that maybe they enjoy Rick and Sards

[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:53.340]
Or anything that takes a different point of view

[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:58.880]
That's it, that's the repertoire. There are three things and all the rest is strictly filler

[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.860]
It's Uncle Neil is this and Uncle Neil says that and Uncle Neil is great and Uncle Neil stays

[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:06.660]
That's number one far ahead of all the others. Number two is Rick and SUDSUCK

[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:09.460]
And everybody's coming over here, that's number two. And number three is

[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.700]
Tied in usually with number one or number two, okay?

[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:17.320]
That's it and I think number one and number two are a very good apropos in this case

[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:22.300]
Have you got it, Ian? But I thought you were the guy that was giving me a big song and a dance just the only weeks ago

[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.840]
About how you were so excited he was back

[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:28.700]
You remember? Come on, you're a pickle, you're a pickle pickle and you're a biker

[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.760]
You're like a butterfly in a heat and...

[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.060]
But Rick and SUDSUCK started getting into them a lot more, I guess

[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.060]
Well we don't want to get into them

[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:37.920]
Okay and one thing, if the dog was good at Super Bowl in Tampa

[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:42.300]
Yeah, would you go? Are you kidding me? Of course I would go

[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:43.640]
You got how you would you got to take...

[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.200]
I'd take Rick Weaver's spot

[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:51.100]
Oh, okay. And one more thing about ratings, how did QAM versus WROD do in the sports talk, Rick?

[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:55.820]
Oh, geez, I got all this stuff here but I never thought anybody would ask to ask today

[01:23:56.940 --> 01:24:00.980]
Well, we don't have the hour by hour, the book won't be in for a couple days, I can give you seven in midnight

[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:02.220]
Okay, that's what I think

[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:05.320]
I know 12 plus seven in midnight, IOD had a three which was...

[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.580]
No, that's not right, that was 25 to 50, we're just a second, just a second

[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.600]
Well you're a pain Ian, you really are her

[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:11.120]
I'm sorry

[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:11.880]
You're a pain in the ass

[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.900]
Sometimes I can't do you

[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.860]
Like crap, okay, here we go

[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:19.240]
Thank you

[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:22.880]
Night time, seven in midnight, 12 plus, WROD had

[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.520]
Where the hell are we? Boy, are we on this page even?

[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.640]
We had a three three up from a two nine, Hank is moving up

[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.980]
He was only on a part of that thing, we're increasing your night

[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:35.040]
And WQAM, seven in midnight had a 1.2 down from a one five

[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:35.520]
Uh-oh

[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:38.880]
Uh-oh, here comes the money, there goes your money, no more meds

[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:39.820]
Okay

[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.560]
Is that an answer your question?

[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.180]
Yes, I appreciate it

[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:48.600]
Ian have a wonderful life and as soon as Calvin's ready for the announcement, believe me, we are ready for him

[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.560]
You guys have an exclusive

[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.300]
Okay

[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.240]
Talk to you later

[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.160]
Have a good day

[01:24:52.800 --> 01:25:01.720]
It's 11.56 at WIOD, boy do I feel great today now that I left my contribution to the breed last night, here's a starline mobile in Fort Lauderdale

[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:02.920]
Dale, when is this?

[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:06.980]
Hey, I was just wondering, since I am on the starline

[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:13.760]
And all those crappy mobile phones called in, I was wondering how does this radio phone sound

[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.220]
Radio phone?

[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.460]
Yeah, well, yeah

[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.980]
So other phones, so it's radio waves, and we're around 800 meg

[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:29.300]
Yeah, but just the way you put that it was like so pseudo intellectual, I was incredible, very technical

[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:31.280]
Yes, well how does it sound?

[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:31.680]

[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:32.360]
Crapie

[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:35.820]
11.57, I was okay, I just wanted, he just wanted that

[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:39.000]
Why do you always put on West Palm Beach, it sounds like Big Al from Boka

[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.680]
Are you Big Al from Boka?

[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:42.620]
Hello

[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:44.780]
Hello

[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:45.880]
Is this Big Al?

[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.240]
Oh, this ain't Big Al, this is Big Jim

[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.460]
Okay, hold on Jim, same difference

[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:51.460]
Oh, is this Jim?

[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:52.140]
Yeah

[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:54.960]
Is this our ticket, the plundry?

[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.020]
Yeah, this is a ticket, Jim

[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:57.120]
Chicken, Jim

[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.640]
Take it, take it, Jim

[01:25:58.640 --> 01:25:59.680]
Chicken, Jim?

[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.580]
Take it, Chris, first Jim

[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:04.720]
Hey listen, don't let Marlon Brando get a hold of you Jim, do you hear that story?

[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.340]
Okay, I'm sorry, how you doing?

[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.440]
I can, no, I didn't hear this story, why'd you tell me?

[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:12.040]
No, I don't want to tell you, do not on the ear, so what's going on Jim?

[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:16.460]
Well, I'm gonna see up there, you know, figures, I, you know

[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:21.760]
But last time I went to a prior mutual choice, and it wants me to get down there, I was at this chain

[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:22.480]
Yeah

[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:24.020]
And they put the wrong dog up

[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.180]
Here comes the bunny

[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:30.680]
Yeah, Monday I finally took my friend to go down to Pompo, hasn't been there all year

[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.820]
And the power went off

[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.780]
And you guys already left, you must have finished dinner already

[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:36.440]
Yeah, that's right

[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.000]
So what have you been running?

[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:41.420]
I got stuck down in North Miami, I said, gee, I can't get to Pompo, no time

[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.220]
I'll catch a last three or four races in Hollywood, what happened at Don't Court the Law?

[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.300]
You are what they call a kiss of death, Jim

[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:50.060]
State that

[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.940]
I wish, but you could have driven Jeff's awesome in the 10th race last night at Pompo, Park

[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.200]
You'd have been awesome

[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.780]
You know Stanley Tantz told me I had great hands to drive

[01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.340]
Did he?

[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:00.840]
I'm still waiting for the right roll

[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:04.020]
He keeps telling Harold Kelly that too, but it doesn't seem to be getting a job done

[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:08.000]
Stanley by the way, Hannah Horace went off one to five last night in the second race

[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.960]
And I had the winner now race by the way, but didn't bet him flat, I had him in the double

[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.280]
Did not have the double because of 40 to one shot on a third race

[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.560]
And Indie Nalobel won a second with Sepp Nichols

[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.840]
But anyway, brief a tire with Harold Kelly went off one to five, Stanley Tantzoo trained a second race, you know where he finished?

[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:23.460]
A desperate third

[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:24.600]
A desperate third

[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:29.480]
Yes, Sting, whipping, slashing and gasping for oxygen in the deep stretch

[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.520]
Now let me answer something

[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.760]
Stan Bird's the only thing

[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.080]
How much do double pay?

[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:33.440]
Right

[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.380]
A lot

[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.740]
It paid like 268 or something like that

[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.180]
You're 600 bucks, 600 bucks

[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:40.560]
He knows there's nothing like those dollar double wheels

[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.080]
There you go, he's the only one

[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.500]
Well listen, here comes the bunny, we'll see you're Friday, 10th race, Christmas, don't forget

[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.420]
Okay, so how do Renee and they don't?

[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:49.760]
Okay, and Don Brainer, and Jeff Gregory

[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.720]
Jeffery, somebody's gonna have to put you over their knee and spank you, baby

[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.820]
We have something we're going on there, what is your story?

[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:01.740]

We're gonna go over 110

[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:25.520]
What is this card? What is his picture of a lion to the king of beasts of talk entertainment radio like this picture of the lion

[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:31.600]
Whoo oh from Gilbert the cards from together the writing was like pre-pubescent

[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:37.480]
Now that explains it you know Gilbert's getting little a much you know it don't you think so the promoted calder

[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:41.300]
I thought he was well. We stifled him pretty good. He's just getting out of hand

[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:48.440]
Anyway the reason I played the Rick Sanchez thing you see the thing in a paper. He's got malaria and he's pretty happy about it

[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:54.520]
Because he'd been getting ill and chills and fever and wow sit next to Sally and Penny and

[01:30:55.180 --> 01:31:00.480]
It didn't know what the hell it was and it said somebody pre-sperformed the last rights and he woke up and he looked up

[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:02.920]
He thought he was in the godfather. He was just confused and

[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:08.060]
Now it's malaria which is treatable and he's grateful and we wish him a speedy recovery

[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.940]
Which probably explains why he's been singing like that. That's a good explanation if you had malaria

[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:19.000]
You'd sound like that, too

[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.920]
It's 1208 at W. I. O. D. We have an open line in date County 7501

[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:30.840]
I'm just looking at this is this oh this isn't a check. Oh man. Oh man

[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.340]
It's from Mary at the University of Miami

[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:40.440]
Mary says a few weeks ago I heard a caller on your show

[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:42.260]
So then when you bought a herald from a vending machine

[01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:44.240]
He took all of the papers recently

[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.000]
I read the papers are purchased by people who don't work for the herald

[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:53.720]
But people who work an extra job for added income they fill the machines hoping that those buying papers will be honest to leave the papers

[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:57.920]
And I've been paper blah blah blah and so in other words they lose money not the herald

[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:02.460]
But all those poor slabs that fill up the machines lose money if you steal a papers

[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:05.780]
I'd still do it

[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:10.620]
It's 1209 at W. I. O. D. We also have an open line in Palm Beach at 655

[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:17.440]
9463 655 W. I. O. D. Got to clear the mong out of my throat. You're ready for an exciting two hours

[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.820]
Rick and Spud will be here from two to six

[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:24.940]
Oh, it's a psychic thing. I can't believe it Rose

[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:28.460]
Hi, how are you? I was just during the news break

[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.620]
I kept that kid boy and other some people we haven't heard from it a while like

[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:37.840]
Rick no, I'm serious like Rose and Rick from the vent from the video rip off store whatever he's doing

[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:40.940]
Video overcome over to the video no

[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:47.000]
You know Rose those guys are all flash and okay. I know that all talk

[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.680]
Okay, well, I don't see him anymore. Yeah, well, we didn't have time for us

[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:53.380]
We only got Corey bugger

[01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:00.280]
Corey now let me ask you a question because you're a very astute observer of the passing scene

[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:04.660]
I try you know who Corey is yeah, we did the song. Yeah, that sounds great at the stadium

[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:09.840]
But like mush on this cart that we got here. Yeah, is he me coming a little chronic do you think? Okay?

[01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:12.620]
I haven't on your show or on the station

[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:13.840]
And

[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:20.620]
And I wish this KS would stop sending me these pornographic pictures. I've seen it all okay

[01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:27.760]
This guy's been sending these for 15 years he keeps sending me these pictures, okay of all these hot young guys doing discussed

[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:28.680]
Oh, look at that

[01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:36.080]
I'll tell you this blue lagoon. What do they call the return of the blue lagoon?

[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:38.480]
I see these are supposed to be their children

[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.100]
You said blue good. That's fantastic, but paradise

[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.620]
He looks great, but the movie sucked okay had both movies sucked

[01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:50.320]
But I mean the people look great who cares if the movie is good if the people look good enough

[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:52.700]
Okay, well, I thought you're talking about something now

[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:57.340]
Now you sound great you feel you say you've gained weight, but you feel good

[01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.040]
Well, I mean I got to lose the weight again

[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:02.700]
I better do it because man is my blood sugar this morning was about eight million

[01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:09.200]
And that experience I headed the track. I don't know why because I mean I've lost I've had when my old real gambling days

[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:13.020]
I've had nights of the track when I just punched my brains out and I didn't lose a lot of money

[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:18.500]
But I was just I'm just so tired of seeing crap that shouldn't be allowed to go on and I'm gonna speak out again

[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:21.660]
I don't care about what it is. I'm gonna I want to stop see it stop

[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:22.760]
Yeah, I want that stress

[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:27.260]
Because I'm just mind being ripped off myself or just seen a bunch of incompetence out there

[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:28.640]
I mean it's just got to stop

[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:34.940]
Well, and I think that some of those stewards over there ought to start opening up their eyes and start doing something about it instead of looking

[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:36.680]
You know up up in the air somewhere

[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:38.820]
Well, I wanted to also add

[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:43.580]
I'm also sick and tired of super Dave coming out of the table to you know sitting up there with Gary side belt

[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:47.740]
Go up there with Mitchell Dave and just leave us alone. Will you you're bugging me?

[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:50.100]
Can you believe super Dave comes to the table now?

[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.980]
What table at the track?

[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:53.880]
Yeah, in fact rich

[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:59.300]
We're just minding our own business plunging our guts out getting aggravated and now we got to put up with super Dave and Alombardo

[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:01.660]
Just everybody go jump from the roof, okay?

[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.340]
Well, I enjoyed it. Did we have a good time and called her? I'm not sure because sometimes when they're chaotic like that

[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:15.680]
You get through you don't know you can't tell I think I got about three hours of it and when it really got heavy into

[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.360]
To the racing, you know, I don't think I heard that part well

[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.300]
We didn't get heavy in it because we couldn't see it so we just you know there was no and

[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:27.300]
Gilbert was fine because you kept him under wraps, you know, yeah, but see off the air what you don't hear in the background

[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.440]
He's bugging me and bugging me

[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:33.340]
We have that a chance to talk yet, but you know I came out here holding back a bunch of things

[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:38.540]
What's that phone number for what's it there? What's that phone number? I then he won't call me anymore

[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.100]
Yeah, but you know fat rich can run interference real well

[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:46.480]
Yeah, rich was already there when we got there he they had the whole tent set up around in fact rich was the tent

[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:48.560]
They used his shirt for the tent

[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.780]
Well, you know, I wanted to call and talk about

[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:54.360]
I wish that rich would call into they talk about that race last night

[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:57.900]
I you know, I don't want to be the only one and I'm not trying to stir up because like I said

[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:02.780]
Poppano is beautiful. I love it. They're great. They treat me wonderful. I love harness racing. I love the sport

[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:06.640]
I love you know, but boy there are a couple of these guys out there man

[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:09.620]
Go back to Canada where you came from go back to Quebec

[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:13.040]
You should know what you got banjo between your knees. I know

[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:20.340]
There was no you know, I wanted to call about Thursdays not landing. Yeah, no, I don't get to watch it often

[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:23.620]
And I got about 45 minutes of that night and Val

[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:24.560]

Uh mental problem. He has a mental problem. Yeah, and that birth at birth

[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:34.440]
Well, don't you remember don't you remember she fell off the horse and hit her head

[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:37.240]
No, she's that's what I say. I don't get to watch it a while after that

[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.700]
She started being like wacko and now she's just getting worse and worse every week and she's

[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:46.520]
What is she taking while she's pretending to be taking something but she's slipping something else in those

[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.700]
Yeah, yeah, she's pretending to do something. Yeah, she's taking the same stuff Elaine that tortakes I think

[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:53.460]
Okay, well

[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.980]
You can put me a magazine called doggy down. Do I get what once in a while it slips in here? What

[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:01.560]
Premier Magus

[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.880]
Wait a minute wait a minute. I thought you're talking about something else

[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:12.220]
Okay, relax Rick. Thank you. Okay, take to aspirin Rick

[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:14.300]
Then you do see it right hold on a second

[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:17.520]
Yeah, cuz I got to do a break and you're so nice and you've been out a long time

[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:21.900]
But I haven't let you say anything rose 1214 to W. I. O. D. At Toyota of Hawking

[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:24.180]
So anyway, so anyway, oh

[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:25.480]
I already said that

[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:27.440]
Yeah

[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:36.340]
Rose yeah, I'm here. What happened? I'm sorry. I got caught up in something you had cut it you got cut off cut up and oh

[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:38.760]
Okay, okay, we were talking about premier magazine, but

[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:45.880]
They do show it the up and coming in the you know like in the far future like what they're making now what they want to make

[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:49.880]
It's for what movies and so forth. It's pretty interesting. Yeah, the story is here

[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.060]
I see some pictures now, and I think that's what I want to make in the future

[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:00.700]
You like return a blue lagoon. Yeah. Oh

[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:01.720]
Rose

[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:07.300]
Trust me you'll be on the floor. Okay, you said awakening didn't sound didn't appeal to you

[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:12.540]
Well, I mean just the way cost for describing it. Of course. He's such a sued. I mean, and I saw the previews of it too

[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:17.800]
You know robber I got to be honest with you the more I see of Robert De Niro the less I like him

[01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:20.120]
He's always got that same

[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.420]
Expression that same

[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:25.580]
You know the one I mean. Yes, always

[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:30.340]
Like even in good fellows, which was a very good movie, but he still always had that same

[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:37.020]
You remember like in godfather Marlon Brando had that one like when sonny got shot on the cause way

[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:41.900]
He had that one certain expression. You know, I mean like hopefully and that like stood out

[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:43.520]
But he didn't always have that on his face

[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:46.400]
He had like different expressions especially with all the cotton in his cheeks

[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:49.040]
It was like putting it in different places where some of which we can't mention

[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.980]
But like Robert De Niro he's always got that same. I don't know

[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:55.360]
Well, the thing is he can't get away from that

[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:58.700]
But do you think he really does that like in real life? I hope not

[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:04.000]
I love Robin Williams. I love Robin. I go to any Robin Williams movie. He's great

[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.180]
And always movies he's great, but his movies are always great dead poet society. I couldn't

[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:14.340]
Huh sees today. Yeah, that was terrible. I didn't think dead poet society was that good

[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.780]
I couldn't even get through the first 20 minutes. It was pretty

[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:21.340]
Well, he's in a Robin Williams thing. I mean he was there, but they kind of yeah

[01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:24.660]
So anyway, this is a good movie is that what you're trying to say? Well, I haven't seen it

[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:28.660]
I'm just you know you said I was just wondering if you knew something I didn't know no

[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:32.720]
I just uh, it's just the whole thing they had in Sephalytis and they came back years later

[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:36.380]
I don't want to go see a movie about a bunch of people who had in Sephalytis

[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:37.640]
I mean we got enough of that down here

[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:41.900]
I can see but in fact most of the people down here act like even if they didn't have in Sephalytis

[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:42.560]
They got it

[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:48.080]
Don't they? Yeah, so who needs then? Well, I agree and on that note it is. Although it is a true story

[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.720]
Yes, now I do like two stories in fact

[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:54.340]
I don't read fiction. I always read non-fiction because I don't have time to read fiction

[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:59.620]
Well anyway at any rate any Robin Williams movie I will go to what about Elvis rose sensory

[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:04.540]
Okay, now well since you asked um, did you ever see him in person? No, okay

[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:08.320]
I think that makes the difference because no don't get me wrong

[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.260]
I find is the whole story fascinating. I've read persil

[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:15.860]
I read you know like on a plane. It's always great to have a paperback and since I like reading non-fiction

[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:20.000]
You go in the store and even then I picked up the persilabook and with the other one the woman said you have a lot

[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.200]
I have read any books, huh? I haven't read any of the books but I'm just saying it's interesting

[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:26.580]
But it's just the obsession that people seem to have I mean

[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.380]
That's just like anything else. That's the nanny. That's the big golf report

[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:34.700]
What when I saw him he was doing his comeback. He was a minor beach convention hall

[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.880]
My girlfriend and I we were in there. We liked Elvis. We liked his son

[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:42.960]
But when we saw him when he came out on the stage. Oh, I mean

[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:48.960]
Those last couple of the last performance in Vegas was they showed on this thing on channel four yesterday afternoon on that

[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.040]
personality show

[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:55.120]
He was he was just it's a miracle that I mean the sweat was pouring off of them

[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.100]
He was like like parking out like I mean his poop is hanging over to his toes. He couldn't barely walk

[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:05.360]
How it came as a shock to anybody that this man and all the stories about his doctor and all these jellies

[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:09.580]
Pills he was described he was taking and he was prescribing for men at late at night

[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:13.900]
He would go to his dentist his dentist would set up appointments personal like in his office

[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:15.160]
He'd meet him there 11 o'clock at night

[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.900]
Not to do dental work, but to write prescriptions for I mean this guy was on more pills

[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.440]
Carter ever saw

[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:25.200]
And he used to take a bunch of pills to get knocked out in other words

[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:29.640]
He would get in the sack and not get knocked out and just lie there for hours and hours and then it was his whole life

[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:31.160]
And then he'd give him the uppers to get him up

[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:33.200]
I mean he just became a bitch

[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:40.040]
That was his whole ladder life right talking about when he that's what caught people was when they went to see him

[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:42.080]
Especially in the comeback. Yeah, okay

[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:46.260]
He looked great. He sounded great. He had oh you mean here

[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:47.860]
Yeah, not in Vegas

[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:53.640]
At the end he looked like oh no, no, no, you're the end. Don't get me wrong about that. I mean, you know

[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:57.760]
I saw him in like worth on his last tour. Yeah, and

[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:01.860]
For old times sake and I thought he was okay

[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:03.240]
but

[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:10.580]
Seeing him in 75 and seeing him then they just broke my heart. Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying that you know

[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:16.620]
It's wrong to be a fan, but I mean to carry to such an extreme like he was the emperor of the universe or the president of the US or like

[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.880]
I'd say the people of this world they're they're not

[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:27.040]
In this is like the inquirer inside additional like garbage. It's fanatic. It's sensational. Yeah, I like it

[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.060]
But one thing may I say one thing okay?

[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:29.540]
Um

[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:32.600]
On the positive side my brother

[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:39.140]
I'm very proud of him. He's he works for metraday. Yeah, and he made lieutenant great

[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.520]
He used to listen to you, but he can't anymore

[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:47.100]
But I know some of the people in his office listen to you as we speak probably and I just want to say

[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:51.900]
I'm very proud of him and congratulations and it's just wonderful

[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:57.960]
And keep up the great work. He's not a pig at work. I'm the pig at home. I have to go. I'll say okay

[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:07.880]
Have a great life Rose. It's a delight. Okay. See you. Yeah, she's nice 1223 at W. I. D. We have an open line in day 751 one in Palm Beach 655 if you're looking for a night

[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:32.780]

Everybody's got a backpack back machine

[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:53.600]

Then watch your boss get booted out the door

[01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.320]
Everybody's got a back machine

[01:44:19.230 --> 01:44:22.070]

Well 30 at W. I. O. D. We are doing it some of the colors dropped off

[01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:56.150]
I can't believe because we had rose on for half an hour

[01:44:56.150 --> 01:45:01.410]
It's too bad if you don't like it tough banana. She's great. We love rose. We have an open line in day 751

Mobile in Miami on the deadline. Hello. Hey deal. Yeah. How you doing today? Okay?

[01:45:18.910 --> 01:45:22.450]
I'm listening to our first time caller great. Thought I'd give you a call

[01:45:22.450 --> 01:45:27.670]
We just got out of that royal castle. You talked about a couple months ago. I mean Wayne Ardell's royal castle sure at

[01:45:28.130 --> 01:45:31.450]
125th and northwest 7th Avenue in North Miami. I've ever had

[01:45:31.450 --> 01:45:35.050]
Yes, sir. We'll be back to the good old days here in Miami. Can't be to with a stick

[01:45:35.050 --> 01:45:39.350]
But I had something what are those things from New York home those white hunts? Oh

[01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:42.610]
The best the best little sausage

[01:45:42.610 --> 01:45:47.690]
Well, whatever. It's not good personal sir. I had a call you you were talking about

[01:45:47.690 --> 01:45:51.970]
54 Christmas you had a caller talking to about how many Quebec license places were where?

[01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:58.650]
Oh, you're gonna start me on a French Canadian again man. Sorry about I am so hysterical about French Canadians after last night

[01:45:58.650 --> 01:46:01.890]
I'll tell you I would pay for the bus that would take them all back

[01:46:01.890 --> 01:46:07.630]
I'd buy a misalame sandwich and stick them on a bus and give them a one-way ticket man never to come back again

[01:46:07.630 --> 01:46:11.370]
Well, they do this town all winter long. I wouldn't do to

[01:46:12.630 --> 01:46:15.050]
Saddam Hussein. How do you like them apples?

[01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:19.310]
Well, yeah, that would be nice to send them over there. Yeah, send them over there right

[01:46:19.810 --> 01:46:24.770]
I'm gonna match made in heaven and stick them in a Iraqi army. Okay by Lex Monday

[01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:29.250]
Well, we were over in the beach last night and I we just for the hell we're going up and down the beach

[01:46:29.250 --> 01:46:34.030]
And I started looking at the license plate. See was in town and they're all Quebec. Yeah, they're all Quebec

[01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:38.410]
Anyway, I just thought I'd give you a call. Okay, sir. Have a great life. We're going see you

[01:46:39.090 --> 01:46:43.930]
1231 at W.I.O. Do we have an open line in date one on a starlight want to Palm Beach still three if I count him right

[01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:47.570]
I don't function very well when you have like less than 400 calls on the board

[01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:51.050]
Do we ever find out what the problem was with the phone by the way

[01:46:51.050 --> 01:46:51.770]
Oh

[01:46:52.770 --> 01:46:57.930]
Mitch said it was southern bell so of there stick it in your pipe and eat it

[01:46:59.470 --> 01:47:07.570]
And if Mitch Wien says it's southern bell you know it's southern bell because Mitch Wien is the greatest broadcast engineer in the history of

[01:47:07.570 --> 01:47:09.050]
the 79th Street Causeway

[01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:11.810]
North Lauderdale

[01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:18.350]
Hello, yes, sir. Did you see that face face last night? I saw them all

[01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:23.610]
Did you see what Don Brainer did with that one or what? Oh, wait a minute, sir. Let me ask you a question

[01:47:23.610 --> 01:47:28.450]
Yeah, is this going to be a bitching session for people that bet on Donald Brainered? No, no, no, no

[01:47:28.450 --> 01:47:29.390]
Don Brainered

[01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:33.610]
I just curious how a one was can wind up six on the break

[01:47:35.370 --> 01:47:40.290]
And why they don't penalize these guys a little first of all some horses have no gate speed however

[01:47:40.290 --> 01:47:47.390]
It is interesting to me that the horse you're talking about left the last time and was parked out in 58 and one so that is rather interesting

[01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:52.950]
Is it right when you're but when you're worrying about Donald Brainered sir? You must be in a dream or you didn't bet that horse

[01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:59.430]
Did you I believe in another Donald Brainered? Yeah, oh my god? He's got to win one once and oh hey

[01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:03.850]
It's too early wait till April okay just like last you wait till about the last two weeks

[01:48:04.410 --> 01:48:05.150]
Wait till I

[01:48:08.970 --> 01:48:13.730]
Well, I don't understand is why they let some of this dead meat to be out there on a tray

[01:48:13.730 --> 01:48:17.070]
That's what I just do not understand because it makes for bad relations. You're upset

[01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:19.010]
I'm upset you weren't there for the 10th race

[01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:24.110]
No, I wasn't I am gonna tell you if you as upset as you are if you would have been and I bet a lot

[01:48:24.110 --> 01:48:26.650]
I had a couple of bucks across because it was a big price and Gregory

[01:48:26.650 --> 01:48:28.010]
I thought might give it a shot

[01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:32.870]
Jeff's awesome this horse started out last and moved backward rapidly and

[01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:37.130]
Distanced again like he did the previous time you know you figure look at the previous time the race was fast

[01:48:37.130 --> 01:48:38.190]
It may have been an off-night

[01:48:38.190 --> 01:48:42.510]
He won a night before the time before that in the same time that the race went last night

[01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:44.210]
So you think he's got a shot he's dropping down

[01:48:44.210 --> 01:48:49.690]
This horse had no more business running on a track than you and I pulling a chariot. Okay. I mean forget it

[01:48:49.690 --> 01:48:51.870]
Yeah, and I am pretty p-oat about it

[01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:57.370]
Well, you see the problem I think is that they they find them like 50 bucks or something from

[01:48:57.370 --> 01:49:00.890]
It's ridiculous. Pack them up and send them back where they came from

[01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:03.490]
I'll let they set them down for a month that would mean

[01:49:03.490 --> 01:49:07.250]
But I think we ought to set you down because if you're betting on Donald Brainerd sir

[01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:11.710]
We're gonna have to have a seminar and get you straightened out. Okay. I'll see you. Don't do it again

[01:49:11.710 --> 01:49:14.970]
Thank you. Okay. Wow. Can you believe that?

[01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:21.610]
Oh, man, even fat rich was about to make a weight-run at horse. I said boy if you do that

[01:49:21.610 --> 01:49:26.670]
I'm gonna crawl under the table and I'm gonna make cackling sounds for the next four hours and quite frankly

[01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:28.990]
I'd have been better off by doing it W-I-O-D

[01:49:28.990 --> 01:49:30.590]
Oh no, please hold on

[01:49:31.330 --> 01:49:33.430]
Let's go to Miami

[01:49:34.050 --> 01:49:39.890]
Neil yes, sir. How you doing sir? I'm doing it. Okay, um buddy. Look I'm not pissed off or anything but

[01:49:40.410 --> 01:49:45.310]
But there's always a big button to work here exactly as Dave Gamewood said reference to a collar

[01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:48.830]
You had a little wall ago. Wow there's been so many. Yeah that Latin guy

[01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:55.890]
Remember that you said yeah comment about no cash rolls, but yeah anyway. What about to tell characters, but you know something we don't

[01:49:55.890 --> 01:49:58.650]
No, no, that really that's personally the only guy but anyway

[01:49:58.650 --> 01:49:59.190]
um

[01:49:59.650 --> 01:50:05.490]
You know, there's a lot of things that people say about land and this and that but if you want to keep your ratings up

[01:50:05.490 --> 01:50:10.730]
Uh, about 80% of you know of your loyal listeners, which I happen to be one

[01:50:10.730 --> 01:50:16.590]
You know, I love your show. Yeah, but you know, you really got to refrain from comments about land because oh

[01:50:16.590 --> 01:50:19.230]
So in other words, I can talk about anybody and everybody else

[01:50:19.230 --> 01:50:23.630]
But if I make a little joke about latins because we had some homophobic jackass on a phone

[01:50:23.630 --> 01:50:27.370]
Then right away you're going to take it personally now you're not gonna become uptight. Are you sir?

[01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:30.510]
Excuse me? You're not gonna become uptight. No, no, I'm not uptight

[01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:33.630]
That's the first thing I told you look I'm not pissed off because I've you know

[01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:36.010]
I've heard a lot of people say a lot of comments, but you know

[01:50:36.010 --> 01:50:41.510]
You got to take you got to take into consideration people that do take it personally the people that do listen your show

[01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:44.210]
Well, let me just say this to you if that if you know

[01:50:44.210 --> 01:50:48.070]
reminds me of the Alice Rantel thing if every if I had to take into consideration

[01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:49.950]
That everybody was thin skin

[01:50:49.950 --> 01:50:56.230]
Then I would never talk about anything from a Sally Fitz to Rick Sanchez to Alice Rantel to anybody or any group or any person anything

[01:50:56.230 --> 01:50:58.770]
There'd be no show that's a big part of what I do

[01:50:58.770 --> 01:51:01.850]
I really never heard you say any any type of comments about any other

[01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:04.150]
Ratio, you know any other rating, you know

[01:51:04.150 --> 01:51:05.090]
Oh my god

[01:51:05.090 --> 01:51:12.210]
I did a whole show here one day a couple of months ago about how the whole society is becoming black and raw rapping and white people are in the rap music and all

[01:51:12.210 --> 01:51:16.370]
What are you talking about? Don't be thin skin. It's beneath you sir

[01:51:17.110 --> 01:51:23.890]
Yeah, maybe you're right consider the source of the call we were talking to okay consider that slime ball is busy picking at Fidel's butt

[01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:33.110]
Anyway, um, I got a little message for uh, yeah, Mr. Dave game and and willie and uh

[01:51:33.110 --> 01:51:37.230]
Them to the same way will he sims yeah? Yeah, they uh

[01:51:37.230 --> 01:51:40.350]
You know try to try to get him on a neutral system or something because

[01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:42.930]
No, these guys shouldn't even be working for anybody

[01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:51.430]
Just the comment the talk okay listen. Yeah, how big is your TV screen? Uh, 27 inches

[01:51:52.530 --> 01:51:54.970]
No, your TV screen my TV screen

[01:51:56.450 --> 01:52:02.950]
Ever great day all right see you 1237 at W. I. Would you hey listen? He should be a stand-up tall and proud

[01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:09.210]
If you can stand up we have an open line a day at 751 and one in Palm Beach six five five

[01:52:09.210 --> 01:52:13.810]
You know, it's interesting you would call because that's a perfect example of all is crap back in fourth been going about

[01:52:14.850 --> 01:52:21.590]
It's just uh, you know, it's just a radio show and that's true. It's not that's not I'm not gonna say that to be like a cover-up

[01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:27.350]
It's a show. It's life if you can't have a good laugh at yourself and it light I mean life is a joke

[01:52:28.930 --> 01:52:32.550]
W-I-O-D. Yeah, so I like to speak to you please you bet you hold on

[01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:36.530]
22 and a half before one at your insecure idiotic

[01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:40.750]
Ostracized ostrich size station W-I-O-D

[01:52:42.630 --> 01:52:48.290]
Anyway, it's a 1240 a W-I-O-D and Iliana is up on a chair there. Well, no she means she's riding on a blackboard

[01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:49.490]
and

[01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:55.210]
We just opened up a couple more checks here 108 we just crossed another barrier. How do you like that? A

[01:52:55.750 --> 01:53:00.010]
Hey Uncle Neil the new improved skinny Johnny dark here. I oh you're supposed to be in the next break

[01:53:00.430 --> 01:53:04.150]
Anyway, I thought it was the other thing in there. I don't know what's it see the machines are on the floor

[01:53:04.150 --> 01:53:07.690]
Now I got to cue that up again. She's Johnny cut the crap. Boy, yeah

[01:53:08.350 --> 01:53:12.870]
I thought the douche man was in that thing but that's what happens when a cart machines are on the floor

[01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:13.630]
Mitch okay

[01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:17.150]
blame Southern bell for everything, but in the meantime, where's our cart deck?

[01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:21.710]
Don't you think in honor of this really great book that I just had with a six three when all those great demographics

[01:53:21.710 --> 01:53:27.830]
They had to put that a cart deck right there and cut the crap and stop with the excuses. Let's get on top of it

[01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:33.930]
Anyway, what's our just an oh Iliana change the total hundred eight thousand twenty six we just crossed the 108 barrier outstanding

[01:53:34.150 --> 01:53:38.370]
Now what are we doing? We're going to a north lottery deal. Feel how you doing okay?

[01:53:38.590 --> 01:53:39.930]
I had the un

[01:53:40.630 --> 01:53:44.230]
Unprivileged of listening to Steve Katie other day wow and what a guy

[01:53:44.230 --> 01:53:49.490]
Just like he said I mean he said nothing else better to do to talk about you and Rick and suds

[01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:54.350]
No, my like Tony. He showed boils down to three components me Rick and sud suck and

[01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:56.530]
mouth-reliated and that's good

[01:53:57.690 --> 01:54:02.430]
Well, he's got a psychosis about me that stems back to when he first came in his time

[01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:04.830]
I've never seen anything like it in my life you went in to New York

[01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:08.070]
We used to get spy reports from people calling from the city or around New York

[01:54:08.610 --> 01:54:12.530]
Saying was talking about me on here now what the hell do I mean on wabc in New York?

[01:54:12.530 --> 01:54:14.930]
I've never worked in a market most of the people are never heard of me

[01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:21.890]
But he's just got this obsession and not only Alyssa. I mean get a life already Steve get a life beside the baseball card

[01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:25.870]
You can't look at them. I mean look at his white doesn't put out and he he tells that on the air

[01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:28.230]
You let everybody know about it come on sir

[01:54:28.230 --> 01:54:29.370]
Put you

[01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:35.750]
Let me ask you this if you were married to Steve

[01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:37.470]
Would you be busy?

[01:54:38.210 --> 01:54:40.250]
Probably not probably not

[01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:42.670]
Now what was the other?

[01:54:43.050 --> 01:54:47.890]
Somebody told me that you had a hernia operation and I just had one a hernia operation

[01:54:47.890 --> 01:54:53.570]
No, I have a mental hernia. What a mental hernia? Why would that help her? They had a hernia operation. I did

[01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:55.010]
My name is Kimpy

[01:54:55.690 --> 01:54:56.130]
Kimpy

[01:54:56.970 --> 01:54:58.890]
Do you want to make one of my names?

[01:54:59.310 --> 01:54:59.750]
Kimpy

[01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:03.610]
Yeah, wimpy I just heard the operation

[01:55:04.630 --> 01:55:05.070]
Okay

[01:55:05.930 --> 01:55:10.970]
1243 at wio d. I was Steve's brother calling and we have an open line in brown at 52494635

[01:55:11.590 --> 01:55:13.410]
Wio. D. Georgia's on a bat line

[01:55:14.290 --> 01:55:21.450]
Yeah, Neil hold on is that Phil Saltsman? Okay, let's get right to it ladies and gentlemen the voice of reason is calling from Colorado

[01:55:21.450 --> 01:55:26.370]
Rastrak, a man who gave you more 240 horses on Friday than we've ever seen in one card in one day

[01:55:27.070 --> 01:55:30.470]
Meal I've been listening to you most of the morning and you are on a roll today

[01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:36.450]
A man who invested a man who invested $55 in a bet three and got back $20 to 60 but cashed

[01:55:36.450 --> 01:55:41.030]
Atta boy, I feel you're doing it. It's not important whether you win a lose as long as you cash

[01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:47.050]
Now let me ask you a question. I don't want to get you involved because you're in a you know in a student observer for many years of the racing scene

[01:55:47.050 --> 01:55:53.670]
It's torn up many a ticket and I'm just you do you hear my comments about this and I'm not a bad loser. I'm really not as you know

[01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:57.570]
But there are some horses you see at racetracks that

[01:55:58.830 --> 01:56:05.670]
Obviously don't belong out there, okay, and don't you agree that a little bit more could be done would create a little more confidence with the public

[01:56:05.670 --> 01:56:07.250]
I don't want to put you on the spot

[01:56:07.770 --> 01:56:09.730]
Yes, it's the answer to the question

[01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:13.770]
I mean this if you would have seen last night if you'd have been calling to race

[01:56:13.770 --> 01:56:17.330]
You'd have had to have like the Mount Palamart telescope to see where this horse was

[01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:20.450]
Well, you know, that's happened before but they're could you know

[01:56:20.450 --> 01:56:24.170]
I don't want to play devil's advocate, but there could be a lot of reasons why that happened

[01:56:24.170 --> 01:56:28.550]
Yeah, but it happened twice in a row and you didn't have to qualify after the first time, okay

[01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:31.510]
Well in a horse is distanced when it says D.I.S

[01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:37.590]
Okay, as in dis and that as in this this I just I think that maybe they ought to see if there's something wrong

[01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:42.830]
There before they let people make tangible support to it the next time out there on the track as it goes backward in about two

[01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:43.730]
14 but anyway

[01:56:44.290 --> 01:56:47.250]
That's neither here nor there right I guess so but uh no

[01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:48.650]
I would tend to agree with you Neil

[01:56:48.650 --> 01:56:54.630]
I've been fighting windmills in this game for 35 before years and it's good and the problem is the more you talk to folks about that

[01:56:54.630 --> 01:56:57.170]
I'm talking about the powers that be the more they just kind of hey

[01:56:57.170 --> 01:57:04.110]
Isn't it a pretty died and hey we got the lights on they just first whatever the reason they just these are certain things that they just don't

[01:57:04.110 --> 01:57:09.310]
Like hearing about well, you know sometimes you bring up points that are very hard to deal with you know

[01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:15.630]
They're not a there sometimes between a rock and a hard place themselves or maybe they're in Quebec which would be a good place for him

[01:57:15.630 --> 01:57:19.630]
Do we have any French Canadians that come into Gulf Stream by any chance? Oh, sure

[01:57:19.630 --> 01:57:23.790]
Oh, I don't mean the storage are calling me. Yes, sir

[01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:27.590]
Oh boy storage is called about that cripple heart. I'm sorry

[01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:31.270]
Don't know. I just have to make a quick announcement here. Okay. Go ahead

[01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:38.250]
Far be it for us to an fringewon the activities with colder raster didn't always make you feel like you're on the inside of something

[01:57:38.250 --> 01:57:40.210]
What feel has to make these announcements? I'm sorry

[01:57:40.210 --> 01:57:45.970]
I was just saying to our limited audience said it's always like kind of being on the inside of something when we have you on the phone

[01:57:45.970 --> 01:57:48.470]
And you get to make the and we hear this in the background yeah

[01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:53.510]
Well today is truth that I'm I'm kind of like a jack of all trades up here

[01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:57.630]
I'm almost everybody's whipping boy so to speak

[01:57:57.630 --> 01:58:02.610]
Well, like close me instead. I need this announcement made it's my obligation to do it

[01:58:02.610 --> 01:58:07.870]
So sometimes I get interrupted when I really don't want to but I can't take my phones off the hook

[01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:12.030]
Yeah, you know like surely you left your lights on go out to the park and like that's kind of stuff

[01:58:12.030 --> 01:58:14.210]
Oh, we've had we've had some great things

[01:58:14.210 --> 01:58:19.050]
You know you know my favorite ran in so anxious to make the double he locked the car doors ran in

[01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:21.730]
I had to make it announced to go out you left your motor running

[01:58:21.730 --> 01:58:23.470]
I will you took the words out of my mouth

[01:58:23.470 --> 01:58:27.850]
That's always my favorite that I was just jack rings that he tried yours the wife's dear then think he was making up

[01:58:27.850 --> 01:58:32.030]
Will so and so please report to lot a your lights are your

[01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:34.570]
Car is locked your engine is running

[01:58:35.850 --> 01:58:39.590]
And I always thought that was a fictitious, but I guess it's true. Yeah, it's true

[01:58:40.230 --> 01:58:42.610]
Probably those wise guy valley parkers right Eric

[01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:49.910]
Okay, so we got angel mine in the first race with early fires you came in yesterday one right off the bat from out of nowhere from Chicago

[01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:53.890]
Getting ready for the Gulf Stream meets so I'm going back with them again. Okay. Well here's the column

[01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:57.910]
Re-creating it from the top of the stretch here. We go there's a quarter of a month ago

[01:58:57.910 --> 01:59:00.530]
They turn for home. They went to happen 46 and three

[01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:04.010]
Don't be coy moves up on the outside to get the lead by a late

[01:59:04.010 --> 01:59:09.770]
I will leave the early paint centers back to second angel mine on the move is third then shining on between horses

[01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:16.010]
With sunny st. Tore the inside with birds with sparks to weaken then silver ragged toady deceptive bet looks for him on the inside

[01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:20.550]
They're most past the ace pole don't be coy extends early to three lights

[01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:24.070]
I'll only weakening as angel mine comes on down the middle of the track

[01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:28.690]
Then it's silver ragged toady with deceptive bet on the rail they come past the sixteenth pole

[01:59:28.690 --> 01:59:35.150]
Don't be coy as extended to lead to five. They're not going to get it today angel mine now moves into second position

[01:59:35.150 --> 01:59:41.090]
I will leave with deceptive bet they come to the wire and don't be coy and easy first time starter winner

[01:59:41.090 --> 01:59:45.790]
Angel mine was a clear and easy second deceptive bet gets up to be third

[01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:49.030]
Well second is a lot better than what we've been doing lately right?

[01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:53.810]
That's true and she ran a big race if this first time starter hadn't been something special

[01:59:53.810 --> 01:59:57.810]
She probably would have gotten a lot better than parsimonious I would say

[01:59:57.810 --> 02:00:03.050]
Oh, yeah, we won't mention that no hey listen herby can't win them all you know, so that's Katie Swini won that race

[02:02:19.970 --> 02:02:24.490]
I didn't send anybody a letter. I read the letter the fact that he's friends with these people

We have an open line and Broward 524 stiff 524 wio d. I would never want to come across the store loser because I'm not

[02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:36.490]

Uh, it's things listen. I know you don't talk about topics on your show. That's right

[02:12:53.250 --> 02:12:59.490]
But I'd like to you mentioned something about the racetrack and how the racetrack has an obligation to protect the public right

[02:12:59.490 --> 02:13:05.970]
And I would like to mention one subject real quick and maybe I'll save one person's money and heartache

[02:13:05.970 --> 02:13:10.610]
I got a dog from one of those local pet shops that are during the mall and

[02:13:11.770 --> 02:13:17.550]
The dog had just about died over the weekend and is having major surgery is gonna cost me about two grand

[02:13:18.210 --> 02:13:25.150]
Now the other thing was I found out last week that four other dogs they came from the same pet store have the same situation

[02:13:25.150 --> 02:13:35.090]
Bad health birth defects and everything else and I just I hope that somebody out there's listening to me does not go and buy a pet any kind of pets from these pet stores

[02:13:35.090 --> 02:13:39.230]
Well, listen do me a favor will you please? Yeah, sir. I'm not being facetious call up call up

[02:13:39.230 --> 02:13:45.610]
Is it Bob mayor who does that at channel four? Yeah, and call up Bob mayor channel four and get through to him

[02:13:45.610 --> 02:13:49.990]
I mean even after the message and they'll do what I suppose they are they've been doing a good number on that

[02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:54.770]
Well, I tell you know, I'm thinking about a lawsuit, but you know that's not the point

[02:13:55.150 --> 02:14:00.950]
But the fact is is that my family's gone through heartache and this dog had that major neck reconstructive surgery

[02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:05.730]
That sounds crazy, but I hopefully whoever's listening out to this great audience out there

[02:14:05.730 --> 02:14:11.850]
Please do not buy a dog or a cat or any other pet at the mall you save a lot of heartache. Okay, sir

[02:14:11.850 --> 02:14:14.510]

[02:15:53.210 --> 02:15:54.470]
Think you might turn it around

[02:15:55.110 --> 02:15:57.230]
In Tampa Bay no way Jose

[02:15:58.030 --> 02:16:02.850]
You don't think so. I'd be honest with you the Norman Braeman bothers me a lot. I mean, I don't like you

[02:16:02.850 --> 02:16:04.650]
You hear Norman Braeman I would hang out that night

Yes, sir. I know and Braeman bugs me

[02:16:08.410 --> 02:16:12.990]
He's one of these guys who's got a lot of money and is very smug about it. You know, they kind of talks down to him

[02:16:12.990 --> 02:16:13.350]
Right

[02:16:14.050 --> 02:16:21.130]
Exactly right. Yeah, but like that's something like Tampa Bay could use or quit. Why are you concerned about the Eagles or Tampa Bay?

[02:16:23.190 --> 02:16:26.570]
Norman Dawson fan. Well, there's so who cares about them? They're small potatoes

[02:23:42.570 --> 02:23:48.310]
I'm getting choked up from that last call. It's 129 and WI would do a 1249 sounds pretty interesting to me

[02:23:49.250 --> 02:23:54.110]
Oh, we have an open line in Palm Beach of course if you care to participate and if not we don't really care

[02:24:22.990 --> 02:24:26.470]
We're talking about from his plans. I mean, I'll I afraid he's an ugly guy

[02:24:26.470 --> 02:24:30.510]
He needs to go to the wizard of us to get a brain. Yeah, now a hand in though. I think it's a good

[02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:33.570]
I'm not talking about how they look okay. Although I wish they bring back Jim Dory

[02:24:33.970 --> 02:24:40.150]
Uh, do you remember Jim Dory? I remember Jim Dory. We have season tickets. Do you remember Jim McKenney?

[02:24:40.350 --> 02:24:44.790]
Jim McKenney my favorite player got his sweater. See the Leafs used to be good and we looked good now

[02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:50.470]
They just distinct but I mean no better. Yeah, I'm getting better. Hannah's a player and I'll tell you English playing pretty good in the goal, eh?

[02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:55.670]
Yeah, not bad. Better defense. That's what that's what does it? Right. That's what doesn't. And am I crucial?

[02:24:55.670 --> 02:25:02.410]
Let's just plan a pretty good game. Yeah, yeah, uh, when we're just waiting for the Russian guy to start right yeah

[02:25:02.850 --> 02:25:05.270]
How do you get all the trouble? How do you get all our

[02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:11.470]
Game you got a satellite. Yes, ma'am. Well, we got a satellite Toronto. We don't get I mean outside of our regular

[02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:18.290]
Channels we don't get hardly any of the Leafs games away. How do you get them? Well, you know what? No, I don't I only get Saturday night

[02:25:18.290 --> 02:25:24.610]
Oh, yeah Saturday night hockey night in Canada, eh? Right. What about Wednesday night? She don't get those. No, no see those are low you get that local

[02:25:24.610 --> 02:25:29.870]
Yeah, we get that local and I you know, I have had Bivalent feelings because Bob Cole I think it's pretty good, but

[02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:35.790]
I miss Bill Hewitt. I'm sorry. I agree. Bill Hewitt was the greatest hockey announcer in the history of the sport

[02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:38.730]
He really was. Well, Foster was good of course, but he was like an old time

[02:25:38.730 --> 02:25:40.790]
But Bill Hewitt made those games so exciting

[02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:45.230]
Cherry's great. He's a good in the beginning in the beginning. I didn't like him at all

[02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:48.510]
I hated him because I wanted to see the National Anthem with the organ and the thing

[02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:53.210]
That's a great spectacle. No, at the garden. So that's it's fun. It's great. It's great. But Don Cherry

[02:25:53.210 --> 02:25:56.770]
He grows on you. He's a lot of fun. He's got a big mouth like me and I like him

[02:25:57.850 --> 02:26:02.950]
That's why we like you and we got everybody in our store all the kids come in listen to your tape great

[02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:08.730]
Outstanding well the Leafs all the way okay some year great. Just remember punch him like lose

[02:26:09.570 --> 02:26:15.450]
Thanks Susan. Thanks, Neil. Bye bye. Isn't that great. We're getting a few maple leaf fans here a wonderful

[02:26:16.430 --> 02:26:17.670]
Boy, we could go Saturday

[02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:21.730]
They just beat the crap out of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh was in a real hot streak too

[02:26:21.730 --> 02:26:24.890]
And they came in and we just pasted him a six to three and I just loved it

[02:26:24.890 --> 02:26:29.330]
It was like bring back the old times right Bob Cole. Hey Bob gross him here. Well, yeah

[02:26:29.890 --> 02:26:33.130]
And Harry Neil he's okay too, but he's about 400 years old, and

[02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:39.870]
Man, I got I love when you get these like little coughing fits when you catch like a little hair in your nose Rick

[02:26:41.730 --> 02:26:42.090]
Wow

[02:26:44.110 --> 02:26:44.790]
It's fun

[02:26:45.730 --> 02:26:48.510]
And there's nothing have you ever seen like somebody on the news get that

[02:26:49.390 --> 02:26:53.530]
Get one of those coughing fits. Oh, that's just can you imagine being on camera because when the radio

[02:26:53.530 --> 02:26:57.770]
You shut off the mic or you can play a bit or you can just sit here and gag and tube like I'm doing

[02:26:57.770 --> 02:27:01.190]
Which I kind of enjoy because I like sharing everything with the audience whether it's good or bad

[02:27:04.410 --> 02:27:06.530]
But on TV it kind of like um

[02:27:07.470 --> 02:27:12.650]
Just as make it I'm fumbling around because I want to find something for Susan the nice lady and all our other fans out there

[02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:44.390]
Miami

That it's the teach that

[02:27:50.930 --> 02:27:51.890]

[02:28:11.850 --> 02:28:12.170]
I

[02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:16.130]
Mean I don't want to orientalist music up. Oh everybody's got their W.I.O.D. Watch. All right

[02:28:16.530 --> 02:28:22.850]
Oh, and I don't put it there come on. Oh, I guess it helps to know what time it is for that to we have an open line in Dave County

[02:28:24.570 --> 02:28:26.310]
751 9463 751

[02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:32.530]
I'm not gonna say it. Okay. I say a lot of stuff about management

[02:28:32.890 --> 02:28:38.150]
But you know they might be touching about that because mr. Disney himself personally came in here and did he give that to you personally?

[02:28:38.810 --> 02:28:42.450]
Oh, well, he gave me mine personally and I just you know

[02:28:43.470 --> 02:28:45.930]
He may be uptight about those watches. Okay, I mean

[02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:57.210]
Oh god and after you work here like 30 years you get like a regular band you get like a metal band

[02:28:59.050 --> 02:29:04.470]
Illuminati 26 till 2 at w. I. Ospreitz size D and will be right back

[02:29:09.070 --> 02:29:09.430]
Oh

[02:29:10.470 --> 02:29:16.330]
137 at w. I. O. D. Well, we're playing it today, but just a little bits and pieces because we don't want to get accused of a whole reacting right

[02:29:16.330 --> 02:29:17.030]
Pompano

[02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:22.950]
Oh, yes, sir. Yeah, there's a snail. Yeah. Yeah, this is a long time listener first time caller great

[02:29:22.950 --> 02:29:26.870]
I go to the paramutuals every once in a while. I've gone to highlight and

[02:29:27.350 --> 02:29:31.970]
Pompano Park and caller and what seems to me. I don't know if this happens. What does it seem to you?

[02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:37.410]
Okay, like when you go to highlight, you know these guys make these outrageous catches and everything and that whoops

[02:29:37.410 --> 02:29:41.670]
And then when the bottom right to them. Yeah, they can't seem to catch it. Well, that's one of those things

[02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:44.450]
You know and like you know what they say in baseball sometimes the ball

[02:29:44.450 --> 02:29:47.810]
It's it right at you the hardest to feel that sounds like a good excuse in them

[02:29:47.810 --> 02:29:52.470]
Yeah, okay, and the other gripe I had was at Pompano Park at one time. I had this horse that was going on

[02:29:52.470 --> 02:29:53.630]
It was about three years ago

[02:29:54.150 --> 02:30:01.670]
And he was leading at least by a length or two and what happened the jockey all of a sudden decides to stand up on the horse and let these other two horses

[02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:03.530]
What do you mean the jockey the jockey?

[02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:06.070]
You mean on the quarter horse on the quarter horse

[02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:09.630]
Well, the quarter horses had a lot of problems there and of course they are bringing them back

[02:30:09.630 --> 02:30:16.110]
So good luck to everybody concerned on that. Yeah, but I kind of distance myself from all of that quarter horse business because my feeling

[02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:18.230]
You know what they know what I call them quarter horses don't you?

[02:30:18.410 --> 02:30:20.150]
No, because that's as much as I'd ever been on

[02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:24.850]
Yeah, that's what it seems like. I'm just saying don't you think sometime that's for the whole night? That's for the whole card

[02:30:24.850 --> 02:30:31.010]
Yeah, that's like a lot of these races seem to be rigged sir. I didn't say that no, I'm just saying it you said that

[02:30:31.010 --> 02:30:35.890]
No, I'm saying that let's put it delicately sometimes they look bad those quarter horses that what you're saying

[02:30:35.890 --> 02:30:38.530]
Yeah, they look you know, I'm like you say once the while they get well

[02:30:38.530 --> 02:30:43.030]
Let's see if Dave Joseph is right or if the folks over there can really straighten them out this summer, okay?

[02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:46.550]
Yeah, because by the time you like you like you're somebody else's money get these tips out there

[02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:51.850]
That's the word sir stiff get the stiffs and sentiment to cool back right exactly with a banjo on their thing

[02:30:51.850 --> 02:30:53.490]
Okay, I'll good luck to you pal. All right

[02:30:54.370 --> 02:30:59.230]
138 at W.I.O.D. We have an open line and Broward 5249 for oh wait a minute hit him again

[02:30:59.230 --> 02:31:01.730]
Here he comes come on him must yeah boy

[02:31:04.810 --> 02:31:08.770]
What did I start to say oh yeah 524 I'm not bitter not me

[02:31:09.290 --> 02:31:13.050]
But you know when when the other horses are going around and he's going in the other direction

[02:31:13.050 --> 02:31:17.130]
I get a little nervous

[02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:18.990]
Mobile in the cables

[02:31:19.790 --> 02:31:22.410]
Hello, yes, sir. He'll how are you? I'm okay?

[02:31:22.750 --> 02:31:27.330]
Long time listen to first time call terrific. I got one question. Okay, shoot

[02:31:27.330 --> 02:31:30.290]
What is it you dislike about sales people so much?

[02:31:31.970 --> 02:31:36.070]
Geez now why didn't you give me a little advance warning on this it's the end of the show I'm putting carts away

[02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:40.830]
I'm not getting getting a mind. I'm talking about radio sales people you do understand don't you?

[02:31:40.990 --> 02:31:44.010]
Oh, no, I wasn't aware of that. I thought it was all sales man. Oh wait a minute

[02:31:44.010 --> 02:31:48.470]
Just found a card. I wanted to use a little while old cheese and he'll to here okay now that doesn't fit now

[02:31:48.470 --> 02:31:53.390]
But I did want to use that earlier so if anybody was ready for it and missed it there it was okay

[02:31:54.490 --> 02:31:57.710]
All right now what was the question to get about what about sales to go?

[02:31:57.790 --> 02:32:03.830]
I was wondering why you dislike them so much sales people are anthems. Okay, I love that little skip

[02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:08.690]
But I don't understand it radio sales people sir. You've got to understand. They're a different breed

[02:32:09.230 --> 02:32:16.310]
Okay, they're all hatched out of a gigantic factory in Nashville Tennessee underneath the Andrew Jackson's home underneath the hermitage

[02:32:16.310 --> 02:32:21.310]
They have a big barn back there in all these gigantic eggs are pulsing and

[02:32:21.430 --> 02:32:30.050]
And you know inside each a there's another lino freight is or Tom Deniburg or Kenny tol and waiting to pop out and wreak havoc on broadcasters from coast to coast

[02:32:30.050 --> 02:32:35.110]
Okay, I'm glad you clarified that for me. Trust me when I tell you can I just call for an reminder to spank?

[02:32:35.410 --> 02:32:38.270]
Absolutely, don't he take up your dues bag and then closing sir

[02:32:38.270 --> 02:32:43.230]
I want to remind you of one thing what's that sales people are iceholes have a great life

[02:32:43.230 --> 02:32:48.830]
Okay 140 at W. Wilde look at how we got three open lines and we got about 18 minutes to kill here

[02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:51.090]
Minus the next break which is about like three and a half

[02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:56.150]
Well, I like to figure these things out erath medically. Okay, get out your little slide rule and slide it

[02:32:57.390 --> 02:33:03.850]
751 W. I. O. D. and Dators in opening there. We have one and brown or five two four one on mobile rail soft mobility that might have been

[02:33:06.470 --> 02:33:10.310]
Rose rose was great. She took a lot of time people got a little PO to about it

[02:33:10.310 --> 02:33:17.110]
But she was actually one is always and we had what was it Sally Sally Susie from

[02:33:23.930 --> 02:33:24.370]
Yeah

[02:33:24.370 --> 02:33:25.730]
Yeah, I was loyal comes fans

[02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:31.050]
Boy remember him was long suffering Cubs. You're any banks and freaky Jenkins to play in all those miserable teams

[02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:35.570]
They just kept your banging away doing their thing with fano and cousin. Yeah, right

[02:33:36.030 --> 02:33:38.490]
Well, that's not what I call I sure hope not

[02:33:38.490 --> 02:33:41.750]
Yeah, what I wanted to call it back me on it was about

[02:33:45.690 --> 02:33:49.490]
I have a little chat with now I've already given it more than enough publicity sir

[02:33:49.490 --> 02:33:53.230]
Okay, and he starts when he starts paying setting us a check for all the free advertising

[02:33:53.230 --> 02:33:55.570]
No, you know, you want to get serious for one minute?

[02:33:56.190 --> 02:34:00.870]
One thing I discovered today when I came on I did my little which I was gonna do regardless

[02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:07.050]
Okay, because I want to get it out of my system. I discovered that this audience the people are over here at W.I.O.D

[02:34:07.050 --> 02:34:12.390]
They're not interested in that. That's another one of those things like WS news in the past with the a battle the

[02:34:12.390 --> 02:34:17.570]
Radio wars and all that crap that they're trying to resurrect. It's all ancient history. It doesn't fly anymore

[02:34:17.570 --> 02:34:20.890]
No, the only people who want to participate in that are all the old hands

[02:34:20.890 --> 02:34:26.050]
Okay, and I'm sure that those are the people who are over there right now pitching in without oh, yes

[02:34:26.050 --> 02:34:30.770]
You're right. He's a bastard. We're upset about and and we don't want old hands over here

[02:34:30.770 --> 02:34:35.130]
Old-hand radio is not for us. That's WS news, you know, and if that's what they want to resurrect

[02:34:35.130 --> 02:34:39.370]
That's it. They're right on the right path for believe me or even on radio like a hen party

[02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:44.070]
Yeah, well, you know it's like when you used to talk about or actually the bird I met with a long ago

[02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:48.910]
You talk about Sandy and her sugar cookies and almost nobody knows what you're talking about

[02:34:48.910 --> 02:34:52.130]
Yeah, but that was still funny that was still fun. Oh, yeah

[02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:55.690]
Sugar cookies might renery like to because he had sandy like poison

[02:34:56.570 --> 02:35:01.630]
He would never say that because he likes to be a nice Gentile Gentile guy, but he hates her like poison

[02:35:02.310 --> 02:35:04.070]
Can I ask one small request?

[02:35:04.530 --> 02:35:06.530]
Yeah, small is the operative. Yeah, just a

[02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:11.230]
As an ostrich size I know I know it's even worse than to your show all the time religiously

[02:35:11.230 --> 02:35:15.490]
Yeah, and let me point another thing isn't it fascinating that when they had their opening in a battle of the

[02:35:15.490 --> 02:35:17.790]
He was going through this thing about all of them. I bet all of them on him

[02:35:17.790 --> 02:35:20.630]
That won't have to listen to Neil much anymore is gonna be if Alan is so interesting

[02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:24.970]
How come it is it Steve is with us like religiously almost every reading moment tended to

[02:35:24.970 --> 02:35:27.470]
Well, he wants to be back in I.O.D. Wow

[02:35:28.330 --> 02:35:33.230]
But what I wanted to ask what's the question I can handle it is that you know

[02:35:34.050 --> 02:35:37.330]
Steve if you're out there would you mind picking up the

[02:35:38.610 --> 02:35:45.210]
$35 fine. I got it from the Coral department for having to put all that a little bit of forward my trees trying to pick up your saver

[02:35:45.210 --> 02:35:48.650]
No, I can't I really can have a great day of

[02:35:50.190 --> 02:35:53.230]
144 W.I. Did that Henry man? He's always there when you need him isn't he?

[02:35:53.570 --> 02:35:54.750]
We have an open line in Broward

[02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:58.010]
You'll never get on the air, but boy it's gonna be so much holding on fun

[02:35:58.670 --> 02:36:04.270]
Did I put those words necessarily in the right order? See this is not a station where we care about necessarily putting in the right order words

[02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:07.110]
But anyway if you want to put your body

[02:36:12.050 --> 02:36:14.090]
149 I'm gonna do the not slanting lady a second

[02:36:14.090 --> 02:36:19.730]
But I just want to mention Chuck byer just came in and we may get like preempted or bumped in a couple of minutes or somewhere between now and two

[02:36:19.730 --> 02:36:25.890]
So be prepared for that because we may have a special announcement immediately you realize it's like what about seven o'clock at night over there now

[02:36:26.390 --> 02:36:28.690]
Almost eight o'clock in the middle of seven or eight o'clock

[02:36:28.690 --> 02:36:34.210]
So they've been meeting like for hours and hours and hours and evidently a secretary of state Baker has got an announcement

[02:36:34.210 --> 02:36:37.970]
That he's gonna make sure so if that's available and we code to it we may get

[02:36:38.650 --> 02:36:41.530]
Obviously we want to get that on right away, right? That's right

[02:36:43.210 --> 02:36:47.610]
Everything's important. Yeah, I mean, it's no not slanting, but it's something no not slanting

[02:36:48.330 --> 02:36:54.630]
Tomorrow morning I will not forget that's what I was calling to remind you set it up. You won 24 wasn't that nice of you

[02:36:54.630 --> 02:36:59.450]
Tomorrow ought to be pretty exciting. I'll tell you one thing you should make room for guiding light in your life

[02:36:59.450 --> 02:37:04.430]
I think I may try to do that. What time is that on three to four three to four and since you have a satellite

[02:37:04.430 --> 02:37:10.770]
I watch it up in the late after four to five on you know those calls we had yesterday about if three is changing and everyone

[02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:16.490]
I turn it on last night like after midnight. I don't they're all everything's the same place where they always have it

[02:37:16.490 --> 02:37:18.590]
I don't know what that's all about. I haven't noticed anything

[02:37:18.590 --> 02:37:23.010]
I don't know. I think maybe Mercury is in their reign at your Uranus

[02:37:24.190 --> 02:37:27.830]
Don't you? I think the planets are like I'll rearrange or something

[02:37:28.490 --> 02:37:33.370]
Well, I'll be up there really if not at least I'll tape it. Okay, okay?

[02:37:33.490 --> 02:37:37.950]
And tomorrow we can huh? I said and tape it we can ruin it for everybody. That's right

[02:37:37.950 --> 02:37:41.470]
But we want you know, we don't have to ruin it. We can just give everybody a little piece a little kiss

[02:37:42.210 --> 02:37:46.210]
You were just smashing out at Calder Friday. Oh, I'll tell you I come here

[02:37:46.650 --> 02:37:48.530]
Did you lose your brains? Yes

[02:37:48.530 --> 02:37:51.890]
Well join the club. We all plunged our lungs and they're pretty happy about it

[02:37:51.890 --> 02:37:53.350]
I guess I had no beginners

[02:37:54.170 --> 02:37:57.510]
That's amazing. Did you see the guy came up with a little girl the baby? No

[02:37:58.030 --> 02:38:02.970]
Are you cereal? No, I did he had picked the because of the colors or the nose. Yes picked the number

[02:38:02.970 --> 02:38:05.170]
She picked the five and at run race the first race

[02:38:05.170 --> 02:38:10.790]
I was paid like 26 bucks and he better perfected with it and got back here a five dollar perfected got back 150

[02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:14.170]
So you know out of nowhere that's a way to do it

[02:38:15.170 --> 02:38:19.470]
Because as I've always said the more you know the worst shape you're in

[02:38:19.470 --> 02:38:21.750]
Well, I'll bring my kids next time. There you go

[02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:26.670]
Bring Pat Peterson to why do I do that? Well, that sounds good. Yeah, at least keep us busy anyway

[02:38:26.670 --> 02:38:30.810]
They have a real private part of that clubhouse. Yeah sure see you tomorrow. Okay, bye

[02:38:31.450 --> 02:38:34.570]
151 let's go to for Lauderdale. Hello. Meal. Yeah

[02:38:35.010 --> 02:38:38.070]
What do you think about this device? Is Southern Bell trying to sell us now

[02:38:38.730 --> 02:38:39.830]
So color ID

[02:38:40.610 --> 02:38:43.510]
What someone calls your number you press a button and shows what number they're calling?

[02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:46.370]
They're not trying to sell it to us now. Then it's not available yet

[02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:50.190]
Well, I read in the paper that they're gonna try to sell this to us. What do you think?

[02:38:50.410 --> 02:38:52.430]
It's dangerous first dangerous

[02:38:52.430 --> 02:38:57.430]
What if you had it there and you know everybody's number that called in yeah, then we wouldn't have to talk to jerks like you

[02:38:59.390 --> 02:39:01.370]
152 I mean it got it in states everywhere

[02:39:01.370 --> 02:39:07.610]
It's the pigs down here that are against it which I think is outrageous and the excuse they use as well when they do their FBI

[02:39:07.610 --> 02:39:11.610]
Stings and this and that they would know that recognize the number or something like that

[02:39:11.610 --> 02:39:17.750]
I mean they can change the phone number on those things every hour if they want to right so I mean that's a layman's excuse

[02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:19.870]
I've heard in my life and

[02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:22.970]
I think it would be outstanding

[02:39:22.970 --> 02:39:26.910]
Can you imagine all the crank calls that would cut down on and how much you know

[02:39:26.910 --> 02:39:32.330]
I just I mean from every aspect that they do it everywhere so Florida probably be with it about 15 years from now like you

[02:39:32.330 --> 02:39:37.630]
We're always a day late and several dollars short and look at that Johnny dork is wending his way in here

[02:39:37.630 --> 02:39:38.370]
Isn't that amazing?

[02:39:38.930 --> 02:39:42.850]
Just enough to make you want to get on your hands and knees and puke all over those CDs

[02:39:42.850 --> 02:39:46.290]
They have next door wow and look at that shirt this man

[02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:47.910]

[02:39:48.730 --> 02:39:49.530]
movie about

[02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:52.710]
Tall men don't wear a plan or something what's the name of that movie?

[02:39:54.310 --> 02:39:55.610]
You know what I'm talking about

[02:39:56.170 --> 02:39:56.570]
dead

[02:39:56.570 --> 02:40:00.730]
and this is an oxy moron isn't it?

[02:40:02.850 --> 02:40:03.650]
Anyway, oxy

[02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:08.010]
You think that's on he's busy and there he's waiting for this big announcement

[02:40:08.010 --> 02:40:12.190]
He's hoping to go blow the whole world up as long as we leave him all the money that's George

[02:40:12.190 --> 02:40:17.990]
You know he's been deprived so long just leave him as wife and all the money and they'll have a good time at our expense

[02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:22.130]
So what is it this major announcement? Oh, you have an announcement today, too. Wow

[02:40:23.770 --> 02:40:26.590]
No announcement Johnny is coming out of the dark

[02:40:28.050 --> 02:40:32.610]
Shadows I was gonna say closet the dark shadows kind of you see they're trying to bring back dark shadows

[02:40:32.610 --> 02:40:37.430]
Never be the same. We got to have Barnabas wasn't that was his name was Barnabas those old

[02:40:37.430 --> 02:40:41.550]
That was a weird but enjoyable show was bizarre head is biting moments

[02:40:41.550 --> 02:40:46.490]
So what were you about to lay on us about your great ratings on the coast? How are they? I didn't pay that much attention

[02:40:46.490 --> 02:40:50.350]
Are they pretty good? Yeah, not bad number two 2554

[02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:55.630]
When we do the mean oh in the afternoon you mean yeah, that's not the coast was

[02:40:55.630 --> 02:41:01.370]
As a matter of fact, I think midday here. I was number two 2554 with a six four. That's not bad. Hey, yeah

[02:41:01.970 --> 02:41:07.650]
We're doing it. Yeah, we got a great combo here and if they start playing good music next door, it'll be even better

[02:41:09.390 --> 02:41:11.350]
What are they playing what do you plan this afternoon anybody?

[02:41:11.570 --> 02:41:15.170]
We have a incredible stuff is that Liz Welch? Liz Cooper?

[02:41:15.170 --> 02:41:18.570]

[02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:22.090]
Doobies out in the stuff that you played like what was it?

[02:41:22.270 --> 02:41:29.550]

[02:41:38.610 --> 02:41:40.630]
Since we hit her up for the money for

[02:41:41.250 --> 02:41:46.870]
Camilla's house that she wouldn't give us she has been man. She just oh don't come by here any like she used to

[02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:50.670]
She didn't the hallway waves and gives me like your number one. That's it. She never gave anything man

[02:41:50.670 --> 02:41:55.510]
Hey to reach its own okay, and if you see and all I'll be honest with you don't need any food money

[02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:58.330]
Did she eat if I could give 20 bucks?

[02:41:58.950 --> 02:42:04.030]
Exactly does she oh and that's why there's that great thing on it cover you say about betting on neutral system

[02:42:04.810 --> 02:42:08.970]
Now this is the only man who bets in small change. Okay. Oh, let's make a big bet

[02:42:08.970 --> 02:42:16.170]
I got a couple of nickels here. I'll bet you a wooden nickel again said George Washington come on will you but does she ever eat?

[02:42:17.070 --> 02:42:23.370]
I don't think so looking at her. I mean she makes Karen Carpenter look like Debbie Yellowson a bad day in heat and she's diving

[02:42:24.390 --> 02:42:29.210]
Oh, then she really is anorexic are you serious? I'm very she is dieting. Yeah, did you hear that?

[02:42:30.050 --> 02:42:33.810]
This is something. No seriously. She's got a serious problem because people
