[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.580]
Who's dog rating?

[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.760]
610 WIOD presents the Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.680]
To get in touch and talk with Neil Diles, 751 WIOD from day.

[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.660]
Inbrouder, 524 WIOD.

[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.980]
Outside the 305 area code,

[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.480]
Soul free, 1-800-944 WIOD.

[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.340]
And Bell South mobility customers make a free call by dialing star IOD.

[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.980]
The opinions expressed in the comments

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.440]
by the guest's hosts or callers are not necessarily those of this nation.

[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.660]
Now, here's Neil Rogers on News Dog Radio.

[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.040]
610 WIOD.

[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.140]
Well, this is the Neil!

[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.880]
Not a like to stand on.

[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.980]
It's Democrat Man!

[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.360]
In today's story, Democrat Man and his faithful companion,

[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.340]
Page Boy, are trying to counteract a strange force that is turning Democrats into Republicans.

[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.880]
Where are we watching the tape over and over Democrat Man?

[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.800]
Because we must discover the Bushman's secret power that is ruining the Democratic Party.

[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.280]
He didn't do politics, you're a pretty good job at that already.

[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.920]
Why, Page Boy? Did that buzz in the background?

[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.460]
Yeah!

[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.260]
We wind a tape slowly.

[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.380]
Okay, but I don't think...

[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.340]
Listen, don't keep bad.

[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.560]
Bellisman.

[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.280]
Good.

[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.960]
That's it.

[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.640]
The Bushman is sending some movable messages.

[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.940]
Now, let's turn that off, Page Boy.

[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.660]
We gotta go.

[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.600]
Page Boy, are you okay?

[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.860]
You kinda mean good.

[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.680]
And, well, brilliant.

[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.420]
Oh, no!

[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.840]
Page Boy!

[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.160]
We will us again next time when you're here.

[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.420]
You're not a good guy.

[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.940]
Kinder.

[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.620]
No, no, no.

[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.720]
There's only one thing left to do.

[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.020]
Put in my Ted Kennedy exercise tape.

[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.380]
I'll wrap this to the left.

[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.700]
I'm gonna get top down.

[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.680]
Take this guy so good.

[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.500]
You drive this in, Baby, it drives you.

[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.600]
Yeah, it's got to visit Capri.

[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.520]
So come down, please, make him a jury.

[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.420]
Hurry for the $2000 rebate on Capri.

[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.100]
Yes, yes, yes, this is Capri, you are your king.

[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.380]
Okay, that's for sure, Leuke,

[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.200]
because he just happens to be standing in the other room.

[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.060]
$1025 at WIOD.

[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.140]
Here's a lady in North Miami Beach.

[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.180]
On the star line, who's gone?

[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.880]
Hello.

[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.760]
Oh, you're there.

[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.460]
Hi, Neil.

[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.180]
How you doing?

[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.860]
Good, how are you?

[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.800]
I'm doing okay.

[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.360]
I want to say happy birthday to you.

[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.400]
Well, isn't that nice?

[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.520]
No, why?

[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.080]
Why?

[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.760]
My birthday's today, I'll tell.

[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.640]
Well, back at you.

[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.560]
All the great people were born on November 5th.

[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.460]
That's what your older said.

[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.240]
How old are you?

[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.220]
How old am I?

[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.780]
49.

[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.040]
My last birthday in the 40s.

[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.320]
Yep.

[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.300]
I'm a quarter of a century.

[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.820]
Now, you're just like a spring chicken.

[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.400]
So what are you going to do today?

[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.740]
What am I going to do while I'm going to do a great show here?

[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.980]
Not, and then I'm going to go to Mommy's for lunch, and that's about it.

[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.400]
Uh-huh.

[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.840]
I'm dead, huh?

[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.980]
Go get my car's emission check.

[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.780]
I went over there yesterday, and the thing is closed on Monday,

[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.220]
which really frosted my brains.

[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.920]
And then paying the wrong week specific place in the city.

[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.220]
Yeah.

[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.840]
I mean, I found it with no problem.

[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.640]
Thanks to the audience.

[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.220]
Give me directions.

[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.460]
I go over to Hyatus Road.

[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.260]
I take a little turn.

[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.100]
I go down to the thing, and I thought, boy, this is great.

[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.960]
There's nobody here.

[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.040]
And guess what?

[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.120]
There was nobody there.

[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.340]
Closed on Monday.

[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.880]
Huh.

[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.640]
I'll remember that.

[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.640]
I'll see that also.

[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.920]
Well, have a great day.

[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.780]
You can do something special today, like go out to dinner or, um,

[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.200]
Yeah.

[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.200]
Go rob a bank?

[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.540]
Yeah, something like that.

[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.380]
I was planning on that.

[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.720]
Good.

[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.480]
Selfie.

[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.200]
Yeah.

[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.700]
But you better hurry up there.

[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.500]
It might not be anything left.

[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.900]
Yeah, somebody beat me to it.

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.960]
Well, have a great day.

[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.820]
Thank you, Tunele.

[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.200]
Bye-bye.

[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.800]
All right, bye-bye.

[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.660]
1027 at W.Y.D.

[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.220]
Now, for Alan who wrote the facts, she didn't call to get into any great intellectual discussion.

[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.520]
But does he think that she's some kind of a bubble brand that couldn't have a discussion about something more meaningful than Joe Blow is a douchebag?

[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.260]
Shame on you, Alan.

[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.300]
This idea that you have to be one dimensional in life is just a pile of crock.

[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.220]
As some of those right-wing football coaches would say, it's a pile of crock.

[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.640]
Sturt.

[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.240]
Oh, happy birthday, Neil.

[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.240]
Oh, no.

[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.260]
Yes.

[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.400]
Are you, are you in, Stewart?

[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.160]
I'm on my way to the fabulous facility down in West Palm Beach on Flagler Drive, even as we speak.

[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.120]
Oh, great.

[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.380]
Nothing like it.

[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.780]
I would have said a card, but have you seen how much stamps cause these days?

[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.400]
Yeah, I know it.

[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.820]
That's why it's easier to use other people's material to it, comes cheap.

[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.020]
Anyway.

[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.080]
Yes, Lee.

[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.560]
Junior.

[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.480]
28 years ago today.

[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.200]
Yeah.

[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.940]
Alex Bennett was exactly the same age you are now.

[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.720]
No, it's a matter of fact, I've just read the examiner, and the rumor has it that he's still out there in San Francisco.

[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.000]
Oh, no.

[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.540]
And he's getting his jolly's on a trolley and he's like just turned 17 today.

[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.840]
Absolutely.

[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.460]
So maybe he'll find some cheesecake after all.

[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.940]
Well, or some beef cake.

[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.840]
Yeah, things are happening.

[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.420]
That's correct.

[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.220]
You know what?

[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.940]
I heard a speaking of strange things.

[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.580]
Uh-huh.

[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.220]
I heard Stan Major on the Sun Network the other night.

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.380]
Well, that is pretty strange.

[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.000]
How's he doing?

[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.440]
Well, I just want to say, uh, Stan, don't give up your day job.

[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.600]
Somebody hasn't got a day job.

[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.680]
It's just a joke.

[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.800]
Okay, Lee.

[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.540]
Uh, by the way, Debbie Ellis.

[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.320]
She was supposed to get a job interview with WLS in Chicago.

[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.880]
Yeah.

[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.580]
Uh, five guys from the stock yard, right around her up in the street.

[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.420]

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.840]
Okay, Lee, hang in there.

[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.840]
I'll keep the piece.

[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.420]
Okay.

[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.980]
Boy, he is out of control today.

[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.320]
Isn't he?

[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.140]
Trent 29 at WIOD.

[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.640]
Let's go to the Coke and a Creek.

[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.040]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.800]
Just wanted to call him.

[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.880]
Wish you a happy birthday.

[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.080]
Well, thank you so much.

[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.740]
Thank you.

[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.160]
Uh, for entertainment that you provide to us, Bailey.

[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.520]
And thank you for all you do for our community.

[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.320]
So again, happy birthday and have a terrific day.

[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.120]
Thanks very much.

[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.940]
Thank you very much, Ian.

[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.060]
See, that's the kind of cause we ought to be getting today.

[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.200]
As people are a little more grateful in these little pinheads

[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.660]
slabs out there who have nothing better to do than call and make

[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.020]
good, well, sounds on a radio.

[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.380]
What are they going to get little gratitude in this town, huh?

[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.660]
For all the hard hours of sweating and puking and pouring over

[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.640]
cassette cart tapes.

[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.480]
And by the way, I don't want to pick on Rick Riley again or

[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.840]
Sudd.

[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.660]
In fact, there is a Sudd said to me that on Friday, he was going to go

[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.840]
through and straighten out that the new rack over there.

[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.440]
And I took a whole bunch of carts out for that ill-fated remote we

[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.180]
did Friday to play out there.

[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.740]
So left a whole bunch of slots in there.

[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.380]
What they did is they took a bunch of their stand wherever there was an opening.

[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.100]
They jammed it in there, so to speak.

[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.080]
Now, how are they ever going to find?

[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.240]
Of course, I took them all out and stuck them on the back thing here.

[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.940]
But I mean, how the hell would they ever find them again?

[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.900]
Talk about organization.

[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.720]
You can't complain about theirs because they haven't got any.

[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.800]
It's embarrassing.

[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.900]
It's almost as embarrassing as the fact we got three open lines on the board now.

[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.260]
This is going to be, I can see already the fifth consecutive day of absolute

[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.560]
desperation on this show.

[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.120]
Not for any particular reason, just they're just not in the mood to talk.

[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.460]
They don't want nothing to do with me.

[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.040]
They're upset.

[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.740]
They're angry.

[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.320]
They're hostile.

[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.240]
They're psychotic.

[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.560]
Whatever it is, they just don't want to play the game.

[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.760]
Lighthouse point.

[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.140]
Marit and Peter here, belly ache.

[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.960]
Yeah, pop about this.

[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.900]
Okay, see what I mean?

[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.480]
There we go.

[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.660]
Miami, hello.

[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.220]
Hello, Neil.

[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.620]
Yeah.

[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.520]
Yeah, you're right, all the great people are born on this thing.

[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.140]
Another one?

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.160]
Yep.

[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.240]
Well, how about that, sir?

[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.260]
What are the odds of that?

[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.700]
I'm telling you.

[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.520]
Pretty slim.

[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.100]
Yeah, I want to wish you had the first day.

[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.960]
Well, thanks a lot.

[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.940]
And I want to wish you had the first day.

[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.180]
We could just do this for four hours.

[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.740]
It beats talking to assholes like Peter that we just don't have the phone.

[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.840]
Wow.

[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.060]
And today is David Duke's first day.

[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.520]
So you're right.

[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.400]
I'm on the greatest people are born on this day.

[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:40.960]
Yeah.

[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.440]
Very funny.

[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.000]
I'm not kidding.

[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.100]
They all have a great day.

[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.320]
Bye-bye.

[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.180]
Load out your notes.

[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.660]
1031 at WIOD, let's go to Lady in North Miami.

[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.120]
Hello.

[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:53.800]
Hello.

[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.920]
Happy birthday.

[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.780]
Well, thank you.

[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.800]
I feel the same to you by the time of the gold war.

[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.400]
And unfortunately, unfortunately, I'm hooked.

[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.680]
Well, isn't that great?

[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.280]
Thank you.

[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.180]
And isn't it amazing that's how we managed to play a lot of humorous stuff about the war

[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.760]
and still managed to do a lot of serious talk all at the same time on this show for about two months,

[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.420]
which may come as a surprise to Alan the Maven on the Facts machine.

[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.280]
I have the radio on it to work whether my boss might could or not.

[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.040]
I'm sure show.

[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.380]
Bad reception in this area, bad radio, whatever.

[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.040]
In North Miami, you have bad reception?

[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:29.600]
Yeah.

[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.700]
Well, wait till we get our subcarrier in North in the North Day.

[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.320]
That'll be great.

[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:33.980]
Yeah.

[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.440]
Well, thank you so much.

[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.780]
Have a great day.

[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.280]
This is great.

[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.160]
The suction man is tremendous.

[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.140]
I'm almost getting the yank bread out of the seat.

[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.600]
1032 at WIOD.

[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.480]
Here's a mobile on I-95.

[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:51.580]
Yes.

[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.120]
It's Frank.

[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.620]
How are you?

[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.500]
Okay, Frank.

[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.720]
I want to wish you a happy birthday.

[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:54.980]
My friend.

[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.300]
Thank you so much, my pal.

[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.740]
And I really don't have anything to say.

[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.280]
Just have a great day and enjoy yourself and a happy birthday.

[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.340]
And we'll see you at Poppano Park tomorrow night.

[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.960]
Bring 2030 to the end.

[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:03.960]

[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.800]
