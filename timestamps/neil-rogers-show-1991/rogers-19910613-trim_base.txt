[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300]
I'm a cut man.

[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.240]
A high fly ball.

[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.760]
The sends off.

[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.660]
Top win.

[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.980]
Well.

[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.100]
And a bad man.

[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.300]
As they beat the San Francisco Giants.

[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.620]
Evening up the series by the score at six to one.

[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.780]
And once again, there are the 500 mark with 29 and 29.

[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.680]
A chance to go over by winning the finale on this road trip here.

[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.300]
Tomorrow the final game of the series.

[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.580]
And I trust you are too.

[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.680]
One in seven Americans suffers from a terrible affliction.

[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.780]
And while others find it funny.

[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.400]
To those who have it.

[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.220]
It's no laughing matter.

[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.380]
It's called frequent burping syndrome.

[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.540]
It's terrible.

[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.100]
I'll be on a date or a business meeting.

[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.680]
And...

[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.620]
And...

[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.300]
We...

[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.720]
Excuse me.

[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.400]
See? See what happens?

[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.240]
Frequent burping syndrome.

[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.080]
It can ruin your life.

[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.780]
But it doesn't have to.

[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.000]
Now there's a clinic that can help.

[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.620]
Trained specialists.

[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.560]
Sensitive to the needs of compulsive belchers.

[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.900]
A special place known as...

[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.140]
Burp Inders.

[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.760]
Gosh.

[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.860]
Burp Inders saved my life.

[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.300]
Joanne and I were in love.

[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.440]
I really wanted to ask her to marry me.

[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.600]
But I just knew that when the moment of truth came.

[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.060]
I'd let out with a big ripper.

[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.940]
You know?

[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.720]
Burp Inders.

[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.720]
No shame.

[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.560]
No guilt.

[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.460]
No more tummy rumbling smelly belches.

[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.260]
No more stopping in mid-sittance to uncoork a big cheesy blaster.

[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.460]
Just carrying professionals.

[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.040]
And the help you need.

[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.060]
Don't wait.

[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.680]
Here's the number to call.

[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100]
555-2877.

[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.020]
That's 555-

[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.700]
Burp Inders.

[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.960]
Call today.

[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.320]
And stop being so gross.

[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.080]
Okay, I'm thinking about giving away maybe like $20 million on a show today.

[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.660]
Okay, to the first person who calls.

[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.740]
It's t-

[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.780]
10-08-

[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.740]
at W-I-O-D.

[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.760]
It's a great Thursday.

[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.040]
The birds are doing it.

[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.980]
The sun is shining.

[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.260]
Man, are we doing it?

[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.500]
I said I'm thinking about it and so I'm going to do it.

[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.980]
And I got to tell you this right off the bat.

[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.740]
Not to be sucking around because you know how I feel.

[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.640]
I've mixed feelings about the whole sports ambiance here at 610.

[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.400]
Your sports obnoxious station.

[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.100]
But last night,

[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.720]
Sonny Hirsch and Joseph Gack, he and even Hank.

[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.440]
But especially Sonny and Joe Horrante in California.

[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.760]
It's such a great job covering all he going on at the baseball meetings.

[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.900]
It was just tremendous.

[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.000]
It was spine tingling.

[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.180]
And I have a right from the horse's mouth that Mr. Heisinger.

[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.380]
Mr. Assyggy.

[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.380]
No, Heisinger.

[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.480]
Whiz-

[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.840]
Whatever the hell is name is Wayne.

[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.180]
Was listening to W-I-O-D.

[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.780]
Just pinned to that radio last night on because that's the only place he could define what was going on.

[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.060]
And we got it.

[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.080]
I mean, the National League says unanimous.

[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.000]
We're all in favor any more.

[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.680]
He says, yeah, mine mean dead was fine.

[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.820]
But we want to bleed a little more money out of the whole deal.

[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.700]
Okay, so let's piss everybody off.

[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.760]
But it's it's done.

[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.840]
There's like maybe one chance in a billion that we're not going to get Major League Baseball here.

[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.140]
And of course, no one is town.

[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.640]
Anyway, on the front page of the Sun set.

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.040]
And I know this is going to get Stan Worthheimer crazy.

[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.220]
Are you out there Stan?

[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.360]
Is he on the phone yet?

[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.580]
You know, he's going to call.

[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.340]
Mr. Casino gambling.

[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.360]
Casino gambling group pushes 92 vote.

[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.140]
Wouldn't that George was saying earlier and he's not even much of a sports fan to say the best.

[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:47.100]
But can you imagine Major League Baseball and Casino gambling all in this Godforsaken town could like transform this from a sleepy dying over here place overnight in a couple of years anyway?

[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.440]
I don't think it's going to happen.

[00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:02.180]
But in addition to which there's a conflict there because I have a feeling that'll be one of the excuses that'll be used another one of this if they need new ones, you know about the mom's going to come in and a crime and all is and disrupt our early bird dinners.

[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.200]
But now of course they'll be saying well, you know, we got a Major League Baseball town.

[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.880]
They don't want that kind of atmosphere.

[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.360]
We don't want like a Las Vegas ambiance and lots of gambling because got on unless we how about if we had Pete roses manager?

[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.220]
That might not be too bad, huh?

[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.920]
But anyway, it says Casino gambling group pushes 92 vote.

[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.920]
They're going to try it again one more time.

[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:31.700]
I hope that I wish they just put on the ballot every two years and just keep jamming it down the throats of the people these Neanderthals in a state till they finally just got so tired of resisting.

[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.840]
Okay, go ahead.

[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.080]
Just don't try to drag us in there.

[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.500]
And you know, the amazing part of it is the very old farts and the pseudo right wing religionists to where the ones who claim to be against it.

[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.900]
They'd be the first ones in there.

[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.100]
They'd be online for 10 miles in every direction.

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.900]
It's like when you go to Vegas and you see all these Southern Baptist having your convention out there and all these other pseudo religious groups.

[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.640]
They're all out there doing it, doing anything they can get away with.

[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.780]
So I'm sure that Stan Worthheimer, Mr. Casino gambling is going to be a yearring it up now.

[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.920]
You're a great guy, Stan.

[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.780]
You're a wonderful guy.

[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.460]
A little ponderous, a little one dimensional.

[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.220]
Tomorrow nights are a big baseball fever night.

[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.220]
Flag day, big night at the miracle tomorrow night.

[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.360]
We hope everybody comes out and say more about that later on the game is at seven.

[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.100]
I'll be there at six.

[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.060]
Fat Rich will be there and Rick and Suds have been kind enough once again or dumb enough to adonate their presence.

[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.520]
They're just incredible.

[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.660]
They just keep coming back for more punishment no matter how much they're abused and maligned by the sales staff and set out on lost missions.

[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.820]
They just keep doing their thing.

[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.100]
And then Saturday, of course, Saturday morning, everything down to Benson camera.

[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.360]
So we got lots of stuff coming up.

[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.100]
We also have the WYOD slash coast frequency flyer.

[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.100]
Which is our little in-house newspaper.

[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.880]
I got to tell you something.

[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.860]
This thing, it started out as like two pages.

[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.480]
Now it's bigger than the Wall Street Journal.

[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.180]
I mean, this thing is just gigantic.

[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.080]
It's mammoth.

[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.380]
Almost as big as our staff.

[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.740]
You know, as you leave through, I'll get into some of the names here.

[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.300]
There are people mentioned in here who are now working at this station.

[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.640]
But you're like 75 people working in research.

[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.640]
A Georgian to have you, buddy, since they pay them like 30 cents an hour.

[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.500]
And the nail is asked in that chair like eight hours a day, several days a week.

[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.860]
So Marvin can go out and play professional jackass.

[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.000]
And we're having all these other people.

[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.600]
They must all be on pay, aren't they?

[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.060]
Like the interns.

[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.420]
See that?

[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.940]
That's the way they like to do it.

[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.660]
A Cox broadcast.

[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.300]
And we have 400 employees, but 380 of more interns.

[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.300]
So they don't get paid.

[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.620]
Okay.

[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.940]
We have an open line at Broward.

[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.340]
524 and Palm Beach.

[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.500]
We had a little thing on there.

[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.480]
What are the line checkers?

[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.500]
Line checkers.

[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.380]
Come on, Steve.

[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.380]
Go sell some more spots.

[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.640]
Speak at a Palm Beach.

[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.620]
Wait till you hear this.

[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.520]
Paddy Wheat owner of the 17th store.

[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.440]
Paddy's place only sexy things.

[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.860]
Retail lingerie chain.

[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.980]
Now has another problem.

[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.840]
Can't raise her sign in North Palm Beach.

[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.040]
The county that made Roxanne Pulitzer and William Kennedy Smith household names.

[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.340]
Voted last night.

[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.160]
Not to allow him is wheat to hang a sign outside her newest store.

[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.100]
The same sign found outside the other 16 locations.

[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.480]
It includes the words Paddy's place and the script beneath reading only sexy things.

[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.840]
Tuesday's vote brings to a head.

[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.360]
The month long controversy surrounding Mizouit's new store.

[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.900]
In mid-May before the new store opened at 767 North Lake Boulevard.

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.180]
Let me say it again, 767 North Lake Boulevard.

[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.560]
The Palm Beach Post refused Mizouit's grant opening ad is too suggested.

[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.320]
Paddy's place quickly attempted to purchase radio commercials on Palm Beach radio stations.

[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.960]
WIRK and WRMF.

[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.780]
Again, the grant opening ads were turned down.

[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:47.140]
Finally, only WIRK accepted a sanitized version of the radio spot.

[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.420]
Meanwhile, Miami Radio Personality and First Amendment defender.

[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.200]
Neo-Rongers of WIOD, sure.

[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.340]
Devoted portions of his May 17th show to the controversy.

[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:07.720]
Palm Beach listeners called in to report and read massage parlor ads in the same sanitized Palm Beach Post newspaper owned by those phonies at Cox Enterprises.

[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.040]
Mizouit is battled fiercely against those who would seek to regulate or banish the marketing and sale of legal products.

[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.760]
You'll appear at the July night town council meeting with their attorney in a bunch of whips and chains.

[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.540]
In a related development, listen, it gets even better. You're going to love this.

[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:33.480]
West Palm Beach refused to allow an occupational license for the Backdoor Bookstore because of assumptions based on the store name.

[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:45.760]
Zoning officials finally visited the bookstore at the owner's insistence and realized the gay and lesbian bookstore is located in the back of the building and is most easily accessible via its back door.

[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.900]
The Backdoor Bookstore now has its license.

[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.780]
Wow. That's Palm Beach. So that's why we're taking that stupid line out.

[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.820]
Okay, we're sick and tired of all you right wing Neanderthals. We got enough of those down here and date and brown.

[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:11.540]
We don't need the just this whole. It's just like a never ending cacophony of repressive Neanderthal old farts from cemetery village et's and Yahoo's.

[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:18.680]
And phony Yahoo red next. They remind me of the people up in Nashville. Oh, the Bible says the Bible said in the meantime they're doing everything that moves.

[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:27.540]
They're cousin or sister their brother, both at the same time. That's their motto up there in Nashville. Incess is best.

[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:35.560]
And yet in the meantime, the Bible says we're all going to rotten hell. Well, I got news for if the Bible's right, it's going to be pretty damn crowded down there. I'll tell you that.

[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.340]
It's going to be like dying and go to Tennessee.

[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.460]
1028 at W.I.O.D. Let's go to Kendall. Hello. Yes, sir. Okay. Did you happen to catch the.

[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:59.960]
Sovation locker room last night in the ball. Well, I told you about the bulls. I told you weeks and weeks ago. It's a Euro Michael Jordan in the bulls and all these Laker fans and all these other Celtic fans.

[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:08.600]
They don't know what they're talking about. Bob. This was in the locker room. It was just unbelievable. Yeah, but for the year he's standing here.

[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:16.520]
First of all, I look like he's from junior like because he can't see him. First of all. So it does up to. It sounds like the I hate the bird guy to me.

[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:24.960]
Is this the I hate the bird guy? No, I don't like the I hate the bird. Now you said doesn't he sound just like the guy I hate you? Come on. You are.

[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:36.300]
I'm not a second time car. Okay. You sound just like the guy with the other. That's a compliment. If you miss the Neil Rogers show yesterday on 610 W.I.O.D. you missed this.

[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:48.880]
Is this the bird? Yeah. How you doing? Okay. Listen, do me a favor. Play anything because I can't stand listening to you. You sound like a douchebag. Do it. Just do me a favor. Play anything.

[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:56.640]
Well, can I ask you a question before you go? Oh God. You sound so stupid. I hate to talk to you. Yeah. Go ahead. Why did you call me? I didn't call you.

[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:04.780]
No, not just to tell you not to say anything. Just play something. Oh God can't stand it. Well, then why are you listening?

[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:11.200]
Play something already. Why won't you answer me? Get stand up. You won't see he won't talk to me.

[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:17.040]
Well, I don't know about you, but you sound like some stupid idiotic. Stupid idiotic.

[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:26.720]
Pompano. In ill. Yes, sir. Since Mr. Hanzinghi and Cifan call on the team after fish, why don't we call them Miami Jew fish? Cause we sure got them down here.

[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:34.640]
There we go. Yeah, okay. See you mentioned Nashville. You get a Nashville. Y'all who on the phone right away.

[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:52.500]
Oh, that's right. It's Thursday. It's almost time for the sheet sale. Hello again. I'm McKenna Shishnuk. And now we proudly present a very special episode of Rost of Peace Theatre.

[00:11:53.300 --> 00:12:01.580]
In this story, we take Margaret Mitchell's classic tale of the old south and transported to a Caribbean milieu.

[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:21.420]
It's a three-part series entitled, Gongja with the Wind. As we join the episode one month, our hero, a very aromatic Rost of Ferry in name, Regate Jackson, is forced to choose between playing in a Jamaican steel drum band or a

[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:40.080]
bench of the California Angels. Well, man, quite a dilemma for our Noobian friend. He with the whoopie goldberg hair. So won't you slice a mango and join us for Gongja with the Wind on Rost of Peace Theatre. I'm the white devil, McAllister Shnuk.

[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:50.360]
Anyway, it's 1042 at W.I.D. at the big sheet sale. I was talking about only moments ago. They have a sheet that a little small one that you can wrap your parrot or parakeet in. It's called a bird sheet.

[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:59.120]
18 to 11 at W.I.D., it's interesting about that phone and the six and eight. It's maybe those are the numbers in the double today. Do you think so?

[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:10.060]
1054, let's go to South Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Listen, you're talking about these old puke stuff in Palm Beach in a place. My father and I do bartending at, you know,

[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:38.400]
private parties and stuff. Well, this we did a party in at a church and you want to talk about hypocrites. You can talk about the Catholics because I had to go to the bathroom. So I, you know, put all the bar bottles underneath the bar and I went to the bathroom. When I came back, they, I mean, these people, they couldn't get enough booze. You know, when I come back, I mean, you know, like 10 people around the bar behind the bar picking up bottles and just free and pouring.

[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:48.180]
And they said, Oh, did you have any, you know, cranberry? Do you have any, you know, tomato juice? Can I make a bloody Mary? Yeah. These people are unbelievably.

[00:13:48.520 --> 00:14:01.060]
What is the word for it, sir? And they're just, I mean, it's that tip on Neil Mike Disney syndrome. Oh my God, they all got liver like a liver like a rock. And it's they go. I'm telling you.

[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:10.840]
It's unbelievable. And you know, we have all of these rainy days all through the summer here. So when it's pouring outside, they're all pouring inside. That's my, I'm like Disney.

[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:28.280]
Another thing I got to tell you is store cable. I mean, this is, I mean, I thought this was America. Not if you have store cable. Please, I see if you have a store cable, it's more like Siberia. Well, store cable, I got the bill.

[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:41.860]
And I put it on the bottom of my bird cage. And, oh, in other words, it's like a bird sheet now. Yeah, kind of sort of. And after the day is done, then I'll mail the bill back to them. Come and come pick their box up.

[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:49.480]
Table satellite came back by yesterday. And they are offering that they are very good people.

[00:14:50.340 --> 00:15:01.440]
Cable satellite came by and for 1395. Yeah, but I heard the quality sucks though. Somebody called in Raven about that and I heard that there's no stereo in the pictures like upside down. So don't get too excited. Check it out.

[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.340]
Check it out first before we go getting a sucked in again.

[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:21.920]
What I did was I went ahead and ordered the cable satellite. And it's 1395 for all the basic channel. Plus you get free showtime for life. And free sports package for life. Now this is what they're offering. It's 1395 plus tax comes to 1479.

[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:30.440]
And so I'm going to go ahead and try it. If you know, the bill goes up to $14.80. I'm going to have put the bill on the bird cage again.

[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:37.340]
Exactly. Well, even if it is a crappy service, at least you're canceling a store will piss them off, which is a definite step in the right direction.

[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.500]
Oh, the worst. The all time worst and Jim Bozo over there lives up to his name.

[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:50.700]
Oh, and you call them to complain about it. And it's you know, everybody over there is like a walk and talk and wreck them. Yeah, unbelievable.

[00:15:51.420 --> 00:16:00.060]
So anyway, so thank God my name is getting baseball and you got to get a show and good luck to us all. Thank you very much. Thank you.

[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:10.300]
New from the makers of America's funniest home video. Bob's saying is back. Feeling sorry for those senior citizens.

yeah from this expansion stuff here yes sir you know who's gonna end up in Tampa Bay St. Peter's

[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:04.200]
burrow Houston Astros it's burr pirate no way yeah I don't chance no way Jose Houston

[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.900]
it's gonna be the pirate Craig B. Gio a Ken of Fort Camini D it's gonna be there Eric Yelding

[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.960]
and a cast of Julian's cast of Julian's mark my words he's an Astros one more question that

[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:21.320]
there in a rain out game like the park game yesterday does anything you do in that game count no

[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:28.740]
sir so that home run handy hat no sir white it's white washed away wow washed out with the tide

[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:35.900]
I said that on the table like Natalie Wood what do you mean it doesn't make any sense it's not in

[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.340]
other words the game has to go five innings to be a game of record so if they played like eight innings

[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.700]
and the game was complete like they had gigantic tornadoes and thunderstorms they had to like

[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.560]
replay the whole game later time the statistics would all count but if it's less than an official

[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.380]
game then it wouldn't count well learn something new every day there you go ask the experts sir when

[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:05.280]
it comes to baseball I know my ball okay Neil have a great day singular 1031 at 1131 well it's 1031

[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:22.020]
the cup game today is not gonna be on at tape they could be behind like 17 to nothing by the time I

[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:26.860]
get home and who's pitching for us today is it Scanlon yeah they will be no I don't think who is

[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:34.080]
it Scanlon I guess and I'm gonna say it again Jim Essien makes me sick poor Mike Polekia I guess

[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:40.520]
he don't like his new haircut he's seven and four he got bombed one game he's been our best

[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.820]
one more games anybody on a staff the game he lost to the dice should be eight and three at worst

[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:49.980]
at worst if we scored him any runs back to the bullpen Mike we got all our Yahoo's we got less

[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.780]
Lancaster we're gonna ruin him again now he's finally pitching good from the bullpen we're gonna
