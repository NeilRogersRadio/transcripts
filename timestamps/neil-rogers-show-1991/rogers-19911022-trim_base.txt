[00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.900]
Well, join us.

[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.760]
Get out of the way.

[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.960]
Hey, Rick, it's Bob.

[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.240]
The Rogers on News.Radio.

[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.200]
Six dead.

[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.600]
W-I-O-D.

[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.000]
It's the one to do our...

[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:14.700]

[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.080]
...

[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.120]
...

[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.520]
...

[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.300]
You know, when I was a little kid,

[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.240]
I used to have this WebCortate PC-Corder

[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.320]
and I used to sit like an old corner of the living room.

[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.920]
With a little microphone and play radio.

[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.340]
And that's basically what I feel like we're doing here again today.

[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.460]
It's like being reborn all over again.

[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.600]
It's like reliving your childhood.

[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.260]
Here's a man who dresses like he was just crawled out of a gutter.

[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.460]
He's got more money than God.

[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.360]
How you doing, Preston?

[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.780]
Preston, hand ladies and gentlemen.

[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.120]
Close friends with my good buddy, Sheriff Nick.

[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.060]
Only he's got better here than you do.

[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.780]
Yes, Preston.

[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.460]
To apologize for what?

[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.780]
How about doing a microphone?

[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.000]
To apologize to me and apologize to Nick.

[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.680]
I'm threatening you.

[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.140]
Yes.

[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.680]
For what?

[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.020]
Are you putting those lights on here?

[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.720]
Oh, geez.

[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.640]
That's beautiful.

[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.520]
Get that thing out of here.

[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.860]
Okay, I don't do snakes.

[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.240]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.060]
Get that, Grotesque.

[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.360]
He's got a snake, the size of a laski here.

[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.920]
Don't put that baby on me.

[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.500]
I'm telling you.

[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.480]
Jews don't do snakes.

[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.560]
Okay.

[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.540]
It's not kosher.

[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.660]
It's drafe.

[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.620]
Just say you're sorry.

[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.080]
I'm not sorry, okay?

[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.940]
No way, Jose.

[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.060]
I apologize for nothing.

[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.920]
And I got a real good lawyer too, okay?

[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.600]
So get that baby and you got lots of money to cash in on.

[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.100]
Oh, geez.

[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.160]
I think I'm going to trip off the stage on a way out.

[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.980]
Thank you, Preston.

[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.340]
You got her.

[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.540]
You and Sheriff Nick, a sense of humor from hell.

[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.220]
Great guys.

[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.580]
Is he here?

[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.380]
Where is he?

[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.380]
Is he hiding over there?

[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.980]
He's hiding over there.

[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.620]
Come on.

[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.140]
Come on.

[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.260]
Quick hiding over there.

[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.540]
What did you just because that horse is still running at Papano?

[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.080]
I bet you're really sunny from the market.

[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.000]
I knew that Sheriff Nick would be lurking in the background.

[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.360]
That's why our phones got screwed up.

[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.500]
He's getting even for that horse.

[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.680]
Anyway, it's 107 at WIOD.

[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.700]
Let's, where's Adam?

[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.700]
Okay.

[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.560]
I'll tell you what to do.

[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.720]
Because I know it's a terminal.

[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.080]
I mean, the show has been horrendous enough with all our problems.

[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.300]
We've done our best.

[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.480]
It hasn't been very good.

[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.520]
It's been putrid and best.

[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.000]
We got a whole bunch of these.

[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.400]
Now, the ladies like in the who haven't won anything.

[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.400]
In the first three or four rows down there, you just stay in your seats.

[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.620]
And here, Adam, and there's about a dozen, fifteen or twenty.

[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.000]
All those nice ladies down here.

[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.600]
Because they're the ones that come here in shop.

[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.160]
And by jewelry and cosmetics and all the other great stuff and clothing and schmattas and whatever here at the swap shop, they love it.

[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.740]
So, just give those out.

[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.460]
We're going to try to make as many people happy, especially the ones who are closest to me.

[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.880]
Okay.

[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.080]
Just keep them happy and everybody will be okay.

[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.380]
Okay.

[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.580]
Hi.

[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.880]
And let's talk to our next caller in beautiful Boka.

[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.440]
Welcome to 610WIOD or a screwed up station for the 90s.

[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.880]
Sir, man.

[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.960]
Boka.

[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.400]
Boka, that's what I said.

[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.020]
Hey, Neil.

[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.420]
Yeah.

[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.940]
How about those cops, huh?

[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.860]
Yeah, we're doing it.

[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.020]
Do we get our new manager yet?

[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.860]
I don't know.

[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.300]
Too busy wrapped up worrying over the braids.

[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.760]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.360]
Yeah, you sound...

[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.120]
Ronnie Gantt Jr.'s doing the Tomahawk chop again, okay?

[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400]
Oh, not that again.

[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.620]
Yeah.

[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.520]
And Jane Fonda is pretty upset about it.

[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.400]
Yeah, let me shift you.

[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.460]
You better watch yourself, Ron.

[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.420]
We're going to have the seminal Indians come over here from Bingo and nail your ass.

[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.780]
Okay.

[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.460]
Watch it, Ronnie.

[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.480]
Go ahead.

[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.320]
Buddy, shift gears.

[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.780]
Please.

[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040]
Connection is beautiful.

[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.600]
Great.

[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.400]
You sound great.

[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.040]
It's killing me.

[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.200]
See?

[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.140]
We went through all that crap just so we could finally get our great one to two hour and everything's

[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.320]
all straightened out for the moment.

[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.760]
I know.

[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.820]
Since some of your staff out there like an hour ahead of time to test it out or something.

[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.540]
Sir, we were all here 830 this morning.

[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.780]
We were getting southern bell involved and when you got Sheriff Nick lurking in the background

[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.920]
and when Joseph Gackie and his lackeys are working sabotage at the phone company, what the hell are we going to do?

[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.960]
Well, to quote my grandmother, always a.

[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.500]
Exactly.

[00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.780]
And I'll leave you on that note.

[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.520]
Have a good one, Neil.

[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.360]
And the same to you, Sheriff.

[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.840]
I'll ask for a clear connection.

[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.040]
Okay, I had nothing to say, but it was a nice sound to good connection.

[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.220]
Let's go to North Miami Beach.

[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.200]
Hello.

[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.960]
I just want to say a thing.

[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.480]
What do you sound so bummed out about?

[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.300]
You sound like you're ready to blow your brains out?

[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.780]
No.

[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.940]
Don't do it till after the lottery, okay?

[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.980]
I'm on for the third time. I think it's great.

[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.880]
This is the first time I've ever called you, so.

[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.800]
Well, what do you mean you're on for the third time?

[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.260]
I'm in the guy now, little.

[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.660]
Oh, he keeps putting this guy back on the phone.

[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.340]
You have it, isn't this cheering you up a little bit?

[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.020]
Yeah, it's great. I'm in isolation, so.

[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.580]
Yeah.

[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.900]
And you got pneumonia, right?

[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.520]
Yeah.

[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.180]
And you're spreading germs and disease all over the hospital.

[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.780]
Hell, yeah.

[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.160]
Let me give you a little clue, okay?

[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.720]
You know, the vent that's up there on the ceiling.

[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.300]
Just take that baby out, get a long pipe and just keep bricking into that thing and squeezing and ram down.

[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.180]
You'll have more fun going on in that place that we change in our diapers every five seconds.

[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.300]
It'll be better than the huggies halftime show it to Dolphin Game on Sunday.

[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.000]
Okay, hold on, sir.

[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.420]
You're going to keep holding it?

[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.140]
Yeah, I guess he is because Alex just put him back on hold.

[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.460]
Ten minutes after one at WIOD to kick off exciting new 92 season.

[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.460]
Where is he? Where is the Paris?

[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.900]
Huh?

[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.000]
He left.

[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.700]
I would have left two if I were him.

[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.200]
To kick off the exciting new 92 season Toyota of Hollywood is having a one time only event.

[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.360]
The World Series of Savings.

[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.800]
And you know what?

[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.520]
It's happening last weekend.

[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.620]
Unbelievable prices on a new all-star lineup of 92 Toyota's.

[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.600]
The kind of prices that knock all the other dealers out of the ballpark.

[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.560]
And last weekend Toyota of Hollywood was making some big headlines.

[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.100]
Special savings on Tursell's.

[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.100]
Crescent is pickups and preview of fans.

[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.120]
So it would have been a good idea for you to be first at the gate.

[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.080]
To check out Toyota of Hollywood's most valuable player.

[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.460]
They all knew 92 cameras.

[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.520]
It's the most beautiful, the most spacious camera they've made yet.

[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.980]
You won't believe the deal they could have made this past weekend during the Toyota of Hollywood World Series of Savings.

[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.900]
You should have checked the back of the sports pages in last weekend's Harold for record-shattering prices.

[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.780]
See, this is a spot it's kind of like learn your lesson.

[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.060]
And next time we tell you, you'll check the ads and you'll get your ass down there.

[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.280]
Okay, it's to make you feel bad.

[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.280]
They were really expecting a large crowd.

[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.860]
I'm sure they probably had one turn out.

[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.400]
So you should have heard on down.

[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.900]
Special finance experts were there on hand to offer you big bucks on your trade-in.

[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.080]
And low monthly payments on that great new 92 Toyota.

[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.540]
The best selection, the best prices.

[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.080]
And Patrick Murray who couldn't get arrested in the rated cheerfnick's house.

[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.500]
They're all waiting for you at Toyota of Hollywood on 441.

[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.320]
Between Taft and Sheridan streets in Hollywood where people come to buy.

[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.700]
And not to shop.

[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.860]
And we'll come back live.

[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.680]
We're making a wee bit of a comeback here at the Swap Shop.

[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.840]
If you wear glasses or contacts, listen to this.

[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.000]
Another bag.

[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.800]
And we have one more.

[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.980]
Man, rich has pulled these things out of I don't know where.

[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.640]
Jim Gurgis.

[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.560]
Not here.

[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.820]
Dave, uh, G-O-L-N.

[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.440]
G-O-C-N.

[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.280]
Wilton Manners.

[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.800]
Is Dave Goln?

[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.100]
I guess Dave's Goln.

[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.560]
Steve Adler, North Miami Beach, slept all the way up here.

[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.120]
To win a breeder's cut bag, we pulled his name out of the thing.

[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.760]
And Steve is not here.

[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.920]
Steve, joy mirrors of Parkland.

[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.840]
A joy forever.

[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.440]
Is a thing to hold tomorrow?

[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.220]
Not here.

[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.100]
Otto Blanco, Miami Lakes.

[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.820]
Otto.

[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.900]
Well, I heard a gushry from way in the back there.

[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.580]
Is that you Otto?

[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.200]
Okay.

[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.660]
Stuff that baby with all kinds of good stuff.

[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.040]
Okay.

[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.980]
And the bag too.

[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.300]
Okay.

[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.680]
We got a one breeder's cut t-shirt left to give away to Hermann Gehring.

[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.800]
Oh, Jerry Gehring, a Fort Lauderdale, G-O-E-H-R-I-N-G.

[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.440]
Where's the guy in the SS outfit?

[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:45.960]
Jerry?

[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.440]
Not here.

[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:48.920]
Joe?

[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.260]
Troholis of Hallendale.

[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:52.660]
Joe?

[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.320]
I heard another gushry.

[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:56.940]
Where is Joe?

[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.620]
There is Joe right over here.

[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.980]
Joe, you got the t-shirt.

[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.120]
So that takes care of all that.

[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.460]
We're going to give some snapple away.

[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.260]
And we'll take a few more of these incredible calls.

[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.980]
Now we can all get out of here and say, hey, it was a great experience.

[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.740]
Was it a great experience so far?

[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.060]
Yeah.

[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.260]
That's what I would say about the same enthusiasm.

[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.300]
Okay, let's take a call from Kendall.

[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:15.680]
Hello.

[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:17.580]
Kendall.

[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.140]
Okay, next one.

[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:19.580]
Miami.

[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.020]
Hello.

[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:21.800]
Miami.

[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:23.880]
Hello, Neil.

[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.780]
The guy in the hospital.

[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.180]
Yeah.

[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.000]
That's my brother.

[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.700]
Oh, yeah?

[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.820]
Mike, you're on tape.

[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:29.940]
Isn't that great?

[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.880]
That's awesome.

[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.800]
Oh, did you hear that?

[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.280]
I sound like I'm under water now.

[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:33.920]
Did you hear that?

[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.040]
Can you hear it?

[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.580]
I've been hearing it.

[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.940]
Yeah, it sounds like it's repeating, like underwater.

[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.220]
Well, let me tell you, when you hear it.

[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.100]
It's me or can you hear it?

[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:40.940]
Listen to that.

[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.100]
We're under water.

[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.460]
All right.

[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.600]
I bet you even Joy Reynolds never did this.

[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.180]
Hello.

[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.520]
Yeah, so now you and your brother are big stars, right?

[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.560]
We're mega stars.

[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.060]
Can you hear that?

[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.060]
The way it's feeding back?

[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:55.840]
No.

[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:56.800]
I can.

[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.380]
I like it.

[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.000]
I'm getting a sensual thrills from it.

[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.080]
Well, all of that, when you were doing that radio with your paper quarter there, it sounded

[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.100]
much better than this show.

[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.220]
On guarantee of that.

[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.640]
Neil?

[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.220]
I want to call somebody to do space.

[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:10.800]
Go ahead.

[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.320]
Ed and Eric, you guys have a major do space.

[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:13.840]
Okay.

[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.220]
Florida State Number One.

[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.240]
Go visit your brother.

[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.400]
Give me something to do, okay?

[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.520]
I did last night.

[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:18.960]
Okay.

[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.560]
All righty.

[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.000]
See ya.

[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:20.260]
Bye.

[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.260]
And he visited his brother too.

[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.060]
Once 17 at WIOD, now things are starting to pick up.

[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.020]
I like the sound of this.

[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.640]
Could we figure out how this works and take it back to the station and do this every day

[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.700]
at the underwater show?

[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.920]
Where we're drowning over here.

[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.580]
Let's go to Lauderdale Lakes.

[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.500]
Welcome to WIOD, where we're just confused and glad about it.

[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:40.760]
Hello.

[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.460]
Hi.

[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.040]
Hi.

[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:42.800]
I'm Michelle.

[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.020]
How you doing, Michelle?

[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:44.400]
Great.

[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.460]
I was there earlier.

[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.400]
Early in the morning.

[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.200]
I was sitting in the front and I had the two kids.

[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.360]
Did you win anything?

[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.300]
My mom did.

[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.040]
Yes, you called my name and she picked it up for me.

[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.080]
Well, that's great.

[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:54.600]
It's great.

[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.520]
You got to say hi because I slept here from Miami Beach this morning.

[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.440]
It's great to be there.

[00:09:59.580 --> 00:09:59.580]

[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.420]
Well, hi, Phyllis.

[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.680]
Congratulations on winning our big schmata whatever was we gave away to you from WIOD.

[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.380]
Where we spur no expense to send the most mediocre.

[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.240]
And you know what?

[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:09.620]
Is that you?

[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.180]
Oh, that's the lady down there that came up here 17 times to win a prize, right?

[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.360]
17 times?

[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:15.880]
At least.

[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.620]
Listen, let me tell you one other thing.

[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.280]
She said you were number one, by the way.

[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.540]
Oh, let me tell you something about you.

[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.040]
Yeah.

[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.160]
I was told not to be disappointed and I wasn't.

[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.960]
I thought you were pretty cute and funny.

[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:27.960]
Oh, huh?

[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.560]
Yeah, I was the thin tall guy that would keep carrying the box all over the place.

[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.820]
Everybody thought that was Adam.

[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.660]
That was really me.

[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.420]
Oh, oh, now I know.

[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:35.720]
Yeah.

[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.120]
Hey, Neil, you're cool.

[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.000]
You did a scene that gigantic snake that the Preston hand set up here to put around my neck.

[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.060]
Yeah, I heard you just incredible.

[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.380]
We were about like two seconds away from a major lawsuit.

[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.080]
Yeah.

[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.560]
I noticed as soon as I mentioned my lawyer and lawsuit all of a sudden the snake disappeared

[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.240]
and pressed them right over to see Sheriff Nick.

[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.160]
Oh, well, listen, they need to get a life.

[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:54.980]
Yes, they do.

[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.000]
So let me ask you something, is you were driving home from here?

[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:58.420]
Yeah.

[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.660]
I want to keep pressing this, but I'd like to get the the the Emma's.

[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.020]
You know, I'm saying I like to get an answer.

[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.960]
You're the harmonica?

[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.320]
That's Aubrey.

[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.500]
Is Stevie Wonder visiting or what is that?

[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.100]
Her name is Aubrey Cantitorian.

[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.200]
She's dynamite on the home.

[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:12.640]
Great.

[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.580]
On the mouth organ.

[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.060]
That's good.

[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.680]
Now listen, as you were driving home.

[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.980]
You found it fine and you found fine in the house too.

[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:18.360]
Great.

[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.320]
Well, thanks for the good report.

[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.440]
Yeah, what can I say?

[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:21.860]
OK.

[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.960]
All right, Neil, take it easy.

[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.820]
Have a lovely life.

[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.360]
Bye, mom.

[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.260]
See, she said bye, mom.

[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.040]
And she said you're still number one.

[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.700]
With the other hand.

[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.240]
A mobile in Miami.

[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:31.680]
Hello.

[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.040]
How you doing?

[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.720]
OK.

[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.500]
You don't sound like you're underwater.

[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.180]
Good.

[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.180]
We don't hear it.

[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.800]
Only you do.

[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.000]
But it was, well, maybe it was just the effect of the show.

[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.960]
It's having on my mind.

[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.420]
It could be.

[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.900]
I want to talk sport.

[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.480]
I'm taking a mental barrier.

[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.600]
I'm animal when I get home.

[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.420]
It's going to be great.

[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:46.940]
Are you?

[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:47.820]
OK, go ahead.

[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.360]
Whatever you like, sir, this is America.

[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.060]
This is W-I-O-D where you can say almost anything you want

[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.820]
as long as we agree.

[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.220]
Go ahead.

[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.120]
Who is the N-L-most valuable player?

[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.820]
Who's the most valuable player?

[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.160]
Yeah.

[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.040]
Terry Pendleton.

[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.140]
Not Gantt?

[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:03.580]
No.

[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.420]
Gantt?

[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:04.700]
Yeah.

[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.160]
Oh, he's sucking up to you, sir.

[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.160]
I think he wants to date.

[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.060]
No, but Terry Pendleton hands down.

[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.980]
No question about it.

[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.900]
Go to the bank on it.

[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.140]
Did they have a chance to come back?

[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.120]
Of course.

[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:13.820]
Are you rooting back?

[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.920]
They're a coming back team.

[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.400]
I'm rooting my brains out.

[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:16.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.940]
As long as we keep that pink O-Jane fondant

[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.900]
or sleeping husband out of there, we got a chance.

[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.760]
So what's the story?

[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.280]
She said she's not going to do it anymore.

[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.580]
She's not going to do it anymore.

[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.420]
And she's not making the chop anymore, either.

[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.420]
What about him, if he's looking at me?

[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.900]
He and I'd look in from him sleeping.

[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.820]
I think he's been doing it for a long time.

[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.200]
OK, believe me.

[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.220]
Well, you take care.

[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.960]
You're the best, but I know it.

[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:36.320]
All right.

[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.040]
What's sucking around?

[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.460]
OK, 20 after 1 to 2.

[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.840]
If you can do this show today, the way this show has gone

[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.360]
and somebody calls and says, you're the best.

[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.040]
You know, either the desperate, they want to date

[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.900]
or they like your life.

[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.920]
20 after 1 at 610, W-I-O-D.

[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.380]
And let's do a little break here.

[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.620]
Alex will come right back.

[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.940]
We're live at the Swap Shop.

[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.880]
We got 40 minutes.

[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.460]
We're counting it down by the second.

[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.340]
Thank you, Tim.

[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.340]
123 at W-I-O-D.

[00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.580]
We're live at the Swap Shop.

[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.740]
Let's continue with the calls.

[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.740]
We got some snappled to give away, too, by the way.

[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.400]
And is that it?

[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.640]
I don't want to make sure we give everything away

[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.080]
that we got.

[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.640]
By the way, lovely Laura is here from the former continuity

[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.580]
at W-I-O-D.

[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.480]
Remember, Sife tonight?

[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.340]
And all the great stories about Laura's rabbi.

[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.160]
Laura's here.

[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.460]
And she would come up and say some disgusting things

[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.380]
about management, but she's getting a good settlement.

[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.700]
So she's going to keep her mouth shut.

[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.400]
Good thinking, Laura.

[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.280]
123, let's go to Miami, a mobile.

[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:25.680]
Hello?

[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:26.820]
No.

[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:27.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.620]
I'm angry.

[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.320]
I'm disappointed.

[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.480]
Your mad is hell.

[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.320]
I'm mad at hell.

[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.500]
OK, join a crowd.

[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.140]
I got a call.

[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.300]
I got a couple of golf fans in the car.

[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.940]
And we got a vent our anger.

[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.200]
We've got a call for Sammy Smith, Mama, a dispatch.

[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:41.580]
Yeah.

[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.300]
I know it.

[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:42.720]
I'm sorry.

[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.720]
I'm angry and hurt.

[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.180]
I took my season tickets.

[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.880]
They look great on a brushed brush frame in my office,

[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.160]
because I'm certainly not going to use them.

[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.540]
I'm sitting at blazing hot sun to watch that trash.

[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.740]
Good luck, sir.

[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.140]
I know it.

[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.440]
You're nothing.

[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.200]
Hey, hold on.

[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:57.580]
Yeah.

[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.460]
Here's another one, too.

[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.040]
If you want to call someone a dispatch, too.

[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.340]
OK.

[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.460]
Yeah.

[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:02.140]

[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.460]
Hey, Marbys, this is your bag.

[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.540]
OK, thanks a lot.

[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.240]
OK, Rick Weaver calling it on his day off.

[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.420]
124 at WIOD, Little River.

[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:09.760]
Hello.

[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.920]
Little River is gone.

[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.400]
Pembroke Pines.

[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.400]
Hello.

[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.920]
Pembroke Pines going once?

[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:22.400]
Yeah.

[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:23.620]
How you doing?

[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.100]
OK.

[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.960]
I just have one thing I want to talk about golf in a minute.

[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.280]
Who's the running back coach?

[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.200]
Do you know for the golfants?

[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.040]
The running back coach?

[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.340]
Yeah.

[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.140]
Feats me.

[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.660]
I just came down here from New York,

[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.460]
in the last few games at the golf and played.

[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.220]
Sammy Smith jumping over to top with one hand.

[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.080]
Would I own a ball with two hands?

[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:42.640]
Right.

[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.480]
It's just amazing.

[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:45.960]
Yeah, it is amazing.

[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.760]
That's what Shula said in the locker room after the game.

[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.220]
He said he must have told Tony Nathan.

[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:49.740]
That's right.

[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.480]
He said he must have had two hands on a ball.

[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.080]
And then one of the coaches, it wasn't Tony.

[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.960]
One of the coaches said, no, he didn't.

[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.900]
And Shula just had a spit-eating look on his face.

[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.460]
There is no way you can jump it to the end.

[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.560]
They all are holding the ball in one hand.

[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.400]
Of course not.

[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.100]
And even Higgs was talking about the way how he leaps sideways

[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.020]
to make sure he's got the better angle.

[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.420]
And he's got both hands on a ball.

[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.060]
And Sammy just goes in and we're low for bread.

[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.240]
And they're looking for it.

[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.740]
It's the only chance they got to stop it.

[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.080]
Knock it out of his hands and bingo.

[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:15.820]
We do it again.

[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.880]
I don't know if he's too excited to get in or what.

[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:18.600]
Wasn't thinking.

[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.140]
I don't know.

[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.160]
Never should have happened.

[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.720]
It should never have happened.

[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.040]
But you see those Toronto Maple Leafs against those

[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.740]
cannot fly off night?

[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.400]
Yeah, they're great.

[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.740]
Why was it on?

[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.200]
Yeah.

[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.300]
Oh, I didn't see that.

[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.100]
Thank God.

[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.200]
Didn't see it.

[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.400]
Yeah, enclosing.

[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:32.900]
Go Rangers.

[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.440]
OK.

[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:33.920]
Right.

[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.020]
125 at WIOD.

[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.540]
Don't forget sports channel has come to continental cable,

[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.380]
which gives a lot of people a little more of a life.

[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.460]
I just can't believe the it's either these people are loyal

[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.360]
who are here today or have no life at all.

[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.140]
These people have been here.

[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.640]
Is there other people have been here since 10 o'clock?

[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.960]
Look at that.

[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.800]
There's like a whole bunch of hands

[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.620]
of people have been here since way back at 10.

[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.960]
I can't get over it.

[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.600]
Get a life.

[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.020]
I mean, talk about loyalty.

[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.120]
Talk about just waiting for something exciting to happen.

[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.480]
I got news for you.

[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.680]
And the last part, it ain't.

[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.900]
But Phyllis is still there.

[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.980]
She's a celebrity now.

[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.460]
Her daughter was on the phone.

[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.580]
It's, you know how that gets in a week.

[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.360]
They'll both be chronic.

[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.080]
They'll be like Bonnie and Sandy.

[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.400]
Miami.

[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:14.840]
Hello.

[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.500]
Hello.

[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.560]
I want to talk about the dolphins.

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.780]
Wayne is the, sir.

[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:20.380]
Yeah.

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.660]
Do you think Sammy sucks?

[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.880]
Do I think so?

[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:24.440]
Yeah.

[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.500]
You want an honest answer?

[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:25.920]
Yeah.

[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:26.340]
Yes.

[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:26.960]
Yeah?

[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.560]
Why did you start?

[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.020]
OK.

[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.740]
Thank you, sir.

[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.880]
I take it as a great compliment.

[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.340]
126 at WIOD.

[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.060]
Oh, jeez, he said I suck on.

[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:36.640]
No.

[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.320]
My mother is listening.

[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.620]
I mean, that's the same mentality.

[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:42.980]
OK.

[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.840]
I mean, you're either going to butcher up and take it

[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.860]
like a real man or make believe.

[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.420]
What are you just going to be a wimp like?

[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:48.900]
Sammy?

[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.640]
Hollywood.

[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.100]
Hello.

[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.240]
Hollywood.

[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.240]
Oh, no.

[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:53.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.260]
Hey, first time calling.

[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:55.800]
Great.

[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.300]
And I think you're agree.

[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.020]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.440]
And what is it you want?

[00:16:59.760 --> 00:16:59.880]
Huh?

[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.800]
What is it you want?

[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.700]
Nobody sucks around like that without wanting to.

[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.260]
I'm leaving.

[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:03.800]
I'm moving.

[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.580]
Where are you going?

[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.340]
San Francisco.

[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.200]
Oh, boy.

[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.860]
And I'm going to miss you.

[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:09.560]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:10.960]
And I'm going to miss you.

[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.340]
Well, you're going out there just in time

[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.380]
that Alex Bennett got camped out there

[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.680]
so you won't have to worry about him.

[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.160]
All right.

[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.860]
But who else is in a listen to you, Alex?

[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.260]
Nobody.

[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:18.780]
Nobody.

[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.000]
No good.

[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.500]
And I'm just happy to get out of Florida and Miami

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.160]
and all the cockroaches and all that down here.

[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.520]
Take a lot of tapes with you, sir.

[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:27.360]
Sorry.

[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.820]
I'd like to call somebody a douchebag.

[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.200]
OK.

[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.960]
Knit and a viral first of all.

[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.340]
He's right here.

[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.700]
He heard you said you're number one.

[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.700]
He said you better get out of town fast.

[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.700]
And tell him to stop going to the adult bookstores.

[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:38.320]
OK.

[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.600]
And he said he's got a good selection at home for you.

[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.760]
If you don't find what you're looking for.

[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.620]
I'm sure he does.

[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:43.920]
Yeah.

[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.580]
And two more people.

[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.240]
Twelve and her Z are big anal beach bags.

[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:48.740]
OK.

[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:49.860]
Have a great life.

[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.260]
It's a great.

[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:50.700]
OK.

[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.000]
And don't drop the soap.

[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.780]
128 at WIOD.

[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.780]
By the way, is anybody selling two live crew here

[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.140]
at the Swab Shop?

[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.520]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.300]
We could have a live on the air bus.

[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.780]
It could be better than Channel 7.

[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.680]
We could get Rick to come over here and squat over our

[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.440]
Sheriff Nick's head.

[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.820]
Man, we could have a big on air thing and save this damn show

[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.120]
today.

[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.940]
Mobile in Key Largo.

[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.180]
Hello.

[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.620]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.080]
Great.

[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.740]
I just want to comment on the post game show.

[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.100]
When him was talking about the fact that one guy put a towel

[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:20.800]
over his head.

[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.900]
The other guy said don't put Sammy in.

[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.280]
As far as I'm concerned, they were saying the same thing

[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:25.860]
as the fans.

[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.360]
Right.

[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:27.080]

[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.020]

[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.520]
Except the fans don't have any way to voice this off except

[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.240]
in the stadium.

[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.880]
But how come on we say it that all of a sudden we're bad guys

[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.840]
and we suck and we shouldn't come back if we want to criticize?

[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.300]
I still can't get over that.

[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.000]
I never heard such a thing in my life.

[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.900]
It would be like if I had a restaurant, OK?

[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.520]
And you came in and you had what you considered

[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.300]
was a bad meal.

[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.300]
And you called the waitress.

[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.520]
You said, I'm going to send this back.

[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.200]
I don't like the food.

[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.340]
And I said to you, I said, if you're

[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.900]
going to complain, don't ever come back here again.

[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.540]
Would anybody ever say that?

[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.220]
That's right.

[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.600]
Unless they were out of their mind.

[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.240]
Yeah, somebody like me have only been saying,

[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.480]
only been saying, pick it all just for 21 years.

[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:01.820]
Yeah.

[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.660]
I guess that gives us a chance to say something.

[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.580]
You bet.

[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.000]
Have a great face.

[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.440]
Terrible phone.

[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.780]
John Feinberg in Atlanta.

[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.520]
Neil.

[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.420]
Yes, John.

[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.060]
How you doing?

[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:14.520]
Great.

[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.480]
I called him my portable lollipagot.

[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.540]
You were sounding loud and clear early in the show.

[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.100]
Yeah.

[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.100]
So I heard the show.

[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.380]
How'd you hear the show?

[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.980]
Well, I called on the 800 number.

[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.520]
Oh, I see.

[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.460]
Nobody ever picked it up.

[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:25.720]
No.

[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.860]
Well, he was busy trying to save his job.

[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.860]
But it sounds great.

[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:29.420]
Good.

[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.580]
I listened to the whole show.

[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.020]
This town's gone crazy.

[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.040]
Yeah, I bet they are.

[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.840]
These people are what I want.

[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.500]
By the way, you bet.

[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.640]
Oh, it's 130 already.

[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.920]
And Ronnie Gantt is still sitting here in the first row.

[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.540]
And now I got news.

[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.700]
We better get that plane in here.

[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.880]
You guys going to be in big trouble,

[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.240]
although he has left a lot of runners in scoring position.

[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.280]
Hey, I didn't want to dump on you, Ronnie.

[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.400]
But I got news for you.

[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.680]
That foul, pop fly with runners at first.

[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.000]
And third, the other nice shameful.

[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:50.700]
I agree.

[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.580]
I disgrace in the top of the eighth, Ronnie.

[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.200]
Butch up.

[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.680]
I'm surprised you're not coming here tonight.

[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.000]
What do you mean by that?

[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.960]
I got a work for a living.

[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.180]
OK, I can't just flew around like some kind of butterfly.

[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.280]
Well, I'm not independently wealthy like Preston Han.

[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.900]
If Preston gave me a big bag of money,

[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.320]
I'd be up there in a couple of hours.

[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:05.960]
No problem.

[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.000]
I'll think about you tonight when I'm doing the chop up.

[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.360]
OK, go braves.

[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:09.900]
Go braves.

[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.440]
OK, and screw those Indians, sir.

[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.440]
Hey, one thing they want to trade Sammy Smith

[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.600]
for Tim MacIer up here.

[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:15.340]
Yeah.

[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.360]
We'll pack a sandwich you can have both of them.

[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:18.720]
All right.

[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.320]
130 at WIOD.

[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.380]
And let's, I don't even know what we're doing anymore.

[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.840]
I'm just doing it on automatic pilot.

[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.100]
I could be here like midnight now.

[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:27.940]
It wouldn't make any difference.

[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.900]
Let's go to Miami.

[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:30.380]
Hello.

[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.560]
Good afternoon, Neil.

[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.000]
Yes.

[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.320]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.660]
Are we making a little comeback now?

[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.660]
You're doing great.

[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.100]
OK.

[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.100]
I'd like to make a quick comment about Cambra Marshall.

[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:40.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:41.920]
OK, this guy.

[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.720]
He's out of this world.

[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.260]
I'll tell you.

[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:43.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:44.740]
That's true.

[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.640]
So last night on the sportscast, he just

[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.520]
went on and on about Sammy Smith and just how the fans

[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.260]
and how it's just a game and how it got out of hand

[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.540]
and this closing comment was, for all those fans

[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.360]
that boot him, get a life.

[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.540]
Oh, no.

[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.200]
Not only is he stealing my material,

[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.520]
but it is just a game.

[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.780]
But the people who go out there

[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.360]
got a right to complain in Beliac

[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.920]
if they're paying their 26 or 28 bucks, don't they?

[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.840]
That's right.

[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.880]
And I just want to know how many more time

[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.860]
to see enough to fumble before we finally get rid of him?

[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.780]
Probably as many times as it takes for Don Schule

[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.880]
to convince himself that he can't get the job done.

[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.120]
And heaven help us before how long we figure that's going to be.

[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.160]
I don't know.

[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.680]
Hopefully something will work.

[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.640]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.360]
How come, like when Marino makes a real bad play

[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.080]
at a crucial time in a game or has a bad game?

[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.260]
And he's had several this year.

[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.320]
Marino says it was my fault.

[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.640]
I can't play anybody else.

[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.880]
I have to take responsibility.

[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.200]
I didn't get the job done.

[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.900]
He's the one of the few stand-up guys on the team.

[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.900]
We don't even try to blame our...

[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.040]
When Schule makes a call like that,

[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.600]
and he sends in a guy who you know is going to fumble the ball,

[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.720]
he doesn't say it was my fault I call the plays as well.

[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.360]
We just got to put this behind us.

[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.300]
Yadi, yadi, yadi, yadi.

[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.480]
How come he never takes a blame for it?

[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.440]
You're right about that.

[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.380]
I mean, you can't just keep getting kudos and credit

[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.760]
for those previous 300 wins.

[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.780]
We'd like to have a few more before we die, you know?

[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.660]
Is my right?

[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.820]
That's true, yes.

[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.680]
Have a great day.

[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:09.340]
Thank you.

[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:09.800]
See you.

[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.780]
Not that I want to get excited about this again today

[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.620]
is the last day for any of this, okay?

[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.080]
In spite of any intempered bashing or crap,

[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.000]
you're tired of hearing about this?

[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:20.820]
Too bad.

[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.260]
Okay, 132.

[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.600]
Hey, you got it in your system.

[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.400]
You have to win it out, let it out.

[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.340]
Am I right?

[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.040]
Even the Nots landing, ladies said,

[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.920]
put a lid on it already.

[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:30.640]
Did you say that?

[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.860]
Since Pat Peterson left the show,

[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.160]
she has been such a wreck, man.

[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.460]
She just can't control herself.

[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.460]
It's been so long the show has been on.

[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.840]
I don't even remember what it's about anymore.

[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.400]
130, what is it?

[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.080]
You did what?

[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.880]
Did I sit up here and let you take your picture

[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.920]
and let you humiliate and degrade

[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.240]
and make a circus up here?

[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.280]
Did I not subject myself to all this fall to all?

[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.380]
And now you're still hawking me a china kabad.

[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.780]
Just relax, okay?

[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.720]
40,000 years from now,

[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.720]
nobody will give a crap about any of this, okay?

[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:11.060]
Right, so just relax and have another beer, okay?

[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.760]
133 at WIOD, mobile in Miami, hello.

[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.060]
Are you there?

[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.300]
A mobile in Miami, who's about to speak?

[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.820]
I can't believe it, there's a sound coming

[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.220]
through the end of this thing, yes sir?

[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.080]
Yes, it's working.

[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:25.620]
Okay.

[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.080]
Well, first of all, I just find it so amazing

[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.520]
that they have Tony Nason as the running's back coach,

[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.060]
because that guy was notorious for fumbling when he played.

[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.340]
Well, at least he's a good teacher.

[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.160]
Oh, man, it's the most incredible thing.

[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.920]
And also, I'm finally glad that everybody's taking

[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.440]
Mandage and the gaki to task for this,

[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.340]
because they've been doing it all season long,

[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.620]
just ripping all the fans.

[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.720]
And I'm finally glad that that asshole's getting his-

[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.980]
Say, there's a difference between ripping front-running

[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.140]
phonies who don't show up unless you got a winner.

[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.700]
I mean, that's legitimate, I've been doing that

[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.160]
for years and I stand by that.

[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.760]
But to rip the people who do show up

[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.460]
and the people, the thousands of us,

[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.880]
including me who left early before that little episode

[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.940]
happened and to start painting everybody

[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.560]
with a big brush and a fan suck

[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.920]
and to try to turn it around.

[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.200]
That's a pile of crap.

[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.400]
And I am embarrassed and nauseated for those people

[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.460]
who listen and call into this radio station

[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.340]
who call into suck around to agree

[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.220]
every time those guys get on and say that crap,

[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.320]
because it's a bunch of garbage.

[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.940]
It is. I mean, when Sammy dropped the ball

[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.600]
and they recovered and they called it,

[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.860]
I immediately got my son, we stood up and we just walked out.

[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.920]
I was too disgusted to hang out anymore,

[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.320]
so I didn't really hear the episode.

[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.520]
Well, we stayed, fat rich and I were there,

[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.740]
just blowing our brains out.

[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.900]
We stayed, I mean, hoping we'd get the ball back one more time,

[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.620]
Houston started that series.

[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.020]
They made the first down, it was less than two minutes to go

[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:43.720]
and we had no time.

[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.880]
And at that point, you know, we're not getting the ball back.

[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.340]
We left.

[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.660]
So whatever the episode that happened was right at the very end,

[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.420]
thousands and thousands of people, including me,

[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.160]
were out of the stadium, but because we were there that day,

[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.800]
all of a sudden, we're guilty by association and we suck.

[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.920]
And the thing is that we're really pissed me off

[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.220]
because that he would let these jerks

[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.700]
that come from other towns like Philadelphia, Chicago,

[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.000]
or whatnot and ripped the fans that were there.

[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.460]
We're voicing their own opinions.

[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.260]
And like, he would just let them go on ad nauseam,

[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.400]
these apples that come here from wherever else they come from.

[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.120]
All they know how to do is to-

[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.000]
I'd like to hear, I'd like to hear Manichin Zagaki talk

[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.560]
about what would the reaction have been

[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.180]
to Sammy's second straight fumble in the end zone

[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.980]
if the game were played in Philadelphia if he was on the Eagles

[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.120]
or if the game were played in the Middolands,

[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.500]
if he was on a giant to the Jets,

[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.060]
what kind of reaction would he have had then?

[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.180]
He wouldn't have came out alive.

[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.300]
Well, Neil, have a good win.

[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.300]
Keep your blood pressure down.

[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.000]
See ya.

[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.400]
135 at WIOD.

[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.920]
You know, a lady in Miami purchased a red 1990 Honda Accord

[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.940]
for what she thought was a pretty good price.

[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.340]
The odometer on the car said only 8400 miles,

[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.100]
but surprise, when she got the car home

[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.080]
and looked in the glove box,

[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.420]
she found any missions test print out from June

[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:57.040]
that reported the car's mileage to really be 34,000 miles.

[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.680]
It's more than 25,000 miles more than she thought,

[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.380]
and that was four months ago.

[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:05.000]
In a panic, she called our friends at the 140 at WIOD.

[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.540]
Okay, we're gonna have another cheer from this crowd.

[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.600]
We still have, I almost every seat here is filled.

[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.620]
I can't believe it.

[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.600]
Don't not that kind of a cheer, not that kind of a cheer.

[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.980]
At the count of three, I want Neil Sucks, okay?

[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.440]
Because I want to prove that I can handle it.

[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.260]
I'm gonna leave here.

[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.180]
I may have a few tears running down my cheeks.

[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.560]
This guy's still doing a chop.

[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.660]
He's still chopping it.

[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.720]
Well, it's a good thing you don't have a pastrami over there.

[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.920]
So we could have some good sandwiches.

[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.640]
What is it?

[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:32.780]
What?

[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.760]
You know that snap on you brought was delicious,

[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.640]
but it's starting to back up just a little bit.

[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.040]
Okay, here we go.

[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.040]
Glenn, calm down.

[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.520]
One, two, three.

[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.580]
I want to trade.

[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.660]
140 at WIOD, I want to be traded to QAM,

[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.420]
so I can work with some real sports people

[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.980]
like my fault friend Eddie Kaplan.

[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.360]
There's a great guy.

[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.980]
20 bad handicapped, but a good guy.

[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.560]
19 till two at WIOD.

[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.020]
Now let's give the snaple away here

[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.560]
because these people are holding a hope out above hope

[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.740]
that they might get their name called.

[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.240]
Arlene's bill, Folk, La Bocca.

[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.120]
We got seven or four packs of snaple.

[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.720]
We're never gonna get to this.

[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.180]
Okay, because most of these people are going,

[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.220]
how are we gonna do this?

[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:27.820]
Where's Adam?

[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.280]
Adam is over there, hawk on the china.

[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.000]
Let's give the snaple away, okay?

[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.740]
I'll let you use your own discretion

[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.780]
so they can blame you.

[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.460]
Just wander around, find some people back there

[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.380]
that look desperate, that haven't won anything,

[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.960]
that looked like they're really needy,

[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.900]
that love snaple, that maybe you want to make a date with you,

[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.300]
and I'll come and watch.

[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:51.820]
Okay, we'll take care of that,

[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:52.760]
and that means that's it.

[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.640]
Okay, we did everything.

[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.120]
We give away everything that we had,

[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.040]
and hallelujah, and thank God for that.

[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.200]
Let's take a few more calls.

[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.780]
You know, by the way, I heard that promo.

[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.380]
Did you notice who was on that promo

[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.580]
in the last break who shined us on the one day

[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.480]
when we desperately needed them the most

[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.960]
when we could have used their assistance

[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.680]
when we're having all kinds of technical problems

[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.020]
and I was ready to pass out,

[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.420]
we're sitting, we're spitting over here.

[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.520]
Reconcords, you'll notice, shined today.

[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.300]
Not that I want to turn you on or anything like that

[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.580]
or that I want anybody to call and attack them

[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.480]
for being douchebags and turncoats.

[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.020]
Reconcords, total shined today.

[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.220]
I can't believe that.

[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.400]
Now, trust me when I tell you, okay?

[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:30.900]

[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:31.440]
Huh.

[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:32.300]
Huh.

[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.320]
We'll have rubbing my eyes.

[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.140]
Reconcords, ladies and gentlemen,

[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.840]
shined artists didn't show up,

[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.400]
and suds, by the way, is on the phone from the house,

[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.760]
not from the studio.

[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.200]
I got news for you.

[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:44.560]
If I were you.

[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.820]
We didn't want to show up because we were afraid they started chanting

[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.500]
that we thought, if I'd have been you guys,

[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.120]
I'd have stayed away from here today too.

[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:50.380]
Yeah.

[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.200]
I'd have held a wine on.

[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.160]
We weren't invited.

[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.820]
What if they started saying we suck?

[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.560]
We decided we were going to call in all of the sudden.

[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:56.560]

[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.920]
On three, Reconcides suck.

[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.220]
One, two, three.

[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:04.440]
Yeah.

[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.900]
They said it like they meant it.

[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.860]
Two, a couple of people said it two or three times.

[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.160]
Well, sure, our moms are there.

[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.020]
Boy, we could have used you here today.

[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.760]
I want to tell you, this is the mother.

[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.820]
Of course, considering it is my last remote broadcast ever,

[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.340]
I, you know, it's not.

[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.480]
I don't know what you're laughing about.

[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.720]
That's the Emma's, okay?

[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.120]
That is the living truth.

[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.260]
My show is out of the studio.

[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.900]
We got the cards, the phone.

[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.700]
It's comfortable.

[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.500]
Everything is.

[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.220]
I was on my way and then I heard what was going on.

[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.260]
I turned around immediately.

[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:32.820]
Chicken.

[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:33.920]
Total color.

[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:34.460]
You got it.

[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.720]
You're turning into another Zagaki lackey.

[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.840]
You probably didn't have the courage.

[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.220]
Hey, hey, let's keep in mind one to radio here.

[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:40.400]
It's right.

[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.680]
You guys probably had a facemet six o'clock.

[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.560]
Didn't have the courage.

[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.800]
No, they were out there.

[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.700]
No, I'm talking about tonight.

[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.280]
Oh, well, the show ends at five.

[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:49.720]
That's 50.

[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.060]
Now, let me ask you a question.

[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.360]
Since you have a sheet and I don't, who's doing sports talk tonight?

[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.120]
Football talk.

[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.160]
Shoel talk.

[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.300]
Who's doing it tonight?

[00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.000]
I don't have a sheet.

[00:29:59.260 --> 00:29:59.880]
You don't have a sheet?

[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.460]
Not yet.

[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.240]
It's not joking.

[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.400]
Oh, here we have a sheet.

[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.460]
Okay, we have a sheet.

[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.300]
It's Joe and Sunny.

[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]
With Terry Cashman, baseball composer or poser.

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.780]
We're talking baseball.

[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.040]
Well, that's a good way to sweep it out of the carpet, isn't it?

[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.720]
And then Hank, it says, no game due to World Series.

[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.120]
Yeah.

[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:19.840]
What does that mean?

[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.580]
That means that Hank is...

[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.760]
That's exactly what it says.

[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.620]
Hank is hanging out somewhere there.

[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.780]
It's not a game due to World Series.

[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.220]
What does no game do to World Series?

[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:28.460]
Yeah.

[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:28.980]
Exactly.

[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.160]
Well, they must have watched the first two in Minnesota.

[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.600]
I can't even speak anymore.

[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.960]
Well, hey, then we got to go.

[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.000]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.720]
Wouldn't you guys like to start a few minutes early?

[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:38.980]
Because you probably got a lot of material.

[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.480]
I always say, I have all this stuff here, and I'll never get to it.

[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.240]
Maybe today could be the day you get to all of it.

[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.400]
And then some.

[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.420]
Just be quiet.

[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.240]
And you might even...

[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.080]
You might even be able to play some of the cards out of Rax 1 and 2 if you play your

[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:51.620]
cards right now.

[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.120]
Okay, let's do the show, hey?

[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:53.360]

[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.660]
Drive home with the...

[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.260]
Oh, by the way, so what happened with that?

[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.000]
Okay, wait a minute.

[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.320]
We got a big crowd here.

[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.240]
Hold on.

[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.480]
We don't have to do this by phone call.

[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.060]
Everybody that wants the old rickensuds opening theme back.

[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.000]
Hands, let's see hands.

[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.200]
Ooh, pretty weird.

[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.480]
I guess you'll be pleased.

[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.240]
No, pretty weird.

[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.580]
Let's hear those people.

[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.480]
Okay, everybody that hates the old song is thinks it fits by the baby old song sucks.

[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.620]
Okay, everybody that doesn't give a crap one way or the other.

[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.280]
Oh, that's got the winner right there.

[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.240]
That's the one, okay.

[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.240]
Wow, by a landslide, wasn't even close.

[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.500]
Everybody that shuts the radio off at two o'clock.

[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.540]
Okay, let's say, oh, jeez.

[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.120]
Like I said, it's so good that you're over there.

[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.120]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.000]
There's no idea.

[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.040]
These people are brutal.

[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.260]
Okay, we'll be looking for you guys sooner than you can think.

[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.480]
Yeah, you can be right there.

[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.660]
And when Joe comes in, give him a big kiss for me, too, on the forehead if you can fight

[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.620]
it between those eyebrows.

[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.060]

[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.300]
You got it.

[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.120]
Tell him he makes me puke and tell him to get into...

[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.900]
Tell him to darken out his face on it, show on 39, man.

[00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.860]
People are starting to talk.

[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.400]
Let's go to sunrise.

[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.820]
Hello, welcome to WIOD, your family station.

[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:04.600]
Neil, how you doing?

[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.120]
Pretty good.

[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.760]
Neil, how come the announcers in the play is down here?

[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.680]
They don't realize that when you pay your money, you have certain rights.

[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.220]
They cause there a bunch of shills, sir.

[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.040]
There are shills.

[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.180]
They cover up artists.

[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.320]
They suck around together.

[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.300]
They sleep together.

[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.100]
They have an incestuous relationship, and they can't tell it like it is.

[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:22.820]
How's that pronounced?

[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.580]
It's a good analogy.

[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:30.780]
I'll give you Eddie Arcaro used to get booed for $20 a ride at three to five when he dumped

[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.680]
on a favorite.

[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:31.980]
Right.

[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.000]
And I was one of them.

[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.460]
Hey, let me...

[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.620]
Hey, let me...

[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:41.700]
At the racetrack, the railbirds, the people that go down and stand right by the rail.

[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:47.120]
I have an occasion in the summertime when it's an ice day, you go down and stand by the

[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:47.260]
rail.

[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.620]
They come out for the post parade.

[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.500]
And the fans are like five feet away.

[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.180]
I mean, it's a captive audience.

[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:59.020]
And I remember one time at Yonkers, I'm standing by the rail, and Carmine Abatello comes

[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.220]
out from the post parade.

[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.960]
And there's like a whole bunch of these nearer, Carmine, you suck.

[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:04.860]
And I mean, they're screaming.

[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.800]
And guess what?

[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.960]
He goes in there and he does his business in the next race, whatever he's got planned.

[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.680]
You know how that goes?

[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.680]
And life goes on and that goes with the territory.

[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.980]
Of course it goes with the territory.

[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.720]
And he doesn't cry and say, I'm taking it, I'm going to freehold.

[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.860]
I'm not putting up with this thing.

[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.280]
I'm taking a red mile.

[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:19.860]
I don't like it.

[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:20.260]
Exactly.

[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.000]
It's part of the territory.

[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:22.540]
Of course.

[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.240]
And these guys are making big money.

[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:29.540]
And to listen to Hank and all these other sagretto and toning and this is shameful and

[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.240]
how could anyone person take the abuse?

[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.440]
What kind of crap is that?

[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.140]
We all get it.

[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.620]
And if you're in a public limelight, you take a lot of crap.

[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.140]
And if you get paid well for it, then you just smile all the way to the back.

[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.420]
It made a hell of Sammy going to go to the things he wound people.

[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:41.920]
Yeah.

[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.820]
Good luck to him.

[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:44.360]
Thank you.

[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.140]
See you.

[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.160]
Excellent call.

[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.940]
Finally getting my adrenaline going again here today.

[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.640]
147 and WIOD.

[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:58.520]
It says, please tell all these slime ball termite inspectors to inspect this from Mike

[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.640]
Petrazino of the Florida termite inspectors.

[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.260]
You're a great American Mike.

[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.240]
Inspect this.

[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:04.660]
Okay.

[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.040]
Inspect this Mike.

[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:07.640]
There he goes.

[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.500]
He looks like my bug man as a matter of fact, looks like I wrote a bad day.

[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.000]
147 and WIOD.

[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.440]
A moment of silence right now to commemorate this magic moment in sales history as little

[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.800]

In fact, I'm having a difficult time believing knowing what a BS artist Denenberg is.

[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.020]
But it says so here in the copy.

[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.120]

[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.880]
is the best that your money can buy.

[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.120]
153 our final few minutes.

[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.320]
I say with deeper grad here at the swap shop.

[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.480]
It's been a day that we won't forget for a long time or Orlando.

[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.180]
Hello, Neil.

[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:39.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:40.580]
How you doing?

[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:40.860]
Neil.

[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:41.840]
OK, Orlando.

[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:42.900]
What's up?

[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.060]
Now I'm just calling you.

[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.420]
I haven't talked to you for a week.

[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.180]
You know, I just seen what's going on.

[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.900]
We could have used you out here today or Orlando.

[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.060]
A lot of a lot of guys.

[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.800]
I mean, girls out here that would love to have had a date with you Orlando.

[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.120]
Oh, these two young ladies down here.

[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.100]
They would have just crawled all over your bones.

[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.480]
Oh, I guess it's like I got her tongue all the way down to her knee.

[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:02.700]
Oh, man.

[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:04.400]
Hello.

[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.420]
What is it?

[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.120]
Orlando, what happened?

[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:09.960]
I don't know.

[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.460]
And you got cut off there for a minute.

[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.120]
Don't worry about it.

[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:12.780]
Just keep talking.

[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.820]
OK, that's what I've been doing.

[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.360]
It worked for me.

[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.520]
Just keep talking and pretend that there's nothing's going on.

[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.780]
OK, now I just got back from New York last Wednesday.

[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.200]
Remember last time I talked to you.

[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:21.520]
Yeah.

[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.180]
I went to New York before I left New York.

[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.980]
And nothing to Sunday was my birthday.

[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.440]
Well, happy birthday, Orlando.

[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.040]
26, 27.

[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:29.880]
26.

[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.540]
Getting up there.

[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:32.700]
26.

[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.640]
26.

[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:34.320]
Why?

[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.500]
For a guy that old to look as good as this is pretty incredible, you know?

[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:42.900]
He thinks, you know, but I then you know, I went to a dolphin game on Sunday on my birthday.

[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:43.500]
Yeah.

[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.820]
Now, you were one of those guys that was sitting around at the end of the game saying,

[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.100]
Sammy Sucks, were you Orlando?

[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:48.980]
No, I wasn't.

[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:49.680]
I didn't do that.

[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.140]
OK.

[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.060]
I really didn't know.

[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.320]
I thought I kind of felt bad for him, you know, because I know he didn't do it on purpose.

[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:54.560]
Right.

[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.840]
You know, I know he could have put two hands on the ball going over.

[00:36:59.000 --> 00:36:59.180]
Right.

[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:00.840]
I don't know.

[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.440]
Well, you can probably relate to that putting two hands on it, right, Orlando?

[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.040]
OK.

[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.520]
Yeah, wouldn't do it right.

[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.080]
Yeah.

[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.660]
Well, listen, it's always a pleasure to hear your voice.

[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.960]
The ladies down here are going to go out and buy 40 copies of your calendar and we'll

[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.640]
be seeing you around.

[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.480]
Great, Neil.

[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:14.800]
Great.

[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.640]
Nice hearing from you.

[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:15.980]
OK.

[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:16.460]
OK.

[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.800]
See you.

[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:40.200]
I'm going to go out and buy a couple of them.

[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.080]
I'm going to go out and buy a couple of them.

[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:42.920]
I'm going to buy a couple of them.

[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:42.920]

[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:42.940]
I'm going to buy a couple of them.

[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:42.960]
I'm going to buy a couple of them.

[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:42.960]

[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:42.980]
I'm going to buy a couple of them.

[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:42.980]

[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:42.980]

[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:42.980]

[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:42.980]

[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.800]
I'm going to buy a couple of them.

[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.500]
I'm going to buy a couple of them.

[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.100]
I'm going to buy a couple of them.

[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.380]
I'm going to buy a couple of them.

[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:49.780]
I'm going to buy a couple of them.

[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:49.780]

[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.380]
I'm going to tell you this.

[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:56.640]
I played golf yesterday with the Breeders Crab Group and the Joe Pavia team was 99-1.

[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.260]
Really?

[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.600]
And finished right where the odds would indicate.

[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.040]
Up the track.

[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.460]
The Nick Salvy team was the winner.

[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.440]
Nick Salvy.

[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.220]
Nick Salvy.

[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:05.720]
Oh, boy.

[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.260]
Where's Raven over when we need him?

[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:12.020]
There was nobody watching that team though, so you know those harness men.

[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:12.560]
Yeah.

[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.940]
A little hanky-panky on the back side.

[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.360]
Oh, I don't want to say.

[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.180]
OK.

[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.380]
We'll be there post-time 7 o'clock Friday.

[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.980]
I have a feeling our sports department will be there, but we'll somehow survive without him.

[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:22.680]
It's a big night.

[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.160]
OK.

[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.520]
Can die laughing wins?

[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.380]
Look out for three wizards, sir.

[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.460]
That's all I can tell you.

[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.480]
Richie Silverman talks a good game, but look out again for three wizards in the deep stretch.

[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.200]
They all twirled out last week.

[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.040]
12 dollars.

[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.380]
You're about four days too late.

[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.100]
I know it.

[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:38.780]
We had him.

[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.000]
OK.

[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:40.620]
We had him.

[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.480]
You didn't come and ask me, did you?

[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.480]
No, I didn't.

[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.400]
Eddie Kaplan came and asked me, so can anybody beat this horse?

[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.100]
I said three wizards.

[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:48.620]
Did you really?

[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.420]
Yes, I did.

[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.740]
It was a good tech.

[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:51.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:51.900]
Very good.

[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.620]
Have a great year, Dave.

[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:52.900]
OK.

[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:53.900]
Let's take this.

[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:54.720]
OK.

[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.700]
Move along here, Alex.

[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.300]
Let's go.

[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:57.800]
Let's go.

[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.260]
It's only got three minutes left.

[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:00.140]
Man, is he slow?

[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:00.940]
Four-letter day.

[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:01.200]
Hello.

[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:03.940]
Miami.

[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:04.340]
Hello.

[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:05.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.120]
Where are you?

[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.540]
I'm in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:07.940]
OK.

[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:08.860]
Well, I'm on a head of you.

[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.180]
Go ahead.

[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:09.700]
Are you?

[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:10.080]
Yeah.

[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.400]
Yeah, Neil, I just got a big gun for a couple years.

[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.720]
I just wanted to have no bird.

[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.500]
You speak with him on the radio.

[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:17.260]
Hold who?

[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.060]
Bird.

[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.380]
Oh, the bird.

[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.040]
The bird.

[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:20.540]
The bird.

[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.420]
The bird is in Lakeland.

[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.320]
He's working at U-float them.

[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:23.960]
Is he?

[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.720]
He's floating them at U-float them, yeah.

[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.600]
Yeah, he's floating.

[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.380]
Yeah, we had little parting of the way, sir.

[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.780]
He's making a lot more money, maybe.

[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.600]
He's making about $375 an hour now.

[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.760]
He's got that now.

[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.100]
No more free lunches.

[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.220]
In nice talking day, I enjoy your show.

[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.120]
I'm just back.

[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.840]
I'm moving, but it's nice talking to you.

[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.660]
Where did you move to?

[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.160]
Alabama.

[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.220]
That's where I'm going.

[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.180]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:45.540]
When?

[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.060]
OK, with a band you want my knee.

[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.620]
Have a great life, pal.

[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.180]
OK, Sheriff Nick is over here saying, man,

[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.540]
if you think it's repressive in Alabama,

[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.100]
just give me another couple of years, man.

[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.100]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.380]
157 at WIOD.

[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.020]
Lakeland.

[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.400]
Is this the bird?

[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.580]
Everything's fine.

[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:03.100]
Yeah.

[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.120]
As long as I have my place of pizza.

[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.200]
OK, there he is, straight from Brickovan

[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.320]
with his slides of pizza.

[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:11.760]
Great.

[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.240]
OK, have a good nice life.

[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:13.780]
Get rid of him.

[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.080]
Miami, hello.

[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:18.600]
Yeah.

[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:19.220]
Yeah.

[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.460]
I think I hold the record for the most

[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.240]
calls in one day.

[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.040]
What does that mean?

[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.120]
Did we hear it from him 400 times?

[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.500]
Well, that's what happens on remote.

[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:30.660]
You will, then.

[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.080]
Hey, Neil.

[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:32.760]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.700]
I know you're running out of time,

[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.180]
so I'm going to get to the point real quick.

[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.940]
We're upset that we're running out of time,

[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:38.800]
but what the hell can you do?

[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.860]
It's only a four hour show.

[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.560]
Yeah, OK.

[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.400]
Sammy Smith, you were flaming first round

[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.320]
fumble-finger, Tom O'op Chopping,

[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.140]
seminal sucking douchebag.

[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:47.660]
OK.

[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.160]
Great job.

[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.660]
And we got some of the,

[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.260]
we got a couple of people here with guts

[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.580]
who applauded and agree with that.

[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.440]
Well, that's going to just about kick it in the head for us,

[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:56.820]
isn't it?

[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.100]
And I want to thank all of these people.

[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.080]
You have been incredible.

[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.040]
I just can't believe you, people, have been out here.

[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.940]
Some of them since 10 o'clock this morning,

[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.460]
they're sitting wondering when the hell the show starts,

[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.160]
but hey, listen, life wasn't built in one day, OK?

[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.420]
We did the best we could under difficult circumstances.

[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.080]
Enough sports tomorrow.

[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.660]
We're not going to talk about any of the fact.

[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.940]
I got enough material here today.

[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:16.640]
Believe me.

[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.500]
And we're going to talk about a great break.

[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.240]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.240]
We can't talk about the race victory around

[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.960]
because Glen from Irmer gets all psychotic and bent out of shape.

[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.620]
Well, we'll whisper about it, OK?

[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.440]
We'll just play the, the Tom Tom thing in the background

[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.440]
for four hours tomorrow.

[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.220]
Anyway, have a great life.

[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.320]
Thanks again for coming out.

[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.680]
Let's stick around for Rick and Suds.

[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.300]
I guess the verdict is with anything song,

[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.620]
it's still basically the same, right?

[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.860]
That's what they're trying to tell you guys.

[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.300]
We got football talk.

[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.860]
She'll talk at 605 tonight with Joe and the poor sonny

[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.260]
who gets rubbed in all of this crap.

[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.020]
Don't blame him.

[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.860]
And Hank has the night off tonight.

[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:50.600]
805.

[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.100]
We got it throughout the room in the car.

[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.060]
If you're lying on the beach, if you're just psychotic,

[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.100]
you're running around with answering your pants.

[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.500]
And you're not near a TV.

[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.560]
We got Game 3 of the World Series.

[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.040]
The Braves beat the twins.

[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.480]
805 tonight from Atlanta, Fulton County Stadium

[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.460]
and Butchup Jane.

[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:06.140]
See ya.

[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.300]
This is South Florida's

[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.200]
news traffic and weather station.

[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.920]
News Drop Radio.

[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.180]
610 WIOG.

[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.840]
Miami Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beach.

[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.240]
And now we're at our WKIV Key West.
