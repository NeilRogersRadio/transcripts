[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.660]
What do you want Elaine?

[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.120]
What do you want?

[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.260]
Can we eat some of that Irish stew?

[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.080]
We need to please have a nice life.

[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.520]
10 away to W.I.O.D. that's for St.

[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.420]
Paddy's Day there.

[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.840]
There's something to get us in the spirit.

[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.580]
What?

[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.060]
Do we have some Irish childless morning or what?

[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.480]
It was great man.

[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.220]
Wow, the fat level in here even without me being in the room was like about 110.

[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.980]
Speaking of fat level, look at this great card.

[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.040]
I got it if you look inside your speaker from Gordon Stevens.

[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.900]
A little late anniversary card.

[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.540]
Thank you, Gordon, you're a hell of a guy.

[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.920]
The pigs are out in full force this morning.

[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.120]
Man are they out.

[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.920]
Unbelievable.

[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.660]
I leave the house.

[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.160]
I'm going down Nob Hill to 595 and they got a cute little gimmick up there this morning.

[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.420]
They've got some old beat up crappy car in the where the break in the median is about

[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.260]
half a mile south of sunrise and behind this old clunker that's sitting like sideways.

[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.780]
We got two cops in like using the car as camouflage and two of South Florida's finest are

[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.460]
behind the car with their radar guns sticking their beam I guess or sticking something up

[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.040]
over that hood at the oncoming traffic.

[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.020]
Then I get to where the turn pike intersects at the golden glades and we've got like a whole

[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.620]
bunch of a man on motorcycles waiting where the traffic merges and a lot of people I don't

[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.460]
want to say I would ever do it but a lot of people occasionally drift over to the right

[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.320]
of where you're supposed to merge to get over to 441 which some of us luckily did not

[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.980]
do this morning but man they're out there in heat.

[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.540]
Luckily George and I had clear sailing coming out here today.

[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.320]
I stop at the light where you turn from 79 from I 95 and 79 to 3 to look at my rear view mirror

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.680]
and there is Ford Grenada the red bomb with George behind me unbelievable.

[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.980]
We had a race he makes Laura look like a piker.

[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.480]
We had a race from that point to this radio station this morning that Maryline Dready

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.600]
would have been embarrassed by me.

[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.360]
We were smoking in and out weaving all over the road.

[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.000]
And every time I thought I had him left in the dust through that crazy traffic on 79th

[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.580]
street I look in a rear view mirror here comes a maniac again.

[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.780]
And finally we get to the last light the last chance before the station here on the

[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.880]
causeway and I look over to the and he's he's in front he's going to be right there

[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.720]
first at the light not behind some erratic woman and a brand new geo.

[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.260]
And finally I look over in the extreme right hand lane and I see it's clear as a bell

[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.440]
and I zip over to that right hand lane and George looked at me with that that look

[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.100]
of well it was a nice try but I know it's over now as I eased away from that light

[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.340]
and left him in the dust boy I was so we were not never going more than 90 though it was

[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.580]
pretty good speaking of races man last night now I know a lot of you think it's boring

[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.140]
but I'm going to tell you something anybody who has ever been to pop it up park before

[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.420]
last night we had the first round in the drivers championships that was one of the great

[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.800]
nights I have ever seen in my life at any track it was tremendous Wally Hennessey and

[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.880]
the Peter Ren and they were just in brolder almost every race was almost like a match race

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.620]
I mean at some point in every race they were like nose to nose head to head down the stretch

[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.400]
up the backside all over the place no not that backside it was tremendous and in the beginning

[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.560]
it looked like Wally was going to make a runaway of it then Peter came back strong and after

[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.560]
four events they were in six races against each other after four events Wally had 113

[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.060]
points Peter had 112 and a half the half because of a dead heat per first that he was in

[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.780]
with the Bruce Ranger in a race before that so it all came down to the last race the 10th

[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.220]
race we all thought Peter had it locked with red October Walter Ross's horse Wally was

[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.520]
with that old arm bro what the hell is that horse arm bro douche bag I got the program

[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:17.100]
here somewhere arm bro come on where the hell is it dummy Caesar of course and the

[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.340]
Peter's got to lead all the way slows it down a little bit the half comes around the final

[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.260]
turn Wally is out there in a year looking like he's got no horse and they come out of the

[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.560]
stretch and here comes the old horse grinding up on the outside they come down the stretch

[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.060]
head and head nose to nose and Wally wins it at the wire and wins the first round I'm serious

[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.480]
it was sensational if you missed out you better make Wednesdays and vote on your calendar

[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.800]
the next six weeks it's going to be tremendous and I do take credit for the idea okay and

[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.640]
spite of what can't Williams or any other douche bag at Poppano Park says I take full credit

[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:59.060]
for the idea right that's right hold on don't you're not going anywhere are you right you're

[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.240]
not going anywhere I'm not going anywhere not slanting ladies on even though there is no

[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.340]
knots landing night yesterday I asked all the ladies who were upset about the basketball

[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.880]
to call I guess that didn't sit a sink in on them yet today no soaps on CBS none NCAA

[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.360]
CBS is carrying air we stink of one of the basketball games your soaps are in the toilet

boy they're just uh... what's going on now it's like the middle of the

[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.940]
month they there must be something we don't know about

[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.600]
uh... we're raising money for a big benefit for themselves or something at

[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.020]
the end of the month because they're just

[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.220]
crazy now

[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.300]
but you have to work crazy you know you have to get the pick on the at uh...

[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.420]
four offices in june in and everybody's up tight as they go pick up

[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.080]
the sec we've all jesus

[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.760]
you know i'm this morning when i passed that thing on obhil for the first

[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.640]
time in a long time it made me furious not that i mean i could see a

[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.720]
coming so i slowed down

[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.900]
but it's just the idea that you know that old adage about the police

[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.880]
minutes your friend

[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.420]
and he's there when you need him and all of the crap

[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:14.060]
and here we got guys hiding behind cars and sticking at radar up their nose

[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.860]
and everything under the sun that's not law enforcement it's just her

[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.480]
harassment is what it is in the public or such about your sheep we just put up

[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.560]
with it we just sit back there should be like a revolution about this crap

[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.440]
i mean if you're going six of miles an hour over the speed limit like

[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.080]
everybody else is what the hell differences are making especially out in the

[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.800]
middle of nowhere

[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.200]
people are going seventy seventy five on the turnpike coming to work every

[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.080]

[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.780]

15 thousand claiming handicapped which is why you got the outside again because this is in for

[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.860]
15 but no problem or raise them from behind there's a lot of speed in their probation

[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:53.460]
with Kelly Shepherd. Kelly told me last night he's going to go the first half and 52 in change.

[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.300]
And we got the wall off with Kevin in there. Boy, he's going to be out and fly best bunny with

[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.800]
Wally. Man, what a first half we're going to have again. And here comes Joe on the outside as they

[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.020]
go off the backstreet circling the field and just winning for a joke again. I think he's going

[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:11.920]
to be real good this week. Trust me. And again, I want to say one more time if you missed the first

[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:16.820]
route of the drivers championships last night. It was, I'm telling you, I'm still got goosebumps.

[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:22.120]
Wally, Hennessy and Peter Renner. I've been going 31 years to the harness racing and seldom have

[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:26.340]
I seen a night when I saw such an exciting thing going on. The fact that I had some input in

[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:31.500]
that makes me feel good. In fact, I want to take all the credit for it. How do you like that? Can't

[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:36.340]
they have the horseman's meeting? He said, well, this is not the eruders idea. This is our idea. Right.

[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:43.100]
Sure. Uh-huh. It's my idea. Who cares whose idea it is? It was a great idea. And it just was fabulous.

[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:48.360]
Went right down to the very last to the last few yards of the sixth race between Wally and Peter.

[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:53.520]
As they struggled it out, Wally beat him in the stretch and won the thing. And Peter better luck

[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:59.520]
next year. Boy, it was great. Next Wednesday we got, um, total you have Pavia and, uh, Tommy Outen.

[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:05.460]
And then the week after that we got Kevin Wallace, Mr. God against Ron Wapels, little Canadian

[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:10.540]
battle area. And then the week after that it's Bruce Ranger. He's the danger against John Hogan.

[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:14.500]
And then they do the semi finals the following two weeks after that. And then the 23rd of April

[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:20.600]
last Wednesday of the meeting, the big thing, the last one of championships. I mean, it makes for

[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:25.120]
great racing and they're out there just puking their brains out and they're like some perfect as you

[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:30.840]
can't miss like that. 9th rate. That was at the 9th 10th race. The 2 3 Peter and Wally coming

[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:36.620]
down to stretch. It paid like 10 60, which wasn't that bad. A mortal lock perfected. Of course,

[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.260]
somebody I know knocked it way down Miami Beach. Hello. How you doing? Okay. Hey, you know that

[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:46.260]
game. I got tickets to that Saturday game, uh, the 30th. Yeah. That's the first night of past

[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:50.260]
over to. So are they going to be substituting the monster for the crack? Yes, sir. Huh?

[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:54.960]
Hey, you know, the other day also you asked if you there's any live people in surfside left to call

[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:59.240]
you. And while I'm calling you, I'm one of the live ones. All right. I don't know who that

[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:05.380]
English guy is that keeps calling me some peanuts and mots of balls. That's good to know. We'll bring

[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:09.160]
those to the games doing throw them back like they're doing. There you go. Right through the

[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.760]
mots of balls. I was going to throw out the first mots of ball. That's a question. Probably Joshua

[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:17.220]
or the lifeguard probably sunny. Hersh. There you go. Have a good one. And the same to you, sir.

[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:21.620]
143 at W. I. I. W. Do you know the shame we cut him short before we could tell us about the

[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:27.200]
lifeguards in Eli Turgman. We have an open line in Dave County 7519463. That guy bores me to death.

[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:32.340]
Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Yes, sir. Dale. Yeah. Hey, how'd you get talking about

[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.440]
carols the other day? I want to know how did I get talking about it? Yeah. What does that mean?

[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:41.200]
Well, I want to know if you remember the golden point over a good man street in Ridge Road East.

[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:46.120]
No, sir. You don't remember that? That wasn't even before carols. Now, how old are you think I am?

[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:52.480]
Me. I'm 39. Well, I'm 48, sir. I'm not some old fart from the dark age. I don't remember that.

[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:57.100]
Well, you probably remember when the hamburgers were five cents. No, I remember when they used to

[00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:01.340]
pay you a dime to take him. Okay. Hey, listen, will you do me a favor? How about those French fries

[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:05.260]
and carols? Men, they had enough salt on them. You can make a salt lick out of them. I said,

[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:10.380]
lick this. I used to get mine at carols right by the ballpark for KPA. Remember, I'm

[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:15.780]
Ridge Road West. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm proud from. Okay. But I got to request. And so we're going to

[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:21.140]
add a convenience for now. I want you to play the convenience for manager and I want you to

[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:27.260]
play Glen Hill Academy. Can you do all that for me? No. 144 at WIOD. We have an open line in

[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:30.660]
Brown. I mean, anybody that talk, he can't be from Roxy. Do you hear how boring he was?

[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.720]
He had that like, like his voice was on a tape. I think you're already the convenience store manager.

[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:38.980]
So you're like on a tape. We'll do it some other day. Okay, pal. Don't get you wrong thing out of

[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:43.840]
shape. Don't get your taco bell wrong out of shape. I started to say we have an open line of

[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.980]
brown. But what the hell difference is I make. We'll never get to him anyway. But it looks good.

[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:49.820]
Because there's a lot of important looking people wandering around the building today. We want to

[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:58.960]
press him. Like boy Gary. 524 WIOD in Broward. I might even pick it up live. You never know. You never

[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.780]
know. Do you? Don't forget breakfast with Reneerie at Gulf Stream tomorrow morning. The broadcast

[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:09.060]
from the clubhouse live. It says his live is the mic ever gets. Of course. And then it's just a joke.

[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:14.700]
Don't start getting hysterical and calling him up. But that office challenge. Wow. And anyway,

[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:19.360]
we do want to tell you speak in a live. Oh, WIOD. Hello. Yes, sir.

[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:29.220]
Panic. Could you hear the paranoia? Woo. I love it.

[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:39.540]
Here's another one. WIOD. Who's this? It's Kirby on mobile and QR.

[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:46.960]
Kirby Puckett. Kirby Power. How you doing, Kirby? Is this like from the Kirby vacuum cleaner?

[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:51.080]
I don't know if I was right. I hear that suction in the background. Of course, it's in the key.

[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:54.920]
So I guess that speaks for itself. You're on the air, Kirby. Is this steel? Yes.

[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.920]
Okay. Listen, I'm sitting out here on my boat. That's the boat noise here in the back.

[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.940]
Oh, that's what that is. I thought it was your Kirby vacuum in about eighth year.

[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.600]
I was reading the newspaper. Do you, uh, the movie, fear of 76?

[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.480]
Hear anything about it? No. Guess who's costume designer?

[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:20.340]
Who's the costume designer? Yeah, it's a pia copula. Oh, wow. I bet you all the people

[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:27.720]
in it look like serenote a berserat. Could be. Who might be? Hey, let's not all boat people

[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:31.820]
are bad, you know. Oh, what? Not all boat people are at. I never said that. And you're down

[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.980]
there, minding your own business. You're not up here messing up the traffic and screw it up

[00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:38.980]
the bridges on the causeway. No, that's why I'm down here. That's a way to do it. All right.

[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:42.960]
Well, listen, the pal have a great day and give Sophie a big kiss all over the Shnaz. Okay.

[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.920]
So I take about a half hour. All right. See you later. 147. I'm sure glad I picked those up live.

[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:51.980]
We want to tell you about little Maria's been. Everybody loves Maria, right? Boy, she is pretty and

[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:56.500]
perky and she's a little bit country and Don is a little bit old. But anyway, she's going to be

[00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:01.840]
doing two live shows on Saturday and Sunday this weekend at the Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop,

[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:06.460]
the home of lots of bargains and fun and a circus and just all kinds of great stuff. The second

[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:11.320]
bit most popular tourist attraction in the state of Florida with more than 8 million visitors a

[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.960]
year. That's a ton, okay. And one of the reasons is because they've got some big names that come

[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:20.200]
in on a weekend. You see a free show cost you absolutely nothing. You can park free, nothing to

[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.740]
get into the joint. You pick up a bunch of bargains. You sit down, you watch Marie Doer thing

[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:29.940]
and her show too of Sunday one and Saturday, one and six PM and Sunday, two and five PM.

[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:35.500]
Boy, it's incredible. Then we got Mel Tullus coming soon and Conway, Twitty and George Jones,

[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:39.700]
a whole bunch of old boys. Okay, it's going to be great. So check out Marie this weekend at the

[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:45.400]
Fort Lauderdale Swap Shop on Sunrise between I-95 and the Turnpike. Hey, Tony about those dark

[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:52.280]
shades too. That Tony Curtis, boy, so you doing it or what? He's hot, hot, hot, hot. Man. Anyway,

[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:59.140]
Florida Derby Day coming up on Saturday. Well, nothing is perfect. I'm falling and I can't get it up.

[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:07.220]
151 at WIOD. Here's the caller from Boca. Hello. From Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, a long time listener,

[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:12.360]
a long time caller, whatever. Okay. And I just want to tell you about the people who are

[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.820]
going up and putting down the police and who tell you what that stuff is. Yes, sir. Well, you know,

[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:21.240]
they're out there saving our lives. Oh, are they? Yeah, those two pigs behind that hide behind the

[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:28.020]
car this morning. They were sure they were sure saving my life. I'll tell you that. I'll never miss this show again.

[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:36.240]
You jerk jerk. Okay. 151 at WIOD. Let's go to Kendall. Hello. Hello, Kendall. Yes, sir.

[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:40.760]
Oh, that one was hot, wasn't it? It was great. It was almost as hot as Tony Curtis. Almost.

[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.960]
Why wouldn't know? He's hot, hot, hot. I wouldn't know. I wouldn't know. You know, I waited all this time

[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:50.120]
and when I see those spots on TV, it gets me so excited. I want to jump on my horse and ride

[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:57.080]
right out of town as a matter of fact. Again, I wouldn't know. I wouldn't know. Okay. Markets of 24. It's

[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:02.280]
like a yo-yo. It was up about 36. It went down to about 11. Now it's back up to 24. They can't make up

[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:07.020]
their mind today. Nobody knows. Right. Nobody knows. Nobody knows the trouble we've seen. That's right.

[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.540]
So I wanted to audition now, but you know, so that seems to be the new fact. Addition for what?

[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:16.500]
Addition for, I don't know. We believe this is the wrong show for that. I would call up Dave Gray line at home.

[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:21.480]
Oh, is that I need to call Dave? Yeah. What's Dave up to? What do you mean? What's he up to? I don't know.

[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:29.600]
Do you know him? Uh, remotely. Why? Who's this? Who's this? This was Glenn? Glenn? Hutton.

[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:36.980]
Oh, not that Glenn. No, no, no, no. This is Glenn. I'm not yelling. Glenn Hutton. I can't believe it. Yeah, well,

[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:40.840]
wow. How are you doing? Boy, this is a voice from the past ladies and gentlemen,

[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:45.520]
a man who was widely chased to W.S. News by a whole bunch of perverts. Yeah, I heard rumor about all that.

[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.100]
Oh, yeah. There were some people who were just just hot for your body.

[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.420]
I heard rumor. That's the way one of them is working on a small station in Fort Lauderdale now.

[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.380]
Does that one have them? But anyway, what are you doing these days, Glenn?

[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.180]
I thought you had a girlfriend break your sunglasses on the air. What are you doing these days?

[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.960]
He's got it. I forgot all about it. Hey, I got a great memory.

[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:10.040]
That's worth a million. That one. Yeah. I don't know where she is. I have no idea where she is.

[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.060]
Well, that's good. You're lucky. You know, what do you sound so happy?

[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.480]
I know. Let me say it again. What are you doing these days, Glenn?

[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.840]
What am I doing these days? Let's see. Why do you repeat everything I ask?

[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.800]
Glenn is working at the pirate jungle. Is this the micro-nairy show?

[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.400]
No. No, we're selling voicemail. Do you want voicemail up in Canada and around it?

[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.740]
Oh, and voicemail, eh?

[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.500]
Voicemail. Eh? You know, we have a big project up in Canada, eh?

[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.600]
Well, what is it?

[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:39.060]
A voicemail. You know, automated attendant voicemail, you press buttons and your call gets routed

[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:44.120]
through various locations. Oh, like that crappy thing they put in here. Did you guys put that in here?

[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.140]
Oh, did they put one in there?

[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.920]
Oh, man. Up in the front office.

[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:47.240]
Oh.

[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.260]
This rotunda up there is having a nervous breakdown over that baby.

[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:53.740]
Yeah, that's why it's probably, it's because it wasn't an access voice systems product.

[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:54.480]
That's why you see.

[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.580]
Okay, whatever you say. A little plug there, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.100]
With that plug?

[01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:58.520]
Yeah.

[01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.500]
My God, I didn't realize.

[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.700]
I didn't realize. I didn't realize.

[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:02.180]
Yeah.

[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.280]
So, well, I, you know, I was sitting on hold to think about it.

[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.420]
Since it's toward the end of the show, we might call it a butt plug, but that would be wrong.

[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:09.580]
Now, what is it called?

[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.260]
Oh, ah, gee.

[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.660]
That was definitely the wrong end.

[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:17.000]
What I wanted to know, it's a scoop on the catalytic converters now.

[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:22.220]
So, if we go in and you plug in your car, and it's bad, what happens?

[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.880]
They gas you right there in the spot.

[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.900]
But you have to get a new catalytic converter.

[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:29.460]
I mean, what are they trying to do?

[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.200]
I don't have any idea. I don't know.

[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.680]
We don't want to give all the information out of one day and get everybody scared to daylight.

[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.620]
Just let's break into them one piece at a time.

[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.080]
My question is, who's really going to make the money behind this?

[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:40.500]
That's what I want to know.

[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.280]
That's another great ripoff. You know that.

[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.320]
That's what I want to know.

[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.700]
Well, of course. Why don't you get in on it? You're good at that stuff.

[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.320]
Actually, we're good at that.

[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.120]
Call up Dave Ryder. You can go to business together.

[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:48.520]
Uh-uh.

[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:49.660]
Dave Ryder.

[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.300]
Dave Ryder.

[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:50.800]
I was a big...

[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.100]
He's a big...

[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.380]
I was talking to Dave Ryder and you...

[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.280]
You can have your converter just stick it in the phone.

[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.020]
They can do it over the phone by voicemail.

[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.440]
He's big, though. He's big, though.

[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.920]
Well, maybe you've seen, but I've heard.

[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.980]
Well, it's very great hearing from you.

[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:05.220]
Glenn gets a new material, and I'm glad you're still bouncing around out there.

[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.080]
I'm working on it.

[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:06.400]
Thanks, Dan.

[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:06.800]
Excellent.

[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:07.960]
All righty. Have a great life.

[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:08.200]

[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.980]
Glenn Hutton. I can't believe it.

[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.320]
Ladies and gentlemen, wow.

[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.320]
Let's go to Miami. Hello.

[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.620]
Yes. Neil.

[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:16.080]
How you doing?

[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:16.500]
I'm fine.

[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.820]
I'm doing okay. How you doing?

[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:18.560]
Pretty good.

[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:19.180]
Okay.

[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.580]
I'll call about the emissions test.

[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.600]
There's, uh...

[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.800]
I'm an audit, just, uh,

[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.000]
I've been keeping up with all the, uh,

[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.080]
stuff that's going on with the emissions test.

[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.880]
A lot of misinformation going on out there.

[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.280]
Okay. While you're the guy who sounds like you're going to straighten us out.

[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.260]
Some guy called earlier saying it's on your birthday.

[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.280]
It's not on your birthday.

[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.040]
It's going to be in conjunction with the registration renewal.

[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.660]
And you're going to have 90 days prior to your birthday.

[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.100]
You get the test. You're going to have three months.

[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:40.700]
Right.

[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:41.760]
You go ahead and get the test.

[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.280]
Oh, well, that's a lot better.

[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:43.960]
And another guy,

[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.380]
I call talking about our inspector is his friends are going through the rain or whatever.

[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:48.740]
Right.

[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.760]
That doesn't make any sense because the computer makes the decision not to land inspector.

[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.600]
And, um, about the volunteer testing going on right now,

[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.960]
it's a free volunteer inspection just for public information.

[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.120]
For those people who want to go ahead and get their test done

[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.940]
and find out how the car is running.

[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:09.300]
The actual mandatory inspection starts April 1st in day to county.

[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:09.840]
Yeah.

[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.040]
Which, by the way, what do you mean in date county?

[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:12.840]
What about in Broward?

[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.960]
Well, Broward's a month late from from what I know.

[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.680]
I've been looking at the news reports.

[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.620]
That's not a car for the course for us.

[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.240]
Their contractor is a month late, but date is starting on time.

[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.000]
The system here in date county is totally different than before.

[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:26.980]
It's not safety inspection.

[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.520]
It's an emissions inspection only.

[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:30.860]
There's going to be an optional land for safety,

[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.140]
but that's completely optional.

[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.040]
It doesn't affect the, if you pass a fail to test.

[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.500]
The test here in date county is state of the art.

[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:44.120]
It's a high-tech program, the most modern advanced program in the country right now in the US.

[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:48.140]
And it's going to be seven stations in date county, spread out throughout the county.

[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.680]
And the test itself takes about two to three minutes.

[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.480]
The safety test can take up to six to nine minutes, but that's like I said, optional.

[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.760]
All right, so now, like Glen said, what happens if you fail?

[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:06.260]
Well, if you fail, they'll give you a computer print out of what's wrong with your car.

[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.220]
They'll give you an idea of what repairs you might need to do.

[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.320]
You can get your repair done so you can stop polluting the air.

[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.340]
And then you go ahead and get a reinspection, which is totally free.

[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.280]
It doesn't cost your thing.

[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:21.000]
All right, so in other words, they give you a amount of time to come back.

[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.300]
You have to give it 30 days to get back and do the inspection again.

[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.640]
And then when it fails again, they send you the L.A. to get the beat up right?

[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.860]
No, no, that gets more involved.

[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:37.160]
But failing from what I've read, about 15% of the cars that have gone through the pre-inspection

[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:41.380]
that failed. So basically the majority, the vast majority of cars are passing the test with.

[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:42.960]
All right, let me ask you this question.

[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.020]
What about buses?

[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:48.380]
The buses going to have to go through this, the ones that are puking that diesel out of the air,

[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:50.720]
just polluting our lungs and making this gag and choke?

[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.020]
Yeah, well, buses, there's been a lot, I believe, in effect, for over a year or two buses,

[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:03.240]
any vehicle we're carrying that emits these dark pollution gases for more than five consecutive

[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:07.740]
seconds can get cited. And buses are handled through a totally different program.

[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.140]
And they're supposed to be tuned up and regular oil changes and all that.

[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:11.760]
Oh, yeah.

[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:13.140]
That's a different story.

[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:13.620]
Yeah.

[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:17.660]
But just a lot of misinformation, people haven't been getting the right answer.

[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:23.120]
And they're well complaining about one line and so on and so forth, which isn't true from what I know.

[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:23.740]
Okay.

[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.140]
All right, so just want to plug in a little positive.

[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:31.140]
Because I'm very strongly in favor of cleaning up the environment and I'm sticking

[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:34.420]
tires. You know, all these people tearing off their pollution devices and, you know,

[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.360]
polluting my air.

[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.180]
Exactly, just to pouring it out there.

[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:40.220]
But when you get one behind one of those people, maybe just gag.

[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.140]
Yeah, it's all up.

[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.620]
You know, I don't want to get like R.A.

[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.960]
And have to have a smart alert.

[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:45.580]
Exactly.

[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.980]
No wonder they beat the crap out of each other out there, man.

[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.400]
They're also full of toxic fumes.

[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.340]
They don't know what they're doing.

[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:50.680]
Yeah.

[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:51.960]
Okay, thanks.

[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.920]
Thanks for the load.

[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:53.680]
I did a great job.

[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.300]
All right.

[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:54.880]
See you.

[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:59.760]
Okay, well, you asked during the IAS, I guess, when we got the real, the straight poop on this show,

[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.560]
we really got it.

[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:01.380]
Didn't we, sir?

[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.680]
Anyotic, just any.

[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:03.820]
Just any.

[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:04.220]

[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:04.940]
Just any.

[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.060]
Just any.

[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:07.260]
Okay.

[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.620]
Now tomorrow he's going to tell us what he really feels about everything.

[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:10.680]
Okay, I love that guy.

[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.180]
If we can get him, Tony, get him and John from Chicago together.

[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.520]
We could have a great show on a weekend to replace him at Green.

[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.900]
Oh, hey, by the way, happy anniversary, Meg.

[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:22.300]
She's going to be out there and doing those yellow shots with Marvin next week or something.

[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:26.020]
Wouldn't that be a shame if they both got like congealed inside of that big,

[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.460]
lava, jello, never seen again?

[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.120]
What a shame that would be, huh?

[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:29.800]
Yeah.

[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:33.200]
We can send Sandy out there to lick her way through and save Marvin.

[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.040]
Anyway, she'll get in her lick sooner or later.

[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:36.740]
I can just see that.

[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:37.660]
Can't you see that now?

[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:41.380]
Just chewing her way through a big, gigantic, lava, jello.

[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.800]
Marvin, please come out wherever you are.

[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.700]
Oh, sweetheart.

[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.900]
Get a big chunk of pineapple.

[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:48.640]
Just stuck right in your esophagus.

[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.480]
Anyway, have a wonderful day.

[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.660]
Stay tuned for Rick and Spud with Phyllis Diller.

[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:55.040]
She's going to be the big nose on the phone today.

[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.680]
Sonny Hirsch on Sports Talk at 605.

[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.680]
And then tonight, the one, the only.

[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.380]
I'm sure he's just a foaming at the month,

[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.660]
getting ready for Saturday in the Florida Derby.

[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:07.280]
Hank Goldberg would lease a patrillo on the Academy Awards.

[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.240]
It ought to be a real swill show.
