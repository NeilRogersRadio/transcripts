[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820]
bottom of the house.

[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.580]
Okay, we have a celebrity caller online.

[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.100]
That was well on glad you thought so.

[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.340]
So this the douche bag.

[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.220]
1007 at WIOD.

[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.560]
It's Friday, finally, the longest week in the history of the human race.

[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.920]
Man, usually the week just flies by here.

[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.700]
But this week it's been real long.

[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.140]
And if you stick around, we'll tell you how long.

[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.560]
Anyway, tonight's the big speaking of that WIOD Hooter Softball game.

[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.980]
The Hooters girls are going to be there.

[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.120]
Stark naked naked.

[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.140]
Just hang it out at the ballpark.

[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.100]
And I heard the suds yesterday and wonderful guys.

[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.140]
But they're so full of crap.

[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.400]
He said in Pompadot Park.

[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.800]
It's not at Pompadot Park.

[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.880]
That's a race track suds Pompadot municipal stadium.

[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.680]
So when he don't show up tonight, the excuse will be he went over to Pompadot Park

[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.600]
and hung out over there.

[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.780]
But it's at Pompadot municipal stadium 730 tonight.

[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.260]
And the goofballs from IOD and I hope they get some folks to show up there from the station.

[00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.320]
Because I know I won't.

[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.700]
But Sam will have the T-shirts for sale.

[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.640]
You going to be there Alex?

[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.100]
Alex is going to be there Adam.

[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.600]
We know him.

[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.900]
We'll be there.

[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.700]
And tomorrow I'll be a champion Marine from Noon to Three.

[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.760]
Up and that's a good location too.

[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.660]
There's no excuses.

[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.180]
It's 190th in Viscans.

[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.640]
You can come from Dayton, Brown and Pomp beach and all over the place.

[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.380]
And we'll have lots of stuff to give away.

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.420]
And we'll be selling the T-shirts.

[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.220]
We got 12,278.

[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.960]
Not shabby.

[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.680]
Not too bad for our Vietnam vets in the event.

[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.700]
In the meantime, what are all these calls on the board already?

[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.140]
I don't want to start on Rick Sanchez today.

[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.160]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.560]
But, but I tune in yesterday as I was on my way to McDonald's or somewhere.

[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.320]
And I didn't hear Rick Riley whimpering out again.

[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.680]
Did I?

[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.620]
And defending Rick Sanchez.

[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.560]
And you got to wait until he has a try.

[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.280]
You got to buy.

[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.080]
You don't know if you were in that situation where you were at all.

[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.500]
Man.

[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.880]
The Sanchez, like, come over here with money or something?

[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.520]
And speaking of that, what happened to those, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.880]
What happened to those Rick Sanchez droppings?

[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.100]
Oh, no.

[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.180]
You got to be kidding me.

[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.280]
What happened to those carts?

[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.700]
You know, every day I sit down here within a couple of minutes, I discover that there's

[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.340]
a whole bunch of crap that's disappeared.

[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.580]
We had, like, about a half a dozen Rick Sanchez droppings here, which would have been

[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.280]
perfect today.

[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.020]
They're all gone.

[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.160]
Oh, boy.

[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.220]
Oh, boy.

[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.400]

[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.900]
Are they certainly out in here with this stuff?

[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.260]
Are they?

[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.800]
With Rick and Spud's crap.

[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.380]
Oh, look at this.

[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.940]
They got this thing so jammed up.

[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.100]
You couldn't find anything in here if you're alive dependent on it.

[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.940]
I sure hope they're not in here.

[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.900]
I'm sure they're not, because they wouldn't do that, would they?

[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.620]
They just jammed, like, dozens and dozens and dozens of carts in the middle of their cart

[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.860]
rack.

[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.980]
Well, I'll do that during the break.

[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.320]
Okay.

[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.360]
Ten minutes after ten, let's take our first call from Haya Leah.

[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.360]
Deal.

[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.780]
Yeah.

[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.000]
Let's start off on Hank.

[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.280]
I beg your pardon?

[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.240]
Let's start off.

[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.360]
Bashi Hank.

[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.920]
Okay, who are going to bash today?

[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.860]
Hank Goldberg, first ladies and gentlemen.

[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.500]
Okay.

[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.080]
And?

[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.600]
That's nice.

[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.240]
I happen to have the rate of two and a half to two, and then you want to turn on the

[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.480]
radio.

[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.720]
Radio accident, yes?

[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.260]
Okay.

[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.740]
And he's talking about not having air conditioning at his house.

[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.060]
It's time to make everybody feel sorry for him.

[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.540]
And then he says, maybe I'll go spend the night at the stars nightclub and pick up some

[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.780]
money.

[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.260]
Maybe I'll spend the night somewhere else.

[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.700]
All right.

[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.560]
Then maybe I'll spend the night somewhere else.

[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.020]
Some guy called the little bit later and told me.

[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.080]
Yeah.

[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.280]
And then somebody else called a little while later and said enough for the sucking over

[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.600]
the air.

[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.540]
And he goes, I hope the daytime mentality is spreading to the night time shows.

[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.860]
I don't know.

[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.100]
We've been between the lines.

[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.020]
Oh boy.

[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.360]
Sounds like he's drawn a little line in the sand to me.

[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.300]
So I have to say.

[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.800]
Okay.

[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.400]
Thanks for the report, sir.

[00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.620]
You're a great American.

[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.480]
Where the hell you're from.

[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.820]
It's 11 after 10 at WIO.

[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.020]
We've got a couple of deadlines.

[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.240]
It's still aren't doing it yet.

[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.220]
751.

[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.520]
Right now I want to tell you that one of our favorite restaurants, Charcoal's, is having

[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.780]
another special this weekend.

[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.260]
A whole lobster with sliced flank steak special this weekend.

[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.700]
Not easy to say, but easy to eat.

[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.560]
It's going to be delicious.

[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.080]
Come into any one of the four Charcoal's locations.

[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.520]
Get a whole lobster with sliced flank steak plus rice pilaf homemade soups and rolls

[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.780]
and a trip to their humongous salad bar.

[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.920]
Get all this for the amazingly low price of only 1495.

[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.500]
It's a good way to introduce yourself and a whole bunch of folks just bring this grab

[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.300]
a whole bunch of people and throw them in the back of the truck and take them over there

[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.380]
to Charcoal's and get familiar with a super restaurant delicious food humongous portions.

[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.380]
So let's check it out again.

[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.260]
This week's special for 1495.

[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.980]
You get a whole lobster, sliced flank steak, rice pilaf homemade soups, rolls and a big

[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.540]
salad bar.

[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.300]
Only 1495.

[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.960]
It's a deal you can't beat with a stick.

[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.820]
For locations for Charcoal's, they're in Kendall, it's a ton of country center just east

[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.220]
of the Turnpike in Kendall, dry.

[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.840]
In the Miami Lake area, just west of the Palmetto at Northwest 154th Street, that's

[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.880]
Miami Lake's Drive exit.

[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.220]
The Corsair Springs on Sanford Road at 441.

[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.000]
And in Lauderdale on North University Drive and Commercial Boulevard, check out their

[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.220]
gigantic steaks and delicious prime rib to this weekend at Charcoal.

[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.700]
For me, honey, the off-colorized version of Gone with the Wind on TNT.

[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.280]
I would do this in the air.

[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.940]
I must have loved it in the air, though.

[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.200]
I just did it slow, I didn't know it.

[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.660]
Please, please, you first care.

[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.360]
Listen, honey, I've had enough of this.

[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.120]
That's please.

[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.060]
I'm out of here.

[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.800]
I never really loved this.

[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.020]
You lie and bitch, I guess when you had yettangin' his mouth you are cleaning his

[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.940]
tape out into dice clang.

[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.820]
And divinely in the off-colorized version of Gone with the Wind.

[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.400]
Oh, honey, if you go, I said I go, I said I do.

[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.960]
Why don't you bake a mohawk out?

[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.060]
Cause frankly, yo bitch, I don't tip off.

[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.140]
And coming on TNT next week, the off-colorization of Leva Tobiever.

[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.860]
Beaver, I have never been more disappointed in you than I was today when you walked

[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.460]
in the principal's office wearing that horrible sweatshirt.

[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.620]
Well, dad, I was a little more disappointed when I found out you named me after the first

[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.780]
thing you saw when I was born.

[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.560]
Catch all the action this week on TNT.

[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.440]
Wow.

[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.220]
1016 at WIOD, we have a little mystery here.

[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.160]
All the rick sent you as carts have disappeared.

[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.240]
All those little droffins we had yesterday.

[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.960]
So kind of put two and two together and you get 75.

[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.260]
Rick Riley sitting here sucking around yesterday covering up the tracks.

[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.000]
Here's this, he did not take the new times though that's still sitting around here with

[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.620]
the latest article about this poor guy in a picture of this guy that was just flattened

[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.480]
flattened by your Channel 7 news anchor.

[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.440]
It says those Sanchez says he tried to aid smoothing it at the scene of the accident and flagged

[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.100]
on motorists.

[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.620]
I witnessed his plan the anchorman ignored the injured man and loudly told police and

[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.640]
bystanders that blood tests were pointless and would hurt his public image.

[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.560]
Yeah.

[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.020]
So we don't care that we hurt this guy and he's still in a coma and just to make it a little

[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.960]
bit can barely move his left arm and leg and maybe once in a while hold his head upright.

[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.400]
But we don't want to hurt Rick's public image.

[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.900]
Coconut grove.

[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.300]
Good morning, and how are you doing?

[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.760]
Pretty good.

[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.860]
You know, I got a little story to tell you.

[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.280]
Okay.

[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.780]
It happened this week.

[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.520]
In the beginning.

[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.980]
Okay, I was driving on 9.95.

[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.560]
Yeah.

[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.260]
And you know, listening to me your show.

[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.780]
Yeah.

[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.740]
And I got a little traffic jam so I was just sitting there and then I started picking.

[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.340]
Come on, you can do it, picking your nose.

[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.240]
And then you've got to say it, I can't say it for it.

[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.120]
Pick your nose.

[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.780]
Yeah, instead of picking my nose and it pulled out a burger.

[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.160]
It is so hard.

[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.560]
Yeah.

[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.720]
And the burger had little nose hairs on it.

[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.920]
What do you think about that, Neil?

[00:07:59.460 --> 00:07:59.860]
How many?

[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:00.980]
About two.

[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.760]
Oh, that's not much.

[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.320]
Two.

[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.180]
You get more than two, you get busted for it.

[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.840]
Two nose hairs on the burger.

[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.440]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.600]
I kept the burger.

[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.580]
And eight.

[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.240]
Eight the hairs.

[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:10.660]
Okay.

[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.580]
1018 at WIOD.

[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.680]
That's a good story to get you ready for an exciting weekend here in South Florida.

[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.400]
We have an open line in day 751 WIOD for Lauderdale.

[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.880]
I'm going to get over here.

[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.380]
Okay, sounds like it.

[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.220]
Pembroke Pines.

[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.500]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.160]
I'm doing it.

[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.240]
Uh, it's a little story for you myself, not across that lab.

[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.540]
By the way, we're going to, uh, we're going to electrocute Danny Jackson on the show today.

[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.360]
It's going to be very exciting, about 1230.

[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.880]
Uh, I've never been here for the sports department, Joseph Aggie.

[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.240]
Yeah.

[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.420]
I had an unfortunate experience.

[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.460]
We don't want that daytime mentality sneaking into the nighttime there in the Hank Goldberg.

[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.560]
You want all those old pretensions out?

[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.700]
Allowing Hank.

[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.880]
How you doing?

[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.960]
Oh, it's so wonderful to hear it in a flexible show.

[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.540]
What is it now?

[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.800]
I was just sorry.

[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.460]
I went to high school with Joseph Aggie.

[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.940]
Well, you sound pretty depressed about it.

[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.640]
Oh, man.

[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.660]
You ain't kidding.

[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.560]
What was your first food that he was a dip?

[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.560]
What was the last?

[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.620]
What was the first food that he was a real dip?

[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.660]
Uh, I don't know.

[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.360]
Just the way you look.

[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.780]
Man, and the way you talk.

[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:12.720]
WIOD.

[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.440]
Yeah, that's more real.

[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.300]
Depressing.

[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.320]
He's gone through high school, wasn't that easy, either, with him?

[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:18.580]
Yeah.

[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.780]
But, uh, seems like he's kind of made it, I guess.

[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.440]
He's a big star now in the front.

[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:23.860]

[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.220]
He brownoses all the right people in this place.

[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.380]
He is a superstar.

[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.760]
Hey, you learned how to do this.

[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.540]
Elvis with Mr. Z.

[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.780]
I'm telling you.

[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.180]
Oh, man, I guess if that was the way it would have takes to make it in this world, you should have.

[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.340]
How do you think he's on the air?

[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.080]
Boy, he's sucked around with all the right people here for a long time.

[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:39.740]
Yeah.

[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.220]
Now he's the director of sports and entertainment and research.

[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.120]
Hey, that's a title, anyway.

[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.420]
Everybody here's got a title.

[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.220]
That's the best part.

[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.560]
The talent don't have any title.

[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.940]
We're the only ones that have no titles.

[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.220]
But everybody else is the director of this, the producer of that.

[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.160]
They don't have a title.

[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.980]
And they all get paid like a buck and a half an hour so we can live without the title.

[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.580]
We don't give it to them.

[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.180]
If you make cash, you need the title, right?

[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.120]
That's right. Screw it.

[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:05.720]
Screw the title.

[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.120]
Because most of the people who got titles that make up for their metal insufficiency.

[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:09.700]
Exactly.

[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.020]
Like in programming, for example.

[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.300]
I wanted to say I wish everybody that they're happy to do something.

[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.380]
Okay.

[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.520]
Well, you sound pretty happy even though you knew Joe.

[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.900]
Maybe you're happy you got away from him.

[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.480]
Have a great day.

[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.820]
20 after 10.

[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.160]
Boy, these people are ready today.

[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.920]
I'll tell you that.

[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:26.780]
I'm not sure for what.

[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.420]
One open line. It's in Broward County.

[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.160]
5249463524 WIOD.

[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.840]
I'm sure interested in finding out what happened to those four or five carts that were very conspicuous

[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.360]
because they had like yellowish labels on them.

[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.140]
I mean, you couldn't listen.

[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.200]
Even Ray Charles could have found them easy.

[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.540]
And they just conveniently disappeared.

[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.000]
On the same day that I noticed we were showing for our good fat buddy next door, the squatter.

[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.780]
I don't understand.

[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.000]
They're not here. They're just gone.

[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.000]
And I checked out what a mess in there.

[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.020]
Okay. Now, when they first came here, they had a big box for consuts.

[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:06.080]
And they used to have here schlep the carts around in the box, which would be preferable to just jam them all in it.

[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.080]
And the middle thing, I found one car where the tape is like all looped out and just rolling around.

[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.380]
But I did not find the rick's inch his cart.

[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.920]
So the mystery continues and the search will go on.

[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.640]
The mystery continues and the search will go on.

[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.040]
The mystery continues and the search will go on.

[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.080]
The mystery continues and the search will go on.

[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.080]

[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.180]
The mystery continues and the search will go on.

[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.460]
The mystery continues and the search will go on.

[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.560]
The mystery continues and the search will go on.

[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:35.820]
The mystery continues and the search will go on.

[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.060]
The mystery continues and the search will go on.

[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:36.460]
The mystery continues and the search will go on.

[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:36.520]
The mystery is often feeling the insectsуп.

[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:36.520]

[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:36.960]
The mystery is often feeling the insectsуп.

[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:36.960]

[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:44.680]
And the neighbor heard it before Darmin Carcline calling him a clairvoyant brother.

[00:11:48.900 --> 00:12:06.040]
It surprised quarters gossip.

[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.160]
All right, come quiet.

[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.740]
All over the sea.

[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.280]
Which are here so we can see him.

[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.660]
In the morning, all over the sea.

[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.920]
La la la la la la.

[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.400]
And pick him in love.

[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.360]
If he we heard in service, recorded live at Peewee's

[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.480]
all night playhouse.

[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.800]
Oh, he hasn't ate by him.

[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.200]
Look, no, I'm a hermit.

[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.180]
Now they'll hold hot wax, records and taste.

[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.580]
Thank God for Peewee, man, who had been the most boring two

[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.760]
weeks in the history of mankind.

[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.680]
1025 at WI would do.

[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.880]
Still haven't found those carts.

[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.720]
We have another massive rickstance has cover up, taking place

[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.960]
and they were part of it.

[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:42.900]
Do you believe this?

[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.600]
I mean, what did he say in those carts?

[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.040]
Either somebody has a yank goes out of here.

[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.020]
Or somebody has lost them.

[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.960]
Oh, could you be?

[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.980]
Hey, Neon, I know you like bass phones, more straights.

[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.080]
But do you like bass cars?

[00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.100]
I beg your pardon?

[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.320]
Do you like bass cars?

[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:01.680]
Bass cars?

[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.700]
No, I prefer radar, my son.

[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:04.360]
OK.

[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.360]
And another thing I don't think.

[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:06.820]
Yeah.

[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.040]
Rod needs a feast bag and then I had the ability to do it.

[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.420]
OK.

[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.500]
1026 at WI.

[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.880]
That was from Oak and Chilby, by the way.

[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.320]
So those of you up there of Pohokie can track him down,

[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.240]
beat the crap out of him.

[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:17.740]
Miramar.

[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:18.620]
Good morning.

[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.240]
How you doing, sweetie?

[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.100]
I'm doing pretty damn good, to be honest with you.

[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.160]
Boy, I'm glad to hear that.

[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.120]
You know, I'm at work all day and I never

[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.000]
get to call you in.

[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:25.760]
The Dirt Show.

[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:26.840]
It's so amazing.

[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:27.560]
I know it.

[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.220]
It just tickles everybody's fancy.

[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.100]
Well, it's great because I'm a letter carrier.

[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.080]
And I've got your radio in my bag.

[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.520]
We have a lot of carriers who listen to Dirt Show.

[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.140]
I don't want to tell you what they're carrying, but.

[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:38.840]
Yeah, right.

[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.980]
Hey, one of these things I was thinking about while listening

[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.740]
to your show a lot.

[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.120]
Yeah.

[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.300]
During the war, when everybody was really trying to get

[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.780]
to stand and all this, he used to play a lot of cars

[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.680]
that were related to war efforts.

[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.200]
Yeah.

[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.320]
And one of the ones that I really used to think

[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.780]
was great was the Chamberlain thing.

[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.820]
And one of the all-time great of course

[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.340]
would be to start saying,

[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.900]
with banner, just kind of reminding people, look, you know.

[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.860]
Oh, sir, spare me.

[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.560]
There you go.

[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.680]
Don't you understand where you are?

[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.260]
Don't you understand the real world?

[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:10.860]
I know.

[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.320]
That's past say now.

[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.420]
It was all fashionable to jump on the bandwagon.

[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.580]
Even I got cut up in certain aspects of it.

[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.040]
It's, they were all full of crap.

[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.780]
Well, neither onward, enough word with Madonna

[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.520]
and all the other crap.

[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.980]
Well, maybe you got to a resentment.

[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.840]
That might do it.

[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.660]
That might do it.

[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.420]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.920]
All we can do is get back.

[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.000]
Sure, go right ahead.

[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.460]
All right, my brother, Neil, you're a dishbag.

[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.000]
And Dan at Active Pass, you're a dirty double-deck

[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.860]
on a dishbag.

[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.320]
OK.

[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.040]
Bye.

[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:40.800]
See you.

[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.260]
There's another one of those carriers.

[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.920]
1027 at WIOD, we have an open line in Dave County, 751.

[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:47.520]
Do it fast.

[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.100]
So I think we ought to have a big major tribute to Rick

[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.220]
Sanchez today on here.

[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.800]
We ought to have like a three and a half hour tribute

[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800]
because he's a great guy.

[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.580]
Much misunderstood.

[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.220]
And when you squat that long, it starts affecting

[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.600]
your brains, especially when they're located where he's on.

[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.900]
Mobile in North Miami.

[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.120]
Hi, this is Ray.

[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:04.980]
How you doing?

[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.420]
You know, believe it, but I'm on the 79th free bridge.

[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.600]
I can't believe it, Ray.

[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.720]
Yeah, I'm coming over.

[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.340]
I got two checks for you for the van.

[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.140]
Great, Ray.

[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.360]
Can I get a couple of shirts?

[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:13.960]
Sure.

[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.340]
What's the title of the first one I got to talk to?

[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.620]
The title of the first is the shirt director.

[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:19.120]
For shirts?

[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.000]
Because we got more shirts in this place, man,

[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.720]
than you ever see.

[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.680]
But you really have shirts?

[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:23.260]
Yeah.

[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.380]
They got them all around.

[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.080]
In fact, if we don't have one, Alex will give you

[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.020]
the one right off his back.

[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:27.520]
OK, here.

[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.120]
Give me a minute.

[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:28.500]
OK.

[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.340]
How's it going?

[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:29.860]
Thanks, Ray.

[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:30.560]
It's going great.

[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.080]
All right.

[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:31.500]
OK.

[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.000]
What's the title?

[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:33.820]
12,278.

[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.800]
Hey, we're in more than halfway there.

[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.400]
We're doing it.

[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:36.820]
All right.

[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:37.420]
See you, Ray.

[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:38.440]
OK, enough.

[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:39.860]
1028.

[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.720]
You know, I discovered yesterday that Andy Calb turns out

[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.840]
to be a real sleaze bag.

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.280]
We always thought he was OK because he's

[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.360]
a short little torpy guy.

[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.220]
He was taking such delight in the fact

[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.740]
that Cubs were getting their brains picked out of me yesterday.

[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.680]
Now, how did that game in any way, shape, or form,

[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.620]
affect the Metz?

[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.340]
Didn't it all?

[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.180]
The fillies and the Cubs.

[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.500]
And he kept running in here, laughing and puking and carrying,

[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.420]
oh, it's five to one.

[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.300]
Oh, it's 10 to one.

[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:03.760]
Ah-ha.

[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.840]
And then to make matters worse, the Metz beat the pirates.

[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.980]
Oh, I'm kind of happy about that because I'm sick and tired

[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.860]
of Chuck Meyer and his condescending attitude.

[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.180]
Though I really am.

[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.300]
They've been kicking as they've been winning every day.

[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.720]
And now, all of a sudden, they lost like nine

[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.220]
of their last 11 and they're playing like Slutshot, Vaughn,

[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.420]
Bons gets picked off face.

[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.900]
They look like crap, Chuck.

[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.360]
They look like crap.

[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.540]
Slutshot, please do that because this weekend

[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.500]
we'll take care of the Cubs again, the Metz again.

[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.080]
Now, we will take care of the Cubs ourselves.

[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.240]
Maybe we could start Danny Jackson again.

[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.240]
Maybe we could throw it.

[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.540]
We could pitch Sutcliffe today, Danny Jackson again tomorrow.

[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.740]
See, Danny goes out there, he pitches three innings.

[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.620]
Even gives up two runs or a hundred runs.

[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.800]
He goes out pitches three innings,

[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.040]
who's got to do something for that 10 million, right?

[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:44.420]
Woody?

[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.640]
You back in.

[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.040]
Starlines open, Star IOD, by the way.

[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.880]
Yes, I want to compliment you on the screen.

[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.320]
What do you mean, yeah, wait, no, wait, wait, yeah.

[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.460]
That was an important announcement.

[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:54.680]
Woody.

[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.960]
Was an important announcement?

[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:56.440]
Yeah.

[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.060]
Oh, OK, well, you know, what happened to my Rick Sanchez tapes,

[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:00.600]
Woody?

[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.260]
I say what happened to those Rick Sanchez tapes?

[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.440]
I think, you know, Rick Riley ate them.

[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.680]
No, I'm serious.

[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.140]
Where did those disappear to?

[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.120]
There were like four or five tapes at the very end.

[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:14.560]
Have you asked next door?

[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.080]
Have you asked next door if they got them?

[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.400]
I mean, there was nothing that was set on there.

[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:19.960]
They were all cute.

[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.080]
They were all kind of embarrassing for him.

[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.580]
But that's, you know, he didn't lose anything at all.

[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.260]
He didn't get any more embarrassing than that.

[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.320]
Really, I mean, there's nothing that he hasn't already

[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.280]
said or done on it.

[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:29.980]
Right.

[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.060]
It isn't embarrassing.

[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:31.780]
Really?

[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.960]
But I got to tell you that I was driving an I-75 yesterday.

[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.900]
And about the 12 new news, when you started playing

[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.560]
the airplanes through Tom Roberts, you know, traffic

[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:44.880]
report.

[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.960]
And I just cracked me up so much I nearly

[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.540]
had an accident.

[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.680]
I noticed this morning I'm coming to work.

[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.400]
And I hear one of the Sky 123 and four people saying,

[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.780]
now there's no golden glades.

[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.280]
It's clear this morning, no jamming.

[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.260]
And I know, I know definitely that's a response to my ripping

[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:01.860]
them and ass.

[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.860]
And guess what?

[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.780]
For once they were right.

[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.620]
There wasn't a dog on the golden glades.

[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.120]
With two there about 95.

[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:07.740]
All right.

[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.720]
You sort of put them on their toes, so to speak.

[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.280]
Yeah, right.

[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.980]
They are still full of crap.

[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.420]
You know, they think they can get away with it

[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.440]
because they basically have a monopoly in the market.

[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.800]
They're on every station in town.

[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.180]
And I'm, you know, giving any crap we want, they'll believe it.

[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:19.840]
You got it.

[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.560]
About time somebody called them for being

[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.100]
a bunch of phonies that they are.

[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.980]
Every time I'm heading down to the South 60 highway

[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.340]
on the, you know, five or six o'clock,

[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.320]
they always say it's all backed up through the city.

[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.520]
And then you finally see driving in the South of the

[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:33.600]
clear.

[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:35.820]
Yeah.

[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:37.800]
Yeah.

[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.420]
Yeah, we got your plane right over here, Joe.

[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.820]
Yeah, I almost ran into a browned chair

[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.780]
deputy who would slap and so hired.

[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.340]
You know, we do.

[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:44.540]
Really?

[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.800]
I mean, I just, I was just one of the great moments of radio.

[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:48.900]
Well, give it a shot again.

[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:49.300]
OK.

[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.020]
All right.

[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.160]
I'll try it again.

[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.980]
And go, Giants, and big Al, you're a big douchebag.

[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.600]
OK, Woody.

[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.860]
Listen, thank you, Danielle.

[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.160]
You control yourself, William.

[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:57.800]
I'll try.

[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.220]
See you.

[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:58.640]
Bye-bye.

[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.180]
You're rid of that stupid ponytail.

[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.020]
1032 at WIOD.

[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.720]
There's an open line in Dave County 7519463.

[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.040]
A pig reporting to Gables.

[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.680]
I feel safe surrounded.

[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.040]
The large evils of police station.

[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.120]
I guess they're looking for the chief.

[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:16.840]
Yeah.

[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.640]
Anyway, terrible shows today.

[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.760]
I guess they're all home.

[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:21.160]
OK.

[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.360]
1032.

[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.500]
It was great up until I called.

[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.260]
1032.

[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.420]
There's an open line in the star line at star IOD.

[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.460]
Let's go to Coral Springs.

[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:27.820]
Hello?

[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:28.720]
Coral Niel?

[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.080]
Yeah.

[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.240]
I have some more like a pig report.

[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.580]
Well, who is this?

[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:35.340]
Rob.

[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.160]
Rob?

[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.680]
You're going to be a little chronic, you know what, Rob?

[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.000]
Boy.

[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.420]
Summer time, the sun is shining.

[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.940]
The birds are dropping it on the cars.

[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.920]
And you're like, call the show every day, Rob.

[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.480]
You need to go out there and get a little suntan,

[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.380]
the Lexus size.

[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.560]
I do that.

[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.080]
Oh, after the show.

[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:52.880]
OK, that's all right.

[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.120]
Do you remember?

[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.340]
Do you exercise it after the show?

[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.100]
Yeah.

[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:56.800]
OK.

[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.820]
The number of the two lives puts the banning of the two.

[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.980]
No, I never heard of it.

[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.600]
Well, we don't play black music on this stage.

[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.060]
Yeah, I know.

[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.300]
But that's WADR.

[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.100]
When Nick Navarro bandit.

[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:10.760]
Never heard of him.

[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.060]
The only guy with white hair I know

[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.200]
is Sonny over at the market.

[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.260]
Never heard of two live crew Nick Navarro.

[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.640]
So what's the point, Rob?

[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.500]
Come on, you can do it.

[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.560]
Don't be intimidated now.

[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.620]
Stand up like a man.

[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.880]
Over at, since it was banned, I saw one like a top girl

[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.820]
over by, they saw one of the past years you wanted to take.

[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.240]
And still makes the one case and left the other two there.

[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:38.780]
Yeah.

[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.080]
Well, he was just taking one home for his family.

[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.800]
Michael, what a jackass.

[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.900]
What a jackass.

[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:45.640]
There you go, Rob.

[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.620]
Now you're getting warm.

[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:47.460]
Yeah.

[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:53.340]
Exactly.

[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.380]
That's my sentiments precisely, Rob.

[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.380]
Well, listen, get a grip on yourself

[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.960]
and have a great weekend and get out of this handed

[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.080]
while you were getting tired of it.

[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.580]
1034, we haven't opened on ever put him on again.

[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.700]
We have an open line in Broward 5249463.

[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.180]
524WI.

[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:11.740]
D.

[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.660]
If you're going to be out shopping around for a used car this weekend,

[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.640]
I got a little friendly piece of advice for you.

[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.280]
Call the auto critic and have them check it out along with you

[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.480]
before you put down a dime because buying a used car

[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.900]
is like playing automobile roulette, man.

[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.940]
It's usually getting here, it's somebody else's headaches.

[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.360]
And I would say nine times out of 10,

[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.140]
there are hidden problems with used cars

[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.140]
that you're never going to find out until it's too late.

[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.040]
When you've already signed and made the deal,

[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.480]
and you're already committed to make of the payments.

[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.040]
So instead of getting ripped off,

[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.240]
when you buy your next used car,

[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.100]
call the auto critic that conducts an unbiased 90 point bumper

[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.700]
to bumper analysis, they will analyze it from head to toe

[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.400]
from front to back from top to rear of any vehicle.

[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.380]
And just about an hour, they have a fleet of mobile fans

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.640]
that come right out to wherever that car is to the dealer,

[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.760]
to a private home, to a used car lot, whatever it might be.

[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.540]
And they use only ASC certified technicians who do that 90 point

[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.640]
bumper to bumper analysis and give you the load on it,

[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.880]
whether you're getting the great deal or 11, okay?

[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.080]
It's only $79.95, a mighty small price to pay,

[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.500]
where you can save lots of grief and maybe thousands of dollars

[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.900]
in future repairs.

[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.720]
The auto critic, check them out in day call 592, 7663,

[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.040]
592, 7663, in Howard 772, 6590,

[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.640]
772, 6590 for the auto critic.

[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.860]
This is the thing you've seen the TV commercials

[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.080]
now, and Joey Chinwood and his big wheels teach you how to do it.

[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.060]
Thank you, mate.

[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.820]
Yeah, are you getting the great coupons?

[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.220]
Sure do, but full that ring on up.

[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.880]
Oh, look too far.

[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.440]
After just one week of Joey Chinwood's great coupons

[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.700]
stunt driving school, you'll be sweating spicy djones

[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.680]
with a big ring.

[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.500]
Joey Chinwood, king of the 85 mile per hour condiments

[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:55.820]
lost.

[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.140]
See if you got one of the chase.

[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.220]
Tuck out the mustard.

[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.060]
21 to 11 at WIOD, so they've all disappeared.

[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.960]
I've checked everywhere they could possibly be.

[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.520]
We have another Rick Sanchez cover up.

[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.820]
Isn't it interesting how he's got these connections that no matter

[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.920]
what kind of tracks he leaves behind,

[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.580]
what little pile he leaves in the yard.

[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.700]
Somebody always seems to come along and cover it up.

[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.260]
Hmm, Miami.

[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.920]
Neo, how you doing?

[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:19.480]
Okay.

[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.280]
Pretty good.

[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.340]
Yeah, pretty fair.

[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.680]
I got a fire for you.

[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.080]
Yeah.

[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.720]
I found out with those cards there.

[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.260]
Yeah, they're in selling fifths as first.

[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.880]
They're in her purse.

[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.660]
Yeah, they're in the purse.

[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.900]
I thought you're going to say something else.

[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.640]
Get the paramedics again.

[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:35.940]
Wow.

[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.000]
If you got them, boy, OK, well, sharpen up that needle,

[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:40.420]
shall we?

[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.920]
Maybe we can play them out from next door.

[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:43.960]
OK, sir, great call.

[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.440]
Two open lines of dates.

[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.980]
Somebody just panicked when he said that.

[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.640]
751 WIOD, let's go to Davy.

[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.940]
Uncle Neo, how you doing?

[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.740]
I'm doing it.

[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.720]
Sound great today.

[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.380]
Well, that's good.

[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.340]
Listen, Neo, BSO is going to be conducting a Nazi Germany

[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.660]
DUI set point tonight between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m.

[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.660]
in front of the Lauderdale Mall 441 Northbound.

[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.200]
Great.

[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.440]
So Rick Sanchez, if you're listening,

[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:09.880]
stay out of Lauderdale.

[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.820]
It could be back to your image, do you, back?

[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:12.960]
OK.

[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:13.640]
Thanks, Neo.

[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.440]
Thank you, sir.

[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.660]
Great job.

[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.040]
The BSO striking terror in the parts from coast to coast.

[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.280]
And all we got are a bunch of lame idiots sitting back

[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:24.580]
out there.

[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.740]
Man, what are we going to do?

[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:26.760]
What are we going to do?

[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.600]
One of the first missions of the Santa Rosa County

[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.500]
Sheriff's Department in Navarro Beach,

[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.360]
or is that Navarro Beach?

[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.200]
What the hell is that?

[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.560]
Since the legislature passed a boundary change,

[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.120]
that shifted that community from a scambia county

[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.080]
has been an undercover operation

[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.820]
aimed at curtailing nude sunbathing.

[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.300]
What we've been doing, we've been doing covertly,

[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.440]
Sheriff's Captain Terry Hardy explained,

[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.740]
saying there have been some arrests.

[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.800]
There haven't been a lot of marked cars

[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.740]
or uniformed officers.

[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.360]
He said, in order for us to find out what's going on down there,

[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.460]
we have to be able to be there without anyone

[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.240]
knowing we're there.

[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.800]
So now they're cracking out down on the nude

[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.280]
baters in Navarro Beach in a scambia county.

[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:06.980]
Hallelujah.

[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.140]
What a great state, huh?

[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.200]
The police state.

[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.040]
We're doing it.

[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.540]
You just mark my words, OK?

[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.820]
You can laugh all you want when I talk about the passport.

[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.800]
And I read that Al Goldstein editorial from Screw Magazine.

[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.240]
Yes, Dad, that's pretty funny.

[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.240]
Yeah, right.

[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.000]
Would they drag your ass away?

[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.300]
Don't be calling us on the air and bitching about it, OK?

[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.160]
Coral Springs.

[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:27.980]
Hill.

[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:28.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.500]
Hey, I heard you were up in the TV down.

[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:31.960]
How was it?

[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.440]
Terrible.

[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.220]
Terrible.

[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:33.900]
Did you win any money?

[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:34.560]
No, sir.

[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.520]
You got to be kidding.

[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.980]
Soft, I never win a TV down.

[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:37.920]
It's a terrible play.

[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.080]
Play you think they're fixed up there.

[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.100]
I didn't say that, sir.

[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:40.860]
Oh, well, well, well.

[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.260]
Or be it for me to make any accusations like that.

[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.540]
Hey, listen, have you ever eaten in a place

[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.720]
right outside of Rochester?

[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.780]
It's called the Maplewood Inn.

[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.440]
I know what it is, I've never been there.

[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.520]
Oh, great food.

[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.600]
You're up in Rochester.

[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.400]
I think I've been there a long time ago.

[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.520]
Very, very good.

[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.280]
Well, that's good.

[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.380]
Hey, listen, can I call somebody a douchebag?

[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.020]
1042 at WIOD.

[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.940]
We have an open line at Broward, 5249463, 524.

[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.740]
WIOD, clear water.

[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.300]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.340]
I'm doing OK, sir.

[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.460]
I haven't talked to you in a long time.

[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.360]
I used to live down there.

[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:13.740]
I moved down.

[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.180]
I moved to Sarasota for a while.

[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.380]
You moved to Sarasota while things are getting pretty hot

[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:17.800]
over there.

[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.760]
Yeah, it was, they have nothing to do over there.

[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:20.420]
It's so ridiculous.

[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.560]
You know, you heard the St. Peter's birds say

[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.040]
that people retire when they go.

[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.520]
You know, they go to retire.

[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.580]
Well, their mothers and fathers retire to Sarasota.

[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.360]
That is correct.

[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.660]
They're dead.

[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:32.700]
They're grandparents.

[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.440]
The great grandparents retire to Sarasota.

[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.360]
Yeah, my buddy, Mark, at the Mercedes dealer down there

[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.860]
since he tapes everyone for a while,

[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.640]
so I can still keep track of what's going on.

[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.000]
Well, it's the same old craft, not the race here.

[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.840]
There's nothing to do in this town.

[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.940]
The radio appears about the same except for your show down there.

[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.540]
They're the traffic's the same.

[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.600]
They don't have an clue.

[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.460]
They're on 50 different stations with 40 different names.

[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.600]
They don't know what they're doing.

[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.160]
I bet you Mike Paxton is on down there, too.

[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.260]
He probably is.

[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:05.140]
What's his name?

[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.280]
He's probably CD Schwartz on a year over there.

[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.780]
Now, full of crap, Tom Roberts.

[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.960]
OK, you're not full of anybody, a fat slob.

[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.560]
Yeah, well, they can add airplane.

[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.560]
They can confuse you.

[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.160]
Oh, and they don't know.

[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.640]
How can you really tell?

[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.980]
I mean, you're at that far up in the air.

[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.080]
You look down, all the streets.

[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.220]
Yeah, that's the problem there.

[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.460]
Playing that's like cruising at 37,000 feet.

[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.480]
What the hell are they going to see?

[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.700]
You don't know what's going on.

[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.620]
Anyway, you're doing a great job for the veterans and stuff.

[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.580]
Well, we're trying, like, hell, it's a tough thing just

[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.440]
to come from out of the blue and ask for 24 grand.

[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.040]
But we're plugging away.

[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.460]
Yeah, I listened to the tape.

[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.000]
I think it was from last Monday.

[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.720]
I was listening to that on the way in this morning

[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.280]
about our buddy Greg, whatever they are getting

[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.700]
flammed off the light bulb.

[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.420]
No, he's not.

[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.300]
That was a false rumor planted by somebody inside.

[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.640]
I don't want to mention Steve's name,

[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.200]
but they wanted him out desperately.

[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.140]
And he's still on there.

[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.880]
He's still plugging away with his...

[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.280]
Oh, you mean Steve the douchebag came?

[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.200]
And not in New York?

[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:57.900]
He's down there now.

[00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:58.940]
You didn't know that?

[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.560]
Oh, he got blown on New York in a matter of months.

[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.200]
What do you do for him to sleep up there?

[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:03.680]
Yeah.

[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.260]
They didn't have enough of those...

[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.580]
One too many urine leave, he shows.

[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.140]
Chris, if I had a choice between us

[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.100]
and the Howard Stern Don Eimes or Steve Kane,

[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.020]
that would be a tough one.

[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.460]
Oh, yeah, Don Eimes is really good.

[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.480]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.560]
And at the end, they got that F.A. and radio up there.

[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.220]
That's right.

[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.660]
And they actually promote the personalities up there.

[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.120]
They keep on a Metz broadcast.

[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.540]
They keep talking about Eimes.

[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.340]
They got all these caricatures and billboards.

[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.060]
They actually believe in promoting the personalities up there.

[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.320]
And he comes on and he rips the hell out of the Metz

[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.920]
and the sports staff and they love it.

[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:30.640]
That's right.

[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.300]
Here, we don't want to promote the personalities

[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.820]
because somebody might find out that we're here

[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.580]
so we talk about news, weather, and traffic.

[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.280]
Oh boy.

[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:36.800]
Yeah.

[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:37.440]
Lame.

[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.520]
Oh, listen, you just reminded me.

[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.520]
You know, Howard went on the year in Los Angeles.

[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.780]
Howard Stern on the...

[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:44.740]
The F.A. is doing in California.

[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:44.920]
Right.

[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.180]
It's a formal cast of what he's doing in Philly and Washington

[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.560]
in the K-Rock in New York.

[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.340]
So he's on an L.A.

[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.920]
And so the first person he started ripping out there

[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.100]
and justifiably so was Tom Likas.

[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:54.900]
Likas.

[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.160]
Remember Tom Likas was here for a...

[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.580]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.440]
Where'd he go to Chicago?

[00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.380]
Right off to...

[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.400]
No, he's at our sister station, K.F.I.

[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.580]
Another Cox Broadcasting embarrassment out there.

[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.240]
So guess what K.F.I's management told Tom Likas?

[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.260]
What's that?

[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.620]
You can't respond.

[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.240]
Don't mention Howard's name.

[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.320]
Just to ignore it.

[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.260]
Now, isn't that typical?

[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.560]
Isn't that just the Cox Broadcasting way?

[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.460]
Ignore it.

[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.220]
Like nobody's going to...

[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.340]
Somebody might find Howard if Likas mentions his name on here.

[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.060]
Oh, man.

[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.120]
These people, if they knew anything about radio,

[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:24.940]
it would hurt them.

[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.080]
The only thing they know is to put on a bunch of slush out there

[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:28.980]
on a coast in L.A.

[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.120]
And make 37 million a year from it or something like that.

[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.780]
So all they can do is put on a bunch of CDs

[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.820]
and sharpen up the needle.

[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:35.900]
Oh, well.

[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.420]
I'm working for the Z5 guy.

[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.500]
I've been there waiting for some parts.

[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.480]
So I better get back to work.

[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.340]
OK, get your ass to work and have a great day.

[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:41.920]
Nice talking to you, Neil.

[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.240]
See you.

[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.540]
10.45.

[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:44.680]
Yeah, Likas.

[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.560]
Don't mention Howard.

[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.200]
Management will get all paranoid and upset up there

[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.120]
just like they do here.

[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.580]
Hold on, let's just leave on here.

[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.600]
Ooh, ooh.

[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.700]
God, these people are such a bunch of whims.

[00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.480]
Two open lines are both enbrowered at 5249463.

[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.140]
524, WIOD.

[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.160]
That's when you see the two lines like that,

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.300]
that's the sure sign that we're just beginning

[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.460]
to start eroding for the day.

[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:10.720]
But I don't care.

[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.740]
We got just tons of cars.

[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.440]
He went out without the Rick Sanchez cars.

[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:14.420]
Doesn't that strike?

[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.020]
Anybody is being a little bit mysterious.

[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.960]
I'm not making it up.

[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.060]
We had those little drop-ins.

[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.240]
They were pretty amusing and abusing.

[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.220]
Look at that.

[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.840]
And the toll-free lines opened too.

[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.360]
So now we were sizzling all morning

[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.920]
and now while they're coming back a little bit.

[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.280]
But strikes me as pretty peculiar.

[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.640]
And especially, I only tuned in and bits and pieces.

[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.900]
Maybe we need a spy report.

[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:33.300]
But what?

[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.020]
There must have been something that preceded

[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.360]
or went around Rick Gareli.

[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.500]
And here we just had him butched up a little bit

[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.260]
and he's sucking around defending Rick Sanchez,

[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.760]
defending the indefensible.

[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.000]
If you go see Return to the Blue Lagoon,

[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.700]
be sure to wear those no-zipper jeans.

[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.980]
Let's go to Fort Lauderdale.

[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.260]
Hello.

[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.160]
Me, how are you doing?

[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:49.640]
Pretty good.

[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.600]
Our first off, Southclip is the Antichrist.

[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.820]
And who is Southclip?

[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:55.600]
Oh.

[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.460]
Start with our three-game slide.

[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.500]
Yeah, he does have three little sixes under his beard.

[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.120]
And that's his earned run average to a 66.6.

[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.540]
Next, I do have a dish.

[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.400]
Fortunately, they get to catch all the games

[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.540]
that you don't want to see anywhere.

[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.880]
And yeah, what do we have a day game today, right?

[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.220]
320 Eastern Daylight Time, WGN.

[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.460]
I don't know if we could catch the last few

[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.040]
any of these anyway.

[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.080]
As a matter of fact, the Metz fans,

[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.480]
I believe, get screwed again today

[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.540]
because I think I heard Ralph say last night

[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.360]
it's going to be on Sports Channel, New York again,

[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.280]
which is F-47 if you have a satellite dish

[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.580]
and if you don't, you're screwed down here.

[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.460]
That's it.

[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.240]
I'll see you in this morning in New York City.

[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.100]
They have a big protest, something about Pee-Wee,

[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.540]
play with Pee-Wee Day or something.

[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:35.720]
Right.

[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.240]
I don't have 500 people out there playing with Pee-Wee.

[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.720]
And try to play with Pee-Wee.

[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:40.900]
With their button jeans.

[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.200]
Well, that's about it.

[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:42.920]
Now I have a good day.

[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:43.940]
And the same to you, sir.

[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:44.340]
Take care.

[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:44.760]
See ya.

[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.780]
132 at WIOD in a country filled with hypocrites and the assholes.

[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.360]
An open line in Broward 5249463.

[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.920]
And we'll go to Miami and say Buenos Diaz.

[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.460]
Yes, this is my first time on it.

[00:31:59.560 --> 00:31:59.920]
I have to say.

[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:00.820]
Oh, man.

[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.460]
I've said it.

[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.580]
Alex, you're really doing it.

[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.960]
I think Gary Mills had a point.

[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:05.960]
What is it?

[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.260]
Well, I think that Pee-Wee, how would

[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.020]
if he had button flies, he would never get a thing out of there.

[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.800]
How old are you, sir?

[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.000]
I'm 12.

[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:14.860]
Yeah.

[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.660]
But I think it's a real...

[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.320]
I think you've got a zipper fly.

[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.860]
I don't think there's any question about that.

[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.200]
Yeah, but...

[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:26.920]
I think it just got stuck.

[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:27.900]
Bad. Big time.

[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.460]
What do you have against kids?

[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.520]
I don't have anything against, because you want to hear five-year-old kids calling it on a radio.

[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.180]
What a dumb, but I mean...

[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.060]
Yeah, see, there you go.

[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.840]
We like to talk to somebody more mature and intelligent like you, sir.

[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:39.680]
Right.

[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.760]
There you go.

[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:41.840]
But...

[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.620]
That guy's a rotation.

[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.440]
If your voice gets any higher, man, they're going to come to inspect

[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.820]
see if there's anything there, okay?

[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.340]
I think you better quit while you're ahead.

[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.480]
We got to play that song.

[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.940]
He's an old smoothie for that kid.

[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:54.780]
He's like...

[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.360]
We got that Michael J. Fox syndrome.

[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.400]
I mean, there's just nothing there.

[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.080]
Just a smooth spot.

[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.700]
Jamie Neils.

[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:02.800]
Hello.

[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:03.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:04.780]
Hello, Neal.

[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.580]
Yes, I am.

[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:06.940]
This is Jamie.

[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.800]
I'm from Gene Stiles, the rich and famous, and I can give you a pretty good rundown on the story of the button...

[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.300]
...bust-frontly.

[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.160]
Gene Stiles of the rich and flaming?

[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.180]
Yeah, rich and famous, yes.

[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:17.680]
I see.

[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.360]
Just like the Italian show.

[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.120]
Well, first of all, the button front was originally a farmer's.

[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.020]
Gene was the original Levi gene.

[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:27.700]

[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.560]
What's worn by Levi Harner at the TV Down?

[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:31.700]
Okay.

[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.220]
And they became...

[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.340]
They became collectors items in Europe.

[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:44.460]
And people were buying our used button front genes over here and taking them back to Europe.

[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.640]
And it became a style.

[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.700]
And it's still a major style over there today.

[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.480]
Most of our button fronts the years...

[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.520]
Maybe that's why there's that big sign over the stalls in Europe, I saw it.

[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.400]
It says, you're a peon.

[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.240]
Yeah, that's over the top of each stall.

[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.540]
Little instructional information, I guess, for us Americans.

[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:09.320]
So anyhow, they became famous over there and we started shipping the used genes to Europe.

[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.720]
Then New Yorkers and Californians who came to...

[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.020]
Of course, you know, in Tera Soda, they got a big sign over the stalls.

[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.380]
It says, you're a peon or you're in trouble.

[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.020]
Yeah, that's a little...

[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.440]
That's a little bit stupid.

[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:23.200]
Wow.

[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.160]
So where's this all coming from?

[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.120]
They're just flowing out from a magic flood somewhere.

[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:33.520]
Yeah, well, actually what's happened is they're now starting to become famous here.

[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:38.620]
Actually, the New Yorkers and the Californians started to follow the European style.

[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.520]
And then the gay community started to make them famous down in Florida.

[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.040]
Yes.

[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.660]
And the story that Sonny told you...

[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:51.100]
No, I'm sorry, the guy previously told you about the romantic bit of unbuttoning the fly.

[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:51.560]
Yeah.

[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.340]
We heard that story many, many times.

[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.100]
Sure, I got this.

[00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:01.200]
There's nothing romantic about tugging at each one of those damn things when you're just really desperate to check out what's in there.

[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.020]
There's nothing romantic about it at all.

[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:03.460]
Believe me.

[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.740]
Well, I trust rating itself.

[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.340]
I don't know. Stop my finger.

[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.160]
Especially when they don't want to give you any help.

[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.420]
Just to sit back.

[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.500]
Okay, go ahead and see.

[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.340]
I'll have a later one.

[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:11.580]
I'll have a later one.

[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.700]
The ladies want them now.

[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.480]
The college girls want them.

[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.640]
And they want them ripped and torn.

[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:23.900]
We get twice as much money for a used button for our juniors we get for a perfect regular leave-off.

[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:24.500]
I'll be damned.

[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.400]
Well, I guess like Sonny said, they're making a fashion statement.

[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:27.900]
Yeah.

[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:28.660]
A bad one.

[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.300]
Uh-huh.

[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.420]
Well, Jamie, you've been a real tweet.

[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.220]
Let me tell you that.

[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:32.820]
Okay.

[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.460]
I'm going to go home and put on my book.

[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.880]
Bush Good and just have a great weekend.

[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:36.780]
Okay, Neil.

[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.440]
Good luck, Jamie.

[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.120]
Good boy.

[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.120]
I'm sure it is.

[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:43.680]
136 Jamie Nells from Gene Styles of the rich and famous.

[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.960]
Oh, and Alex puts lifestyles of the rich and famous son.

[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.500]
Well, you are.

[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.020]
You're so gallable, man.

[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.460]
They can tell you anything like these little six-year-old kids that tell you they're 25.

[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.060]
It's 136 at WIOD.

[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.860]
So, you're having a limited time only, say it like not an angel.

[00:35:59.000 --> 00:35:59.860]
We sure are.

[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.800]
It is so hard.

[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.440]
Here's my story.

[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.640]
Sad but true.

[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.820]
I always said that there are husband and wife and wife.

[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.980]
It would never be cut dead wearing a button fly.

[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.040]
And I said, well, why is he so honest and open about these things?

[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.320]
He said, he don't have much to hide.

[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.740]
17-till-two at Mollie's Jewish.

[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.360]
What do you expect?

[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.220]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.200]
Hello.

[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.400]
Yes, I am.

[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.940]
Uh, yes, this is about the button flies again.

[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:24.480]
Okay.

[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.820]
I'm originally from Montana.

[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.280]
And I was my first exposure to the button fly.

[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.260]
Your first exposure to the button fly?

[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.720]
That's an interesting way you put it.

[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.460]
I was only about 11 or 12 when the hormones were starting to go.

[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.700]
And my older sister had a boyfriend that always wore button down fly.

[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.060]
Wow.

[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.320]
And it was always just really interesting.

[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.660]
And later on, I would always suggest that my boyfriend would try wearing them.

[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.180]
Yeah.

[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.560]
And a couple of my boyfriends were really, you know, strict about the kind of genes that they'd wear.

[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.080]
One wore Wrangler.

[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:54.700]
Oh, yeah.

[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:55.820]
The other wore a...

[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.900]
Making a fashion statement.

[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:57.560]
Yeah, the other one.

[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.660]
Well, Montana kind of keeps.

[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.080]
Exactly.

[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.080]
Like in beauty.

[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:01.900]
Yeah.

[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.640]
But anyway, there's just such a difference, you know, between a man that's wearing a regular zipper.

[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.420]
And then the...

[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:09.740]
Really?

[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.640]
The button down fly.

[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.460]
Well, what's the difference?

[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.460]
Well, just look at it.

[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.720]
You know, I just...

[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.320]
Oh, you mean look at the fly.

[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.700]
Yes, you can see it.

[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.160]
I see.

[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.080]
You know, it's the way it's...

[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.760]
It's the shape and...

[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.060]
So in other words, it is a statement.

[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.280]
Well, I don't know.

[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.780]
You know, the guy that called in about the genes of the rich and famous.

[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:29.220]
I don't know.

[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:29.760]
You know what?

[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.060]
Because I left my tent and went to Europe and the military.

[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.480]
And I knew they did have a big thing for our genes.

[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.280]
They trade just about anything to get a pair of button down fly.

[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:43.380]
Well, I think we've tapped into something really incredible here today.

[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.020]
I don't think it is a fashion statement.

[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.380]
I think it's a psychological thing.

[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:46.620]
Yeah.

[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.980]
I think once a man gets a pair of these genes on, it feels its power.

[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.940]
It's kind of like what they say at the funeral parlour.

[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.760]
It's just good a task.

[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.800]
It's good to check out our basket.

[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:55.960]
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:56.780]
It's something like that.

[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.160]
It's like, you know, well, it kind of gives them a little extra.

[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.880]
It's kind of like a woman wearing a padded bra.

[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.740]
I see.

[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.660]
That's what I thought.

[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.100]
So in other words, what you see may not be what you get.

[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:06.980]
Right, right.

[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.300]
But women seem to go for that.

[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.100]
And then once the men get them on, they're all the sudden they've got all this power.

[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.820]
And you know, they can just...

[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.100]
Okay, there's a little suggestion.

[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.600]
All you guys try this weekend, the button fly.

[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.420]
You may be flying all weekend.

[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.700]
It can change its whole limit.

[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.360]
Okay.

[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.220]
Thank you.

[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:21.800]
Thank you.

[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.360]
Boy, there it is right from Montana.

[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:29.280]
A psychological statement, not just a fashion statement, but a psychological statement.

[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.220]
She also said a couple of socks can't hurt either.

[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.900]
Oh, geez, please.

[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.760]
I just had lunch a little while ago.

[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:37.960]
145 WIOD.

[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.860]
I'm telling you, this could be...

[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:40.980]
We could do a whole week on this.

[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.620]
One last week, I guess.

[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.700]
Four-letter day, hello.

[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.200]
What a view, that one.

[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:45.700]
Yeah.

[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.480]
As in Crested View.

[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.820]
Yeah, and there's a place out there called Crested Butt.

[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.940]
And just in Buchmont, and Niela.

[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.560]
Just a question on a call.

[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:56.640]
A call?

[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.920]
Right, a call that now they've instituted a quick official.

[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:00.600]
Right.

[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:01.880]
Okay, you know what that is?

[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.920]
Yeah, so like they asked all the jockeys.

[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.760]
Anybody got a problem?

[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.140]
Right.

[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.280]
Right, now my question is, I always thought when they had a way in,

[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.100]
the way they had to be the same...

[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:11.540]
Well, of course.

[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.120]
And if it wasn't...

[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:14.640]
They'd just qualify.

[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.200]
Yeah, I mean...

[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.600]
Do you know that years ago, I've told this story, but it bears repeating because it was a funny thing about 10 years ago.

[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.840]
I had a pretty good bet on a double.

[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.860]
And in the first race, the horse that won, won by like open lengths, and my horse was second.

[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.900]
And I mean, the first one by like 15 lengths.

[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:30.280]
Yeah.

[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.900]
And the results went up on the board, and it wasn't official.

[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.760]
I wasn't official.

[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.880]
I'm like, and just sitting there waiting, and there was no objection, there was no inquiry, there's no nothing.

[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:42.680]
And all of a sudden, like about 15 minutes goes by, and they take the numbers down.

[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.420]
And they announced that the winner had been disqualified.

[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.680]
The jockeys thrown the weights out and the starting gear.

[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.600]
I had never heard that.

[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.420]
It's incredible.

[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:50.840]
And it's my horse got...

[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:56.160]
So my horse, if in a second got placed first, and I hit a real good double, I had about a $5 dollar double was a big one.

[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.140]
And I never forget that.

[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.420]
It was the only time I've ever seen that.

[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.040]
Yeah, I'm going to ask you, have you ever heard of that?

[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.520]
So somebody is going to have to clarify how they do that.

[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.660]
I don't get out.

[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:10.000]
Because it's always the jockeys of the first three, the horses that are in the money that have to come back and weigh in.

[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:10.260]
Yeah.

[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.400]
I think in the old days, Neil, everybody had a weigh in, but now it's the first three.

[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.680]
But anyway, even if the winner thrown the weights, the result is official now.

[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.580]
I don't understand that.

[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:26.220]
You know, they'll disqualify him from purse money, but I just pour that...

[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.820]
That sounds like a hell of a good way to cash a bet, doesn't it?

[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.640]
To hell with a purse money.

[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.220]
Well, I'm sure that Phil Saltsman or one of our astute friends will call in on Monday and play a photo.

[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:36.720]
But I had nobody to ask.

[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.120]
I said, you have friends at least.

[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.700]
And you know, you're right, Neil.

[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.060]
To hell with the purse money, there's people betting in all the game rooms in Texas.

[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.440]
And Vegas now.

[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:45.940]
You bet.

[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.740]
Uh, another comment.

[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:53.140]
You were at a town last week, but call to had 13,000 on Sunday.

[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:53.940]
I don't know if you comment.

[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.440]
Well, yeah, because they had that tote bag, that I pumped the hell out of even though I didn't need to.

[00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.980]
But yeah, they had that big...

[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.040]
A tote bag.

[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:00.720]
A tote bag.

[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.700]
25 dollar tote bag.

[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:01.840]
Yeah.

[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.100]
Those were gigantic bags.

[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:04.860]
They're incredible.

[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.520]
I took a lot of gigantic bags.

[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.480]
Usually at Gulfstream.

[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.900]
There was a lot of old bags too.

[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.340]
Yeah, I bet.

[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.300]
All right, take care.

[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.080]
Okay, see ya.

[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.900]
Well, we better check that out.

[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.920]
I wonder if John Stamos on the beach there on MTV is wearing a button or a zipper fly.

[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.240]
I guess we'll find out during the break.

[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.320]
148 at WIOD.

[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:24.140]
And right now, every stinking Toyota dealer in town has tried to unload their 91 models.

[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.760]
The initial investment.

[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.100]
I told you they're, uh, they get the deal for carrying certain, you know,

[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.800]
per subscriber, like the Turner.

[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.760]
They, uh, then they sell advertiles.

[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.720]
They don't load those where they have local avails.

[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.760]
And you pay.

[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:38.100]
Yeah.

[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:39.580]
So they get paid three ways.

[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.400]
Three ways.

[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.980]
Now, who have heard of such a thing?

[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.460]
I don't.

[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.500]
At the phone company.

[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.400]
It would be like, I'm sending you a bill to listen to WIOD, okay?

[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:47.640]
Yeah.

[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.720]
By the minute, they get paid one way, FPL, phone company, one, one income.

[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:52.660]
Cable has a key.

[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:57.020]
And then like I was charging you for hooking up your radio so you can hear WIOD.

[00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.620]
Sounds pretty good, don't I?

[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.920]
Call 45 and let's go to a mobile and Palm Beach.

[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:03.260]
Hello.

[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.320]
Hello, Uncle Neil.

[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:04.900]
How you doing?

[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:05.360]
Okay.

[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.740]
Uncle Neil, there is a wrestling network.

[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:08.560]
Really?

[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.100]
There is.

[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.500]
I was out in the night.

[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.160]
Well, if anybody should know Palm Beach County should be into it heavily.

[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:15.580]
Uncle Neil, can you do me a favor?

[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:16.020]
Yeah.

[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.780]
I want to call my brother a douchebag.

[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:18.320]
Okay.

[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.260]
Hey, FPL.

[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.520]
You feel better now?

[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:23.920]
Okay.

[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:24.880]
No, he just, that was it.

[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.460]
Thirty-fifths, that's a minute.

[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:26.920]
Yeah.

[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.860]
Well, in Palm Beach, oh, there was a great speaking of Eastern.

[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.080]
You had a bit on the floor.

[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.000]
There was a great story on Channel 4 News last night about how Eastern is coming up with

[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.680]
these reduced fares to New York now $49 one way.

[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.880]
And they were taping out of the airport.

[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.920]
And there was this one guy, a French opinion who had bought his tickets to go home.

[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.720]
He was stranded because his tickets were worthless.

[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.320]
And he was stranded here and he was trying to get back.

[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.060]
Which got me upset to begin with because French Canadians can't get home.

[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:55.780]
I'm really impressed.

[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.240]
And they were talking about the new $49 one way to New York fares and they asked him if

[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.440]
he would take advantage of it.

[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.280]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I got no more money.

[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.240]
No, not for me.

[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:10.300]
And I just about, oh, thinkled on the floor with this wonderful French Canadian.

[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.160]
Now, I guess if they would have paid him to go back.

[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.920]
And we'll consider it, believe it or not, you want to call us.

[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:15.780]
We'll take up a collection.
