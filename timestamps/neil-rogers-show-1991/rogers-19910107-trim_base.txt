[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]
The target whether they're gay or whatever they might be well of the reason that's so funny is because nobody else will do it

[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.860]
Yeah, and the fact is it happens and then it's start bringing all this crap about suicide

[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.080]
I mean that that is just so ridiculous. It's embarrassing. Okay, the fact that anybody stands up to be counted

[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.300]
I mean here's here's the article again John Travolta is getting married now

[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.040]
Isn't that a joke actress Kelly pressed that in John Travolta just happened to be getting married after this outing organization

[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.900]
Popped his name out as being gay

[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.420]
Funny coincidence isn't wow

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.580]
That's what I call a ball Z move John. You're gonna sleep in separate houses up separate countries, probably I

[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.940]
Met him down at Mayfair one day was just like walking around you see I shouldn't say that because then the

[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.960]
Organization up there for lottery what they ought to be doing is going out there worrying about all the gay basures in for a lot of

[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.060]
They'll okay including the police that's what they ought to be doing

[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.380]
Instead of worrying about some jackass on a radio who's got a sense of humor

[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.880]
They're experimenting with new gentle blue uniforms. Did you see that?

[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.080]
Sorry

[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.760]
And white cars wow the brown shirts are cleaning up their act we think goose stepping a little bit lower. Yeah

[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.380]
What again

[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.820]
And I knew it the people I was sitting next to they said all we're in trouble we've lost this one

[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.860]
I know we can come back we did before it was like the jets we did it then we could do it now

[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.040]
I was rooting I was singing and you understand the Henry Burrow is the magic ingredient that put us over the top

[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.820]
Why did they not let him we talked about this like all day Friday?

[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.340]
Why why now they have begged him they said well we need you and Buffalo

[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.900]
It's gonna be a tough game. We want you to come next week. It's gonna be cool. Sure

[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.700]
Who's got the like warming sauce? I'll give you an extra bottle and he said no I can't really can't

[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.840]
See Larry Zorka threatened me one time and

[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.760]
That's why I wanted to know if that was like with

[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.120]
No, I can't really can't Henry come on

[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.560]
Seriously when one for the jipper and we come on just for a couple hours. I can't really can't all right screw you here

[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.560]
Go have a drink

[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.460]
It's gonna be a tough tough weekend

[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.720]
Hey listen, I said this was gonna be a tough game and it was

[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.620]
It was but we both agreed I saw you before the game that was gonna be a good game to see me after the name

[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.860]
You wouldn't believe I know but it was going to be a good game and it was a great game

[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.160]
Maybe the greatest game that I've ever been to

[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.580]
And it was like that chess game we came back we come back Dan knows you know

[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.620]
He wants to give these people their money's worth they paid a lot to get in they complain about the ticket prices

[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.260]
Let me just kind of lay back for a little while give them their money's worth and then I'll win that one

[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.820]
And I didn't hear you mentioned today did you notice that

[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.740]
Nobody left the stadium until all the dolphins were off the field not true. I mean nobody figuratively

[00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.500]
The stadium was nine tenths. Oh, yeah capacity until all the dolphins were no nine tenths capacity when it started well

[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.660]
Exactly, but you know what I mean, yeah, they stayed there. They thought it was gonna be the last home game

[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.420]
They applauded them. They sure it was phenomenal. It was great. It was and you can't get that from TV

[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.180]
No

[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.020]
Not at all and the fact that there were empty seats that that's the only negative you could fight out of the entire

[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.260]
Fear is the fact that there were five six thousand empty seats in inexcusable

[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.540]
And I guarantee there were people afterward kicking themselves that they didn't go I don't think so no I

[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.900]
Know like I said I guarantee there were people who should have been kicking exactly or kicked by somebody

[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.320]
You know what people who don't go who haven't been to a football game in a long time don't realize it's don't get from TV

[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.060]
TV they have such tight shots on everybody and all you see in the field of view is the players

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.140]
When you're in the field you can see all the possibilities where they can go the one guy that's down there that they don't get to

[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.560]
Until the players are already down around the guy you know what I mean the openings the closings and all of that

[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.820]
And you can sit there a roof for something that's about to happen, but you'll never see that on TV

[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.800]
What the hell am I saying? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think Marlon Brando was addressed

[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.480]
Davie hey guys listen

[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.340]
Neil congratulations on the Camilla's house. Thank you second things and information. You got a butt-loat boy on there right here and

[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.560]
Also information for one of your previous listeners. I beg your pardon

[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.020]
All right, there's a

[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:30.020]
Paper shop and record shop when sunrise Boulevard west of 441 called Sir Arthur's oldies. Yeah, he has a copy of the

[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.680]
Prepitation contest really and if he has a copy of it, you know how long metal lasts well

[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.660]
Here's the situation he'll make you one you buy the tape and give it to him. I

[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.660]
Want to do the same for any of your customers that want an original

[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.740]
Second thing you're thinking story about guard

[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.120]
Did you ever too little gay guy standing up on top to don't have a nice life sir

[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.420]
118 and w. I would do we have an open line and Broward 524

[00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.140]
I think he saw that movie the fan with Lauren McCall too many times. That was that peak guy. Yeah

[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.720]
And one understood see I you know

[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.240]
I'm willing to discuss to debate but when somebody calls me and starts threatening and telling me what I can say and what I can't say

[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.100]
And if you know what he's saying if you don't

[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.840]
Bend and yield to well pressure. We're gonna come after you with the vet come after what

[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.540]
Come after what

[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.120]
Because I say because I have a sense of humor

[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.040]
They're gonna beat you up. Yeah, right

[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.720]
Good luck to them. I hope they were paraphera pants anymore

[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.120]
Geez exactly. I mean really some people are so stupid any of these militants. I don't care what it is

[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.700]
Millicent women's groups. Exactly whatever the organization

[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.700]
It's just it's enough to make you barve

[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.460]
One thing to stand up for your rights and to try to uh to try to demand what

[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.660]
Society owes you a fair shake in life. Okay?

[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.560]
And a fair chance to live your life and earn a living and what have you but to start try to throw your weight around because well

[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.920]
We're gonna it's just a bunch of crap. It's a pile of garbage, all right

[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.160]
Why don't you come after some of the other gutless people who are cowering in the closet who want to stand up and be counted

[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.480]
What about them Charlie

[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.280]
one

[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.620]
19 at W.I.O.D

[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.580]
But I'm a great game and we'll be right back if you weren't in a box where you could see it on TV or anything

[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.960]
No, okay on television on a few of those carries that ball was just hanging out there in my heart within my throat

[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.340]
I'm like I know he's gonna fumble it

[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.480]
But sure enough he didn't he really had a great game. That's right. Yeah

[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.740]
Well, I don't know about this weekend, but uh, well listen

[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.940]
I think I got a shot let let me say this to you. Okay, because this is my feeling when I left on

[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.260]
Saturday no matter what happens from here on in it's been a phenomenal season

[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.120]
And that's not a disclaimer because I mean buffalo's gonna be tough

[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.920]
They beat us like crazy a couple weeks ago

[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.700]
But the fact is that that game on Saturday was like you know 12 and four would have been nice

[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.660]
But if we would launch the Kansas City there would have been a lot of detractors

[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.660]
But pulling that game out and doing it the way we did it fantastic

[00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.380]
I mean this has been a phenomenal season. There is one negative though. Neil. What's that they didn't cover the spread?

[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.280]
See him

[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.280]
There's a Hank Goldberg man and I knew that I also thought that too people would be saying well they didn't cover the spread

[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:16.220]
Pathetic care exactly a fool and his money are soon parted as you guys found out on Friday. Yeah. Thanks a lot

[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.880]
How'd you end up doing it? We have two we have two open line. I don't discuss that two open lines indeed

[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.680]
751 I stayed for seven weeks. You did one for seven weeks. Yeah, and I had a couple of seconds

[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.560]
I never had a winner and it's just the tough. It's brutal

[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.980]
751 WIOD and data one and brown at five two four the book will be out tomorrow morning by the way at 10 a.m

[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.360]
Numbers will be out

[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.700]
I think we're all gonna slip a little bit thanks to that November

[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.860]
Everything is up on the air based on December if our folks come came through and listen to a lot in December

[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.800]
We're doing great. I do love those spots though much like our brother

[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:59.400]
They are the same as the billboards only animated at your Robbie Stadium where we see WIOD and you see news whether in traffic check mark check marks

[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.720]
And I think it's just amazing that this radio station which is like one of those people's shit

[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.060]
tirely oriented based on personality radio from a new year in the morning through me in midday and you guys in the afternoon and even the sports

[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.020]
personalities and Hank

[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:22.360]
entirely based on those factors and on the dolphins and hurricanes which have nothing to do with the other three

[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.720]
News whether in traffic is the best we can do to promote this radio station and the people who slave their

[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.300]
Their fat asses off to try to bring an audience over here

[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.680]
I think somebody in our news department ought to be a fess up and admit that that isn't the case

[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.640]
No, I can't really can't well. Maybe you can't maybe Chuck Myers honest enough for guy to do it

[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.060]
Okay, because he hasn't he's not part of the old guard here. What did I say guard?

[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.000]
Isn't that the name of that? Yeah, I'm fit because they're gonna come after me with the vengeance

[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.860]
I like I like places where they have a PO box number

[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.160]
That's always a sign of courage

[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.780]
Anyway, we have two open lines in days seven p.o. Box number p.o. Box. Yeah, they're pretty p.o

[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.720]
I don't want to screw the issue

[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.100]
but

[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.840]
Like I said, we have two open lines in date 751

[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.800]
Butch 751 WIO

[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.340]
Can we hear somebody real butch to be on to kind of counter this whole thing

[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.600]
Or she'd rather than the truck

[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.060]
Let's go to bokeh

[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.500]
Hello, no, yes, sir. How you doing? I was first time. Well, I don't know. I'm kind of in between a rock in a

[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.480]
soft place

[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.580]
Yeah, I'm calling

[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.780]
I love your show. Yeah, great show and I read in a Miami Herald something that I thought was pretty unbelievable

[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.100]
They had a phone pole and

[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:56.560]
Turned out at about five out of six people that they they pulled approved not only just didn't have any opinion on but approved of the Miami Hurricanes behavior

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.880]
In the cotton ball. Mm-hmm. Well, what does that tell you that's this town that's this static

[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.980]
That's just the set. Well, I'm not gonna argue about it anymore

[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.600]
I mean, I should you should see the letter. I just threw in a waste basket from a lady no less

[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.840]
Really a hateful rotten nasty letter and then that article by the team

[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.800]
Chaplain that was in the Sun sentennial yesterday. Oh, yeah, that was a racial thing and we don't understand

[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.420]
I mean, I have never heard so many rationalizations. It's a pilot crap and that's all a risk to it

[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:32.120]
When they blame it on the racial thing that just drives me out because anyone if anyone acted that way

[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:39.020]
It's just right no matter what right, but this town we can make anything if it like snowed in the middle of a January

[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.380]
We'd say it had something to do with a

[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.260]
Porto-Rican Cuban Anglo-Black ethnic Jewish thing and about there

[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.380]
Nene's acts and I just couldn't believe that then he said he was embarrassed because the coach is the ultimate control

[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:56.080]
Yeah, well, in other words, he's admitting he had there was a certain group that he had no control over

[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.160]
Well, I mean, did you see that the sugar bowl last year?

[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.580]
But listen, I don't want I don't want to prepare I don't want to continue this. It's like

[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:08.840]
Beating it not only a dead horse, but one that's in a bottle of glue. I mean, it's that far out of the barn already

[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.740]
It's hopeless. All right, you're never going to change these people's minds. Don't confuse them with the truth

[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:19.140]
All right, one more thing I wanted to ask Bill. It's a little late now

[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.280]
But have you ever seen a movie called the cook that sees his wife and her lover?

[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.280]
Do you ever see that bill?

[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.120]
No, no, it's it's kind of like an arties film

[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.960]
It's British film that was

[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.360]
Really really weird, but it's it's very well done

[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.860]
It's a very well and I'll go over pretty well big here then if it's pretty

[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.360]
Great thing. All right. Okay, and I see you by the way, Bill

[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:43.820]
129

[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.180]
What you know what else I like to the game

[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.820]
Those banners I think there were more banner planes than I'd ever seen

[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:57.560]
And it was just great the whole experience was great, but I gotta say so they're flying around have a great time here

[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.700]
Come to this club and come to this club and they're like you know 10 a minute or oh and then following around

[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.220]
Chase played boycott Miami

[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.400]
Did you see that band? I didn't see that didn't you?

[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.640]
Let's create my

[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:15.780]
Huge banners going around come to shooters and come down here and we've got this for you and then little little chase

[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:21.040]
Playing boycott Miami flying around and around you didn't see that no. Oh, man

[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.860]
And I thought I read all of them. I was reading most of my first thing I did when I got out

[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.680]
I went out and boycott it Miami. Yeah

[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.520]
Well, when I leave here. I'm gonna boycott it. I'm going to plantation acres right on

[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.620]
my dress and

[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.280]
Pink flipper

[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.000]
You know really when you stop and think about it that letter is so stupid that it's embarrassing really is

[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.980]
Bodley Harm. There's pretty you know you could understand when ultra right wing fascist and nut balls right letters like that

[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.680]
Well, when somebody who's supposed to be representing an organization defending minorities

[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.160]
Right say hateful letter like that. You know, there's something missing somewhere

[00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:01.100]
Like common sense and a sense of you worry what that was gonna be 130 at W.I.O.D. and the movie

[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:09.580]
Right back. I just saw Marvin walk down the hall. It doesn't need no yet. Who's gonna break the news to Marvin? No, I can't

[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.340]
I really can't come on Henry. You've been around here long time. You can sit him on your knee and tell him what it's all about

[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.900]
Anyway, Patrick Murray wants 35 and let's go to Delray Beach

[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.740]
Hi Neil. Hi

[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:27.000]
First time caller and I'm a nurse now. I write now. Okay. It's regarding that guard letter

[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.620]
Uh

[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:35.960]
Allerian tell said almost verbatim what was read in that letter on a show on Friday between

[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.560]
Well, he milked it for about an hour and a half. What do you mean he said verbatim?

[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:46.280]
Uh almost verbatim. He said someone called and asked him uh, you know if

[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.480]
W.F.T.L. or whatever the station that he's on

[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.320]
Uh, if they're so free and open was he gonna address his sexuality?

[00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:00.080]
And he said, well, I don't feel the need to but there are certain hosts like Neil

[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:07.100]
who wanted to come out with that and uh, he always refers to me in the female gender

[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.040]
Well, let me first of all, let me say this to you when I was at WNWS

[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:19.680]
Al Rantell and I went to a sponsor that's no longer there called the palace restaurant on Sunrise Boulevard in four months

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.240]
Just a minute and I made a joke out of it and from that day on I used to call him Alice at the palace

[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.700]
All right, so anybody can assume they take that anyway they want that was the joke then that is the joke now

[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:36.620]
And if he can't handle it or anybody else can that's their problem, okay? I've been called I have been called Nellie

[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.060]
I've been called Nancy doesn't bother me they can call me anything I want. I'm a big boy. Doesn't bother

[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.500]
They they were they were milking it as much as possible. Yeah, can was you know in the room with them

[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.280]
And I'm surprised no one else is called to be ported to you

[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.960]
Well, basically because probably number one most people are listening to it and number two most people are hearing

[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.880]
It was the only day I tuned in to see what I was up to and

[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:08.460]
He just went on and on that you must be uncomfortable with his sexuality not in the least bit

[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:13.200]
Not in the least bit. I have no problem with it all which is why I've been open and out of the closet for now

[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.680]
What 14 years as of December of 1977 almost 14 years?

[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.660]
I don't have any problem with it

[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:25.200]
And I have a sense of humor about that and about everything else in life because you know life is basically a joke

[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:31.200]
So if you can't laugh at it you got a problem. They were trying to play many psychologists here. Oh, I'm sure they were and

[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:40.580]
saying that well there must be some problem and and and Al said well maybe because he came to terms with his sexuality late in life

[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.560]
That's what he said yeah

[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.920]
and then he's

[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.600]
To draw the right, you know, it's amazing to me that we got a bunch of people over there who are busy

[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.260]
And of course that Steve's specialty is trying to psychoanalyze everybody else

[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.800]
But in the meantime on the other hand telling everybody he's been an analysis all of his adult life right

[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.180]
So you know, it's like the pot calling the kettle beige. It's not right right exactly

[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.200]
But what is I don't understand what that has to do with this letter?

[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:08.960]
Well because

[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.820]
Al kept going on about you know the way you would call people in the female gender with you

[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:23.380]
The name of the organization is gays united to attack repression and discrimination and quite frankly when somebody in my position comes out of the closet and

[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.160]
Stands up to be counted and speaks out against discrimination and repression

[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.660]
And it seems to me that this is like an oxymoron

[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:35.720]
Right, right while he was disdain that it seems like you you know on one hand that

[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:42.520]
You came out of the closet, but on the other hand you put down like you're putting down yourself

[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.000]
Not in the least bit. It's just a joke

[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.800]
It's and of course that you expect it coming from him and some of the other people over there because they have no sense of humor

[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:55.000]
and and and then Steve made him tell some story about the blue lagoon and

[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.480]
Christopher Ackon

[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.380]
I'm talking about now I sure don't what about it?

[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.340]
He out told this story about how you would free frame

[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.840]
this shot of

[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:15.640]
Chris coming down a waterfall and first of let me say this to you okay, but no no wait, let me say this

[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.580]
I joked about that on a year okay

[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.020]
Alarantel has never in his life been in my home

[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.460]
I was in his home maybe once or twice what he lived in rock creek okay

[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:33.920]
Alan I don't socialize I haven't seen him in years and yet the you know the attempt to go on a year and say oh

[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.280]
Hey, listen, I'll be honest with if that's what they want to start because they've got a number of closet people on

[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.440]
The year over there on that station a number of them and if they all want to start playing that kind of game

[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.640]
I'll be delighted okay. I have no problem with that

[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.840]
It just makes me wonder that you know they were trying to say that

[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.260]
You aren't comfortable with your sexuality. Well, I got let's take it right from the horse

[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:59.720]
Take it right from the horse's mouth. I'm as comfortable as anybody could be okay, and I know you're not putting down gay people

[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:05.580]
It's all all in fun. Well, let me just let me put it to you this way consider the source exactly have a great day

[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:12.520]
You two one 40 at W. I. O. D. Although I will say that after you watch that seem for about 45 seconds you realize it's no big deal

[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.820]
I mean you talk about the caught pot calling the kettle pink okay

[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.760]
You want to compare our libraries of movies now?

[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.680]
I'll bring it all I'll bring in every videotape that I have at home and read the

[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.920]
Titles or read what is written on a box because a lot of them are like cub games and horse raising

[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.320]
I'll read them all on the air and you do the same okay

[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.300]
You

[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:42.040]
Unbelievable talk about desperate flailing out for attention. Put you up will you try

[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.520]
Or I'll sick those guys on you so to speak

[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.460]
man

[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.360]
Hollywood

[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.580]
I don't know this is Adam from Merrimar. Yeah, Adam

[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.700]
Keep me hanging on forever. I'm calling along just on the day line

[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:04.120]
Well, how the hell am I supposed to know that in my psychic? Well, I told Marvin. Well Marvin is not I Marvin's busy

[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.100]
And fired we hope I'm just kidding

[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.600]
Well listen there. I'll call you because I'm on the road. Do they tell him yet? No, I can't really can't

[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.020]
Factors out now. I

[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.640]
Went to jail the other week

[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.160]
We're trying to get a fake ID. Yeah, and

[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.760]
Spent the night in jail and I came out and it turns out that they dropped the charges and they're gonna charge me with

[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.680]
Mr. Meena

[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.260]
My license gets suspended for a year. Yeah, and

[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.060]
With the mister me. I don't know if they'll just still suspended or not and I can call in Tallahassee

[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.020]
I'm calling all of the drives lessons bureau

[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.840]
House and nobody knows. Yeah

[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.760]
You don't have any knowledge in that area doing what do I do? I know if your license has been suspended

[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.980]
Well, you know, you're just a knowledge with type of a guy. Yeah, your license is suspended stay home

[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.360]
You believe that I think these people are doing mushrooms. I really do. I think cost for god him first

[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.380]
Did you hear his list

[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.280]
Remlins part two and Dick Tracy

[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.540]
He is he's a I don't know. He's just a silly guy

[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:14.680]
Fort Lauderdale. I got hello. No, how are you okay? Yeah, good. Tell hour and tell not to worry about anything

[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:22.120]
But anyway um and reference the guard here they need to mind our business to worry about things like a

[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.800]
Miramar and stuff like that not bother with you

[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.340]
You've been doing things like that forever. Hello. I'm here. Yeah. You're here

[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:35.340]
worry about things like Miramar. Yeah, yeah, what that norm and is that you and that playing like that that mayor? Oh, yeah

[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:42.440]
And the other thing you were talking about earlier one is pw and two is Cliff O'Neill up in Washington

[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.780]
Right weekly news and this guy used to write for the weekly news

[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.260]
One of the silliest people I've ever encountered in my life

[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:53.140]
And used to hate me like poison and one of the main reasons is because I like Howard Stern in other words

[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.860]
And again these militant people no matter what group it happens to be unless you adhere to their whole

[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.420]
Agenda who you're supposed to hate and what you're supposed to think. I'm not an automaton

[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.920]
I think for myself okay, and nobody tells me what to think or what to say

[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.560]
Hey, no, you've been doing your stick for years, you know, so why does that worry about it now? You know it's about to crap

[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:11.960]
Yeah

[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.360]
And one more thing as far as the Kansas City and by the way, let me also say this to mr

[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.820]
whatever his name was

[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:26.340]
What's his name? I'm a picky picky picky whatever was when we were when we were under tremendous duress an attack here

[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.640]
By certain homophobic elements in the community. I don't recall him coming to our assistance at that

[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:36.580]
Maybe I have a bad memory, but it just somehow slips my mind. Oh, it slips his mind too probably

[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.420]
You know him and Alan Terrell are all both in the same boat there if you ever heard Alan Terrell

[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.080]
He's another lawyer that tries to do all these things

[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.780]
The press people but he's a good he's a good gay rights activist too far community

[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:53.340]
You never know and just one more thing here concerning the Kansas City Chief. Yeah, I gave a daring

[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:59.840]
And Barry were to ride my cab the other night and I doubt their listening because they're probably gone back home

[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.700]
I was sure things are yeah, yeah, I told him so maybe they didn't get a long distance back in Kansas City where they belong

[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.220]
Okay, I have a good date now and the same to you 144 at W. I. O. D

[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.220]
We have an open line of date one and Broward. Let's go to a

[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.380]
Mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hey Neil. Yeah, you as far as I'm concerned

[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:23.200]
Is this only my opinion you just say it right on the head when you said that all these groups I'm talking an array

[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:28.320]
Anyone who feels like there's some kind of a political action group if you don't believe in

[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.040]
100% of their agenda you're on there. You know what?

[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:38.500]
Exactly and these people first of all in mind is only my opinion like I said you

[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:45.580]
Personally are for human rights now human rights. I don't care if you're homosexual

[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.500]
I don't care if you're the elephant man. Everyone has their human rights. I'm not big on

[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:56.280]
Affirmative action groups or the American Civil Liberty Union, but everyone has human rights and

[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.360]
These people have to understand that whether you're homosexual or not and I don't feel like I'm the home of phobics

[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.220]
But you've got certain rights. You don't have more rights than anybody else

[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:12.940]
And for you the voice you're opinion on the air is your opinion and that's the way it is and if these people don't like it change the channel

[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.340]
Yeah

[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:19.800]
You know, but I just feel like you really hit it on the head with that last call while I'm sick and tired of the in this community seems to

[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.360]
Specializing all of these different individuals and groups who think they have some godgiven right that they're going to tell you

[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.180]
What to say when to say it what you can think what you can write what you can read what you can watch

[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.780]
It's a pilot crap. There's a Jerry fall well in the world and worse

[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:40.020]
Now did you get that letter like it won a concert? Did you have it before you start? I just start opening up the mail

[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.800]
Oh, cuz I was gonna say I can't believe that you had that letter for a few days of that on it without

[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:45.920]
exploding

[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:52.760]
Well, I didn't sit on it. Well although I might sit on a little later when I put my skirt on but I didn't sit on it

[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.980]
Anyway, but I mean the lunacy of somebody trying to connect teenagers committing suicide because they're gay

[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:04.020]
With the jokes that I make on the air. I mean, that's just really reaching just a little bit

[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.200]
No, we all know it's your fault. Of course. Yeah, of course just just like the people who made drown in the

[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.980]
Wherever they are because somebody's listening to the show on a boat. Right?

[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.020]
Have a great life. Thank you

[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.200]
146 at WIOD and our hysterical south Florida community where it's never

[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.100]
I thought today man the day after that victory on Saturday

[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.860]
I thought this is gonna be one of the greatest days in history of the human race

[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.900]
I came into this godforsaken radio station and within 30 seconds

[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.820]
I wanted to blow my brains out and then cost for it came in here

[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.820]
We had a good time with Bill

[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:38.780]
But he also seemed like he was on the wild side today like he was on a moon the moon man

[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.680]
And then I started opening up the mail

[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.600]
But the good news is up for Camilo's house now

[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.860]
107,000 we got another couple of barriers crossed today

[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.340]
107,000 141 dollars and that's not cheesecake. Okay, we'll be right back

[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:59.880]
Failed people and ratoes 149 at WIOD a mobile in Miami. Hey, how you doing Neil? Okay. I was thinking about your letter

[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.100]
You know what it is it's jealousy

[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.240]
You have in Wayne Arnold's which I just came from about half hour ago

[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.160]
Hey

[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.040]
Pictures of yourself up on the wall and how many did he have done?

[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.820]
Got a herd, you know, I'm saying

[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.280]
Who is that the guy to send to the letter from guard? Oh Charlie peak

[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:22.860]
He doesn't even his name is anymore written on the outside but a bathroom. Yeah, that's true. And you have a picture? Well, maybe we could do change that

[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.980]
But yeah, you know we could like maybe every one of your listeners go into one restroom

[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.620]
You know, let's let's not let's not and say we did okay? Okay. Okay. Is that way you won't get in trouble

[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.260]
We know that you want us to do it. No, we don't I

[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.500]
Can't get you in a little bit of trouble here. No. No. Well, I tried have a great life sir

[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:51.820]
150 at WIOD Miami. Hello. Yeah, this is Sammy. You guys didn't bash me this week. Okay, Sammy have a nice life, baby

[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.140]
West Palm Beach

[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.500]
Who Alan? Yeah, Alan

[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:05.820]
unusual

[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:14.160]
I wanted to keep you calling. I'm sending you a mail today. How come you're like whispering Alan? Is there some special reason?

[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.700]
Are they monitoring your phone? Let me see if the phone

[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.680]
Does that sound any better? No, okay. Sorry about that

[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.620]
Um, what is the market's I'm 30 and a half points. What is it Alan?

[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.460]
Two pieces of mail on a guard father. Okay

[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.640]
One is an article regarding

[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:37.280]
And it'll leave me one open up the case regarding 1978 when it both was killed after 33 days in office, right?

[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.000]
That all the interest is renewed based on a new grad father's three moves good

[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.260]
That was interesting. I'll maybe that'll get a head next to half a star from concert

[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:49.400]
That's right and the second thing is I'm sending you a magazine entertainment weekly out unless you get to

[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.940]
Highwood type magazine

[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:57.860]
Six-page story on Al Pacino and the grad father's great. But you might like that. Thanks. Oh, okay. Bye. Bye. Bye

[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:04.580]
West with just a West Palm Beach Hollywood. Yeah, I want to congratulate you on the total on Camille's house

[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.820]
Thank you, and I'm proud to say I'm part of that total

[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.860]
But I wanted to say something about the game this weekend

[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.860]
Good game, but that referee should have kept a flag in his pocket. Come on. That wasn't holding

[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:23.760]
Let's go to Miramar. Hello. How you doing? Okay, you know don't let those guys get you

[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.960]
You know you're doing them a favor

[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.400]
Even talking about the damn letter. Let them go to hell don't give them any publicity

[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.220]
No, I I'm not giving them any publicity, but I think that when people try to

[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:37.520]
Intimidate people I think that they should be exposed for what they're trying to do because a lot of these groups

[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.240]
We're out around trying to pass themselves off as being great guardians of minorities and guardians of people's rights

[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.000]
And all they're really trying to do is uh is take away people's rights

[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.720]
Well, yeah, that's true, but you give it a big time. They don't like my sense of humor. It's too bad, okay? Yeah, forget them. Listen to uh

[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.520]
The rugby the rugby players had a bumper sticker that was really neat

[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.140]
And now I think it applies to the Miami dolphins

[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.320]
It said that uh

[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:07.800]
Rugby players have leather balls and I've got more respect with Miami dolphins that I've had and many many many years

[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.680]
I'm gonna go get

[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.760]
My season tickets like you did good for you because they just demonstrated they don't care

[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.460]
About dirty in the uniforms. They're caught there. They're contracts with everything. They're out there

[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:26.180]
Bangin heads and it's a pleasure pleasure to hear them and see them or whatever and the fact that there is ever an empty seat in that stadium is really

[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:32.380]
It's a commentary on this community. It sure is hell isn't a comment on it on that team or on the coach. Hey one other thing

[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.800]
When you're not on the air or whatever I'd ride the over at 2 a.m

[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:41.120]
I listen to once in a while. He's gonna play a song fight for him on about seven pretty little angelized

[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.960]
He says that betcha favorite song. Yeah, but I like listening to it when I can hear it

[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.520]
You know, and that's on a.m. And it's like

[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.860]
I get a little nervous

[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:56.120]
But tell him I appreciate the sentiment have a good look. Okay 153 at W.I.O.D. Boys strange assortment this hour. Let's go to Kendall

[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.720]
Yeah, hi my name's Ty on the first time caller. Hi Ty how are you?

[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.740]
I've got working on a new alignment here for the for the dolphins. Maybe we can get a sellout

[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.720]
Maybe maybe you can give me some points here

[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.820]
I'm gonna I've worked on a line here and this is this is neat. I got Dwight Lawler Daily on it fullback

[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.260]
Tom Randall at halfback

[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.080]
Huh? Campbell Marshall. Why now

[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:29.480]
Let's go to the mobile in West Palm Beach. Hi Neil. You talking so much for what you're gonna make when he'll angry. Uh-huh

[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.300]
Please don't talk so much for okay. Put you up will you sir?

[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.560]
Davie

[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.840]
Hi Neil. Yes. I was at that game on Saturday

[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:43.100]
I tell you the response we're getting about at this hour on a scale of zero

[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.820]
But what I guess to be expected in this time. I know um I just couldn't contain myself

[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:52.020]
I had to call you. I know we're gonna whip off from the rear. I mean after that incredible win

[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:57.440]
All these calls we got after the hurricanes embarrassed but all these people arguing and denying and screaming about it

[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.580]
We could have we could have gone on with a marathon and had three days solid without an empty line

[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:06.180]
And here we have this incredible victory and just an unbelievable experience on Saturday

[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.400]
And I'm listening to a mishmash of puke on the phone

[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:09.940]
Yeah

[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.980]
Okay, we're going to the Super Bowl. Well, I don't know if we are I don't know if we are or not

[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:20.320]
But regardless of what happens from here on in they are just incredible. It's incredible. Thank you honey

[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:20.920]
Okay

[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.920]
They deserve a lot better than this town. I'll tell you that in fact

[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.700]
I think there are more people than just the dolphins who deserve better, but that's just my own opinion

[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.560]
155 at WIOD

[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.000]
What is that mobile is that a new one?

[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:35.800]
Hello

[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:38.260]
Hello

[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.640]
Yeah

[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.340]
Okay, one word of that was another good cellular phone one word you noticed and it just blasted off the face of the map

[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.240]
Get a new phone pal. Well, yeah, butchup bokeh

[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.120]
Okay

Davy good afternoon. Yeah, sir. How you doing? How's boys? You cut the Roseanne bar special HBO?

[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:05.100]
No, I'm somehow managed to miss that. Oh boy. You oh is unbelievable. It was so much

[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:09.940]
I shouldn't have been called to Tom Irons special because he was on more times than she was. Yeah every 20 minutes he came out

[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:15.020]
Why were you watching? Well, I can see how bad it was. I wanted to see the phone in the uh

[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.920]
I guess across the US

[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.240]
Phone in to say how nice she was. Yeah, not one negative call. It was be bad. I tried to do my bit

[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.780]
But I guess it was green couldn't have been screen cut it. I don't think so. I was funny

[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:33.840]
That's where the president the Salt Lake City chapter of a fan club called in. I just have that's what they got true

[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.520]
Which pretty weird anyway, I'd like to say um Quacho and uh

[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.220]
Thanks for the commonsense. Okay

[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:46.440]
Wow this hour. Where's concert when we need him, huh? Or is he responsible for this? Thanks a lot Bill

[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:47.980]
mobile

[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:56.300]
Boy oh boy oh boy mobile on the songgrass. Yeah, how are you doing? Uh good question

[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:03.300]
This is my first call I've been listening to you for years and years even when I moved out of town and I'm a risk and fan

[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:08.440]
And I've been a season ticket up hold her up there and last year I moved back down here and got my dolphin tickets

[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:14.520]
So I'm uh, I'm I believe you what I like to watch football live is something about it

[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.260]
one of the problems with uh

[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.920]
Joe Robby when I first got there it seemed like they couldn't get the stadium to rock at all

[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.140]
Okay, they got this temporary bleachers and it gets loud and now it seems like people are

[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.420]
Are banging on the season for them and it's really starting to rock and it's uh it was a great game this week

[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:36.800]
Yeah, they finally woke up. Yeah somebody finally gave him the wake up call. I'm glad and uh by the way I love your show

[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.260]
I left my lap every day when I'm driving around and uh it's good talking to you. Thanks a lot

[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:46.120]
Okay, well we had one or two real people to shower not too many 157 at W I O D

[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.620]
You got Miami on there, but they line-in even lit Hollywood

[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.020]
Hello Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. I am I'm a first time caller

[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.520]
I've been listening to you show for a couple months now from the York and I got to say your 10 times

[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.340]
Better than how it's turned number one. Well, I want 10 times his paycheck. How's that?

[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.360]
So okay, I can understand that. I want to just take one times his paycheck

[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:12.460]
One time, huh? Let me uh ask you something. Uh you seem to go out for a part three obviously right twice

[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.980]
All right twice now I seen it uh

[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.840]
Offering when it open Christmas and

[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:24.040]
I think the ending of the movie the very end was one of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen

[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.320]
Do you agree with that? No, why is that

[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.760]
Because uh, you know his daughter gets

[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.760]
You know at the opera. I don't want to give the movie away. Yeah, but uh at the very end

[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:43.020]
I mean he's just sitting I guess it's in Corleone, Sicily. Yeah years later. Yeah. I mean years later

[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:47.120]
He looks like he's 90 years old. Yeah, and he just kills over

[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:53.180]
I mean and that's how they ended a movie that just does not make any sense. Do you think there's gonna be a part four? Oh, yeah

[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.160]
I sure hope so with Andy Garcia's godfather

[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.220]
Well, yeah, I know he took over the family and everything but

[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.100]
They just had Michael call the old left man. He's gone. He's out of it now

[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:10.060]
Now we got somebody who's still alive and uh maybe Michael can be the uh south Florida godfather like for century village

[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.140]
For century village

[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.840]
Okay, in other words, uh he may be dead

[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.560]
But like a lot of the people in south Florida who also have been dead for 10 15 20 years

[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.220]
He can like be the head of their family

[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.980]
Anyway, have a great day and god only needs uh knows you need to dry out a lot of you

[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.400]
It's just been unbelievable today

[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.320]
We got Rick and pod coming along after the news at two this evening

[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.460]
We have what ought to be a massive celebration on sports talk at 605. Good over their night at bootles

[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.760]
Mr Weaver will be there. Mr Zagaki

[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.540]
Mark Dennis of the dolphins will be there. It should be incredible and Hank Goldberg coming up

[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.120]
Do we know who Hank's guest is gonna be? Do we know anything today?

[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.140]
Boy you talk you want to think that yesterday was New Year's Day or something wouldn't you?

[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:54.640]
Talk about I hate to break the news to all the folks around here burn radio land the holidays are over

[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.100]
I know it's difficult to face

[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.540]
It's been exciting. It's been great

[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:03.140]
But time to face the cruel harsh world again come back to work get your act together

[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.880]
Is this a little slower or something would you agree? This is a little bit

[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.160]
I think by like the 15th of July these people are finally gonna wait

[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.800]
1991 maybe we better get back in the office and get to work right

[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.860]
Have a great life the book comes out tomorrow. We'll see you tomorrow morning at 10 here on 610

[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.380]

[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.200]
Hey
