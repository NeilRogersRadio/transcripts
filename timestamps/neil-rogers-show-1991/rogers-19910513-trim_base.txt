[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940]
and William Schadener gets up there and he says get a life.

[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.020]
Oh, I don't know what made me say that. I just been mean. I wanted to say it for a long time. Okay, and I'm glad I said it.

[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.020]
I'm glad it's out. I would have played some of the highlights from the Cubs game last night. However,

[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.740]
that lady was right. It's amazing how timely this show becomes. Remember the woman that was talking the other day.

[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.040]
I said, if you want to see the guiding light and tape it just start the tape now,

[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.720]
when you leave the house at one o'clock and just let it roll and she said well if the power goes off the

[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.920]
VCR is going to cut off and I said no, no, they've all got a thing on them. Well, I've never had this

[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.040]
happen before but I sure wasn't going to sit there and watch the game. I couldn't handle it. And so I started it

[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.660]
and much much later I come back and at the end of the third inning is when the tape stop the power

[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.580]
went out all my clocks are like you know the clock on the microwave is blinking. Yeah, so I don't have it.

[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.460]
And what a shame because we had two dramatic hormones including the game winner by Dawson and the

[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.360]
eighth inning. And Dave Smith came on and got his ninth save. We had a big come from behind. I

[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.140]
tell you one thing if the Cubs didn't win that one last night we'd be in big trouble. It'd be all

[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.200]
over. I'm not saying that it's great but for if we'd have been three games under 500 it would have

[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.660]
been history. Adios, Sarriva Dirich. Who's that on the star line in Miami? Right here. Yes sir.

[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:28.780]
I'm Neil. Long long long time. Well thank goodness for people like you sir that can't find

[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.460]
anything better to do. Yeah, the only real thing on top radio today. The only thing period in the world

[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.420]
is right here between ten and two and to these people here appreciate it. No. No. Not at all.

[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.780]
Markets up two points now. Oh that's wonderful. That's exciting. It's up two health points.

[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.040]
I don't want people to panic. Oh my god. I'm falling.

[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.580]
But we're in a depression. There are nobody wants to fess up to it.

[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.700]
If the one the main reason that I called you is I'm on the palmetto going south. Yeah.

[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.540]
This is really constructive criticism of what on the traffic reports. Now they gave a report just

[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.160]
as I'm going by a hundred and third street. There was an accident going south on a hundred and

[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.140]
third street. And you believed it? Oh man. And you've been listening a long time and you believe

[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.740]
those who saw? Oh man. I believe sky king before I believe sky one two and three.

[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.720]
In fact, I believe the sky is falling before I believe those guys. Listen what do you think of a

[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.740]
guy that goes to Vegas? When's good money? Yeah. And doesn't bring anything back for his friends.

[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.780]
I think he's a douchebag. Hang by the way. I saw Hank. Listen, I saw Hank Goldberg coming up the

[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.560]
stairs this morning and Hank was wandering on his way out with a good big smile on his face.

[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.880]
He's on his way of the West Coast again to Vegas again. Is that right? Man, is more money than God?

[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.400]
Well, he's what I got to do because I'm turning off. But on behalf of my friend Kevin and central press,

[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.940]
I want to call Bob a genuine douchebag. Okay. And I'm sure they're listening to me. And don't

[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.260]
listen to that Joe Brennan again. So he makes it up. He's got three by five cards. He just pulls one

[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.560]
out. That's his slogan over there. Winning down. Pull it out. Come to think of it around 10 o'clock. He's smart.

[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.000]
And there is an accident. I have a fifth streak. That's right. Better start shuffling those cards. A

[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.860]
little better Joe. Good luck to you, pal. All right. See you. So 11 after 10 at WIOD. Also, I got to

[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.060]
pick my Huskos. I heard Phil Saltsman calling yesterday with Chuck Meyer. Who is that guest? By the way.

[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.160]
Oh, man. Chuck is great. And the audience is sucking up to him real good. But I got to tell you that

[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.040]
I'm not into guests. I'd say 90 times out of 100. When I hear a guest on any talk show, I shut it

[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.180]
off because them. Oh, who was that guy? What were they talking about? The intellectual snob. Oh, the

[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:57.700]
intellectual snob. Oh, God. Man, give me a break. Will you? And I heard Phil Saltsman calling

[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.140]
something about his daughter and going to school or some stupid thing like that. Probably with

[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.460]
the racing form. Phil's daughter reads the racing form in school and probably anyway, let's you.

[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.760]
Who am I going to pick today? I'm going to pick. I'm sticking with Katie Swini. I don't want to

[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.500]
snub all the rest of my friends over there, both of them at Calder, but I'm sticking until she wins

[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.800]
one for me. I'm going to stick with her just an admiral with Katie Swini in the first race. How's

[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:31.400]
that sound? Phil? You got it? Just an admiral in the first race. Wheel it, box it, and puke your lungs

[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.000]
out on it. You're not going to go away now, are you? No. Of course not. Okay. And isn't this interesting?

[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.200]
I don't have to get up real early tomorrow morning and watch not slaying. I know. Isn't that something?

[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.240]
It's so bad. Thank God. I got to be in the top 10 this week. Was it really? Yeah. Woo.

[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.420]
Well, two bad rides you got out of here before we knew that. I'll be sure and tell them to

[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.320]
them. Hold on a second now. It's 12 minutes past 10 to WIOD. If you're a salesman, you know what you

[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.660]
are. And if you're out there on the road every day, if you're self-pharmaceutical, surgical supplies,

[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.480]
you just play. I'll come on Tom. Look what he puts in here. A plain old asshole salesperson. Tom,

[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.960]
can't you do something a little more classy than that? Here's a great idea to make your customers

[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.820]
happy. Have a great lunch delivered to them from the pizza loft. How do you like that? That Jeff

[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.980]
Boy, he's on top of it. The loft delivers anywhere in Dave County and they can put together a delicious

[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.640]
lunch for the whole orifice for as little as $4 a person. I was saying orifice yesterday and that

[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.120]
guy from England was just flipping out. He was going nuts. He was having a bloody fit. Just give

[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.200]
Jeff one, a Jeff one day's notice and he'll take care of it all. And of course, we all know that

[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.500]
the pizza loft is home of the world's best pizza and those delicious Italian specialties that you

[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.680]
just want to shovel down your face with a shoehorn, mouthwatering lasagna, stuffed shells,

[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.160]
maticotti, baked ziti, eggplant, parmesan. It's incredible. And you can enjoy your meal in their

[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.640]
new expanded dining room, including the neo-rodgers dining room. I tell you know when you've made it,

[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.400]
when you have a dining room and then after you with the pizza loft, that's prestige. Or you can

[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.960]
take it home or have it delivered. You can even pay for it with your credit card on delivery.

[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.660]
And if you see our friend Jeff, by the way, tell him his pointy tail is delicious. He looks like a

[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.560]
burnout 60s reject, but do say hi to all our waiter friends up there too. Okay, the pizza loft

[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.520]
upstairs at 69th and Flagler in Miami, just east of the Palmetto, you can't beat the food. And of

[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:23.380]
course, the price is always right too. 266, 51 11 is that number 266, 511 for the pizza loft.

[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.600]
Okay, so it was not Phil Saltsman who called yesterday, but I just told him I said,

[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.100]
somebody out there's got your voice down Pat. In fact, somebody's probably making race calls

[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.560]
in her house right now. How come this thing is so distorted this morning? Can you hear it?

[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.720]
I hear it. Like, hollow, isn't it? Hold on a second. Is that better?

[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.620]
Is that, I don't know, sounds a little better. It does? Sounds the same to me. It's awful loud.

[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.120]
I like it loud though. Some like it loud, some like it's soft.

[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.440]
Yeah. I'm sticking with just an admiral. Phil said the horse has been away for over a year

[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.220]
and has no chance. I'm sticking with Katie Swini with her without her bug, okay?

[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.320]
Does that bugs me when people try to count me off my horses? Phil, are you were saying what?

[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.720]
Me? Yeah, I'm talking to you. Oh, man, I watch the Cubs ski. Let me ask you something.

[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.820]
How come when I go into these little side issues? Are you talking to me?

[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.520]
You're talking to me? Of course, I'm talking to you. Oh, well. And I'm really delighted that

[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.040]
you call so you can aggravate those people out there who hate you like poison.

[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.000]
That's right. Now they can hate me more because I want to tell you I was telling George

[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.420]
before the show that you talk, call an audience again to be differentiated from the listening

[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.720]
audience who are the more normal people and never call radio shows. Those people are such

[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.440]
butt kisses. You know, when you come into it, like when I've moved around from one station to

[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.700]
another, the first several weeks is like a honeymoon period. And man, you can't buy an open line.

[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:46.200]
The phones are dripping up and man, it just oh, God, we're just so excited to talk to you.

[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.520]
And then after a while, the bloom is off the rose. You see here pumping those numbers. Now we don't

[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.980]
want to talk to you. And then it's Rick and Suds. I got all excited about it. And then we don't

[00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.360]
want to talk to them. And now I notice Chuck yesterday, man, if he ever had one line open at one time,

[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.000]
it was a miracle. I mean, the phones were just sizzling. Everybody and they're just all sucking

[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.800]
around like, you know, one guy he has Chuck, he said, what was your first car? You know, Chuck's

[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:18.000]
is a 63 Volkswagen Beetle. And the guy says, oh, yeah, great car. Great car. I don't want to go

[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.420]
into the thing. I'm not even going to go into it. Go ahead. No, the kids that got killed in one

[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:28.060]
in the Sturgis Michigan car going 30 miles an hour, hit them head on and a car folded up like

[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.580]
in a courtier and they were killed instantly. But anyway, that's depressing. We don't want to go

[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:38.580]
into that. Great car. He would have said, oh, 58, that's a great car, Chuck. People are such

[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.900]
blood kissers. You know what? They really are. I just can't deal with it.

[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.880]
Did you watch with the Cayman? No, I just, I told you that I did not. I went out. I couldn't handle it.

[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.780]
I just, and thank goodness I didn't watch it because it was a great game. But the first six and a half

[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.620]
fittings, they're losing four to one. And it was another combatoast performance. And I would have just,

[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:05.060]
you know, I would have gone nuts. Yes, they did. Thank goodness. You know, there's still a little

[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.220]
hope left there, but I don't know how much. Our friend Mark Gray said a thousand less.

[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.020]
No, he was three for four. He brought bounce out of the bases loaded. I heard about that.

[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.460]
Oh, that's right. At the very end of the bases loaded up. But Tico Walker had a two run

[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.800]
home, or then of course the hawk comes through and hits the game, winning home, or in the

[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.660]
bottom of the eighth inning and Ashenmocker wins a game and Dave Smith gets another save.

[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.400]
It was a good game. We pulled it out of our thing. I'll tell you that. We were excited.

[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.600]
We needed that game big time. I'll tell you if we lose that one, it's history.

[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.620]
I need to ask you why did they call Andre Duff and the hawk?

[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.960]
Well, there are a lot of lines I could use for that. I don't really know. I have no idea why,

[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.560]
just a nickname. Okay, I have another question because I'm like a new baseball fan. Yes, ma'am.

[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:51.940]
Okay, last night there was a runner. He, well, got hit the ball. Yeah. There was a runner on

[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:57.400]
third base. This phone is making like sounds. Yeah. Okay, the runner on third base score, but that's

[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.340]
the side point. The guy hit the ball. He ran the first. He rounded to go to second.

[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.980]
In the meantime, the fielder threw a two-rind. He caught the ball. The guy like gave up.

[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.240]
Is that like a rule that? What? Yeah, he just left. You're never going to replace Harry

[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.880]
Kerry. I'll tell you that with a scindulating play by play. Oh, I knew. It was a runner where?

[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.560]
Okay, the batter hit the ball. Oh, I don't even say it again. The markets have seven points almost.

[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.220]
Why did the runner give up without trying to make it the second? I don't know. You're not describing

[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.700]
what did he catch it in the air? Yeah, no. Okay, the fielder caught the ball. Yeah.

[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.620]
The outfield. And the best fielder is with the Tigers, not with the Cubs.

[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.180]
So the runner thought he had a chance to go to second. So he rounded first and started to go to

[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:47.600]
second base. And the middle one. Well, runner, the guy with the ball. The guy who hit the ball. Yeah.

[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.860]
Okay. And then the fielder threw the ball to Ryan. He caught the ball first before the runner got

[00:10:53.860 --> 00:11:01.020]
the second base. Why? He caught it from the fielder. Yeah. And where was the runner

[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.320]
way to cut the ball? The runner was between first and second. Well, he probably had him nailed.

[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.920]
He probably made it to what? They were trying to get another runner off base on the play.

[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.620]
Is that it? They were trying to get him from going to second. Well, somebody else will call

[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.260]
and describe it a little bit more articulately than you did. I'm sorry.

[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.180]
Sik-to-Nots landing, kid. Okay. Well, I love the Cubs and that's... Well, isn't that something?

[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.700]
The Braves are ugly. They are not ugly. Dave Justice is not ugly. I just

[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.980]
Oh, just this. Okay. It's a brought-deal Murphy back. And Tom Glavin's not ugly. There's some ugly

[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.460]
guys on that team. Well, we got a lot ugly guys too. Hey, listen, it's not who's got the best-looking

[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.760]
team. It's whatever team you like. I mean, it just happens to be a coincidence. The Cubs have

[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:44.940]
a few guys who are not too bad. Michael Eckie and Mark Grace. Yeah, Mark Grace.

[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:51.660]
And Ryan Sandberg and Sean Bosky and a few others. A few others. Yeah. Well, they keep us watching.

[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.180]
We got a lot of real ugly guys on our team. But we ignore the guys.

[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.780]
No, we don't ignore the guys. They're all our Cubs. That's just as Louis Salazar is ugly.

[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.500]
We don't mean we don't want them to know him run. And what about the Hawk?

[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.520]
The Hawk has seen better days, but he's a great player. He's great. I mean, you think,

[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.440]
I, oh, geez, come on, get with it. Okay. Pretty soon you'll be a Bruins fan too.

[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.940]
You should salivate over done, swinging. See, hockey players wear too much equipment.

[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.020]
There's not a lot of stimulation watching a hockey game. Okay, they're wearing like 45 pounds

[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.600]
of padding and equipment. Right, baseball's so easy because they give you those nice close-ups.

[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.900]
That's right. And they're all scratching. Well, listen, have a great day and we'll fight out for you

[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.980]
what the Rhino's holding. Okay, I'm sure you will. I'll see you.

[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.300]
22 after 10. What the hell is he talking about? We have an open line in Broward.

[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.020]
I, my first car was a 60-core VAR. The next caller when we take it.

[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:49.120]
I want you to call me and tell me great car, Neil. Great car. You know, the one where the

[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:55.720]
fan belt kept breaking every 20 miles. Great car. What a bunch of butt-sucking fools this world

[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.260]
is composed of. You know what? Anyway, if you don't have anything special planned for this weekend,

[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.420]
and probably you don't because this is a very deadly time of the year and a usually deadly town,

[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.640]
come on out to the Cutler Ridge Mall at Mervins because they're having a big job fair from 10 to 7,

[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.840]
taking job applications for sales stock and orifice work. And if you want to make a few good bucks,

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.720]
work for some good people, check it out. I'll be there from noon to three, signing of those ugly new

[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:26.340]
pictures and we'll be giving away sports fan bags, drawing for some neat prizes. And I'll be okay.

[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.340]
Okay, and the Cutler Ridge Mall. So all you people in South-Aid have been saying,

[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.140]
when you're coming down here? Saturday, noon to three. No retail experiences necessary,

[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.140]
but be sure to bring your prior job history. Couple of business references like George and the

[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:44.200]
Manny and... don't bring Marvin. Come on down the Cutler Ridge Mall. This Saturday, 10 to 7,

[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.320]
I'll be there from noon to three. We'll be called in and make him fun of Meg on the air and

[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.000]
doing some neat stuff at the Cutler Ridge Mall.

[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.820]
The evidence is in. Smoking marijuana affects your brain, causing severe memory loss.

[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.680]
Just listen to this actual recording of a celebrated parhead.

[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:11.420]
Your turn, me, Nancy. Who knew then that this innocent experiment would lead to goofy opinions,

[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.280]
belief in astrology, and yes, serious memory difficulties.

[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]
Mr. President, you know anything about the Iran-Cutler weapon sale?

[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:28.680]
Well, I just don't remember. Do you know who was your secretary of state at the time?

[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.080]
Well, I don't recall offhand. How could I buy a vowel?

[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:39.640]
So stay away from marijuana, hot weed. And if you actually do try this stuff and someone

[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:45.440]
like a biographer asks you if it's true, just say no. Dice rules banned.

[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.300]
Lois Theatre's chain is boycotted. Dice rules, the Andrew Dice claked concert film,

[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:56.400]
Opening Friday. One of Lois Film Buyers found the movie to be on a non-stop basis,

[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.680]
odious, repulsive, and repugnant to women.

[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:08.400]
Lois Chairman, A. Allen Friedberg says Lois owns 200 theater complexes with 866 screens in 16 states.

[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.500]
It makes decisions on NC 17 movies as this one is rated on a movie by movie basis so the

[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:20.940]
Dice Man with Lois is out. Big deal. He's not a movie guy. That other movie he made was a gigantic

[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:26.500]
bomb. These guys just don't understand. He's strictly a stand-up comic big mouth, whatever he is,

[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:32.040]
sleaze bag. Just like Howard Stern, radio guy, not a TV guy. They don't understand that down here

[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.740]
because there are a bunch of Yahoo's and they don't hear his radio show, Off-Won TV Howard.

[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.620]
Carl Gables. Neil, how you doing this morning?

[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:44.960]
Okay. I wanted to ask you, who are the creative minds behind these little side shows that you have?

[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.880]
You know, the King of America? Do you know where Arcadia is?

[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.540]
Yeah. Mental institution? That's where they're done.

[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.000]
No, who are the people that produced them for you?

[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.780]
Produce why? You know, the Ronald Reagan bit. You just...

[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.820]
That was from American Comedy Network, sir.

[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.040]
Oh, you buy these on?

[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.660]
Yes, sir. Some of them and some of them just fall in the door and some are done by Mitch Lewis

[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.240]
and some are done by listeners and some we steal from Arc Comedy Network from American Suds

[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.360]
and they're from all over the place. We got billions of cards here, sir.

[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.640]
Because we're desperate for material.

[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.700]
Simple questions.

[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.720]
These people in the audience, they have no material, so we have to come up with our own.

[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.720]
All right, well, let me give you that. I have no life.

[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.220]
Right. Here's the guy that I know you have a special place in your heart for Larry King.

[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.160]
Last night. Did you see him? I know, I don't know.

[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.340]
No, I did not. No.

[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.400]
He had on Ted Turner.

[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.760]
Yeah. Oh, boy. Talk about a butt-sucking marathon almost to them.

[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.360]
God, I believe me. Larry King's nose is so far up his butt that I think they would need a vacuum.

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.240]
They probably had to bring in some of the excavator to get it out.

[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.660]
It was phenomenal.

[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.080]
And the best question he asked was like, he started talking about Turner's material wealth

[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.460]
and then he goes, he goes, why would a man like you care about the environment?

[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.620]
Why would you care about fish?

[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.660]
I... I...

[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.360]
I'm going to go out of my chair.

[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.160]
I want to tell you something. I am so tired of guests.

[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.600]
And I'm going to tell you another guest who shows up on Rick and Suds all the time.

[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.600]
As long as they're not here to defend themselves who makes me nauseous

[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.080]
and he doesn't even come in here. Thank God he's on the phone all the time.

[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.180]
Is that moonscope guy?

[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.000]
Oh, you mad.

[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.520]
He is terminally self-promoting boar.

[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.960]
God, give it a rest.

[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.540]
He's as boring as watching milk curdled.

[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.100]
Hey, I think Rick and Suds party with him on the weekend.

[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:19.820]
I think so.

[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.620]
Because with that guy pull stuff out of God only knows.

[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.460]
Yeah, I know where it's coming out of. Believe me.

[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.400]
And one more question.

[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.180]
Same place where Larry King's nose is.

[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:30.820]
Huh?

[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.320]
Who do you think about...

[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.780]
Who do you think is going to win the cup this year?

[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.940]
North Star is all the way sir in a big upset.

[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.920]
I'm so tired of hearing Chuck Meyer and all those Pittsburgh fans

[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.280]
that make me nauseous, okay?

[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.640]
I want the North Star to kick some butt.

[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.440]
That's part of the bunch of goons though.

[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:45.820]
Yeah.

[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.680]
They can...

[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.900]
They can have a cup...

[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.280]
So what the...

[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:48.960]
The way they...

[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.460]
I mean, they're...

[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.660]
Hey listen, nobody...

[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:55.280]
Did anybody believe that the North Star could even stay on the same ice with the black cocks

[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.360]
and a blue-in-the-way sir?

[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.760]
But the way they handled...

[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.820]
And the same with St. Louis.

[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:01.360]
Who could...

[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.140]
Who could have...

[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.940]
Thunkett is Jeff who can't see...

[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.740]
There are few things saying in the world that make the hair stand up on the back of my neck.

[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:08.940]
Who to Thunkett?

[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.700]
That's one of them.

[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.820]
When somebody says that I know there are real Yahoo.

[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.720]
And Jeff can't see the forest for the trees so that on Sunday on this station

[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.640]
they were embarrassed and we want to apologize for.

[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.300]
Who to Thunkett?

[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.340]
Oh Jeff.

[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.120]
Butch up with those clichés.

[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.480]
Will ya?

[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.120]
All these jocks knifers man, they make me sick.

[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.040]
But one more question of how you part-style the giant is.

[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.380]
Yeah that's it. He's saying goodbye.

[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.300]
Goes out on top. He knows when to quit.

[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.480]
I like that. I like a guy.

[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.900]
You know, he's got no more to accomplish.

[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.180]
He's going to go up into booth and probably add 20 years to his life.

[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:37.840]
True.

[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.940]
Because he's a real hysterical guy, you know.

[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:40.860]
He's a great coach.

[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.780]
I didn't say that but he's a real hysterical emotional guy.

[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.220]
Now he can go up there and get the big bucks and just relax,

[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.020]
and tell everybody else how to do it.

[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.180]
Criticize all the other coaches.

[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:50.960]
All right Neil, have a good day.

[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.460]
That's what Walsh is doing.

[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.520]
Those are going to come back from the day.

[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.260]
I hope not.

[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.340]
Have a great life.

[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:56.680]
Bye-bye.

[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.160]
It's 1031 at WIOD.

[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.660]
We here in Miami are not too fine to build Walsh anymore.

[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.300]
Okay, because he thinks the dolphin suck and he just pretends

[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.020]
on one side and we just hate his ass.

[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.300]
Other than that he's a good coach.

[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.660]
We have two upper lines.

[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.440]
You're both in Dade County 751 WIOD.

[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.580]
Our question of the day is,

[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.980]
are there any straight British men?

[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.720]
That guy who was in here yesterday, I'm going to tell you.

[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.380]
If we didn't have his feet tied down with cement,

[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.120]
you know when they bring those party baskets in

[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.880]
and a balloon start floating around on the ceiling,

[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.840]
I am going to tell you.

[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.180]
I thought he was going to float away.

[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.940]
For just a second or two, the news department came in,

[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.240]
thought the Hindenburg was back.

[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.140]
It was incredible.

[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.580]
What is that all about?

[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.640]
I mean, stop and think of the famous British entertainers

[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.500]
like Anuel Coward and Rex Harrison.

[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.740]
Talk about tiptoeing through the tulips.

[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.940]
Talk about Fey Wain.

[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.580]
I just don't get what that's all about.

[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.480]
Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.300]
How you doing?

[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:52.940]
Okay.

[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.060]
That poor girl, the not late girl, she was trying to

[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.160]
back her to figure out that baseball situation.

[00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.940]
Well, I don't know what else she's talking about.

[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.620]
I have a feeling there was another runner on base somewhere else.

[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.160]
Wait a minute.

[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.160]
Oh, we got a caller who's going to explain it right now.

[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:08.260]
Really?

[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:08.720]
Yeah.

[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.460]
Well, you know, I know you're not going to kiss your butt,

[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.640]
but I'm not.

[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.200]
Why not?

[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.860]
Just because I've been on here here for 15 years,

[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.960]
what's wrong with kissing my butt, okay?

[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.200]
I'm an LA law.

[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.380]
They said it's supposed to be the best one ever this week.

[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.820]
No telling what that's going to be.

[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.120]
I just thought I'd let you know, but I have a request

[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.460]
that you plan a card.

[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.080]
We know I ask for that.

[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:29.960]
You know, you're not?

[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.120]
What is it?

[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.240]
For all the C store language paid by S last week,

[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.640]
and still we're still waiting.

[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.720]
Oh, I'm looking for it.

[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.960]
If I find it, I'll play it, okay?

[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.960]
My my second chair said that at the office wait before Monica.

[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:41.660]
I appreciate it.

[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.080]
Okay.

[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:42.780]
You're doing a good job.

[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.480]
I'm trying to get to work.

[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:43.860]
Hi, man.

[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.200]
See you.

[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.260]
1033 at W.O.

[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.720]
Do you are going to explain to play to us?

[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.380]
Yes, me.

[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:48.800]
Okay.

[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:49.460]
Okay.

[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.960]
The two outs, Braids have a guy in second Bay.

[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.580]
Dave Justice is up.

[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.220]
Hits one in the gap and writes center.

[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:55.600]
Yeah.

[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.380]
He tries to stretch it into a double,

[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.360]
and he's going to get his ass thrown out.

[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.060]
So he stopped.

[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.940]
He tries to go back to first in San Bernard.

[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.480]
Gets Haces and down tags him off.

[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.780]
Right, but he stopped to give the other owner a chance to go on.

[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.580]
For for the third out.

[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.640]
Stop, you're on.

[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.700]
Stop, you're on.

[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.160]
Yeah.

[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.320]
Great game, you missed it.

[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.740]
Well, you know, something the only reason they won is

[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.700]
because I wasn't watching.

[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.780]
But the first game I've seen wouldn't this year on TV.

[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.240]
If I was watching a Chico Walker would never hit the one

[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.740]
and Dawson would never have been in a game.

[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.420]
So I'm telling you, I just,

[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.880]
I get real emotional with the Cup games.

[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.660]
You have no idea.

[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.420]
I'm just tears my insides out.

[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.740]
I'm not just a lukewarm fan.

[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.700]
I mean, and the thing that bothers me is these last few days

[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.460]
that we've been going through some real rough times

[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.680]
that I'm sitting here just crying the blues.

[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.740]
All these Cup fans, you know,

[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.860]
Hank and I did that thing at Biscayne on Friday night

[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.160]
and it was a real good turnout and Hank's asking.

[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.960]
We got any Red Sox fans.

[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.460]
We got any Cup fans.

[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.940]
They like there were millions of Cup fans.

[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:47.980]
Well, where the hell are they?

[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.480]
Where the hell are they?

[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.320]
Are they all in hiding?

[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.500]
Well, we're all out of here.

[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.900]
We keep here from all these Yankee fans and Met fans

[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.720]
and all these other slide Dodger fans.

[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.460]
Where the hell are the Cup fans?

[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.540]
Yeah, well, let me tell you, I'll be up.

[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.420]
Kind of talking bad at around a little bit

[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.460]
and try to reinforce our, uh, whatever.

[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.100]
Well, my trip is planned.

[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.640]
First week in July, I'll be up there.

[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.240]
Well, we're going sometime.

[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:07.900]
I'm sure.

[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:08.400]
Here it is.

[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.400]
It's what's the date today?

[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.820]
The 15th and May, we still don't know anything about it.

[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.660]
That goes to show you what this place is all about.

[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.200]
I'm going for the big pirate homestand.

[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:15.860]
Oh, boy.

[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.000]
We should get our blood kicked.

[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.880]
I hope not.

[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.320]
I hope we get straightened out by then.

[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.720]
And you notice I say we need Doug DeCenzo leading off.

[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.220]
And even though he was only one for five,

[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.920]
but he did score a run, we won the game.

[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.300]
You just caught the number of games the Cubs win

[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.100]
when Doug DeCenzo is in the starting lineup.

[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.440]
In fact, you remember when Walton got injured?

[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.580]
Got that stomach virus a few couple weeks ago.

[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.200]
And we were hot as a pistol.

[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:36.440]
Right.

[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.180]
The Cenzo was leading off every day

[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.980]
and getting on base, taking a few walks.

[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.980]
You can't have a lead off guy who's got

[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.880]
an on base average of about 240.

[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.380]
It just doesn't get the job done.

[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.800]
Yeah, Walton's up there swinging

[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.000]
at the first pitch every day.

[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.480]
He sucks.

[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.440]
I'm telling you.

[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.380]
He's and plus he's a dumb bass runner.

[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.740]
He's always getting picked off face.

[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.860]
DeCenzo's a hell of a good little ball player.

[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.420]
Well, Rhino got thrown out.

[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.260]
And a great fielder.

[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.940]
Rhino got thrown out twice last night.

[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.360]
Yeah, I know.

[00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.300]
I read about it.

[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320]
I don't know what the hell he was doing.

[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.620]
In fact, that was the end of my tape.

[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.760]
That's when the power went out.

[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.060]
Yeah, I was trying to score at Harry San.

[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.260]
And Rhino's going to score as he's out.

[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.480]
You know, and that's when the tape, that's when the power went out.

[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.460]
I think my VCR couldn't handle anymore.

[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.300]
I'm sure it's a went out right after we tagged him up.

[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.160]
The power went out.

[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.840]
Yeah, that's too bad you missed it.

[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.580]
It was something else.

[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.780]
No, I'm glad I'm happy.

[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.780]
In fact, in fact, I'll say this.

[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.440]
If I felt they could win every game by my not watching,

[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.540]
I would just not watch.

[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.620]
All right, that's a cup fan.

[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.220]
And probably had 10 years to my life.

[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.100]
Yeah, they just don't have the sports this year.

[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:31.920]
They're dead.

[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:32.400]
Yeah.

[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.680]
You know, I've known, I know them very well.

[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.460]
This group of cups.

[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.180]
I mean, you can see the pattern.

[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.060]
They score, you know, San Berg always hits his homers

[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.920]
in the first inning, never in the late innings

[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.440]
when it counts.

[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.800]
Always in the first inning.

[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.620]
OK, and we're head two nothing, three nothing, whatever it is.

[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.960]
And then it's just like the whole rest of the game

[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.000]
is like an exercise.

[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.280]
They come up there and they just stand it around

[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.660]
and dunce them, the swing of the pitches

[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.140]
that are bouncing up there and Walton swinging

[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.760]
the pitches on the ground on the first pitch

[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.660]
and grounding out.

[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.220]
And you can see the pattern.

[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.240]
This is not, I mean, in 89, they had, they were on fire.

[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.060]
They had, there was a whole different spark on it.

[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.080]
The only guys who are sparking on it

[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.460]
team now are Grace and Dawson.

[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.260]
That's right.

[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.840]
Other than that, they're all in a coma.

[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.560]
Dunston never swings to the strike.

[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.060]
No.

[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.280]
And now, and not only that, but at least San Berg

[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.960]
when he goes in a hitting slump every April,

[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.820]
least his fielding is still great with dunston

[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.520]
is fielding and is hitting her in the toilet.

[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:23.940]
Right.

[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.740]
Come on, Shaw, Shaw, and butch up.

[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.020]
And we have nobody to throw the ball.

[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.260]
Ever since Jeff can't see the forest that said

[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.100]
Shawana meter, Shawana has never been the same.

[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:31.700]
He's history.

[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.180]
OK.

[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.540]
So anyway, Neil?

[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.260]
Good luck to us.

[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.380]
So it's a subcliff today, right?

[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.480]
I think so.

[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.020]
OK, I'll take a couple of value.

[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:38.800]
There you go.

[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.300]
See you later.

[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:39.680]
Later.

[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.500]
Another one of those afternoon games in Rigley,

[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.520]
I have to be driving home 100 miles an hour

[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.520]
in my nearly smashed up Corvette.

[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.540]
I come to work this morning.

[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.520]
And the Spencer's out.

[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.300]
By the way, Spencer will not be here next week,

[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.280]
but his crew will be.

[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.620]
So everybody get your car washed.

[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.140]
The Eads of money.

[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.180]
He'll be up in Orlando with a doctor for a few days.

[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.040]
But his truck will be out there.

[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.380]
He'll be a wash and for dollars.

[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.000]
Anyway, I come to work this morning.

[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.600]
And I'm racing a Laura up the street

[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.760]
and actually leave her in the dust.

[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.520]
And I get here and I pull in.

[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.780]
And there's this Yahoo from Next Door Channel 7.

[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.060]
You know those forads that they drive, or mercuries,

[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.680]
whatever those things are, those, he's sitting there

[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.900]
and he's got some blonde bimbit standing there

[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.960]
talking to Spencer's wife and blah, blah, blah, blah,

[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.740]
finally she gets back in.

[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.740]
I'm sitting right behind him about three feet behind.

[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.440]
He starts up in reverse.

[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.460]
And I leaned on that horn and man, I'm

[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.460]
telling you about two inches from my fiberglass

[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.160]
being history.

[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.440]
Anyway, right now I'd like to tell you about our good friends

[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.080]
at intruder detection systems.

[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:35.960]
They're such good friends.

[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.060]
We know the owner's name now.

[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:37.820]
Jeffries Wern.

[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.020]
CWIRN.

[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.720]
IDS is one of the oldest independent long companies

[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.500]
in Saafurda.

[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.380]
They are fully insured.

[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.260]

Intruder Detection Systems Inc.

[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.060]
WIOD.

[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.380]
Bang which tape number 6?

[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.740]
The convenience store.

[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.460]
Follow along and repeat.

[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.280]
Convenience store manager.

[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.020]
Hello, may I be to help you please?

[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.020]
Repeat.

[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.400]
Hello, may I be to help you please?

[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.320]
Customer.

[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.260]
Yes, I would like a pack of Parliament lights.

[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.280]
Convenience store manager.

[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.160]
You want a Parliament light?

[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.100]
Repeat.

[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.740]
You want a Parliament light?

[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:34.720]
Customer.

[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.960]
Yes, I would like a pack of Parliament lights.

[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.980]
Convenience store manager.

[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.060]
Visa Parliament light.

[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.160]
Repeat.

[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.620]
Visa Parliament light.

[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:47.720]
This one.

[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:48.160]
Parliament.

[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.220]
Customer.

[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.600]
No, neither one of those is the Parliament light.

[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.940]
Wait, no, he did this one?

[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.900]
No, it's not that one.

[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:58.780]
You want a Parliament light?

[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.160]
Yes, I want the Parliament lights please.

[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:01.820]
Is it that one?

[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.960]
No, the part, the Parliament light.

[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:04.400]
He did it?

[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.480]
No, no, no.

[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.060]
No, can't you see it's a...

[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.440]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.480]
Over there by the dirty magazine.

[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.340]
But can't you see it?

[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.500]
Where's the laundry hand?

[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.660]
It's a Parliament light now.

[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.320]
Now, turn this tape over for language tape number 7.

[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.260]
Ordering Chinese food over the phone.

[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.900]
1043 at WIOD.

[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.320]
Sure hope that melon had appreciated the fact I dug that out and played it.

[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.940]
Because we lost our Palm Beach call while I was playing.

[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.740]
How often do we get a call in Palm Beach almost never?

[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.440]
Let's go to Miami on the Starline.

[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:34.780]
Hello.

[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:35.500]
Mail.

[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:36.900]
How you doing?

[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:37.520]

[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.140]
I just saw a movie last night.

[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.320]
The naked gun.

[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.880]
And I thought it was pretty funny at the end because you know the Queen was that...

[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:46.960]
Was that a baseball game?

[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:47.280]
Yeah.

[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.980]
You know, she's going to bargain today.

[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.120]
Naked gun is one of the funniest movies in the history of the world.

[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.620]
And naked gun 2, I understand, is coming out soon, which I can't wait to see it.

[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.580]
Yeah, I was a good boy.

[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.500]
Leslie Nielsen is probably the funniest man he was ever born.

[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.800]
That's just my own personal opinion.

[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.820]
Well, it was pretty funny because at the end, you know, it was trying to fasten her

[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.680]
and with the right field, the rich Jackson.

[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.480]
Yeah.

[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.260]
You remember that?

[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.040]
I sure do.

[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.680]
And rich Jackson, I was a batting coach for the A's and you know, he might pass the...

[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.440]
Might have told that old dumb chuban can seco.

[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.480]
Do something.

[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.400]
You never know about that.

[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.480]
The dumb chuban?

[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:20.880]
Yeah.

[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.120]
What does that mean, sir?

[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.360]
Wow, he's a dummy.

[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.060]
Okay.

[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.580]
He's an idiotic jerk.

[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.520]
I didn't know that's all I had to say.

[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.040]
Okay, buddy, I'll have a good day now.

[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.220]
Go shoot some quail.

[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.560]
1044 at WIOD.

[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.780]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.500]
524 at WIOD and of course, to the starline with Bellsoft Mbillow now.

[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.280]
Star IOD.

[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.300]
This cost from your pickup truck now.

[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.280]
All you dumb chubans and others.

[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.820]
What a Yahoo Redneckser.

[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.360]
Anyway, it's 16 before 11 at WIOD.

[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.700]
Caesar Maniago, by the way, I've been thinking about this.

[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.600]
If we had any real sports and knowledgeable people out there, I'd have had a call on that yesterday.

[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.560]
He was a goalie.

[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.500]
I'm positive.

[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.480]
And I think he played for the Red...

[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.880]
For the Redwings and also at one time for the Maple Leaves.

[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.260]
If my murmur is correct.

[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.080]
And of course, tonight we have the Stanley Cup final starting.

[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.500]
The Pittsburgh Penguins with Burgess Meredith.

[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.500]
And the Minnesota North Star is the Underducks.

[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.240]
Boy, go North Star.

[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.240]
Go Neil Brotten.

[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.340]
John Casey, whoever the hell else is on that team.

[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.660]
I must be very honest with you.

[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.100]
I like to think I know a little bit about hockey.

[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.700]
I can't name you anybody else.

[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.180]
I mean, once the game starts, I recognize all the players.

[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.860]
But I mean, North Star is the only two players I can name you on the North Star.

[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.600]
And that's pretty embarrassing, isn't it?

[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.960]
There's a thing in the Sun Sentinel.

[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.560]
Oh, geez.

[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.120]
There's a thing here in the Sports section in the Sun Sentinel.

[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.800]
Not too exciting, but there was a thing...

[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.260]
And that was pretty good as a matter of fact about the Penguins Outlook and North Stars.

[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.920]
And the Hot Gold Tending from John Casey and Coach Bob Gainey.

[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.780]
Well, where's the names of some of the players here would be good, huh?

[00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.580]
Come on.

[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.480]
Like one would be good.

[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:01.940]
Look at this.

[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.400]
It's just a lot of generalities.

[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.220]
There were no names, but the Power Play and Pellety Killers and Defense.

[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.400]
And it doesn't mention that.

[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.020]
I don't think they know any names at a Sun Sentinel either.

[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.020]
There's no names.

[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.940]
It talks about Ulf Samuelson and the Penguins into this one and that one, and Tom Barasso,

[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:26.060]
and Mary Olamu and Kevin Stevens and Coffee Who's Out and Mark Recky.

[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.460]
And I can't believe this.

[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.160]
I'm my hand to the sky.

[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:37.260]
There is not one other name of any player for Minnesota in here other than John Casey,

[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.040]
the Gold Tender.

[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.100]
There ain't nobody in his whole as Stanley Cup Final thing.

[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.840]
Well, what about any article here?

[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.180]
Now there's a big article about it too.

[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.880]
It says Pittsburgh, blah, blah, blah, blah, and Johnson said this.

[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.500]
Wayne Gretzky said that.

[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.260]
Well, there's nothing on here.

[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.600]
Let's go back to page one.

[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.260]
About 1981, losing to the islanders.

[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.960]
There is no name of one player.

[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:08.460]
One, other than John Casey who is the goalie for the North Star.

[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:13.760]
So obviously, Jerry Zagoda of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, right up there in Minnesota,

[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.960]
who wrote this article, also knows nothing about the North Star, and that's his team.

[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.160]
There's no anybody on the team.

[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:20.900]
Miami Beach.

[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:21.480]
Ale.

[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.640]
Would you define a technical term for me?

[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:25.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.300]
How can a China?

[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:27.900]
How can a China?

[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.200]
Yeah.

[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.880]
Means banging on the China cabinet.

[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:38.220]
How can a China, it means like buzzing in your ear, talking too much, bugging you.

[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.140]
Being very annoying, someone being very annoying.

[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.300]
By talking too much.

[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.500]
Like Tom Dennyberg, just think of Tom Dennyberg.

[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.820]
Picture his ugly little face and puny little body, and that kind of matches.

[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.780]
Sounds like a real cure.

[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:52.720]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.280]
Okay, sir.

[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.260]
Good luck to you.

[00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:00.260]
Okay, we have more answers for people out there who have questions.

[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.480]
I was going to say inquisitive goyam, but that would have been bad.

[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.180]
It's 1048 at WIU.

[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.660]
They also understand through the grapevine that in this week's new times, there is a scathing answer

[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:16.920]
to Richard Salis' scathing attack on me in last week's letters to the editor.

[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:23.020]
But unfortunately, we don't have the new times yet, so we'll have to wait and find out if it's as good as Mr. Disney said it was.

[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.840]
See, he gets excited about stuff like that.

[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.600]
I don't really care.

[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.840]
Okay, I mean, it's something to talk about, kills a few minutes, gets the juices flowing in the audience.

[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:31.940]
Who cares?

[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:32.920]
Somebody writes a letter.

[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.240]
I mean, the fact that they're even writing about you, that in itself is something, right?

[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.340]
How many letters do you see in there about Sandy Payton, for example?

[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.900]
How many letters do you see in there about...

[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.020]
Alfie.

[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.980]
Whatever happened to Alfie.

[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.920]
Somebody was asking, oh, that was on the Hankshow the other night when he had Arnie Warren on,

[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.620]
and all these old, old K-18 people were calling.

[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.280]
Whatever happened to Alfie.

[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.280]
Arnie.

[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.400]
It's 12 till 11 at W-Y-O-D.

[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.360]
We have an open line at Broward, 5249463.

[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:12.600]
I've lost eight pounds on my ultra-slip fast in one week, today I'll be a week.

[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.800]
And actually, it's even less than a week, because a week you could go today is the day that we picked out at lunchtime,

[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.660]
and we just kind of finally said, yeah, enough.

[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.160]
Remember?

[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:26.360]
Oh, look at this, in the building early today, Mr. Meyer fresh from another pirate victory last night

[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:33.560]
over the powerful Astros is here today again, two and a half ahead of the powerful dangerous mets.

[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.740]
Montreal, by the way, is in last place, eh?

[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.460]
Exposing last place, the Phillies won again.

[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.940]
They powered the Giants, by the way.

[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.600]
If there are any giant fans out there, we'll provide the guns.

[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.000]
Brian Proff.

[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.480]
Just blow your brains out.

[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.380]
Brian Proff.

[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.200]
Brian Bellos.

[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.740]
Well, these are North Stars?

[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:49.040]
Yeah.

[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:49.980]
Dave Gagnard.

[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:51.020]
Who?

[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.400]
Dave Gagnard.

[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.580]
How are you pronouncing it?

[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:54.840]
Gagnard.

[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:56.920]
Gagnard.

[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:57.540]
Gagnard.

[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.260]
What's the guy said?

[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.000]
And Davey Smith.

[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.060]
Davey Smith?

[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:01.300]
Right.

[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.660]
No, that's some Cubs.

[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:03.320]
No.

[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.920]
That's also the North Stars.

[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:05.860]
And?

[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.160]
Is that it?

[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.340]
Yeah, and it's the Galtender for the North Stars.

[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.100]
Long time ago.

[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:12.720]
Both of his career.

[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.220]
Well, but he plays for the Maple Leafs at one time, I think.

[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.640]
He and Jiels Maloss were, uh...

[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.300]
Jiels what?

[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.180]
Jiels Maloss.

[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.160]
Oh, you can't say that.

[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.440]
Oh, he's coming in here with some bloody talk again today.

[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.020]
That guy was a trip yesterday.

[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.140]
He was something else.

[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.960]
By the way, great car.

[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.640]
That Volkswagen Beetle.

[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:30.260]
Ooh.

[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:31.960]
Hey, great car.

[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.300]
I know how you feel about German cars.

[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.940]
No, it's got nothing to do with where it's made.

[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.560]
It's just like a death track.

[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.040]
Well, it's all I could afford then.

[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:39.980]
I had to afford that.

[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.420]
All I had was a little Corveir.

[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.020]
Oh, really?

[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.260]
Sixty Corveir.

[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.380]
A little blue Corveir.

[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.760]
And put 150,000 miles on it.

[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.800]
And every 10 miles you'd have to stop for oil change in a fan belt.

[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.860]
But it was fun.

[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:53.120]
Yeah.

[00:35:53.300 --> 00:36:00.320]
See, everything, you see, everything in life is depends on where you were, place and time, how old you were, perspective.

[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:09.080]
Like, when I first went to Detroit, I was a kid at Michigan State, my first, and I'm in my own little Corveir, and I'm driving to the Edselford, the John Logics pressways.

[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.520]
And it was exciting.

[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.780]
And I've got the WXYZ and CKLW blasting on my radio AM, of course.

[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.080]
And it was exciting.

[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.040]
Now I go to Detroit and like, I want to get right out.

[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:21.700]
Forget it.

[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.340]
It's like all these memories of Pittsburgh.

[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.140]
Pittsburgh is a dank, cloudy, slippery, oh, gross place.

[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:28.940]
That's a dumb thing.

[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.360]
Man, it's a toilet.

[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.880]
10.51 at WYF.

[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.980]
So I guess we could assume safely that there is no step on reshay on the Minnesota North Star, is it?

[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:44.680]
Thank God.

[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.520]
But somebody on the phone has got some names.

[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:47.240]
Deal.

[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:47.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.880]
Falling from Miami and the Palm Beach Line to give you some scoop.

[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.200]
That's how desperate it is.

[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.220]
Are you a North Star fan?

[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.520]
From Minnesota.

[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:55.180]
Wow.

[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.980]
Well, that doesn't answer the question, though, because they've only got about six fans.

[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:58.900]
Yeah, I know they do.

[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.960]
My brother-in-law wouldn't even go out and watch him this year.

[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.520]
He's the hell of a hockey fan.

[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:08.620]
But all of a sudden, they get into playoffs, they get hot, and that place is just jam-packed and they're rocking the raffers.

[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.980]
Bunch of fart runners up there, eh?

[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.020]
Valzoma Kray.

[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.480]
Now the white spot works.

[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.160]
That you already take this time.

[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:14.840]
Yeah.

[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.440]
Here's a good scoop for you.

[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.720]
Neil Wilkinson, their defenseman.

[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.500]
Wow. They got a lot of niels on that team. That's what I like him.

[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.640]
Went to Michigan State.

[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.960]
Any hockey player who niels can't be all bad.

[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.220]
Hey, went to Michigan State.

[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.460]
Well, like I said, I'm liking them more every second.

[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.020]
Thank God.

[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:29.620]
Yep.

[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.740]
And Mike Medano.

[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.180]
Six hundred five shots.

[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:33.880]
Yep.

[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.180]
Big squaries from LaVonia.

[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.140]
Really?

[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:37.600]
Yeah.

[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.900]
From Wolverine Harnas Raceway, School Cracked in Middle Bell.

[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:41.740]
I know it.

[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:43.760]
Yeah.

[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.920]
See, how about the French player?

[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:47.980]
Yeah, I'm ready.

[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.460]
Kray, played for Toronto.

[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:50.940]
Who's that Gordon McCray?

[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:51.400]
Yeah.

[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:51.880]
Yeah.

[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.200]
What a voice.

[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.580]
Who's gonna sing the national anthem I heard?

[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.120]
I know.

[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.140]
Or Dwight Smith will set him up there. He's not playing much.

[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.080]
No. By the way, he's our Monty Ago.

[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:01.460]
Yeah.

[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.180]
He played for nine years from Minnesota.

[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.840]
Twenty four thousand minutes.

[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.440]
But I swear to you, I think he also played before that for the Maple Leafs.

[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.080]
That could be wrong.

[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:09.900]
You're probably wrong.

[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.720]
He's a big Paul Skitty guy.

[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.040]
Yeah.

[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.360]
He's your Monty Ago. I'm positive.

[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.240]
Yeah. He and Gump Worsley for years.

[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:14.980]
Gump Worsley.

[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:15.340]
Yeah.

[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.480]
Worsley was before him.

[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.940]
Worsley was before him, wasn't he?

[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:18.460]
Yeah.

[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:18.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.580]
Well, no, he and the Gump Worsley was in a Johnny Bar era, like in the 1800s.

[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:24.240]
Yeah.

[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.840]
Yeah. He and the Gump Worsley were there. Actually, he's our, was there two years before Gump Worsley.

[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.680]
But the Gump Worsley was like in the twilight of his wonderful flopping career.

[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.340]
Remember how he used to flop down all the time and slide around like a whale and heat?

[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.460]
He was afraid of the world.

[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.440]
He was a great farmer.
