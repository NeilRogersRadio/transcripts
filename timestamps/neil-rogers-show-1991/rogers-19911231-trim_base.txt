[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540]
to beat the crap that he has.

[00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.380]
Oh.

[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.960]
Oh.

[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.860]
Oh.

[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.120]
Oh.

[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.640]
Oh.

[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.640]

[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.760]
Oh.

[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.760]

[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.760]

[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.760]

[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.780]
Oh.

[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.780]

[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.780]

[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:14.800]

[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:14.800]

[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.520]

[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.440]

[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.440]

[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.820]
People are watching women are staring at their green blue envy.

[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.420]
Oh.

[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]
But I'm not sharing something.

[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.060]
Some say his brain lives.

[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.640]
Oh.

[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.360]
Not much going to talk in.

[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.780]
Not much to look at.

[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.960]
But I ain't looking.

[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.000]
His mouth's just a little too much.

[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.220]
His mouth's as far a little too close.

[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.580]
His mouth is just a little too long.

[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.000]
But while they're running,

[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.480]
I will be molting,

[00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.220]
tall, thin.

[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.220]
His got a really big trouser trout.

[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.040]
Those girls look screaming at me,

[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.140]
let it out.

[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.920]
His got a really big trouser trout.

[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.980]
I'm fishing for love.

[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.640]
His got a really big trouser trout.

[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.980]
That boy can make me just twist and twist.

[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.140]
And he's got a really big trouser trout.

[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.120]
I'm fishing for love.

[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.660]
His got a really big trouser trout.

[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.900]
His got a really big trouser trout.

[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.520]
His got a really big trouser trout.

[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.200]
His got a really big trouser trout.

[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.840]
Boy, does he have a lot of hoodspot?

[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580]
You've seen the TV commercials now.

[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.220]
Let Joey Chitwood and his big whales teach you how to do it.

[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.380]
Thank you, mate.

[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.780]
Yeah.

[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.160]
Are you getting the great poo-poo?

[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.240]
Tertivore!

[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.580]
Pull that ring on up.

[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.680]
Oh!

[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.560]
Shoot too far.

[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.220]
After just one week of Joey Chitwood's great poo-poo on stunt-driving school,

[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.520]
you'll be swiping spicy djong with a big rig.

[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.820]
Joey Chitwood, king of the 85 mile per hour condiments washed.

[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.320]
See if you've got what it takes to cut the mustard.

[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.040]
He terrorized you in silence of the land.

[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.380]
Hannibal the Hannibal.

[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.520]
Now he'll tandalize you at Hannibal House.

[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.220]
Yes, Hannibal House, where the food is always flesh.

[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.520]
And now try our new Schmorgas morg.

[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.700]
Featuring all you can eat finger food.

[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.640]
Uh, yeah, I'll have the hand and Swiss on rice.

[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.480]
I want a hot long foot dog.

[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.000]
Hungry for breakfast? Try our 69 cent special.

[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.900]
Scramble legs with French toast.

[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.060]
And I'd like a coffee too, please.

[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.940]
It regular or decapitated.

[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.500]
Uh, never mind.

[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.680]
And don't forget dessert.

[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.140]
Try our world famous hot apple pie.

[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.040]
Ah!

[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.760]
This week order to standard liver and onions with a drink and keep the glasses.

[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.140]
Or a hearing aid.

[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.840]
Even a complete set of dentures.

[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.460]
Why not bring a friend for dinner?

[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.000]
Hannibal House.

[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.800]
Tick tock like mom.

[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.380]
And now it's time for Senator Ted's New Year's party taste.

[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.560]
Happy New Year.

[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.660]
Every New Year has some people all room by.

[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.320]
And responsible friends like myself should step forward and offer helping hands to a fellow party.

[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.780]
Go as if whose judgment may be impaired.

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.700]
Hey, everybody need a ride home?

[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.160]
No thanks.

[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.180]
I already got one.

[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.140]
Sleep it over.

[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.100]
Another New Year's party tip from Senator Ted.

[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.780]
I'm dying out of here.

[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.180]
What else is new?

[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.020]
Out in Hollywood.

[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.660]
Anything going on?

[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.480]
Yeah, this kind of one sort of disturbing thing.

[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.700]
I saw a pretty woman there.

[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.840]
No, what is called this pretty woman.

[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.780]
I already saw that with Richard Geer.

[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.520]
And I kind of put it off.

[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.780]
I'm not a big Richard Geer fan.

[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.060]
Right.

[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.160]
And I think the thing that really bothers me is that I read now that he wants to play Buddha.

[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.020]
And that's not even...

[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.600]
Does anybody else?

[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.300]
Richard Geer is a Buddha.

[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.640]
He is often described and he would like to play the life story of Buddha.

[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.160]
And that's so horrible.

[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.520]
Miss casting thing.

[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.440]
Which they have a lot out there.

[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.200]
And I'm thinking of Richard Geer as Buddha.

[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.340]
You know, like what's next?

[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.220]
Robbie Benson plays Jesus.

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.260]
Robbie Benson is the Lord.

[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.600]
Right after you make Guy Burr.

[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.820]
Come on.

[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.780]
Right after you make Guy Burr.

[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.740]
Ricky Schroeder is Mandela.

[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.140]
You love the bit of silver spoons now.

[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.500]
CM is Nelson Mandela.

[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.500]
Right after Matt Laugh.

[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.340]
Jim J. Bollock is Mussolini.

[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.780]
You love them in sequence squares, Hollywood squares.

[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.540]
Now CM has the Italian dictator Mussolini.

[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.960]
Right after Baywise.

[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.680]
Dick Van Patten is no Stradamus.

[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.260]
Right after the Golden Girl.

[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.760]
Oh, geez.

[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.960]
So what I'll be on the next album?

[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.940]
Hardly nowadays, two spags.

[00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:15.480]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:45.460]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I wish you knew the freedom andロ in my life. Find

[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.860]
The baby of Tobu on the way back home

[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.140]
But I got nowhere to go

[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.560]
That's why I'm asking you, Joe

[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.380]
I'm talking to the man in the tofu

[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.060]
I'm asking you to make some shame

[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.080]
But he answered, look buddy, I just told you

[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.520]
If you wanna pass a picture for all the lame

[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.720]
Cause this place only excites

[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.320]
Change up leading with the man in the tofu

[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.280]
I'm begging him to make some shame

[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.060]
But he answered, look pal, I just told you

[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.460]
If you gotta, when you got to another lame

[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.980]
If you can't come up with a fact change

[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.180]
And it's later like, and I'm out of time

[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.240]
I had a bus to bring all my needed

[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.680]
A dime, a dime, a dime

[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.860]
A dime, a dime, a dime

[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.280]
Come on, a saloon, hate your love

[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.780]
I got a dime, a dime

[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.680]
Come on, a dime, a dime

[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.540]
I have no foreskin

[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.280]
Would you like to read headlines like Dan Rather?

[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.900]
Grass-broll events like Walter Cronkite

[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.800]
Explain the news to the public like Peter Jennings?

[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:07.860]
No?

[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.860]

Carol says, full-applans were ordered after new evacuations

[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.920]
Of the peace agreement suggested

[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.360]
It may rather new evaluation to the peace agreement

[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.100]
What was the evacuation or evaluation?

[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.940]
I'm sorry, it's about evacuating the peace agreement

[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:46.640]
And, and it will feature highlights from 8,000 secret tape recorded

And keep the public aware of top world events

[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.800]
And the CIA would have to assess the country's or assist the country's

[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.920]

Yeah

[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.380]
Bird, how you doing?

[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.140]

[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:16.020]
Listen, do me a favor play anything because I can't stand listening to you

[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.720]
You sound like a douchebag

[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.600]
Do it

[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.160]
Just do me a favor play anything

[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.200]
Well, can I ask your question before you go?

[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.080]
Oh God, you sound so stupid I hate to talk to you, yeah go ahead

[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.260]
Why did you call me?

[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.120]
I didn't call you

[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.340]
You're not just to tell you not to say anything just play something

[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.060]
Oh God, can't stand it

[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.520]
Well then why are you listening?

[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.360]
Ah, play something already

[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.720]
Why won't you answer my...

[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.140]
Ah, get stand up

[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.100]
You won't see he won't talk to me

[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.380]
Oh, we got a car here

[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:44.780]
Hello

[00:10:52.200 --> 00:11:03.020]
I got some shine before the break is on

[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:09.800]
What I'm feeling now

[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.120]
I know you can turn me on

[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:23.300]
Where I guess you say

[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.780]
Well, can make me feel so gay

[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.080]
Near I just

[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.540]
A chicken farmer won't out when dark and windy day

[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.220]
By the crew he rested as he went along his way

[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.140]
Lullin' once a rotten egg hit him in the eye

[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.280]
It was a sight he dreaded

[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.680]
Ghost chickens in this guy

[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.620]
A farmer had raised chickens and he was 24

[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.900]
Working for the colonel for 30 years or more

[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.560]
Killing all those chickens and sending them to fry

[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.020]
Now they want revenge

[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.960]
Ghost chickens in this guy

[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.020]
Everybody put my mind back

[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.980]
The pigs were black and shiny either as we're burning red

[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.520]
They had no meat or feathers

[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.020]
These chickens were dead

[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.480]
They picked a farmer up

[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.020]
And he died by the claw

[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.080]
They cooked a match the crew smooth

[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.580]
And ate him with coslo

[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:38.780]
Everybody

[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.320]
Fuck, fuck, fuck

[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.420]
Ghost chickens in this guy

[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.360]
Wow, boys this pressure radio or what?

[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.840]
I could have put a few liners on the cart

[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.300]
You know what?

[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.260]
You could have just dropped these in like I was really here

[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.660]
And I could have said our Camilla's house total is

[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.540]
And George could have said

[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.680]
$96,031,8

[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.360]
Never known the difference

[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.440]
Oh Alex could have done that

[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.320]
Like I said, $11.45 at WIOD

[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.220]

It's the little thing

[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.880]
That's where we're going to do it George

[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.400]
Summer 1990 is the summer of Dick Tracy

[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.660]
You'll see the movie

[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.680]
Listen to the soundtrack

[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.120]
Where the T-shirt and read the comic book

[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.460]
And now just in time for Father's Day

[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.780]
You can enjoy the fragrance that was inspired by the movie

[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.740]
The soundtrack the T-shirt and the comic book

[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.740]
New Dick Tracy Cologne

[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.680]
Why smell like other guys?

[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.220]
Now you can smell like Dick

[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.140]
There's Lady in town

[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.340]
She's an orthodox Jew

[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:21.220]
And she needs to buy bread that is unleavened

[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.140]
But it's late and she knows

[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.160]
That the stores are all closed

[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:33.540]
And she really believes to make a sandwich

[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.660]
And she's buying bread that is seven

[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.180]
He lives

[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.840]
Oh and the bread is wonderful

[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.740]
This is your brain

[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.980]
This is your brain on drugs

[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.160]
This is your brain being chopped to bits

[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.120]
By a finely honed meat cleaver

[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.640]
This is your brain in a blender

[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.820]
And this is your brain being stirred into a big pot of chili

[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.280]
Brains, real food for real people

[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.720]
It's me the PP guy

[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:46.860]

Well hold on to yours today

[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.580]
You can

[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.320]
For 14 years everything was fine

[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.400]
Unde

[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.400]
Damn it this thing's too big or the paper's too small

[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.360]
So now I gotta start all over again

[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.460]
No matter how hard you try

[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.460]
It never works

[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.200]
Why do I have to wrap this?

[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.620]
I think your box looks pretty good

[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.760]
The moment of confrontation arrives

[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.120]
Your fingertips and elbow hold the paper out of the box

[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.940]
Well your free hand reaches frantically

[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.620]
Don't know it's sticking everything down

[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.760]
No no no

[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.820]
I'm not John Aubrey

[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.840]
You're experiencing

[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.980]
tape fear

[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.080]
Oh no no quick

[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.300]
Put your thumb on the bow

[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.740]
Oh no

[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.040]
Take fear

[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.560]
Come and go hold new you

[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.620]
Take fire in the evening

[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.580]
Put in men

[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.320]

Now we're gone

[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.920]
Asinches head

[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.200]
Fire

[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.280]

I'll bet help

[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.320]
Let us squeal

[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.300]
Fire

[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.400]
Fire

[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:19.580]
Bundy

[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.340]
Money can rub and understand

[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.160]
Boy that chair is really gonna grab me

[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.020]
Sparkle none

[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.920]
Roll the switch

[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.640]
Now it's time

[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.300]
Watch it switch

[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.240]
Bundy

[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.480]
Bye bye

[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.040]
Makes us get

[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.240]
You shine

[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.400]
Don't you worry about a thing

[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.260]
Someday soon

[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.120]
We'll all sing

[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.840]

[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.500]
Bye bye

Bye bye

[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.580]

[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.460]
Now the price

[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.800]
Sexual harassment

[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.140]
Arasement

[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.280]
Arasement like to me

[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.160]
Put on my father ones love

[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.400]
Headed for the street

[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:24.120]
Just checked out the best of hustle and arm

[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.540]
Starting to feel heat

[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.120]
Oh

[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.540]
Suddenly I see people

[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.860]
Checking out my buttons I see

[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.560]
Yeah I got a first class riser

[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.500]
It don't pitch the 10 mind jeans

[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.360]
Now I was born in a woody

[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.040]
I'm finding it impossible to

[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.780]
Can see how I'm spotting a woody

[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.180]
I feel like an absolute out of wheel

[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:03.040]
And so the ghost of the list

[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.280]
He was part one too

[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.300]
Followed him up to the gates of basement

[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.020]
Just to see what he would do

[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.400]
His ghosted face was beaded

[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.400]
As he headed for his room

[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.580]
There's a printer in a ghost

[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.780]
Just waiting for his post

[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.280]
Down in the jungle room

[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.940]
Respawning wood is a man-fess

[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.440]
It's really impossible

[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.560]
To conceal spotting wood is a man-fess

[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.540]
I feel like an absolute out of wheel

[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.980]
Spotting wood isn't man-fess

[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.400]
It's almost impossible to conceal

[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.180]
spotting wood is a man-fess

[00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:01.640]
I feel like an absolute out of wheel

[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.340]
This is the Neal Roger show

[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.240]
This is your brain

Here's my story, said my true

[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.060]
About a girl called Sifiliso

[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.880]
Had a bug and ran it around

[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:23.900]
Gave it to every guy in town

[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:51.780]
Gave it to me

[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.280]
I didn't know whether you're an airy drip

[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.580]
A part of all will always be with you

[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.080]
So stay away from a Sifiliso

[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.540]
It took a close I should have seen the signs

[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.380]
Smell the scent of a friend of mine

[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.420]
You got it back to now I've got it too

[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.220]
So keep away from a Sifiliso

[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.560]
Keep away from that girl

[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.620]
Hoping a Sifiliso now

[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.580]
Gave it away from soon

[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.720]
She likes to sleep around

[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.880]
Gave it to dinner with my bastard house

[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.920]
We did it then I started to cough

[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.780]
Now I'm afraid it's falling off

[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.620]
Here's the moral of the story from a guy who knows

[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.820]
Used to have a horse where this fungus grows

[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.740]
Ask any fool that she ever knew

[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.620]
A keep away from a Sifiliso

[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.920]
Yeah, keep away from that girl

[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.400]
I don't know what's out of the douchebag

[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.280]
Banging out the douche

[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.180]
Binging out the swords and weather

[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.760]
And the management too

[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.960]
You don't know why this being traps

[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.060]
Yes I'm fool with you

[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:16.040]
Nest your arches drive the ground with you

[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.920]
Everyday, I'm vain

[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.500]
Nest your arches hushed in the round

[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.500]

George can only do one at a time

[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.060]
Okay, so if you got a ring, keep bringing it

[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.220]
Okay, can only take one name and address and choose size at a time

[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.220]
So keep bringing it

[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.920]
And since there's only eight lines, it means we're gonna spill over

[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.800]
Look who's in the building, look at that

[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.740]

[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.440]
Because you only got it, huh?

[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.140]
You're still talking to them?

[00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.660]
Man, at this rate by 315, you're gonna have all these ten people done

[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.140]

[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.880]

Oh, hey, I'm no fool, I know how to kill this day, man

[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.120]

[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.820]
You wanna turn out as Mike briefly?

[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.120]
Yes

[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.040]
It's great

[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.160]
I don't hear anything

[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.020]
I don't either, I can't

[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.600]

What do you think about that?

[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.820]
Is this some kind of omen for 92?

[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.300]
Wait, don't Paris, just walked out the door, Mr. Happy New Year himself

[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.220]

These raffle tickets?

[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.680]
Oh, yeah, yeah

[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.840]
Which are worth a hundred bucks on it

[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:49.980]
I don't know

[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.120]
Peace, and somebody's gonna win an infinity which is great

[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.380]

[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.380]
So when he's stiff, I mean when he's great listeners

[00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:00.340]

[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.560]
And we got everything in hand

[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.820]
So to speak, Paris

[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.120]
Everyone knows the Kennedys have quite a record

[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.960]
And now you can have it too

[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.840]
It's the Palm Beach Boys

[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.300]
Singing all the Kennedys greatest hits

[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.660]
Singing all the Kennedys greatest hits

[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.700]
Palm Beach Town

[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.580]
Sometimes it's a thing

[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.220]
But think I love the breeze

[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.100]
The Palm Beach Boys will give you the willies

[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.860]
Help me uncle, help me uncle

[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.280]
Help me uncle, yeah

Get me out of this gym

[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.200]
Yes, it's the Palm Beach Boys

[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.140]

[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.760]
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, red

[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.860]

[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.040]
Tick, tick, tick, tick

[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.880]
Tick, tick, tick, tick

Tick, tick, tick, tick

[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.500]
Oh, their journey laundry is washing up on shore

[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.240]
My girls on the beach

[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.660]
Say you're Rob when I put my head down here

[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.520]
Hi, you're a Ken Heady Ocean

[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.000]

Doesn't patty any

[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.000]
Won't it be by sip wink

[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.620]
Wake up with the wages who is 17

[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.560]
You'll also get little old Rosie from Massachusetts

[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.820]
Ted Man's Curve and twist in by the pool

[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.960]
So next time you feel like hanging Ted

[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.980]
10, catch the Palm Beach Boys

[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.940]

[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.640]
Thanks for calling

[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.240]
This is Tom Brook, John New York

[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.180]
President Bush has pulled a surprise news conference

[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.400]
We suspect that he may have changed his mind

[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.960]
on the Supreme Court nominee

[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.900]
We now join that news conference

[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.320]
Or Bernie in progress

[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.000]
So in my mind about the previous nominee

[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.500]
So instead I've decided to nominate three women

[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.080]
to the Supreme Court

[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.440]
Right girls?

[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.280]
You mean it's the three's court

[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.240]
Hey, this court is wide enough

[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.320]
Slip this to the right night

[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.540]
Everybody's handing out

[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.180]
Listen to you

[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.660]
Now we're getting down

[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.880]
You can't hurry laws

[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.440]
No, you just have to wait

[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.140]
We're too busy singing

[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.860]
There's no time to measure slicks

[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.480]
We rock down in the Senate

[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.400]
Now the way we look like steps in the face

[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.280]
Probably not, but it makes me look real good

[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.040]
Sit up

[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.100]
Now we make the laws

[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.720]
Mary, you up for that

[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.780]
Yeah, well Diana, I'd rather sing flat than be flat

[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.560]
Don't you ditch me, I just need you to stay alive

[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.160]
Yeah, we're dancing, honey, you out of the band

[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.880]
Tom, damn, now you wait for the right time

[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.960]
This is Tom Brook, John

[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.700]
I'll see you in a minute

[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.960]
Common listen to my story about a man named Jed

[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.200]
A dumb mountaineer barely nothing in his head

[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.220]
After Labor Day had a hang-pun to be cool

[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.140]
So he rounded up the kin and they headed back to school

[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.140]
Beverly Hills that is high school 90210

[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.660]
Excuse me, Miss Jay?

[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.100]
Yes, just a little

[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.740]
How many inches in a gallon?

[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.140]
Oh my God, he's like so stupid

[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:16.720]
Hey, look isn't that that dude who surps on a door?

[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.700]
Golly Paul, I don't think I'm ever gonna fit in

[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.520]
That this hair fancy Hollywood high school

[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.220]
Now, honey, you keep waiting there boys

[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:27.400]
You already got credit

[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.420]
Well, the next thing you know there, living in Bel Air

[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.880]
Checking in the rehab and bleaching out their hair

[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.120]
Though they're really tan and they're getting lots of chicks

[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.660]
They ain't learned nothing because they're still a bunch of hicks

[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.980]
And a good, Beverly Hills Village 90210

[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.780]
You're all held back now

[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.780]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers

[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.720]
It's an asshole celebration and they're all out on the street

[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.300]
See them on the sidewalk, over here them shopping feet

[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.440]
That's 20,000 assholes doing assholes from the Navy

[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.860]
Step aside, good people, let's the assholes operate

[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:52.580]
We got the assholes for freedom, the assholes for fun

[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:57.540]
The assholes for Jesus, the assholes for guns

[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:05.020]
Assholes for justice, assholes for crime, assholes for assholes

[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.920]
Assholes for all to come

[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:21.800]
We got assholes making money, we're making all the rules

[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.800]
Taking all our jobs, they're filling up our school

[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.260]
Assholes on the water, assholes on the sky

[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.400]
Designed to settle for one it, only assholes need a fly

[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:50.640]
Oh, teach you won't you tell me how I really made the race

[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:57.740]
Am I good or not, where's for am I just another asshole on the grave

[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.620]
Assholes get the orders, and assholes grow the boat

[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.360]
Assholes get elected, and assholes get the boat

[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.360]
I want to start a film that all assholes never die

[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.700]
They just lay in bed in a small fly

[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.860]
Assholes in the morning, assholes every night

[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.600]
Assholes to the left, and assholes to the right

[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.460]
There's 20,000 assholes to the right assholes from the main

[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:03.140]
Defacite good people, and assholes operate

[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:22.360]
New from your phony company, it's yelling, and it's cheaper than calling

[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.560]
How's the wife and kids?

[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.400]
Pretty good Sam, you and Laura want to come over for dinner tonight?

[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.620]
Sure, okay, I'll get back to you

[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.860]
With yelling, you get the same convenient features as calling, like yell waiting

[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.760]
I just amitted friend, my boss is yelling at me

[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.020]
Oh, David, you got that contract ready for tomorrow morning?

[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.480]
Yeah, you'll start right now

[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:46.240]
Try yelling, new from your phony company, yell at our toll free number for more information

[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:52.560]
Of course it's cheaper to yell after 7pm, a 3 minute yell from sunrise over to Tamrak costs only a dollar

[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.740]
But you may have trouble getting through during peak yelling hours

[00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:02.360]
I pray you, I pray you, I pray you, I pray you, I pray you, I pray you, I pray you, I pray you, I pray you, I pray you, I pray you

[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:07.780]
It's the new easy choice from your phony company, yelling, yell out to someone you love today

[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.300]
Yell at our toll free number for more information

[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.720]
That's 1,800, by EL, L-I-N-T

[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.000]
Don't be 50 hours
