[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]
Best of Rodgers highlights of previously broadcast Neil Rodgers programs.

[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.860]
The opinions of the hosts, guest or callers, are not necessarily those of this station or its advertisers.

[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.260]
Now, the best of Neil with your host, Neil Rodgers, a news talk radio, 610-WIOD.

[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.040]
Right now, for the game show where politicians question the answers they came up with

[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.780]
and the last three years, it's election jeopardy.

[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.200]
And now, here's your host, Alex Q. Popper.

[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.560]
Thank you for returning today for final jeopardy as our reigning champion, George Bush.

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.920]
Are you ready to risk all you've earned so far, George?

[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.820]
Yeah, I'm gone for brawl.

[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.700]
Sort of like the over-taxed middle class.

[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.160]
Now, wait.

[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.780]
All right, here's your answer.

[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.060]
The reason George Bush could lose in 1992.

[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.480]
Oh, J. Swindler, Selena, Ron Bumtsin.

[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.680]
Well, now, well, he didn't like you the first time you know how well.

[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.840]
Is that all I say?

[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.880]
No, I got the nightmare on the session's split.

[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.320]
Wait, I got it.

[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.240]
All right, George, let's see what you got.

[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.840]
No, new idea.

[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.200]
One more question please.

[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.180]
Oh, you mean like, why don't I have any new ideas?

[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.860]
Yeah, I do.

[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.180]
Hey, this guy called voting audiences decided your time's up.

[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.460]
Why?

[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.300]
Run the Wellington.

[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.580]
Come here, it's Joe.

[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.480]
And this list is called the election jeopardy.

[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.420]
Here's the lady in the gables.

[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.720]
Hello.

[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.000]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.620]
Neil.

[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.240]
Yes.

[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.280]
Your favorite person.

[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.720]
My favorite person?

[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.280]
Yeah.

[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.160]
Orlando, your voice is chill.

[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.020]
No, I hope you know I meant well with the Veele.

[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.580]
Neil.

[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.260]
Oh, is this Johnny Dark's sister?

[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.740]
No, this is the animal rights person.

[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.640]
The animal rights?

[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.540]
You were not the animal rights person the other day with the Veele lady.

[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.260]
What's that guy do with animal rights?

[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.260]
Well, what does that mean animal rights?

[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.080]
What does that mean?

[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.220]
Just like they say human rights or, you know,

[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.660]
Well, since when do animals have rights?

[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.160]
Since they feel just like we do.

[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.980]
No, that's what they feel that rhymes with Veele and Neil.

[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.900]
That's what I said.

[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.080]
Next Veele on a squeal.

[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.320]
And I think it would delicious Veele.

[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.320]
Let's everybody go out and have a Veele Parmesan sandwich for lunch today.

[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.000]
Neil.

[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.960]
The door has a good one.

[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.520]
Veele?

[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.500]
I guess you took it personally, but anyway, I just want to do it.

[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.820]
I didn't take it personally at all.

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.700]
Why in no respect?

[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.760]
I just want you to know.

[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.980]
You really want to take it personally.

[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.380]
No, you did not mean well.

[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.820]
You're just a conniving bitch trying to tell everybody else what to do.

[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.680]
No, I don't.

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.660]
I don't think I do not care for as people try to tell me what the hell they do.

[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.100]
I've never tried to tell you what to do.

[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.380]
You told me you came right on the other end and said I've got to change my attitude about this.

[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.120]
I'm not saying you told me you must or else.

[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.340]
Change and every city of God.

[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.960]
Yes, you did.

[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.880]
Yes, you did.

[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.640]
No, I didn't mean it.

[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.480]
Did.

[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.320]
Did.

[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.200]
No, I didn't.

[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.460]
Did.

[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.340]
No, I didn't.

[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.000]
No.

[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.700]
Nope.

[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.420]
Nope.

[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.880]
Nope.

[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.200]

[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.780]
See what I mean?

[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.840]
It's true.

[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.800]
It's true.

[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.360]
Let's move on to something else because I'm not going to change my mind.

[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.920]
I like Veele.

[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.880]
I'm going to keep eating it.

[00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.940]
I'm going to eat whatever I like.

[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.760]
That's not my business.

[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.040]
You mind your own God's business.

[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.520]
That's not my business.

[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.500]
Nothing illegal about buying Veele, okay?

[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.620]
That's not my business.

[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.300]
I don't want to hear about all the poor baby cows.

[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.000]
There are people out there dying on the street.

[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.600]
Slap the ****.

[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.060]
In your life, have you ever heard anything like that in your life?

[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.980]
Twice.

[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.500]
I had it.

[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.100]
You know, they're making a difference.

[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.520]
But I mean, twice you got it in there.

[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.920]
And back at you, bitch.

[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.620]
Boy, the most obnoxious, the most disgusting.

[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.580]
No wonder she's like,

[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.540]
she's into baby cow.

[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.820]
Certainly nothing human would come close to her.

[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.760]
God.

[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.740]
That call was worse than the other one.

[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.520]
Is the lady in Pembroke Pines?

[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.260]
Hello there.

[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.740]
Hi.

[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.860]
Hi, I'm a long time list, Herobius.

[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.960]
Well, that's great.

[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.780]
I'm 83.

[00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.220]
I'll be then.

[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.420]
I've got to be serious.

[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.960]
I received a beautiful, beautiful letter from Harry Somerville.

[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.480]
From who?

[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.460]
Harry Somerville of Camille, I found.

[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.800]
Oh.

[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.960]
And I think you should...

[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.020]
I think I should read this over the air.

[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.900]
No, everybody who adonates gets that and the rest of them don't want to hear about it because they're interested.

[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.020]
Isn't that a damn shame?

[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.500]
Yeah.

[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.640]
It'd be crazy.

[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.900]
95% of them are very close to that lady who called before that they didn't get on the air about it.

[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.960]
Wasn't she a charmer?

[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.400]
She was what you called her.

[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.980]
Exactly.

[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.020]
First class bitch.

[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.580]
Right.

[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.580]
Exactly.

[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.960]
That's why you have to be subjected to...

[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.680]
And I am too.

[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.760]
I think it's disgusting.

[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.760]
There isn't enough money in the free world that anybody should have to sit here and be subjected to cowardly people like her on the phone.

[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.100]
Right.

[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.720]
People who sit behind the anonymity of the telephone and act real bold and brave and spew mong all over the portacola.

[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.980]
It's sad.

[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.240]
It is.

[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.820]
It's sad.

[00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.520]
It's sad.

[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.320]
Our generation has come to the point.

[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.520]
That's the voice that it's sad.

[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.240]
It's sad.

[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.440]
Well honey, it's a beautiful letter and you've got credit, the WIOD and the O'Rodgett.

[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.380]
I get credit for nothing.

[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.340]
I get blamed for everything that goes wrong.

[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.620]
I get credit for...

[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.500]
I'm not in this letter.

[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.120]
I get credit.

[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.340]
Well I'm not talking about that.

[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.240]
I'm talking about here.

[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.880]
Well.

[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.680]
Everything bad that happens.

[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.980]
I'm behind it.

[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.440]
I'm responsible for it.

[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.260]
I'm a part of it.

[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.780]
I'm like just a loose cannon.

[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.260]
No, you just stay well.

[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.040]
As William Conrad would say, a big loose cannon.

[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.820]
You just stay well honey.

[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.180]
I'm 83 and I hope to live another 510.

[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.040]
Another 110.

[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.160]
Well you sound pretty good to me.

[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.720]
You just take care of yourself.

[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.480]
Okay, and you start.

[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.460]
Thank you.

[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.200]
Bye bye mom.

[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.200]
You're listening to the best of Rogers on NewsDog Radio's.

[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.040]
610 WIOD.

[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.660]
Don't worry, Ben.

[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.540]
Jerry Stix is heading here again just now in the middle of that traffic report.

[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.260]
And sister me, I thought you agreed we weren't going to do the music.

[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.940]
Now then we take a little poll on this the other day in formal poll.

[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.660]
And like we talked to 4 million people and every one of them said we want the music on the traffic.

[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.580]
See, like the list of ship, we got these big numbers in here between 10 and 2.

[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.580]
This particular book and of course I know the books are all full of crap,

[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.140]
but nonetheless I'll take credit for it.

[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.220]
I mean it like stands out.

[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.620]
Like it just jumps out at you.

[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.360]
Those enormous, enormous.

[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.280]
I'll give you an example.

[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.600]
Okay.

[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.240]
Let's do our own horn here for a second.

[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.420]
Okay, you're probably used to that.

[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.580]
Henry's used to tuning his own.

[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.000]
Where the hell are the numbers?

[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.760]
Here we are.

[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.260]
Date parts, 9am to 10am.

[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.420]
The weakest hour of the Henry shows that 9 to 10 hour.

[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.940]
I wonder why?

[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.840]
3.9.

[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.580]
At 10 o'clock we got a 7.7.

[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.880]
Then an 8.1.7.9.7.7.

[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.480]
And a 2, Rick and Suds of 4.6.

[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.660]
So anyway, what I'm trying to say to you is obviously this audience wants the music behind the thing

[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.140]
because it's entertaining, it's amusing.

[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.740]
And now Boy Geary says that the traffic of the people are having a fit.

[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.520]
And they're just to go nuts in there.

[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.160]
But the crybabies is what it is.

[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.860]
And I think, you know, there's a certain time to draw the line in the sand and put your foot down

[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.020]
and say I'm not going to whip out.

[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.460]
And I'm not putting up with that crap.

[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:12.220]
And like I said, if it's okay to have the drum meets behind the time passed in George Michael, whatever his name is at 5.20 on Channel 4,

[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.040]
then what's a little soft music?

[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.980]
It's about that level.

[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.980]
Behind the traffic to just to kind of spice it up a little bit.

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.180]
Right?

[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.320]
That's what I say.

[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.100]
I could be wrong.

[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.560]
But I think, like I said, there's a time to draw the line in the sand and don't let the...

[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.100]
once he starts muscling in here, man, then more in trouble, then it won't stop.

[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.400]
Mesh what success.

[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.620]
Screw their traffic, okay?

[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.680]
We could do better traffic, taking it out of a 10 gallon hat like they do the ratings.

[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.920]
I'm not going to make a big issue out of the thing.

[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.320]
I mean, you know, if the people, if the guys, it's a traffic watch patrol.

[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.460]
And not only that, then I get blamed for a day of grave lying, getting canned too.

[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.620]
Okay, that makes it even worse.

[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.780]
I get blamed for that.

[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.060]
He gets fired because he didn't have my support.

[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.120]
I have nothing to say about anything that goes on in his building.

[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.860]
Even on my own show, I have no control over it.

[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.500]
And he's got the emitting a host by to blame me for canning grave lines ass.

[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.720]
That takes some real big ones.

[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.480]
I'll tell you that.

[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.380]
Must have been sleeping with the elephants last night in Stole Appair, Gary.

[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.400]
That's incredible.

[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.480]
That unbelievable?

[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.760]
He got fired because he didn't have my support all these months.

[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.120]
How about the audience's support?

[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.020]
Man, it's just unbelievable.

[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.600]
You know what I mean?

[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.220]
If like a bird drops a big one, I'm one of the upper level management people's car.

[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.560]
It's my fault, okay?

[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.580]
Because the bird was listening to this show and he came like over to the building to give us a message.

[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.620]
Up with the music down with the traffic.

[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.380]
That's what I say.

[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.340]
I mean, I just can't believe it.

[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.120]
And it comes in here like all of it like this is a bulletin.

[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.160]
I mean, we've been doing this for days now, okay?

[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.980]
We had the one newscast that we knuckled under.

[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.580]
And the audience said, we're not putting up with this crap.

[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.800]
We want our music.

[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:05.180]
Don't we pay BMI and ASCAP big bucks every year so we can play music here on both of these important radio stations?

[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.380]
So anyway, the music's gone.

[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.520]
That's history.

[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.560]
It's official now.

[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.680]
They're putting their feet down, man.

[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:18.280]
In clay and stone and granite, your music has been stolen on the hourly traffic reports, okay?

[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.560]
So you can all call up Joe Brennan, Mike George, Michael Paxton, whatever his name is, Roberts.

[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.240]
And Tanya Cruz and all the others say, cry, babies.

[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:28.980]
Cry, babies.

[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.440]
Now, I want to see when Channel 4 takes the drum beats off the news at 520.

[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.760]
That's what I want to see, okay?

[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:41.660]
How come they don't went by to Channel 4 and kiss up to these guys with their inaccurate grotesque highly overrated embarrassments?

[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.960]
That's the first time I've ever seen something traffic reports.

[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.080]
How come that is?

[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:47.820]
George?

[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.840]
Oh, excuse me.

[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.060]
Oh, jeez.

[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.780]
This place, I'm Tanya.

[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.180]
See, this is what happens.

[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.400]
The book just, that's the first copy of the book.

[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:02.960]
We actually had the four hours on this show, like skyrocketing, gigantic, almost enough to give you a little ego,

[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.360]
which in this building is impossible.

[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.560]
And then, man, it's like, okay, let's put that thumb.

[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.200]
Do we have under my thumb by the stones?

[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.780]
Let's play that instead of the news at noon.

[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.000]
We do have it. Is that in there?

[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.300]
Sutsprod in that double stone thing, but I have a feeling it's probably long gone.

[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.580]
I don't see it.

[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.360]
Oh, there it is.

[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.880]
I'll be there, and that's Sutsprod's man.

[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.440]
What a guy.

[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.760]
Always like that, Sutsprod's a lot.

[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.220]
But I bet you that's not on here under my thumb.

[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.240]
There it is. It is on here.

[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.480]
Okay, we're going to play that in lieu of the noon news.

[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.460]
We're playing under my thumb.

[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.180]
It's up to George.

[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:35.920]
It's his choice.

[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.840]
You're a choice.

[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.500]
You're either pop up the news or the cassette deck.

[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:43.920]
One or the other.

[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.440]
Oh, my quick.

[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:49.960]
Yeah.

[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.920]
I mean, this is getting ridiculous now.

[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:58.020]
It's like somebody just opened up a gigantic, like a big dumpster,

[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.900]
and they turned it upside down, loaded with elephant droppings,

[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.380]
and just turned it upside down on our heads in here today.

[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.680]
As a way of saying, thanks for the great job you're doing for us.

[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.200]
There you go.

[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.580]
Man, I feel like I'm covered with it from head to toe.

[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:14.980]
Hmm.

[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:15.940]
Kind of interesting.

[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.840]
Hey, listen, I'm going to knock a lot of it.

[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.360]
They pay me enough. I'll do whatever they want.

[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.600]
Let's go.

[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.080]
I will.

[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.300]
Whatever the hell they want.

[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.720]
They want me to play Chinese polkas here for four hours every day.

[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.640]
If they just keep the checks coming, no problem at all.

[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.840]
Whatever you want, you got it.

[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.600]
Disney.

[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.800]
He does have it.

[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.460]
You can see that.

[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.040]
I'm going to look in his face.

[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.420]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:34.800]
Hello.

[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:35.720]
Hi, Neil.

[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.300]
How you doing?

[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.180]
I'm doing well.

[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.280]
I need some advice on going to the track.

[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:40.980]
I have never done.

[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:41.680]
Don't.

[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:41.800]

[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.220]
No, I just did, Joe.

[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.880]
If you go to Pompo, no, don't sit in the dining room

[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.440]
because Ralph will put your next to a bunch of loud-out obnoxious people.

[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.360]
I think I'm too far away to go to Pompo, no, because I'm in Miami.

[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:52.300]
No, you're not.

[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.160]
Why is that?

[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.000]
Just go up 95.

[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.580]
Get off an Atlantic Boulevard and make a left, and you're right there.

[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.380]
Well, no, but I thought that Haia Leo is closer and closer.

[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.180]
Well, Haia Leo is closer, but unfortunately it's not open at this time.

[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.820]
So you can go there and see the flamingos.

[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.680]
They're still doing it, but that's it.

[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.240]
Can't lose any money there now.

[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.560]
Well, that way, actually.

[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.520]
Also can't get in.

[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.200]
Both of them said it's no good.

[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.440]
Okay, so if I was what I would like to do.

[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.760]
Come up to Pompo, no, we need your money.

[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.920]
Post time, 730, Monday through Saturday nights.

[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.520]
We need your money.

[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.220]
It's a lot of fun.

[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.820]
Well, how long can you, how long?

[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.220]
It's from 730 until when.

[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.420]
So whenever you want to leave.

[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.420]
When did it close?

[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.080]
The last race is about 1115, 1130.

[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.820]
Okay, and if what I would like to do.

[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.720]
But I mean, they don't like lock the door and lock you in.

[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.600]
They would like to, I'm sure, because they want all your money.

[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.980]
But you can leave whenever you want, like I did the other night.

[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.260]
Well, give me an idea.

[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.140]
In terms of how much money I could.

[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.540]
I don't want to spend lots of money.

[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.160]
I want to bring a visiting guest up there.

[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.480]
Right.

[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.280]
And I don't know how much money I could make.

[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.540]
Make reservation in the clubhouse.

[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.980]
Call my good personal friend Ralph.

[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:44.800]
And the clubhouse.

[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.240]
Make reservation.

[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.320]
Have a nice dinner up there.

[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:46.940]
The food is good.

[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:47.760]
Get the stir fried.

[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.380]
I'm in soup.

[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.340]
How much does dinner generally run?

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.380]
Oh, maybe 15, 20 bucks.

[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.280]
Okay, so for the two of us, that'd be around $30, $40.

[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:55.820]
Right.

[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.680]
How much should, if I know absolutely-

[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.720]
You bet $2 a race.

[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.540]
You'll feel for fun.

[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.460]
You say for about $78 races, that'd be $15 a piece.

[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.520]
So that's like, for less than $100, you can go have dinner in a good night.

[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.040]
Okay.

[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.500]
And in terms of the racing since I know nothing about that-

[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.840]
That's the way you're going to win.

[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.940]
Just pick drivers, colors, or horse's names, and just bet to show.

[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.020]
If I like the way I would-

[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:16.660]
Just to show everybody.

[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.860]
Just bet $2 a show.

[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.820]
Then if they come in for a second or third, you can't.

[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.180]
Okay.

[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:20.760]
Okay.

[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.940]
Just pick a horse to show.

[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.500]
Okay.

[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.160]
And it won't get a lot back, but at least it'll give you a little something.

[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.600]
It'll be a good introduction.

[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:26.960]
Yeah.

[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.300]
Just go right up 95 to the Atlantic Boulevard in Palm Pato Beach.

[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.000]
You get off there, go left, and you go to the, uh, to Power Line, and you're right there at the track.

[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.980]
And I can do this for the two of us for around $100.

[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.000]
Less.

[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.000]
I mean, depending on-

[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.980]
I can't control how much you plunge if you get to fever and start going nuts.

[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.160]
Don't call me tomorrow's-

[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:43.580]
Oh, gee!

[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.320]
I can't help that.

[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.480]
Well, maybe I'll-

[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.260]
I give anything if I would have been there last night.

[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.220]
Man, oh, man, Jeff Gregory with 19.

[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.700]
Bet on Jeff Gregory, okay?

[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.260]
All right.

[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.440]
Jeff Gregory is God.

[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.380]
Okay.

[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.480]
Well, thank you very much.

[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.340]
Okay, good luck.

[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:57.620]
Bye.

[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.620]
She'd probably go up there and wouldn't like a trifecta for $14,000, and I'll have to hear about it.

[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.580]
My any beach.

[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.800]
Yeah, hey, Neil, I got the fiery port for you.

[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.080]
Yes?

[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.180]
I went across the street and had food at the wonderful Thai restaurant you keep talking about.

[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:12.520]
Yeah.

[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.760]
And I was sitting at a table with my back to a man, and a voice was real familiar.

[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.020]
And-

[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.040]
You went across the street here?

[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.660]
A carat across the street.

[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.740]
I am, uh, by and by the bay here.

[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.040]
You right.

[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.880]
And I heard this voice order a some young guy soup.

[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.540]
And I turned around and it was Rick Sanchez.

[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.700]
I believe it.

[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:39.820]
He never stopped talking and he finished a whole bowl within 15 minutes and just never stopped.

[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.100]
Yeah.

[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.200]
Well, you know, he's real original at Ricky Sanchez.

[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.240]
Well, that's why he-

[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.960]
See, the reason that he had to go over there, it's the only place in the area he could walk for lunch.

[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:47.780]
They won't let him drive.

[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.980]
Right, and he didn't even have a beer with dinner either.

[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.680]
At a boy, Rick, you're putting up now.

[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.420]
That's it.

[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.200]
Thanks for the report.

[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.340]
Okay, thanks now.

[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.380]
This is Newsdog Radio, 610WID, with a vast of Rogers.

[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:36.260]
You won't miss them at picnic everywhere.

[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.740]
All across the nation,

[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.300]
at a moment of patience,

[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.780]
roasting.

[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.800]
All across the nation,

[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.200]
green beef and the nation,

[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.280]
staying out again.

[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.140]
Not again.

[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:18.880]
Oh, please do not cry your cats in the forest.

[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.060]
All gables.

[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.020]
Deal.

[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:21.560]
Yeah.

[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.460]
What's your order?

[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.200]
How you doing?

[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.720]
Uh, K-Passen.

[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.180]
Got a fire report for you.

[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:26.400]
Yeah.

[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.840]
From Rick Sanchez.

[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.980]
I called you last week, told you that.

[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:31.780]
You were kind of cry-dressed.

[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.300]
Yeah.

[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.200]
Well, take this out.

[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.320]
He-

[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.800]
A couple of my friends are coming over to my house,

[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.260]
in the-

[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:38.800]
In two cars.

[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:39.360]
Yeah.

[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.800]
So, he was like six houses away from me.

[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:43.460]
And uh,

[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.740]
they both pulled down the block,

[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.740]
and they were driving a little fast.

[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.280]
Yeah.

[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.660]
So, I pulled him to my driveway,

[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.580]
and uh, he's come walking from the house and told both of my friends

[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.420]
that there's no way to drive in a residential area.

[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:56.740]
Yeah.

[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:57.920]
And uh.

[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:58.540]
Oh.

[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.420]
He didn't have his little Channel 7 skycam, did he?

[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:02.640]
No.

[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.860]
I think it's because little kids were playing outside.

[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.120]
Oh, you get so emotional, you know.

[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.040]
Yeah, it's funny.

[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.040]
Every time a pedestrian walks up the causeway here,

[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.660]
like in front of Channel 7 and IOD,

[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.180]
he sticks his head out the window and sings that.

[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.620]
That is just a dish bag.

[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.260]
He's the best.

[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.600]
He doesn't like you very much.

[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.340]
Really?

[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:26.780]
Yeah.

[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:27.640]
Why did he tell you that?

[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.360]
No, no. Well, I didn't really talk to him about it.

[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.740]
I don't want him, maybe he might be listening.

[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.840]
Well, how do you know that?

[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.940]
Because, you know, you're always talking about him.

[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.540]
Well, you're right.

[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.860]
He hates me like poison.

[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:37.960]
But he does listen every day.

[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.720]
He's listening right now.

[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.740]
Oh, well, that's great.

[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.460]
So, you know, bottom is all pretty.

[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.360]
He's listening right now.

[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:43.980]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.900]
Well, then Rick's answer is your dish bag.

[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.260]
I'm saying, I'm telling you.

[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.600]
Mine, your own business, Rick.

[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.400]
Leave these punks alone, okay?

[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.240]
Get a life.

[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.460]
Jerky zips up and down the block like he's your own road.

[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.720]
Yeah, well, that's right, because he's got the right connections.

[00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.060]
Have a great life.

[00:17:59.560 --> 00:17:59.880]
See you.

[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.320]
Oh, man, are they emotional today, huh?

[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.820]
You're confused as to what we're talking about.

[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.700]
You're enjoying the crowd, okay?

[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.760]
We just got so much going on.

[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.420]
Now, we also have a memo here from Boy Geary.

[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.640]
It says it's been determined that Neil Rogers is responsible for the following.

[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.760]
He's even doing stick-nails, doing material, Boy Geary.

[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.440]
Neil Rogers is responsible for the following.

[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.320]
Hot 105's format change.

[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.580]
All traffic tie-ups on 95.

[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.600]
Rick and Sud's bad bits.

[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.840]
Lank-thick coffee breaks at the FCC.

[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.580]
Steve Keynes' birth.

[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.960]
Manuel Noriega's complexion.

[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.680]
Sunny Fox sounding suspiciously more and more like Ronsang John.

[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.000]
Worldwide shortage of snappled.

[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.680]
Sales people asking plastic surgeons for an asshole removal.

[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.220]
Ellis Rubensigo, the demise of the purchase ratings.

[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.280]
St. John's basketball loss.

[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.660]
Not so loud to UM.

[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.720]
Patricia Bowman screaming Michael instead of William.

[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.300]
Forcing WQAM to use a microscope to speed their ratings.

[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.420]
Governor Charles, Waxi's music mix.

[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.180]
Dexter Layton and Zanemplummit.

[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.780]
Alex Betts, talent.

[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.360]
Johnny Carson's retirement.

[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.620]
W.L.Y.S. market dominance.

[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.140]
All losing horses at any race track.

[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.840]
And the firing of Dave Gravelock.

[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.200]
I'm the man from the world.

[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.720]
Sorry, David, it's all my fault.

[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.680]
This is the same programming department that hired Alex Bennett.

[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.320]
That hired Dickie Farkel against my strenuous hysterical opposition.

[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.080]
And anybody really believes that I have anything to do with who works here or not?

[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.360]
Man, it's all my fault.

[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.460]
Here's a lady in Hollywood, hello.

[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.360]
Hi, Neil.

[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.240]
Listen, I'm just calling you about, I don't know if you remember yesterday,

[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.040]
a guy called about parents.

[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.520]
Oh, yeah, he had that yellow thing.

[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.020]
Right.

[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:52.960]
He had a yellow thing.

[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.980]
You know, if you...

[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.420]
How many worked in the Chinese restaurant?

[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.080]
I hope we're really...

[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.500]
If you decide that you are going to get a bird.

[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.920]
Who said I'm getting a bird?

[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.660]
Where did that come from?

[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.740]
Well, no, because you were talking about yesterday.

[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.600]
And you were pretty impressed with the way that the bird's tossed, right?

[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.480]
That don't mean I'm going to get one.

[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.400]
Well, no, but I was going to say if you decided that you were going to get one.

[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:13.780]
Yeah.

[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.520]
You could talk to your buddy, K.C.

[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.440]
Okay, C, from the Sunshine Band is a bird man.

[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.920]
He's got like all kinds of birds.

[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:21.820]
Absolutely.

[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.980]
Yeah, he told me he's seen a bird or two in his time.

[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.120]
I guess so.

[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.140]
That's what he said.

[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.860]
I don't know what he meant by that, but I think I have a pretty good idea.

[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:36.120]
Yeah, because I think Rick Reed is his manager or was his manager?

[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:36.840]
Rick Reed?

[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:37.720]
Rick Green.

[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.460]
Rick Green, I don't know who that is.

[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.400]
I think I'm not sure.

[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:47.200]
I met him back in 1979 or something like that at Cable Car.

[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.700]
At what?

[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.940]
At Cable Car.

[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.340]
It's a pet store.

[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.580]
Oh, a pet store.

[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.520]
Call Cable Car?

[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:54.920]
Yeah.

[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.700]
Why would you name a pet store Cable Car?

[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.160]
I have no idea.

[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.260]
But they got...

[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.100]
That's my name in a flower shop, Streetland.

[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:03.720]
Right?

[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.820]
I don't get it.

[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.880]
You miss it, something.

[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:06.560]
You know.

[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.640]
It would be like naming a sandwich shop subway.

[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.800]
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.380]
Now I understand.

[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.220]
Okay, now I got it.

[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.400]
No, but I met him there with your other buddy Bill Tanner.

[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.140]
Yeah.

[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.760]
And they were there together.

[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.920]
Why do you say my buddy?

[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.900]
Why do you say that?

[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.480]
Well.

[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.360]
Now that he's into this whole mess now, everybody wants to link me.

[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.240]
You'd be like my good close personal friend.

[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:32.880]
Okay, so...

[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.000]
Am I seen twice in my life?

[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:34.860]
I'm being...

[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.300]
Not that I'm trying to distance myself.

[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.760]
You do understand, although my feet are moving rapidly.

[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.080]
Right.

[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:39.980]
Okay.

[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.040]
All right, as I said, I was being suspicious.

[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:43.820]
Of course.

[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:44.640]
Okay.

[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.740]
But as I said, you know what?

[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.580]
I don't have any idea what you're talking about.

[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.180]
You started out about getting the bird and about Casey and Big Bird and the yellow bird.

[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.220]
Oh, well, no one knows.

[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.640]
And now we're talking about Tanner and Dancing Your Pants and I don't know what's going on.

[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.800]
Casey's manager was at the cable car with Bill Tanner.

[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:04.500]
Right.

[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.720]
They were getting Casey a bird.

[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.240]
Well, don't be given that information.

[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.320]
They were at the cable car with Bill Tanner giving Casey the bird.

[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.640]
Oh, this is getting worse by the minute.

[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.620]
You may have to give a deposition on this whole deal.

[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.260]
Uh-oh.

[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:18.980]
That's a crap.

[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.380]
Am I going to get one of your infamous letters?

[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.620]
No, that's for sure.

[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.000]
Okay.

[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.520]
Well, listen, have a great day and they're a happy bird to you.

[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.460]
Okay, thank you.

[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.000]
Good bird is a happy bird.

[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:29.700]
Absolutely.

[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.220]
See ya.

[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:30.780]
Thanks, bye-bye.

[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.660]
That's what the scooting lady would say.

[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.180]
I wonder if bird's food, do you think so?

[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.060]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:36.860]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:37.580]
How are you?

[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.160]
All right.

[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.020]
I just want to call a voice in my opinion that I think the trapper, they think they suck.

[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.640]
I just down with them.

[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.280]
Yeah.

[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.320]
What they should say?

[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.120]
Like a crybaby.

[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:46.620]
Exactly.

[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.480]
You're going to be a crybaby at least to have something to stand behind.

[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.060]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.460]
They're trying to change the world.

[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.060]
Right.

[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.560]
They're like a bunch of ramen there.

[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:55.460]
Exactly.

[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.440]
They're busy out there looking for Buddha on the highway.

[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.000]
You should play the cuke you said.

[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.360]
You said that.

[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:04.720]
Yeah.

[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.780]
Two for the price of one.

[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.460]
They didn't say you couldn't play music.

[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.760]
They didn't say you could point anything else.

[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.680]
Oh, you mean you should play the cuke you'd be on it?

[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.060]
No, it's his five minutes.

[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.880]
Now, Boygary said that the news is his five minutes.

[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.980]
Now, of course, he doesn't realize all the times that certain people I don't want to mention

[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.840]
Elaine or Lisa's name went over the five minutes.

[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.640]
So over the last three years, they owe us about six and a half hours.

[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.740]
He don't understand that.

[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:25.200]
That's right.

[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.200]
Because I've been keeping track.

[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.880]
They owe us.

[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:28.740]
They owe you a lot.

[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.260]
You bet.

[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.400]
They owe me their lives, okay?

[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.700]
And what do they do to respond?

[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:33.800]
They don't even go out.

[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.400]
They wouldn't even walk across the street.

[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:41.540]
If this was a real class operation with this book that just came out today, Boygary would come in here and

[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:46.260]
whip the three dollars out of his own stupid wallet and say, I'm going to go across and bring you back to soup.

[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.840]
Just as a way of showing that we do appreciate even as minimal as it is.

[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.200]
That's right.

[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.640]
The writing to down there should all be beat.

[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.320]
Yeah, right.

[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.280]
All right.

[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:53.900]
Thanks a lot.

[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:54.520]
Have a great day.

[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.200]
Good call.

[00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:01.380]
Not a good call, a great call from somebody who's got some cajonis there, not like certain people I know in this building.

[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.460]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:03.940]
Hello.

[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.380]
Yeah, I don't know how you can say anything about the traffic reports.

[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.780]
I could just hear the poetry with those with that.

[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.420]
About the what?

[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.560]
The traffic reports.

[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.320]
West Thursday morning.

[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.520]
I'm coming across 595.

[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.100]
Traffic is beautiful.

[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.600]
And they said there's an accident at 595 and it's unbi-gek.

[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.860]
There was no accident there.

[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:24.340]
Of course not.

[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:31.380]
He didn't hear this morning that we're talking about the thing on Alligator Alley and they had the helicopter and it was and then it's heard out there was nothing there either.

[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.320]
But that all over the place.

[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.240]
It just makes stuff up.

[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.360]
Wheel of break.

[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.040]
Yeah.

[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.040]
And there's an accident.

[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.160]
I mean they told me about that accident three minutes before it happened.

[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.700]
Yeah, that's the psychic fact.

[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:43.900]
Look at that.

[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.120]
And he just got you just cut himself off.

[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.260]
And your phone just died, sir.

[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:47.620]
Okay.

[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.480]
And I could have told you that about like three seconds before it happened.

[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.780]
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale who would go get a suit but she's not close enough.

[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:54.940]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.200]
Yeah, you would do it for us.

[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:56.720]
You sound nice.

[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.440]
Yes, sir Wood.

[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.640]
I kneel.

[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.040]
Hi.

[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.620]
With all this bird talk I had this flashback.

[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.120]
I had it two birds like a year ago.

[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:05.620]
Yeah.

[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.500]
Not so very long.

[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:07.880]
But you're talking about...

[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.400]
That heart rack is really doing it today.

[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.520]
These two birds when you would the one when you would hold them on your hands.

[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.060]
Yeah.

[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.520]
He would like...

[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:18.820]
Drops down.

[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.780]
And he would like rub on you.

[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.540]
And I would like to...

[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.060]
It's like a flip one for a two-shot.

[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:24.780]
You know?

[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.220]
We had a bird here that used to do that.

[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.300]
That's why we had a gear rid of it.

[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.220]
Because like you were talking before but with a bird.

[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.180]
I don't know what he used to do.

[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.180]
Yeah.

[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.500]
Well it probably sounds like school but not all the letters are the same.

[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.540]
But it's a very mind of you that the bird was so crazy.

[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:42.360]
I hated them.

[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:43.780]
Yeah.

[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.920]
I've gotten to feel that way too the last couple of years.

[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.060]
I keep my distance.

[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.780]
They're just noisy and messy.

[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:56.580]
And they can laugh around in that cage and knock all the seeds and their other dropping all around the living room or wherever you got them.

[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.720]
And it's just...

[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.760]
You know, they're kind of useless.

[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.760]
You have one of the nice appetizers sometimes they're not too bad.

[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.160]
I guess I had a scooting bird.

[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.080]
Yeah.

[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.120]
The old scooting bird.

[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.340]
Well you have a great day.

[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.640]
And next time a bird drops up in your hand I'd wash it.

[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.660]
Thank you.

[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.140]
And your hand too.

[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:13.960]
Have a great life.

[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.940]
It's the best dip rodgers.

[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.900]
And this is News Dark Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.780]
It was a kind of an acknowledgement that the fact that I had a gay life.

[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.540]
And I understood what day 6 was about.

[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.180]
That you know that it was not about you know, a factory at all.

[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.140]
It was about violence and savagery in a lot of senses.

[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:41.620]
I think one of the things that stunned me when the record was released was suddenly I realized that I just had a lot of fun.

[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:42.760]
I found a female audience.

[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.340]
Just by being honest about the fact that you know, I have...

[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.120]
I understand.

[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.420]
You know, I understand how gay people feel.

[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.900]
I understand and I identify.

[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.600]
And I know how it feels to be a woman.

[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.460]
I know how it feels to be a woman because I am a woman.

[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.040]
You know, I won't be classified.

[00:26:59.240 --> 00:26:59.840]
It's just a man.

[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.600]
In that book I made it clear.

[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.920]
The magic part.

[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.620]
What's other men is where I'd be.

[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.180]
The magic part.

[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.360]
At Roger's all clear, I come time to stare.

[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.440]
The magic part.

[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.360]
I like his walk and I like his hair.

[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.840]
The magic part.

[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.580]
I watch his tease when he starts.

[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.200]
The magic part.

[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.860]
I just love his magic part.

[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.500]
The magic part.

[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.200]
When we're all too old, I just hold.

[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.720]
The magic part.

[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.840]
He'll lose his grip and drop the soul.

[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.220]
The magic part.

[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.740]
I see him.

[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.480]
I see him.

[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.560]
I see him.

[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.200]
Magic part.

[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.800]
Magic part.

[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.300]
Let's go to a higher lea.

[00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:58.620]
Hello.

[00:27:58.940 --> 00:27:59.400]
Hello.

[00:27:59.740 --> 00:27:59.940]
Yes.

[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:00.880]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:01.820]
Pretty good, sir.

[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:02.640]
Here's me, Gail.

[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.760]
Hey, Miguel.

[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.300]
Can't pass.

[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.240]
No, that's okay.

[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.100]
I have two problems with what I just got with you.

[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:08.660]
No more uno?

[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:09.800]
Hello.

[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.180]
Part of me?

[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.540]
I have a first problem.

[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.660]
I'd like to discuss with you.

[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.980]
I'm Svai.

[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.080]
Drey, who do you fear?

[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.140]
What do you talk to you about?

[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.600]
I'm just talking different languages.

[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.200]
Now it's your biolet multilingual show.

[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.680]
I want to get Sandy Peyton pissed off.

[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:24.240]
Okay.

[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.900]
I have two problems.

[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.780]
I want to discuss with you.

[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:27.120]
Yes.

[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.280]
What do you think about the cubist?

[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.760]
Three cubists that went to Cuba.

[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.840]
Now what am I supposed to tell you about that?

[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.340]
I don't know, then.

[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.340]
What are you supposed to say about that?

[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.240]
You think they got executed?

[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.420]
Do I think they did?

[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.220]
How to hell the whine us?

[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.980]
I think the anchors are going to independent.

[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:42.580]
I don't know.

[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:44.440]
No.

[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.200]
I had my other problem.

[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.460]
Yeah, it was a wait-a-man.

[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.320]
That's your problem?

[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:53.120]
No, I really want to know what's going on there.

[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.460]
I want to know who, if you think it.

[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.760]
No, you know, wait a minute.

[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.080]
You see, you want to know if I think?

[00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:59.380]
Well, no, I don't.

[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.280]
You're going to get executed.

[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:00.940]
No.

[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.740]
I don't know.

[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.560]
How the hell do I know if they're going to get executed?

[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:03.820]
No.

[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.460]
Well, I hope not.

[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.420]
But how do I know?

[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.660]
Why would you call me as me about whatever I think?

[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.420]
Because I don't.

[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.200]
I don't think that's why I come here and do this show.

[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.360]
I stopped thinking five years ago.

[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.860]
Okay, what's the second question?

[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.000]
I hope it's not as morbid and depressing as that.

[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:18.860]
Okay, okay.

[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.120]
What do you think about the pros and the kissing club?

[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:21.900]
There's too many people.

[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:22.660]
The one?

[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.660]
There's too many people at the kissing club.

[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.460]
You're not one of the kissing club people, are you?

[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.160]
No.

[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.800]
Then how do you know there's too many people?

[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.100]
There's too many people.

[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:32.920]

[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.420]
There's too many guys.

[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.060]
It's crowded.

[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.820]
It is jammed.

[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.160]
Jammed.

[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.080]
Well, just open the door and say jammedness.

[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.200]
They'll all run out of there like bad out of hell.

[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.080]
Okay.

[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:41.920]
Have a great life.

[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.300]
Good day.

[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.620]
Boy, this thing with the kissing club, I must be missing something over there.

[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.860]
It's like off in the corner.

[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.040]
You know where the 21st Street parking lot is there?

[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.440]
Across from Wolfees and across from what used to be the 21st Street.

[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.760]
They closed it down to a cinema.

[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.200]
In the corner there, it's where the C-girl used to be.

[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.840]
And there used to be a kosher restaurant.

[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.700]
It's been about hundreds of places called the kitchen club.

[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.720]
And I never knew it had a name.

[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.860]
And all the punky kids who can't squeeze in on South Beach at night.

[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.940]
I guess the kids who were not fashionable enough dressers

[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.740]
and good looking enough to go down on South Beach,

[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:13.800]
they all go in there.

[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.700]
And they're like jammed in there and they're like lined up.

[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.060]
And I don't know what goes on in there, but according to Little Joey,

[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.300]
probably a little grab ass, huh?

[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.420]
Hollywood, hello.

[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.400]
Hey, what to say on my right up there?

[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.640]
On my line on the computer.

[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.820]
It's just as Hollywood, why is it supposed to say something special?

[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.340]
Yeah.

[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:29.940]
Like?

[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.140]
This is Jeff, the Mr. Music Kid again.

[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:33.400]
Who?

[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.360]
You can't remember me this time.

[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:34.700]
Who?

[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.220]
The Mr. Music Kid.

[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.320]
Mr. Music.

[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:37.820]
Oh.

[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.360]
Let me tell my colleague we have to explain this.

[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:42.520]
He's joking.

[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.260]
I'm a bit curious.

[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.040]
Yes, I remember.

[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.460]
It's just having a little, I'll just funnily have Mr. Music.

[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.180]
All right, okay.

[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.640]
I have all those green label cassettes in my house.

[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.560]
Yeah, how'd you like those?

[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:51.540]
I haven't listened to them yet.

[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:52.760]
Good, don't.

[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.880]
I save up all that stuff for my retirement.

[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.700]
So in my daughtering years, I can let's say,

[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.440]
oh, listen to all this, isn't this great?

[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.960]
You know, hey, speak with him.

[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.860]
My rock and cheer, rocking on it.

[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.300]
Speaking of cable car.

[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:04.700]
Yes.

[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.860]
From the last time I called you, I had an eel in my fish tank.

[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.080]
You had an eel in your pants?

[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.920]
Yeah, I called you during the trousers.

[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.720]
I don't want to talk about eels and people with lizards and snakes.

[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.320]
I just, I find that all just.

[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:15.620]
I just want to tell you he kicked it.

[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.360]
I don't, he won?

[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:16.780]
He died.

[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.320]
I thought of my cable car.

[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.400]
It just was big quick.

[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.260]
You bought an eel of cable car and it died?

[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:21.860]
Well, yeah.

[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.160]
Now, Bill Tanna wasn't in there with you, but it was he?

[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:25.360]
No.

[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:25.780]
Good.

[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.640]
You just have to be real careful with your water.

[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.180]
You have to be careful with your eel.

[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:29.640]
Yeah.

[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.640]
Because if your eel gets into some bad stuff, man, it can die on you.

[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.520]
Hey, listen, I got it.

[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:34.960]
Is that right?

[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.200]
That's a good lesson for all of you.

[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:36.820]
Puncture out there.

[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.760]
If your eel gets into any bad thing,

[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.860]
it can die right on the spot.

[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.020]
I need to make a disclaimer right now if you don't mind.

[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:43.480]
About?

[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.020]
Every time I get a chance to call you,

[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.160]
they either let me off or I'm at home sick.

[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:49.880]
And if you don't mind.

[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.940]
What do you mean they let you off?

[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.080]
I have a day job.

[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.320]
And right now, obviously, I'm at home.

[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.560]
So I called in sick today.

[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.400]
I'm not feeling too good.

[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.160]
And let me come and call you.

[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.280]
I get what do you call, flat, the next day?

[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:02.460]
You get flat?

[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.700]
Yeah, I go back and I was like,

[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.880]
Oh, you want to sick the call?

[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.780]
Well, you get flaccid the next day?

[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.300]
Yeah, because they listen to you there.

[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.000]
Yeah.

[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.600]
And they're like, oh, you want to sick the call.

[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.460]
So I am sick.

[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.440]
Thank you very much.

[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.780]
You almost stepped on Mick Jagger in the stone.

[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:15.580]
You do realize that?

[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.840]
I say, you never liked that song?

[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.460]
You never liked under my thumb.

[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.300]
It could be the best record they ever made.

[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.540]
Please keep seeing this face.

[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:23.940]
Under my thumb.

[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.420]
You know, I do a good job on that or what?

[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:26.880]
Ooh, boy.

[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.240]
What do you mean you keep seeing this face?

[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.100]
Mick's face.

[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.660]
No, I don't want to see his face.

[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:32.720]
I like the music.

[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.440]
Okay, I don't want to see his ugly face.

[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:35.060]

[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:35.800]
But it just comes up in your mind.

[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.800]
And let's know it does not.

[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.620]
Maybe in your mind it does.

[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.940]
Maybe that's why you're ill-bied.

[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:40.560]
Yeah.

[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.280]
Okay, I was really broken up a little bit.

[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.200]
I would imagine.

[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.000]
You sound like it.

[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.740]
My wallet was real broken up over that.

[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.200]
I am.

[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.180]
Wow, how much was it?

[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.480]
Oh, let's see.

[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.240]
I think it was just under a 30 bucks.

[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.920]
You went out and spent 30 bucks for a goddamn eel?

[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:54.940]
Yeah, it was a big more eel.

[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:55.700]
It was really cool.

[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.840]
It was eating other things in the tank, which I liked.

[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.360]
You know, I put a couple things in there.

[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.680]
You know, they've pited out and all that.

[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.300]
Mr. Music.

[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.100]
Mr. Savist, you must program music on the coast.

[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:10.780]
Oh, it's a disco.

[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:11.100]
It's a disco.

[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.120]
It's a wine.

[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.000]
It's a food chain.

[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.080]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.620]
As they eat this.

[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.280]
You can have birds also, which is your topic, I guess.

[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.700]
Yeah, that's our topic today.

[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:20.240]
Bird talk.

[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.140]
I've had two cockatiels and I've had them for about...

[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.580]
I don't want to get in your personal life.

[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:23.780]
No.

[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.120]
They're right under cockatiels.

[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:26.860]
Yeah.

[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.340]
Like a mix.

[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:27.920]
They're like a...

[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.720]
Yeah, I know what they are.

[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.080]
Okay.

[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.360]
I've had them for about seven years.

[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.020]
And you might want to start off with one of those.

[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.500]
You know, they're nice.

[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.120]
They're not hard to take care of at first.

[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.320]
You know, it's if you like birds and not.

[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:38.620]
What? A cockatiels?

[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:39.680]
Peel.

[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:40.260]
Oh.

[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.080]
They're not even very expensive.

[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.140]
I have a line that is so good, but like I said,

[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:45.960]
tomorrow's payday.

[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.240]
Have a great day, Mr. Music.

[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.000]
Hey, thank you, Daniel.

[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:48.740]
Can I call somebody else?

[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:49.620]
Sure, no problem.

[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.240]
Timothy, Eve, and the bandal.

[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.340]
Who is the last one?

[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.600]
The bandal.

[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:56.340]
The bandal.

[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:56.460]

[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.200]
They're all the best people.

[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:57.760]
Amen.

[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:58.520]
Thank you.

[00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.340]
Feel better, folks.

[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.120]
Feel this.

[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.460]
546.

[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.860]
I'm 610, WIOG.

[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.100]
All the music all the time.

[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.000]
Let's change the format.

[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.600]
Okay, that'll show those three robbers in their finger too, right?

[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.480]
Let's change the format to long cockups and make their lives miserable.

[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.880]
Let's make a most-day we're never born.

[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.620]
As a matter of fact, let's just take over the coast next door

[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.960]
and play some really good music if somebody wants to hear something.

[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.720]
Not bad. I thought that was pretty good.

[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.240]
Here's the payphone and the falls.

[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:26.880]
Nail.

[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.140]
Yeah. How you doing, sir?

[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:28.880]
I'm doing okay.

[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.580]
Listen, is it the right, if I say asshole?

[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.180]
No.

[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.500]
I'm serious.

[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.020]
Why?

[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.200]
I like to call two people asshole.

[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.420]
Well, why do you want to do that?

[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.300]
Well, because I think they're very close to you,

[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.120]
and you know them personally.

[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:40.440]
Oh.

[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:41.560]
Boy, Yuri.

[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.460]
Boy, Yuri.

[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:42.940]
Yeah.

[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.880]
And Mike Disney.

[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:44.260]
Oh.

[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.400]
Big jerk assholes.

[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:46.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:47.260]
Okay.

[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.900]
I can't believe what they're doing to your radio show.

[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:52.340]
Exactly.

[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.460]
They're messing with my life.

[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.300]
That's my opinion.

[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.100]
I'm like Disney.

[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.260]
I'm not going to take it anymore.

[00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:57.520]
Right.

[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.880]
I mean, they go in there and they pull the cart out.

[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:00.760]
What in the house?

[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.740]
They come in and pull it out.

[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.600]
They tell you what to play, what not to play.

[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:03.920]
Right.

[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.380]
I mean, that cart, I mean, they go in there and they pull the trowel to trowel's cart.

[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:07.920]
What are you with?

[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.540]
What are you doing?

[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:10.520]
Oh.

[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.540]
I don't see anything wrong with that cart.

[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:12.980]
Right.

[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:13.760]
You know.

[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.620]
And then they start telling you you can't play music on the trowel.

[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:16.780]
Right.

[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.700]
And what it'll be next, and then we can't have any sample in the studio.

[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:20.660]
You know, I know.

[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.820]
No eating on the ear.

[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.880]
And I just really can't.

[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:23.840]
No phone calls.

[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.380]
No phone calls.

[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:26.900]
No music.

[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:27.740]
No carts.

[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:28.820]
No microphone.

[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.440]
No, see what they're trying to do is they're trying to knock.

[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.540]
Don't you understand?

[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.560]
They're trying to knock my numbers down.

[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.080]
I made my bonus again by a while, and they don't like that.

[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:42.160]
See, when we originally wrote the contract, the bonus thing was said at a number so high,

[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.320]
they thought they were a wise guy.

[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.720]
They figured no way in the world he's ever going to break a 7-year 25-50.

[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.740]
It just isn't done on an AM station, so they put a ridiculous...

[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.000]
And now I keep breaking it all the time, so you're going to have to pay me these big bucks,

[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.000]
and they don't like that.

[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:54.420]
Wow.

[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.640]
So they're going to do everything and their power to screw up the show, so everybody stops listening.

[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:58.700]
They want...

[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.320]
They only want 35 to 100.

[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.060]
Basically, they want people over the age of death listening, because that's safe.

[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.760]
The traffic reports sucks.

[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:05.220]
Right.

[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.980]
And they're such an embarrassment.

[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.840]
They think that the audience has an IQ of minus infinity.

[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.400]
They do.

[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.440]
They realize...

[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:12.480]
That's why they have this.

[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.560]
They realize these are the same jerks that do the traffic reports for life.

[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.100]
Right.

[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.340]
For waxy, and they're just as screwed up on those stations.

[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.940]
They have no stations, and it's like...

[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.940]
They may believe like it's their W-I-O-D traffic report.

[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:27.180]
Yeah.

[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.560]
Like they're fooling somebody.

[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:32.320]
Like the thing with Mike Roberts and Tom Pasten and Tom Roberts and Mike Pasten.

[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.460]
Like he's fooling like he's yanking our chain.

[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.660]
Like we're so stupid that we don't know it's the same guy, right?

[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.800]
Listen, by the way, I wanted this awesome mention.

[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.320]
I went by...

[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:41.700]
Wait a minute.

[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.480]
I didn't want you to have an action.

[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.020]
Okay, I don't want to step on his lips.

[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:46.660]

[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.420]
Run his tongue.

[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:48.280]
Listen.

[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:49.920]
I went...

[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.480]
The outback steakhouse over here by the falls is open.

[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:52.860]
Yes?

[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:53.800]
And I went by there.

[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.560]
I didn't eat yet.

[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.140]
Why not?

[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.500]
Well, because I have to, you know, get paid first.

[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.960]
Get that walk about soup, man.

[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.180]
Now, I was going to ask you, what is in there?

[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.300]
Because I like...

[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.300]
Got one of those menus, and we'll also take out menus.

[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.380]
Well, you know how it got the name.

[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.200]
When you look in there, you see things that walk about.

[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.100]
No, it's just a joke.

[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:08.420]
Oh.

[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.140]
Now, there's...

[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.080]
You like cheese soup?

[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:10.700]
Yes.

[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.640]
You like onion soup?

[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.340]
It all depends what...

[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.040]
Is it just...

[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.060]
Only onions and spices in all of them?

[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:17.900]
Onions and cheese.

[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.320]
Oh, it is so good.

[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.000]
I'm telling you.

[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:20.640]
Oh, right.

[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.240]
I'm serious.

[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:21.560]
Right.

[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.800]
So it's creamy and it's real thick and it's...

[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:24.840]
You'll die.

[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.560]
You'll wish you had found this years ago.

[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:27.940]
Well, listen.

[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.660]
I like to make another version of that...

[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.900]
...beijo en la polta.

[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.800]
Yeah, watch yourself.

[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.460]
Okay, no.

[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.380]
And this is...

[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:39.800]
It's still a Spanish, but it goes this way.

[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.220]
You ready?

[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.900]
Angomucho, beijo en la polta.

[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.060]
Which means I have a lot of chicken in the...

[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:46.860]
Yeah, that's okay.

[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:47.480]
That's all right.

[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.260]
And I like that.

[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:48.380]
You like that.

[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:48.500]

[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.260]
You like that.

[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.120]
You'll be a star now.

[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.640]
And you can mark this one down too.

[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.140]
And we'll wait this one until your hearts contend.

[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:54.500]
Okay.

[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:55.940]
My...

[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.380]
Boy Gary is not just an asshole.

[00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.620]
He's a phenomenon.

[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:00.980]
That's my opinion.

[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.760]
I'm like Disney.

[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.480]
Have a great life.
