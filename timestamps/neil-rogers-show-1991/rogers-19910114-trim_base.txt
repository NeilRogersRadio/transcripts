[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580]
Boy the weekend must have been wild in this joint. Did you see this room this morning?

[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.700]
Man, World War III was fought in his studio. And what's with a little cherry? You

[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.020]
notice how one of those chairs is a what do they do? I'm playing footsie over here

[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.100]
during the ballgame or something? On real what goes on here in a weekend.

[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.740]
Anyway, it's 10-07 at WIOD. Dolphins, uh, by and disappointing end to a great season,

[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.900]
but nonetheless they battled it out. There were 11 no-shows in Buffalo on Saturday,

[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.980]
Dolphin Defense. Hey listen, what can I say? It was a great game. We gave it our best shot

[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.100]
and the problem was we have no defense. Secondary was nonexistent. Mr. Big

[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.240]
Mouth, MacKire got burned over and over again, but it was great. Okay, it was a great year.

[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.280]
We went 13 and 5 and when you come right down, we lost only five games out of 18.

[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.880]
And the five games we lost were all the teams outstanding teams in the playoffs. Two

[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.560]
graders and Washington. So it was a great year and life goes on and next year's going to be

[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.080]
bigger and better and all of that stuff, right? What have we got about 38 hours before

[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.700]
D time? We should have a little thing going and I don't want to make light of, uh,

[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.060]
tragedy and grotesqueness, but I will say this we're not I can only speak for myself. I'm not

[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.500]
going to sit here and be morbid regardless of what world events are. And uh, you're going to

[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.900]
get enough of that on CNN and C span and everywhere else. So we got 37 hours and, uh, let's see,

[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.260]
51 minutes. Should we have like a countdown like they do on channel seven are really exploited?

[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.220]
Don't you like the way the media does these things? Just exploiting world tragedy and potential

[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.800]
death and the horrendous no matter what it is. They're right there to exploit it and jump on top

[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.320]
of it, right? Sally. Tom jik has got a really idiotic column speaking of stupid. I'm sure

[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.820]
Rick and Duttle have a few things to say about that about the ratings at a boy. Tom, you know,

[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.140]
one thing I'll say about Tom. Very few people are perfect, but Tom is perfect in terms of having

[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.000]
no credibility left whatsoever because it's just, uh, just reaching and struggling, Tom, it's

[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.460]
just amazing. I'm not even I wouldn't even dignify the column by reading it on the air. That's how

[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.040]
pathetic it is. I'll leave it to them. I'm sure you'll have one or two choice comments.

[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.520]
When other people don't act the way you want them to, does it frustrate you? Are you tired of

[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.880]
the press writing stories that tell the whole truth about your incredibly sorry life?

[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.940]
Want to know a great way to get back at all those scumbags? Well, now you can, at the Abe

Sir, what dressing would you like on your salad?

[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.580]

1027 at WIOD. You at basketball tonight. That's a big ratings getter. You haven't laughed

[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.340]
for yet here at Miami 730. Followed by Hank Goldberg with a special guest Abe Hershfield.

[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.700]
Well, that's why I just played that bit. Okay, Hank. If it's a little moist in here tomorrow morning

[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.540]
when we come in, we'll understand. All right. Let's take a call from North Miami Beach.

[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.940]
Neil. Yes, sir. How's life? Okay. How's life? That's an aesthetic defensive showing. I have no life.

[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.260]
I mean, Neil, what does it take for these guys? Sir, let me ask you a question. Yes, please.

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.300]
What are you crying about? What's your problem? Because I really, you know, I mean, I, how can you

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.160]
go out there and expect to win a ball game when you let up either a field goal or a touchdown every time

[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.180]
the other team, you know, get your hands on them. We lost. Okay. We lost to a better team.

[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:44.080]
Yeah. They suck. Yeah. And what about you? Do you suck? No, sir. That's not what I heard.

[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.820]
1028 at WIOD, we have two open lines in date County 751. See he's not a dolphin fan anyway.

[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.720]
He's just an OZN on provocative. You can tell up by the tone in your voice. Okay. We lost a game.

[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.300]
We're getting ready to go to war and this guy's hysterical because we lost a game. You're a jackass pal. Okay.

[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:08.140]
Here's Andrew Dice Clay for Diceroni. All right. Let's say you're eaten. You're sick and

[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:18.900]
tired of potatoes and that stovetop shit. Do like me, honey. Eat this. Diceroni. Come on. It's almost

[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.940]
as simple as you. Put the f***ing bag in the f***ing pot and you turn on the f***ing stove. You think

[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.580]
you can manage that, honey? Hey, but I've been a f***ing thing's done. So remember, Yankee

[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.260]
Doodle came to town right in on a pony. Stock a feather off his ass and called it Dice

[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:49.580]
Diceroni. Oh. Oh, no. The Tucky Tesla Street. Hollywood. Hey, buddy. Here we go. What's

[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.760]
happening? Now we got a live one. You've got a live one. I was at let's have a net on Friday.

[00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.580]
Great place. Excellent place. So Johnny in the dark. Johnny dark was there? Was he pan for it?

[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.440]
What's that? Was he pan for his meal or was he screaming? I'm Johnny dark from the coast and I

[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.820]
want to free meal. I'm broad with him. You know, I think she was foot in the tab. Probably.

[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.620]
Anyway, Carol was very nice. The food was excellent. I wanted to thank you for your

[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.860]
recommendation. It's outstanding. Service is great. Food is fantastic. They give you enough for

[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.300]
six people. You can't beat it with a stick. I was over by you on Friday. I was the one in the

[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.400]
Cowboys hat. I dropped off my check for Camilla's house and I forgot to pick up my tape. What is

[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:35.040]
the vet's number where I can get in touch with her? 751. Right. What's her number? 751. Wait,

[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.200]
she has a brown or number I know. 5, 8, 3, something. I don't know. What's the brighter? Can't even

[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.180]
think of the date number. Isn't that something? I just have a mental block. 751. Must be from too much

[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:52.760]
football. Yeah. I must be at 751. That's serious. I've called that number a million times,

[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.640]
but I have no idea what it is. Any way to operate it. They need something to do. Okay, a couple

[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.780]
other things I thought the way Sammy Smith was running. I think he looked like Bo Jackson on.

[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.860]
Well, let's not get carried away. Not like Bo, but he played a very strong game and when

[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.840]
when the chips were down in the two-playoff games, he played outstanding. He really was good.

[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.760]
Gotta give him credit when he deserves. Mark Logan sucks. Well, hey, that was a turning point

[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.600]
right there. He just coughed. He coughs it up at the big time and McCire of course, big mouth,

[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.020]
nothing to back it up. They made a fool out of him. Just embarrassing. And Andre Reed and

[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.440]
Lothin just what can I say? They made us so badly. Louis Oliver was pathetic and the defense

[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:36.140]
did not show up. Early Superbow prediction 31 17 9 is over the belt. Yeah, no sweat. See you.

[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:41.540]
Okay, Miami. Morning now. How you doing? Oh, not too bad. I went to the pizza loft last week

[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.700]
for the first time. It was great pizza. Great. Boy, there's nobody like Jeff Cohen and a pizza loft

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.700]
and that stuff. Yeah, he came over to my table and asked me how the food was. It was great and I

[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:57.760]
recommended anybody. I was talking to a girl last last night in Tallahassee and she missed going to

[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.120]
the pizza loft when she was here, but her two brothers and Neelys and I just wanted to call

[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.180]
and douchebag the Tomasco brothers. Oh, the Tomasco brothers notorious douchebags. Yeah,

[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.160]
I think they might have been in the godfather. Okay. All right, Neely, you take the hang out with

[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:17.840]
Andy Garcia. Yeah. See you. Hello again, Iraq. I'm Hasee Haseem and this is your Rocky Top 40.

[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:26.440]
Going number two this week and Seymour Hammer. So come on down to Abdul Kamalat for a great deal

[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.680]
and I knew or previously owned Kamal. Just look at this little drama dairy. She's a real

[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.840]
spitter. Yes, this is the Kamal that sells itself a gondah here today, gondah tomorrow.

[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:47.680]
Dusty Minstrels and now the Baghdad Philharmonic with their rendition of Beethoven's fifth.

[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.760]
Oh, thank that you're my horse. All right, baby. This is your buddy. Go man.

[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:14.780]
Wow. 10 54 at W.I.O.D. I must have been the final tube just hit the ground here. W.I.O.D.

[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.400]
Halsey and his in a trance. Isn't this amazing? I got two people in there and said a one and I

[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.500]
still have to answer the phone. What does that tell you? Tell me I'm quick on the triggers,

[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.280]
sir. That's where we're our users used to saying that's why the SPCA was very unhappy with him.

[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.300]
What is it now? I don't know. You tell me. Anyway, going back to the Godfather first.

[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.600]
All right. Now we're talking some serious business. Let's put the family in charge of this whole

[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.200]
operation. We can wipe them out in about 20 minutes. All right. Beginning of Godfather Part 2,

[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.940]
they briefly tell you what happened to Clemenza, but they don't really get into it.

[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.000]
When they were at the christening or not the christening, the confirmation with them in Nevada.

[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.860]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There was a confirmation?

[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.320]
What was the party with Anthony? Not the beginning.

[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.740]
Oh, he's bar mitzvah. Yeah. He's an Italian bar mitzvah.

[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.560]
Exactly. And they're in Las Vegas, in the Vagalaitajo, whatever. And you see Frank

[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.620]
Pantangeli drinking out of a hose. Yeah. And he says, Frank, oh, you look great.

[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.400]
He points to, you know, Fredo says, oh, man, Frank,

[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.160]
seeing you reminds me of the old days in New York, you know, in Clemenza and all the 70 points,

[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.420]
is to, he points, intentionally points to a black armband on his arm. Yeah. It starts like,

[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.220]
and Fredo's like, yeah, I heard about that accident blah, blah, blah. And all of a sudden,

[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.440]
Willie Cheach, he says, no, man, that was no accident, man. See what I'm talking about.

[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.620]
I need to talk to your brother about the Rosado brothers. So apparently he got wasted by the

[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.020]
Rosados. No, are you sure? I'm positive. Oh, wait a minute. But wait. You're talking in a second

[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.620]
movie. In the second movie. Okay. Yeah. But in the first one at the end, when that scene where

[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.680]
a K is in the kitchen, wiping the dishes with her schmata, he comes in there. He comes in and

[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.180]
Al Niri comes in and her kissing Michael on this thing in the big room there. And of course,

[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.640]
they closed the door. Exactly. She don't want to see Clemenza kiss Michael on the thing.

[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.080]
But then I can't blame her. All they tell you, and I had to see her like, you got with these

[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.160]
movies, you got to watch them three or four times to really catch every little thing. That's

[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.940]
correct. But I've watched it a million times and I finally have to be getting. They just tell you,

[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.060]
they don't tell you what happened. Apparently they're making it believe that some of

[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.880]
the people want to leave that Clemenza was killed by accident, but he wasn't. Well, you know, I threw

[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.740]
it in a waste basket because I had glanced at it. Somebody sent me a thing. This could answer a lot

[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.860]
of quite hurt us. All right. This is the, as it says, the Godfather tries for another hit fans count

[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:37.000]
the family casualties. And it's got pictures like Carlo and his actor, Gianna Russo Russo, who's now

[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.200]
47. It says he's been in 23 films and TV shows all as a gangster. Right. Since his thing in Godfather

[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.060]
won and he got married to Kanye, it says Russo also tours nightclubs with a singing act based

[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.660]
on the film and its music and Robert Duvel. Now let's find Richard Castelano. I'm sure it's

[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:57.720]
is it in here? It has to be. It has to be. How could we miss? Here is. It says Richard Castelano

[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:03.020]
who brought considerable weight to the role of trusted couple Clemenza was dropped from Godfather

[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:09.800]
one after or from Godfather two after he demanded an expanded role in salary died of a heart attack.

[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.200]
Oh no, Clemenza the script explained died of a heart attack in Godfather two. That's what it was.

[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.400]
And then and then she said, no, that wasn't no heart attack. Okay. It said he appeared

[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.140]
in the night of the juggler in 1980 and several TV films before dying of a heart attack at the

[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:29.480]
age of only 55 in 1988. Right. 55. So it goes to show you that fan ain't word, word sad. Exactly.

[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.700]
But that's what they said at the beginning of your show and then all of a sudden he said, I heard

[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.940]
about the heart attack and it really cheats you. It was saying, no, man, that wasn't no heart attack.

[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.620]
I think the director will play the pasta and sausage. Hey, that was surprising. I was surprised to see

[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:46.000]
El Nere in part three. Yeah. Well, I brought that was good. I kept some continuity to it.

[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.100]
I'm dying over here. Right. That's what Clemenza said. Have a great life.

[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.900]
I'm ill. Bye. See you. South Miami. Good morning, Neil. How you doing today?

[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.680]
Just like to say that the dolphins had a fantastic game by their loss.

[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.920]
And that's no really brought back memories of the snowplow game. Yeah. And by the way,

[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.100]
if Rick Raleigh is listening, I don't know if you were listening on a Friday, Mr. Football,

[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.040]
somebody called and said, well, you know, it's going to be snowing up there this weekend and those

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.000]
dreaded bills are a bunch of cheats. Wasn't it against the bills we had at Snowplow? Rick, I hate

[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.960]
to break the anus. It was against the New England Patriots years ago. We had that famous snowplow

[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.280]
incident when the guy came rushing out on the field, cleared the path and they kicked that field

[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.800]
goal to win three and nothing for New England. But it was same general northeastern area. Yeah.

[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:33.420]
And they focused that camera and that snowplow. Yeah. Scary. Going back to the godfather, Neil.

[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.060]
I don't know if you saw the most recent James Con movie, Missouri, yeah. No, I heard it's great.

[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.700]
It is great. Is it? It's very good. Is it still planned? Yes, it is. Well, I'm going to go see that.

[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:48.080]
I'm not going to go see a dancing with walls because that's, uh, it's long. Is it? It's very long.

[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.840]
How about the movie? Oh, no, Missouri is not. Missouri is a nice short two hour movie. Great.

[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.520]
I mean, I don't mind a movie being long if it's like an epic, you know, right? Like Godfather. Godfather or

[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:04.540]
Fantasia or something like that. But, uh, three hours of Kevin Costner, I don't think I can handle that.

[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:10.100]
Well, I got something for you, Neil. You might want to leave that in the background, but I got something

[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.800]
for you were asking about this other day. There it is.

[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:28.100]
Oh, I love it. All right, bring in the canollis now. Come on, everybody dig in.

[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.420]
And, Neil, that's the best. Thank you, sir. You made my week. That was, don't you love that?

[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.320]
Aren't those some of the greatest spots of all three movies where they have those

[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:42.080]
wedding and the dancing and dining and dancing? Your feet like Joey Carr is going to come right out with a canola in his face.

[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.180]
Aren't they? Or weren't you listening to what I just said?

[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.080]
Now they are. I love that. Boy, I'm so excited. He played that.

[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.980]
Che la la la la. Not bad. I had more Gannakings. She can whip up spaghetti dinner like nobody's business and looks

[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:07.780]
like she's had a few in her time too. We have an open line in Dade County, 751 pasta, 751, 9463.

[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.780]
How's the Pope feeling this morning? Give a little glass of warm tea. That'll, that'll cheer him up.

[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.420]
You notice the Pope hasn't stuck his nose in any of this yet?

[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.840]
They're probably still busy counting the money over the Earth of Attican Bank.

[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.200]
Just a little joke, it's just a joke of course. Isn't that what they always say at the Vatican?

[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.280]
When they have like 700 million missing, it's just a joke. Bad accounting.

[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.180]
There's no accounting for bad taste. Medley. Neil.

[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:46.700]
Yes, sir. Don't you think it's ironic that even though you like the Hurricane baseball team and dislike the football team,

[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.900]
it was a baseball team that canned your ass as an announcer?

[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.060]
Guess what? What? They didn't.

[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:59.460]
What a jerk. First of all, I wasn't working for the station at Curitom in Channel 33. I did for a

[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:04.700]
year on TV because Ron Fraser asked me to do them and then Channel 33 didn't carry him the next year.

[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.260]
So I hate to break the news to you, Jackass. Wrong information. Okay. Bad information.

[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.800]
But I'm glad that we're making your day. You can answer it. I'm not going to punch it up.

[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.600]
Now, why are you so tentative in there? Now she's getting gunshot. She's like,

[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.420]
said I'm Hussein, she's getting a little gunshot. She goes to pick it up and she looks at me like,

[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.100]
oh, is he going to pick it up first? Like we're in some kind of a contest here.

[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.200]
Here's a pig report.

[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.500]
Yo, let's get to the important stuff. Okay. We got them. We got them. They're lined up.

[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.080]
All right, the world is safe. I'm sorry. I said, at least we know the world is safe now.

[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.620]
Yeah, lined up, Cypress Creek, Northbound 95. They got one in the bushes.

[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:45.580]
His home is radar thing and he's picking them out and then they got about count of nine

[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:51.120]
up the road, pulling them over and he tells them what he told them and then they give you the thing.

[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.340]
Yeah. And then you got to go and give them the money.

[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.800]
Unreal. Can you believe it? Well, like I said, we're safe for all time.

[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.780]
Oh, yeah. We're about to go to war and they're about a couple of speeders.

[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:07.540]
Outstanding. And the sad thing is that's part of the un-95. That's a section of the 95 that's

[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:15.560]
been finished. And it's about 19 lanes across. And the speed limit, I think, is 45.

[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.020]
So I think it's... Well, it's another ripoff. It's not really these planned to let's do some

[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.460]
business deals. Well, look, for sure on money, a poor lot and he came in and found out the state

[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.360]
doesn't have any money. And we've got to cut his salary in half and everybody's getting cut.

[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.280]
Cyphe knife's going to have a good time next four years. Oh, yeah. Have a great day, pal.

[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.240]
Wait, wait, wait. Okay. We can handle it, all right? Now, you'll appreciate this. I'm heading down

[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:42.480]
the turn pipe. Honey, Alexa, this is a couple of weeks ago. Late at night, you know, there's no game,

[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.420]
nothing going on. I get off. I want to pick the toll. It's a quarter. I give them a five dollar bill.

[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:52.600]
Girl looks me straight in the face and says, I don't have change. Yeah. Do you have anything smaller?

[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.040]
I think I have something a lot smaller. I think you need five. Have a night.

[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.220]
Great. Outstanding. That's our best call of the year so far. And it's only the 14th of January.

[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.860]
We have an open line on the star line. How's he? Look at that star. IOD. If you have bell

[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:15.220]
soft mobility and a phone that works once in a while, give it a shot star. IOD. We pay the

[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:24.960]
freight because the sisters are low. This weekend on MTTV, many's meets West during an MTTV

[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.360]
world exclusive. It's Paula and Abdul.

[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.240]
They need bucks for petroleum.

[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.020]
Paula and Abdul, not live on the year's hottest most volatile tour.

[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.520]
Alpha Sinner Rack.

[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:50.500]
Maybe since we never ever agree. We like your rackies.

[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:56.160]
And we like so. You'll hear it's Kuwait that you're shoving. Forever your oil.

[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.700]
Whole hearted shake. And of course, I say we move forward. We say you stay back.

[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.680]
The world's together. And they're off the sidthin rack.

[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.560]
What do they? The Amazon Rack Tour. This weekend on MTTV sponsored by Fruit of the Dooms.

[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.500]
Just when you thank you know what it is. It's MTTV.

[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.120]
Maybe it's I wonder if it's Hock Shamir's wife, those Connie Corleon. Maybe she could feed some

[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:30.820]
stale creplach to us. So, that could do it. Miami. Yeah, Neil. Yeah. I wanted to ask you if you know

[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:36.260]
about the only Corleon that gets killed and the guy that did it gets away with it.

[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:43.060]
Remember in the first movie Michael Corleon goes to Italy, he gets married. Yeah.

[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.840]
Apologna. And the guy blows her away in the car. Yeah. He's never been killed.

[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.540]
That's right. They never caught up with his act or the rest of me.

[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.640]
I read the book to Godfather many, many years ago. So did I.

[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.120]
And in the book, I think they have they catch up with him in Buffalo, New York. He was a piece of

[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.820]
real good place for him. Yeah. You know, he owned a piece of place. Yeah. And again, while the guy shows up

[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:14.740]
in the middle of life, I remember the bomb you put in the car. Right. They blow him away. Yeah.

[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:20.000]
They put a little extra pepperoni on his pie. That's it. You got it. All right, Neil. Have a great

[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:29.640]
life, sir. I get my Miami. Pull him out. Our first crank call of the day. Yes. I'm sick of

[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:35.040]
hearing about this guy. Yeah. Okay. Whatever it is, we don't want to we don't care. We have an

[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.800]
open line in date, 7519463. And of course, that answers the question why the chicken crossed the

[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:45.900]
road in Little Haiti. Let's go to Bokka. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yes. I'm going to say me, my wife

[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.340]
went out. I took two of your suggestions. We saw the Godfather Part Three. Yeah. And we also went

[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:57.700]
to the Outback. Yeah. What a quenella. Uh huh. Well, that yeah, it was I'll tell you what, we had a great

[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:03.820]
time. Neil. Great. I'll tell you the Godfather Part Three, one of the true classic movies. Right. I mean, the way

[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:09.040]
that it was just done and well done, it kept you on the edge of your seat. Yeah. You know, I was

[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.060]
listening last week and they were talking about some people with a hand people talking beside him

[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.100]
the whole time. And we had two people and they kicked him out. Good. You know, they were like, we don't

[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.260]
want your time in here. What were they doing? They were just steady talking. I guess they hadn't seen

[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:28.220]
the first two. What were they over a hundred? About 90. Yeah. Oh, gee. Close to it. What she do, my ring.

[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:33.400]
Huh? What's that going on? Man. But I'll tell you, you know, you're talking about that walk about soup.

[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.040]
That was some classic orgasmic. Oh, man, that was some of the best stuff I ever take. Just like to jump

[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.840]
into a gigantic tub of that and just sit back with a big smile on your face and just to keep looking.

[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.140]
Oh, yeah. I mean, it was great. And also we also mean my wife split one of those uh,

[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.580]
thunders from down under. Yeah. Chocolate thunders. It was so rich. I haven't been able to uh,

[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.220]
partake in that for obvious reasons, but it looks tremendous. Yeah, I mean, it was so rich. It made

[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.120]
my teeth hurt. Good. I mean, you know, you know, it's, you know, it's good when it does that. That's

[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.400]
right. Uh, the food too. Yeah, you're on that nutrition system, are you? Yep. Yeah, how's that work?

[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.460]
It's seven pounds in five days, sir. Seven pounds. I'm going to fade away. I'm going to be like, I'm

[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.860]
going to, I'm going to go a little extra. I'm going to get way down there so I can indulge in some of

[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.940]
these other things again. Do you remember not too long ago? They were talking about that uh, they

[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.820]
said it wasn't good for yourself. Well, guess what? You know, that's a, who, who started that? Our

[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.380]
friends over here next door channel seven. I don't know. I don't remember what that was. Yeah,

[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.160]
well, they were the big ones over there next door. And now what's their credibility? I don't know.

[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.080]
Penny Daniels. She's another one. Too many, too many trips to Sally's house.

[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.400]
I hear you have a great day, sir. Yeah. One more thing. Can I say hi to somebody? Sure.

[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.520]
I'd like to say hi to Bill. I mean, should be driving around in his truck. Okay. Hi, Bill. Thanks. Okay. Bye. Bye.

[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:20.780]
Yeah.

[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.100]
Yeah.

[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.480]
Yeah.

[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:26.480]

[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:26.540]
Yeah.

[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:26.560]
Yeah.

[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:26.560]

[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:26.620]
Yeah.

[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:26.620]

[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:26.640]
Yeah.

[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:26.700]

[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.100]
Yeah.

[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:27.160]

[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.220]
Yeah.

[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.220]
Yeah.

[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.120]
Yeah.

[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.400]
Yeah.

[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:45.760]
Yeah.

[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:46.280]
Yeah.

[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:46.280]

[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:46.280]

[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:52.300]
Okay.

[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:56.300]
Okay. 12.06. The WI would do. We got a momentous announcement to make about Camilla.

[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.420]
Sounds also a big announcement about Rick Sanchez. It's Rick Chambers.

[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.940]
Whose real name is goo.

[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.760]
G-U-E.

[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:05.940]
Gui.

[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.380]
Fui, I knew he Rick, Rick Chambers. So Rick Sanchez, we're still trying to find out. I think his name is Schwartz.

[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:17.220]
Oh, and guess what? There's a little rumour. Oh, I knew I had some big news that I've been holding back.

[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:23.000]
Sheriff Nick, I have this on very good authority. Was that a social function over the weekend?

[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:29.120]
And someone I know very well was also there and heard him talking about music and about

[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.900]
two-live crew. And he doesn't like them, but he does like...

[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:39.600]
They were enslaved in Egypt, massacred in Germany, and made fun of in Miami.

[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:46.240]
Now, they're here live for one night only. Two-live Jews.

[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.920]
Oi. Oi. Oi.

[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.740]
We were posting up some bagels just as peaceful as you please when in Boxer of Gervals said,

[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.600]
hey, yet we bank receives. They dragged us both away. They slaughtered our best stocks.

[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.380]
Said, hey, were you two Jews ago and there'll be plenty of locks.

[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.840]
Two-live Jews. Catch the tour before they get caught.

[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:13.340]
Two-live Jews. Tickets available at all deli counters and hotick-famaster locations.

[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.200]
Another concertation camp production.

[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:23.220]
I found her on the streets. I'll play that a little bit just in honor of Laura who put us over the top.

[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.720]
Now, I heard that not the card I just played, but I heard that the Sheriff Nick is very big

[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.580]
into two-live Jews. So I guess Eric, what's his name? Kumaro.

[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.380]
Eric, what's his name? The Paine and he asks.

[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.060]
George, Eric, from two-live Jews.

[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:45.100]
Lambert? Lambert. Why do you ask in such a, uh, excuse?

[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.280]
Hey, you know kids, I'm hungry. Let's stop for lunch.

[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.440]
Yeah! Hey, Dad, let's go to the big nose.

[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.360]
All right.

[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:52.920]
Yeah.

[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:59.580]
Come to zero and all dear burger joints, bring your family to the nose.

[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:04.000]
Yes, it's zero-no burger joint. Fast food from a big nose.

[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.760]
Just drives through the right nostril and place your order.

[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.580]
Funcher, can I take your orjair?

[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.440]
At zero-nose, you can get a big hawker with cheese, french fried nose noodles,

[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.140]
and a large punch in the nose.

[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.780]
The offer just 99 cents.

[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.160]
That's Buca Samayers.

[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.320]
Hey, Mom, zero-nose cooks everything in local estral shnazzola.

[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.580]
So follow your nose to the big nose.

[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:24.680]
Zero-nose.

[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.560]
Zero-no burger joints when you're hungry.

[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.040]
Pick the nose.

[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.440]
Okay, 1216 and WIOD.

[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.640]
I think I'll do that other one a little bit later and we got a real stride.

[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.680]
So we got everything going on.

[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.680]
We also got a remote at Gulfstream Thursday, February 7th.

[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.220]
Saviour pennies and dimes, George, you can make another 20 bucks.

[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.220]
Thursday, February 7th.

[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.860]
We'll do our show from Gulfstream Park.

[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.860]
There's Mr. Football in the other room with this big Buffalo Sucks T-shirt on.

[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:53.340]
Beautiful.

[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.240]
And he's got it on his underwear too, right on each cheek.

[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.880]
On one cheek it says Buffalo and Sucks on the other cheek.

[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.440]
Anyway, come on in here a second.

[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.100]
I want to get an update on what happened Saturday at JRS.

[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:09.200]
And don't forget, also we got word that the Super Bowl is on channel 10, not on NBC.

[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.640]
I don't know, I don't think that's right, but that's what our audience said and they're full of crap.

[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.900]
But anyway, how was the crowd Saturday?

[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.420]
One of the things that I was racing as fast as I could when I heard your right neck right.

[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:25.200]
Heard your plea for money and Tony who volunteered to get us some stakes

[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.480]
and we didn't take advantage of him, said, well, at least I can do is give $50 to Camilla South.

[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:29.740]
Great.

[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.400]
So I have that 50 army.

[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.600]
So that's $110,058 bucks.

[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.140]
You got it.

[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:34.580]
Wow.

[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.020]
Yeah, we're doing it.

[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.800]
There were over 1,000 people that showed up for our little,

[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:40.900]
we had at two levels.

[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:41.360]

[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.480]
600 on top, 400 on the bottom.

[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.420]
And there wasn't two levels in the building.

[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.260]
Oh, it was great.

[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.780]
And 1,000 people, 600 more on top and 400 more on the bottom.

[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.700]
And a couple of them were just watching.

[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:52.320]
Yeah.

[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:52.840]
Okay.

[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.500]
Well, it was a great game.

[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.300]
It was all I can say.

[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.900]
That rich came over the house, brought a little submarine sandwich that he indulged in.

[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.680]
It was still a horse.

[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.520]
I mean, it was a wonderful game.

[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:06.840]
Yeah.

[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.900]
I went nuts when Dupor got that touchdown.

[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.860]
Boy, it was just that was a great run.

[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.640]
And I walked into a gas station Saturday night.

[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.880]
And I had on my Zubas and my dolphin sweater.

[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.500]
And this girl says, you ought to be ashamed to wear that the way they played today.

[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.660]
See, people like that are what's wrong with the whole world.

[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:25.900]
Okay.

[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.200]
If I was not empty, I would have left.

[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.400]
People like that ought to be stuck with it.

[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.680]
It's not over the bag, that right now.

[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.380]
Millions have converted for fun and profit.

[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:41.600]
Now, you too can turn your pagan ways around at Earl Stripes's.

[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.280]
We'll convert Eddie Goye for just 99.95.

[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.260]
That's right.

[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.760]
Listen to one of our successful graduates.

[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.560]
For Kim, I shall own Malachem, I shall own.

[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.060]
At Earl Stripes's, we'll convert anyone into a Jew.

[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.340]
Malachem, Haka Doosh, Baruchu.

[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.900]
Translated means, sorry, I must have left my wallet at home.

[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.900]
Millachem, I shall own Malachem, I shall own Malachem.

[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.560]
Translated means, stewardess, did you make sure to give me a kosher meal?

[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:17.740]
Millach, I shall own Malachem, I shall own Malachem.

[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.120]
Translated, yes, Rabbi, the check is in the mail.

[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.100]
Yes, you too can convert into a Jew for just 99.95 at Earl Stripes's.

[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.820]
Act now and get a free Yardside Campbell for just $10.

[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:34.720]
Earl Stripes's, we'll convert any Goye for just 99.95 or more if we can.

[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.680]
Haka Doosh, Baruchu.

[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.140]
How the hell am I supposed to read backwards for Christ's sake?

[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.080]
Stand under your head, Laura.

[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.140]
At 12.26 at WIOD, we have an open-line at Browr,

[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.520]
where some impatient slob just hung up 5 to 4 WIOD.

[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.380]
We do have a lady, I hope she's still on there.

[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.920]
I pray in Margate.

[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.100]
She's gone.

[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.340]
Okay, we had a lady in Margate, she disappeared.

[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.560]
Oh, what we would give if she would only call back

[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.420]
in her two open lines in Browr right now.

[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.360]
She'd just be so nice to call back 5 to 4 WIOD

[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.300]
because we need the soothing sound of a woman's voice, right?

[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.420]
A lady in Kindle.

[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.060]
Hello.

[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.020]
Oh my God, I can't wear all the ladies today.

[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:09.820]
I don't know.

[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.540]
Are they all hiding under the bed or something?

[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.360]
What's going on?

[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.300]
They're all exercising.

[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.040]
God.

[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.460]
So how are you?

[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.640]
I'm doing okay.

[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.780]
I saw the Godfather.

[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.440]
It wasn't bad.

[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.160]
I wouldn't say it was like a classic or anything.

[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:22.680]
You wouldn't?

[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.520]
No, it was okay.

[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.480]
Well, okay is better than El Stinco.

[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:26.900]
Yeah.

[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.680]
I like good fellows though.

[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.560]
I like good fellows a lot, but not as much.

[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.140]
Really?

[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.640]
Well, it's hard for me to sit that long without getting it.

[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.100]
I mean, when somebody's got that many zits,

[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.200]
it's hard to keep concentrated on the plot, you know what?

[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.560]
But I don't know.

[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.000]

[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.140]
He looked like who's that guy in the football,

[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.440]
the guy from Boston.

[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.460]
Will McDonough on a bed.

[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:45.740]
I don't know.

[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.680]
It's thing about football.

[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.320]
Well, that's okay.

[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:47.680]
You're lucky.

[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:47.960]
You're lucky.

[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.020]
Movies, I'll talk movies about.

[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:50.820]
I know I think about football.

[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.200]
Okay.

[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.820]
Anyway, I like the Godfather.

[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.340]
It was all right.

[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.960]
And I didn't think a couple of daughter was that bad.

[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.140]
I know you couldn't stand her.

[00:30:59.300 --> 00:30:59.620]
I know.

[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.220]
I know.

[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.200]
She did a little plastic surgery.

[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.680]
Other than that, she looked Italian.

[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.180]
Yeah.

[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.060]
Did she?

[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.980]
Maybe they ought to send her to Iraq and put a paper sack over her head.

[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.320]
She could say it's in the bag, Dad.

[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:13.140]
What?

[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.840]
Acting, I don't know about the acting ability, but weak.

[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:16.860]

[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:17.720]
Week, yeah.

[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.520]
Her acting and her appearance were like what El Martino's voice

[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.520]
in Godfather wanted him to voice his weak.

[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.040]
Week.

[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.260]
Remember that?

[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:24.860]
Yeah.

[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.640]
I'm trying to rent those movies.

[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.600]
You can't get them anywhere.

[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.420]
You haven't seen them?

[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:29.800]
Sure has.

[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.760]
But I want to see them again.

[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.520]
Well, everybody and their brother has got.

[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.880]
In fact, Stan Major better bringing back Godfather

[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.160]
to one of these days soon.

[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.540]
Came over and borrowed.

[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.660]
I had a virgin copy.

[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.720]
Never even taken out of the plastic thing.

[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.680]
Plastic or plastic?

[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.160]
Plastic.

[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.280]
And maybe it exploded in his VCR.

[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.080]
Well, it's a sad situation.

[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.360]
So I figured I'd, yeah,

[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.040]
if I can watch the Godfather one and two while the war begins.

[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:53.480]
Exactly.

[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.580]
The Strat makes sense.

[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:54.820]
Right.

[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.100]
Be some good escapism for you.

[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:57.600]
Definitely.

[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.540]
Better than watching Channel 7 News.

[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.440]
I try to avoid that at all costs.

[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.760]
You have excellent taste.

[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.400]
Have a great day.

[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:04.980]
Thank you, too.

[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:05.380]
Thanks.

[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.660]
1234, we had a nice lady caller already one.

[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.720]
And it's only a two and a half hours into the show.

[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.340]
Boy, the women are really just laid back, you know what?

[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.100]
Just very recalcitrant.

[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.180]
There's an open line in Dade County.

[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.280]
751.

[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.380]
Broad.

[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.280]
That you're getting gone.

[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.580]
751, the WIOD.

[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.160]
Some of that horrendous sexist crap

[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.840]
that Alex Bennett and the Pendulate used to spew on that show.

[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.080]
Remember that when he was your man?

[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.860]
Talk about a sexist pig.

[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.920]
I need some cheesecake.

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.480]
I need some cheesecake.

[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.360]
We got your cheesecake right here, Alex.

[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.060]
Put it on your head.

[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.340]
People think some hair grew back.

[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.060]
Markets down 33 and a half points.

[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.700]
And we'll continue probably sliding throughout the day

[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.520]
in the days to come.

[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.800]
I would sure seem that way.

[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:51.520]
Please, Sue.

[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.480]
Great party, honey.

[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.560]
We like this.

[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.760]
Everyone here is kind to take.

[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.460]
We do.

[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.200]
Hi.

[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.220]
They said you tried to do your derbs.

[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:00.940]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.860]
The clam dip was delicious.

[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.000]
Clam dip.

[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.120]
But we're not serving any clap dip.

[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.380]
Let's go home.

[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:11.340]
No.

[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:16.220]
From the twisted nose of George Mucous,

[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:20.160]
it's attack of the very congested people.

[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.420]
Look out.

[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.680]
It's gonna pull.

[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.620]
Face down a book by Ian Fleming,

[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.380]
directed by Sneez and Spielberg.

[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.620]
Oh, no.

[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.480]
There's something in this.

[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:35.940]
Sneez.

[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.340]
No.

[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:37.380]
Ah.

[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.720]
You tell yourself it's only a movie.

[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.620]
But it's not.

[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.560]
Attack of the very congested people.

[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.760]
All right, it does.

[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.240]
It works.

[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.140]
Ooh.

[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.000]
It's a, all my little balls losing its voice there.

[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.560]
1239 and WIO.

[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.540]
Do you all love these things?

[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.500]
Isn't it amazing how I found it in that mong and a cabinet

[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.820]
in the farm and a copy cabinet?

[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:03.960]
Oh, great.

[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.520]
Here's a mobile in moral gables.

[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:07.320]
Hey, bro.

[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.660]
This is Bo going to Buffalo.

[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.980]
Hey, Bo, how you feeling?

[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.260]
Got that little hip pointer, huh?

[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.260]
Yeah, it hurts a little, Neil,

[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.900]
but I'm gonna go there and run what

[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:14.640]
mind me couldn't do.

[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.560]
I'm gonna run right up there.

[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:16.060]
You know what?

[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:16.620]
Yeah, I bet.

[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.680]
And I'm gonna wait a Buffalo to get a Super Bowl ring.

[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:20.560]
Okay.

[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:21.800]
Talk to you later, Neil.

[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.180]
See ya, bro.

[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:22.620]
All right.

[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.140]
1240 at WIO.

[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.420]
The Bo is a little pain there.

[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.240]
And of course, OJ.

[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.460]
OJ and Bo walking off the field together.

[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.180]
Wasn't that something?

[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:29.720]
Wow.

[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.720]
Give me a break.

[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.280]
We have an open line in the Star Line,

[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.400]
Star IOD.

[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.680]
Let's go to Pompano.

[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.580]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:38.180]

[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.100]
Listen to talk about a lighter side.

[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.460]
The cops, they got a couple of good players

[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.780]
in me and my partner were talking.

[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:44.280]
Yeah.

[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.600]
I was wondering if you remembered.

[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.840]
They got Danny Jackson as another picture.

[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.520]
George Bell?

[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.600]
They got George Bell,

[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.860]
but didn't they get another picture?

[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.020]
We got, um,

[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.880]
I thought they'd read on they.

[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.320]
We got Danny Jackson.

[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.760]
We got the George Bell.

[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.580]
And we got one other, uh, we got, um, what's his name?

[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:01.340]
Yeah, what?

[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.320]
Who's the other guy we got?

[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.960]
What's that other picture they got?

[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.160]
Who's the other guy we got?

[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.480]
We got Danny Jackson, George Bell.

[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.780]
We got three guys.

[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.740]
And there was another picture and we couldn't remember

[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.620]
who it was either.

[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.260]
Um, Sandy Kofax.

[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.000]
Yeah, right.

[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:14.700]

[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:15.560]
He's still alive?

[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.560]
Is Sandy still alive?

[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.140]
Are you nuts?

[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:19.680]
Of course.

[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.540]
There's a drive going back.

[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.380]
It might be headed.

[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.260]
Cops were.

[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.440]
Cops were.

[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.700]
Cops were.

[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.560]
I can't, I can't think of it.

[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:31.980]
Isn't that something?

[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.180]
My mind is like a blank.

[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.360]
Yeah, because we were,

[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.640]
well, no, we had like three major signings.

[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.400]
I've got first Danny Jackson and George Bell from Toronto.

[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.360]
And then we, uh, oh, uh, from Houston,

[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.120]
we got the Dave Smith relief pitcher.

[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:44.980]
Oh, that's right.

[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:45.400]
That's right.

[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:45.900]
That's right.

[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.760]
It was a relief pitcher.

[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.600]
Yeah, the outstanding relief, uh,

[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.840]
fireman from Houston, who's about a hundred years old.

[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.000]
They're going to be great this year.

[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:52.800]
I think so.

[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.460]
With Dawson and Bell in the outfield.

[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.060]
And Desenzo in between him like a Salami sandwich?

[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.580]
Well, they were thinking about getting rid of Jerome, aren't they?

[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.640]
Well, please, well, it's not too late yet.

[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.040]
Not too late yet.

[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:03.880]
Put them in the desert.

[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.660]
Well, they're going to be number one this year.

[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:05.920]
Amen.

[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:06.640]
Thanks a lot.

[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.200]
See you.

[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.360]
Yeah, it's going to be a hell of a year, right?

[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.520]
Holy cow.

[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.220]
You bet.

[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.280]
It's a 1242 at WIOD.

[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.640]
We have an open line in Broward.

[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.320]
What's the day today?

[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.860]
The 14th of January.

[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.440]
Spring, it's like about five weeks away.

[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.700]
When spring baseball camps open,

[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.280]
isn't that what everybody's concerned about?

[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.760]
Isn't that what we're counting down to?

[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:26.780]
You bet.

[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.340]
Hi, Alia.

[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.340]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:28.840]
Okay.

[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.760]
You know, I love the Godfather movies, but I didn't like this one.

[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.960]
It's good as I like the other ones.

[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.120]
Well, that's the way it goes.

[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.880]
No, it was all right.

[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.440]
It wasn't the worst movie in the world.

[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:37.920]
Yeah.

[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.240]
But, you know, I just thought it was just like incomplete

[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.920]
few of the scenes that they showed in the commercial.

[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.000]
You didn't see in the movie.

[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:46.940]
Right, that's true.

[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:47.560]
That's true.

[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.920]
In fact, the whole commercial, uh,

[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.100]
more than the hell were those scenes.

[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.540]
Yeah, so, you know, then, uh,

[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.040]
I thought it would just go on a little longer.

[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.980]
Yeah, another 45 minutes.

[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.620]
It would have been great.

[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.240]
A little bit rushed.

[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.400]
Yeah, that made it.

[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.080]
Some of his, uh, wait around and kill a few people and stuff like that.

[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.660]
Now, let Connie throw her wait around.

[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.460]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.300]
She was the one boy and he was like,

[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.360]
small, but he's still learning.

[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.840]
But Connie is the seasoned,

[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.100]
murderous now.

[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:10.920]
She's tremendous.

[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.180]
You know, a couple of daughter,

[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.980]
see how enough lips there were.

[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.160]
I think John Holmes could have got lost in that.

[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:16.680]
Unbelievable.

[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.200]
She's, she's, I'm glad she's dead.

[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.300]
At least, you know, she can't come back.

[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.040]
Unless they bring her back like, you know,

[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.320]
what he's trying to remember.

[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.700]
Like, Riva on a guiding light.

[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:25.480]
You bet.

[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.780]
All right, in closing, I have something for you, right?

[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:28.920]
Yep.

[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:29.540]
Okay.

[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.840]
Take that off.

[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.380]
It's off.

[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:31.820]
It's off.

[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.360]
Just relax.

[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.220]
Don't get pushy.

[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:33.780]
Here we go.

[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.380]
I am the answer,

[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.380]
all right.

[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:37.340]
The parade is done.

[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:37.880]
All right.

[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.500]
Take care, Neil.

[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:38.920]
Okay.

[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.080]
Well, that's good.

[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:40.940]
We're still planning.

[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.500]
We should be.

[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.360]
It was a great season.

[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.100]
And all you negative people

[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.260]
who want to seize upon the fact we got beat the other day

[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.620]
and our defense stuck to join out.

[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.060]
Hey, up yours.

[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:49.560]
Okay.

[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.260]
But your front running douchebags.

[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.360]
We don't need you people.

[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.120]
We need to real fast.

[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.160]
Yeah.

[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.920]
Come see, stand, come see,

[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:57.900]
high on feet.

[00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:58.820]
All right.

[00:37:59.100 --> 00:37:59.660]
I'm Bob Villa.

[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.340]
And I hope you join me this weekend

[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.080]
for another edition of this old star,

[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.800]
the show where we remodeled Hollywood

[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.680]
has bins into hot new properties.

[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.020]
Last week, we converted sunny Bono

[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.360]
from Shares X Husband into the Mayor of Palm Springs.

[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:12.680]
Share.

[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:13.440]

[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:14.280]
Cool.

[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.100]
I've got some doing.

[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:15.460]
I'll tell you.

[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.020]
This weekend, we'll continue our Donnie Osman project.

[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.760]
As I bring in a demolition crew

[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.540]
and have Donnie's entire family torn out.

[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.060]
So, see you this weekend on this old star.

[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.200]
Right here on PBS, your public banking station.

[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:30.180]
It's...

[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.780]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.300]
Couldn't have said a better myself.

[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.160]
Bob Villa.

[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.060]
Say it right.

[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:35.440]
Villa.

[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.220]
I hate the way he says that.

[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.740]
Making a ton of money with Sears now,

[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.960]
but the man is just Villa.

[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.380]
Why do you say that, Bob?

[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.600]
I think he's built too many toilets myself.

[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.420]
That's a problem.

[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:46.800]
Anyway, let's go to Miami.

[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.320]
Shall we?

[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.100]
Hello, Neil.

[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:48.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.420]
Sounds pretty lively for a Monday.

[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.440]
Yeah, not too bad.

[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.720]
Before I forget, the main reason I called

[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:58.620]
was to find out what's available on the Camilla's house material

[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.780]
and how to send in a contribution.

[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:01.800]
What's available?

[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.700]
Yeah, the T-shirts, the tapes.

[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.920]
Yeah, well, the best in the Eel tape is a 20 bucks or more.

[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.600]
And the T-shirts are like...

[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.860]
Well, it was 200 bucks by mail.

[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:14.420]
Uh-huh.

[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.580]
That's the T-shirt of a...

[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.340]
And the tape, yeah.

[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.500]
T-shirt and the tape.

[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.540]
200 for the T-shirt and the tape.

[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:19.840]
Right.

[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:20.500]
Okay.

[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:26.440]
And the reason the dolphins passed defense looked so porous the other day was that

[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:31.200]
they were blitzing too much and that left old Lewis out there by himself.

[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:31.700]
Blitzing.

[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:32.920]
I got news for it.

[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.840]
They were blitzing, man.

[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.620]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.600]
They sure weren't accomplishing anything.

[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.040]
They should have been blitzing.

[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:38.980]
Blitzing, yeah.

[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.340]
Should have eaten blinces and the...

[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.000]
What you call it?

[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.140]
Canolees.

[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:43.560]
Yeah.

[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.320]
Okay, sir.

[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.360]
Big time, Neil, and I enjoy the show.

[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:46.780]
Thank you.

[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.600]
Let's take a pig report on the Star Line.

[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:49.760]
Hey, Neil.

[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.200]
Yeah.

[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.260]
What's going on?

[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:53.220]
Hello.

[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:53.980]
We're here.

[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:54.460]
We're here.

[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:54.960]
Oh, okay.

[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.760]
When you start with what's going on, you always get that smiley response.

[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.100]
I listen to the true fingers fans like everybody else.

[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.820]
I hate these people who say they were lucky when they beat Kansas City.

[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.480]
I remember them saying people are the ones who said something about the

[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.220]
perfect season.

[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.020]
Hey, pain no attention to those people.

[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.140]
Okay, those people are like sewage.

[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.020]
They're like sludge.

[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.020]
We should just put them down in the sewers and flush them away with the rats.

[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:17.620]
That's true.

[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.960]
I want to ask you one thing.

[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.080]
I just started listening to you and I hear you're a bag of span.

[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.300]
You've got to like go out the bag of span.

[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:23.800]
You bet.

[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.440]
A real place with living and breathing people and a lot of fun and excitement.

[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.980]
That's that's what's at.

[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.240]
Okay, so I went out there six months ago.

[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.240]
Stayed to Mirage was a really nice place.

[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:33.580]
Yep.

[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:38.120]
What I wanted to know is maybe I'm wrong, but does everybody seem to have a spiore?

[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.020]
Stick out there.

[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:40.920]
Everybody's like looking for tips.

[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.180]
They have their hand down and everything.

[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.060]
No, I didn't see any of that.

[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.220]
That's the opinion I got.

[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.080]
I stayed to Mirage and the guy in front of me.

[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.900]
It gave the room clerk or the guy taking room reservations.

[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:51.700]
Ten bucks.

[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:52.020]
Yeah.

[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:56.200]
And then the guy we went to this stupid, you know, like me to see the Hoover Dam.

[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:56.640]
Yeah.

[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:00.140]
And the guy that was doing a commentary on the bus, he was saying that everybody

[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.640]
works on tips so people were giving him tips, you know.

[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.400]
Well, see that's what I got to say.

[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.140]
Wait a minute.

[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:05.740]
Wait a minute.

[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.200]
First of all, you did it all wrong.

[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.780]
If you're going to go as a tourist and be sucked in all those tours and be a

[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.120]
schlepper, that's what's going to happen.

[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:12.500]
Okay.

[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.740]
If you just go like a real person and you pay no attention to that and you go

[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:19.420]
around and see your rent a car and do your own stuff, then you do it the right way.

[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.420]
Yeah, I guess that's right.

[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.380]
I don't, I don't encounter any of that in Vegas.

[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.700]
Yeah, this is our first time.

[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.960]
So we didn't know, you know, what was going on.

[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.020]
Well, you're learning the ropes, you're learning the ropes.

[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.240]
All right, thanks, Rodney.

[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:28.520]
Okay.

[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:28.820]
Bye.

[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.460]
No, I don't listen to the one to two hour.

[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.760]
Wouldn't be prudent at this time.

[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.800]
You grew up with them both.

[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:42.640]
Addao Antler Records proudly presents the greatest hits of Simon and Bullwinkle.

[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.740]
We have you gone for his bed enough.

[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.060]
Natasha, you're his lonely without you.

[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.460]
Yes, Bullwinkle.

[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.960]
Recorded live in Central Park and Frost White Falls, the music of Paul Simon,

[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.960]
the lyrics of Mr. No It All.

[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:03.580]
I'm singing on this radio station, but I'm nothing more than animation.

[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.700]
You know, to the bench, you know.

[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:06.580]
Me.

[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.000]
Simon and Bullwinkle's greatest hits.

[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.440]
I am a Moose.

[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.020]
I am a Man.

[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:15.960]
Moose.

[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.980]
It is Paul, but it's not art.

[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.240]
And rock steals the fame.

[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.160]
Cause Moose is never fly.

[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.760]
Unfortunately, Simon and Bullwinkle's greatest hits.

[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.140]
Now, then, well, that Mr. Peebodies, records and tapes.

[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.840]
Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Slamman.

[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.020]
Hey, Pete, oh, if you love Sweatwood the Hits,

[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.160]
then you'll love my newest workout video Sweatwood the Dam.

[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.340]
Let's welcome the fake bully.

[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:47.520]
Hi there.

[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:48.420]
Okay.

[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.540]
Let's get busy.

[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.180]
Nobody in the world is threatened like Saddam Hussein.

[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.520]
And now, you can sweat with him.

[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.360]
Go ahead.

[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.300]
Get rid of those bags, Dad.

[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.180]
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,

[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.960]
30 Rotten Yaki Doss have come to intervene.

[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.880]
We're back at 16.

[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.020]
A-Wax and Stealth.

[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.760]
Could pose its theory as threat to your health.

[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:19.240]
So if your middle is going east, west and south,

[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.840]
sweat it out with a fully of bagdad.

[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.600]
It's the perfect workout when you've bitten off more than you can do.

[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.520]
Sweatwood with Saddam.

[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.140]
I feel the burn.

[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:37.760]
I feel the new times Ben Greenman rips awakenings.

[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.340]
He's got a review in here today that would make hair grow

[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.500]
on the bottom of your feet.

[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.460]
I'm telling you, rise and wine, even a fine effort from Deniro.

[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.860]
Can't rouse awakenings.

[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.580]
He rips the crap out of Robin Williams.

[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.120]
And I won't take the time to read the whole thing

[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.280]
because that would be a terminal.

[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.380]
But the last paragraph says, for those of you who are waiting

[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.140]
to waste your three bucks or five and a half,

[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.320]
whatever it is to go see it.

[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.840]
In the final disappointing analysis,

[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.300]
awakenings is irresponsibly ignorant of the groundwork laid

[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.640]
by previous hospital dramas.

[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.460]
Watching this film is like sitting through one floor

[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.060]
over the Kuku's nest on videotape in slow motion,

[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.760]
where the small screen and the snail's pace

[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.140]
castrate all that was dangerous in Randall Patrick McMurphy

[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.160]
and drain all that was interesting in human frailty.

[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.460]
Despite the buoyant epiphany of Deniro's acting,

[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.840]
this is a clumsy, big-hearted dog,

[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.420]
a shameless tear-jerker,

[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.320]
and for those very reasons and almost certain Academy Award nominee.

[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.020]
But did you like it, Ben?

[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.660]
Boy, rips the crap out of it.

[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.060]
Stephen Zalian's flabby script with its unexciting pacing leaves

[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.840]
Deniro riffing into empty air,

[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.300]
rolling is arsenal to the front lines of a war that does not exist.

[00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:02.260]
Just ripping in a gigantic, huge, but mobile and fort Lauderdale.

[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:02.940]
Bill?

[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:03.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.080]
Yeah, I'm on my way to Golstein.

[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.460]
There'll be two more people here today.

[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:06.820]
Great!

[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.480]
Punture brains out, sir.

[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.420]
The horses are hungry.

[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.760]
Yeah, I know that, but I think they're going to feed me today.

[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.280]
Anyway, good luck.

[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.120]
The last thing you were just talking about this awakening,

[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.160]
I didn't see it,

[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:20.640]
but I got to tell you that I imagine this reviewer is right

[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.280]
because I got very concerned when I read Candace Russell's reviewer

[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.880]
which he said it was the greatest thing in the world.

[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:26.600]
Oh, boy.

[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.900]
And I think she's brain dead.

[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:30.360]
I would lock the doors and stay inside it.

[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:30.640]
Yep.

[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.460]
But now about the reason I call.

[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:32.960]
Okay.

[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:38.120]
I don't think that all of the dolphin fans here, one of which I am not,

[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.140]
should be whining about the fact Buffalo actually won the game.

[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:45.620]
Well, who's, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, who's whining?

[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.660]
Well, that's what I'm hearing.

[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.300]
Okay, I'm hearing about you want Buffalo to get green, etc, etc.

[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.540]
And they'll, wait a minute, wait a second.

[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.000]
Okay.

[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:55.120]
Are you taking control now?

[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.460]
No, I'm having a conversation because you're putting words in my mouth.

[00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:59.700]
Well, I wasn't finished talking.

[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.260]
Oh, in other words, I have to wait till your finish.

[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.620]
Is that how conversation works?

[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.100]
Yeah, really?

[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.260]
No, generally conversation is like interplay.

[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:08.160]
You don't know how to fall.

[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:08.840]
I'll listen to it.

[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.360]
And I would have listened, but you're trying to put words in my mouth.

[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:11.880]
Not at all.

[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.780]
What I said was that the better team won the game.

[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.120]
Okay, we played a great game offensively.

[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.300]
The defense didn't show up.

[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.420]
It was an exciting game.

[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.280]
The better team won.

[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:22.980]
Regardless of the outcome, I don't like Buffalo.

[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:23.980]
I don't like their fans.

[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.280]
I don't like the team.

[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:26.120]
I don't like Kelly.

[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.320]
So I hope that they get their brains picked up by Oakland or

[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.180]
Serbia, LA, rather, or by San Francisco.

[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.740]
That's the way I feel about it.

[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.180]
Is that okay?

[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:36.440]
That's not sour grapes for the fact we lost.

[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.440]
No, no, I wasn't necessarily saying you.

[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.180]
I was saying a lot of the people I was calling in.

[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.940]
But more importantly, Neil, you're very fortunate to know.

[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:43.200]
Wait a minute.

[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.840]
No, the next Monday, Jay, okay?

[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:45.580]
Pardon me?

[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.260]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.240]
I was talking to my car wash guy.

[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:51.000]
Every 20 years, I make a football prediction.

[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:51.400]
Yeah.

[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.080]
The last one was when the judge

[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.840]
Well, I'm sure that the entire audience is sitting right on the

[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.740]
edge of the yard.

[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.520]
I want you to remember where you heard it for.

[00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:58.680]
Right.

[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.140]
Here we go.

[00:46:59.200 --> 00:46:59.920]
What's it going to be?

[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:03.220]
In all New York Super Bowl, Buffalo and the New York

[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.740]
Giants, the Giants turned to take care of San Francisco.

[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.160]
Yeah.

[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.960]
Buffalo will wipe the rate as clock.

[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.560]
Okay.

[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:09.700]
It's going to be a great Super Bowl.

[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.180]
No, okay.

[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.700]
So step to the plate.

[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.180]
All California Super Bowl 49ers and Araters.

[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:14.760]
Here we go.

[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.300]
Okay.

[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.900]
That's the East Coast and the West Coast, pal.

[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:17.560]
What's that?

[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.660]
I said, these coast versus the West Coast.

[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:19.840]
Okay.

[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.260]
Well, just be very careful one way to ring in that direction.

[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:22.600]
Okay.

[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:23.500]
Good luck.

[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.360]
Right now about the wall.

[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:24.920]
Yeah.

[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:25.440]
Okay.

[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.280]
You think it's going to happen?

[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:26.860]
Yes.

[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:28.620]
I think so also.

[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:29.100]
Okay.

[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.160]
Let's try sunrise on a deadline.

[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:31.900]
Yeah.

[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:32.760]

[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.140]
That was a JR's on Saturday at the stadium

[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:35.300]
club.

[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:36.080]
At the thing, yeah.

[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.080]
And Rick and Sut's with the Agatha question about Sut's.

[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:39.300]
Yeah.

[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.920]
He stands there like rainman.

[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:41.900]
See if it talks.

[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:42.920]
Really?

[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.140]
He just, I mean, Rick is great.

[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.620]
You know, he whoops the crowd up and such.

[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.280]
Just stands there.

[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.500]
Well, first of all, you got to understand.

[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.780]
Sut has no interest whatsoever in football.

[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.580]
Any show to you.

[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:52.440]
He's got no personality.

[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.140]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:53.720]
Wait a minute.

[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.940]
I don't understand why they schlep him around

[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:56.980]
and force him to be there.

[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:57.460]
I see.

[00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:58.440]
I don't go for that kind of stuff.

[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.320]
Let the guy sit home and watch a movie or something.

[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:00.900]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.560]
While watch C-SPAN or something, he's interested.

[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:04.720]
He has no interest in it.

[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.820]
Of course, he's part of the show.

[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:06.640]
So we have to be there.

[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.140]
I mean, don't...

[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:09.060]
We got the crowd going and it was nice.

[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.140]
Well, let me also tell you this.

[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.600]
Just for your information,

[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.860]
Rick Riley also has no interest in football.

[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.240]
None.

[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:15.860]
Zero.

[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:16.640]
Was it an act?

[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:17.200]
Yeah.

[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:17.320]
Oh.

[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:18.820]
He's just a better actor.

[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:19.120]
All right.

[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:19.880]
Gilbert was a...

[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:20.300]
He was great.

[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.940]
Well, all kid, well, if you like Gilbert,

[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:22.680]
well, more could you...

[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.220]
Well, he didn't know.

[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:23.480]
Yeah.

[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.600]
And that says it all right there.

[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.840]
The Dawson's in ABC.

[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.260]
He thought the game was on Channel 10.

[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:27.920]
Oh, man.

[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.980]
Then somebody told him and he put the NBC over it.

[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.100]
Well, that's our secret weapon.

[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.520]
He is really used to a barred Gilbert,

[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.040]
by the way, for the coming couple of days.

[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.220]
I mean, what they're going to do with him.

[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:36.880]
Maybe they'll keep him over here.

[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:37.320]
Exactly.

[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.280]
Put him in a cup of oats.

[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:38.800]
There you go.

[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.600]
Yeah, it was also a track on Saturday night.

[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.220]
And you would be eyeing me online.

[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.000]
And you picked that one horse in a six race?

[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:44.680]
Yeah.

[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:45.880]
And it was a good call.

[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.400]
You mean the one I had 20 and 20 on Peter Ren?

[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.620]
Winning for like a champion?

[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:50.040]
You bet.

[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.660]
Eight bucks to win, five, 20 to show.

[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.020]
Eight, the 20 to win.

[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:53.780]
Eight, 60 to win.

[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:54.760]
Oh, 20 to win.

[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:54.900]
And that one.

[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:55.640]
20 to place.

[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:56.340]
That was a good call.

[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:56.920]
You bet.

[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:58.380]
Hey, listen, I sat there, sir.

[00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.040]
Tonight I had...

[00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.380]
I loved.

[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.980]
I marked two horses when I went in.

[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:01.520]
Mm-hmm.

[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.700]
One of them was Ralph Cramden with David Ingram Ham for the rail.

[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.180]
Yeah, that's Kevin Horst.

[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:05.880]
I sat there.

[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:06.700]
Listen to me.

[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:07.260]
I sat there.

[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.180]
I did not play the race.

[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:09.500]
He was seven to one.

[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.840]
Wins like a champion.

[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.780]
I mean, on the last turn, he opened a five

[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.280]
roasted home, paid 1180.

[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.540]
And the other one was at Pavia Horst about two, three races later.

[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.040]
The three horse, I can't think of the name.

[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:22.460]
Right.

[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.860]
And one like a champion, I had him with the wrong horses

[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:25.380]
and the perfect.

[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.420]
And Kevin Wallace with the Jean Lafitte, the douchebag,

[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.720]
whatever was, got second, the...

[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.300]
Got it in on a rail air and got second.

[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:32.920]
Mm-hmm.

[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:33.900]
So beat me out of the perfect.

[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.980]
Did you play the Ralph Cramden now?

[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.440]
No, I sat there and watched it and I wanted to blow my brains out.

[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.000]
Uh, well, he saved money in a long run.

[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.100]
I picked a lot of good ones, sir.

[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:40.940]
I bad money managed.

[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.020]
But I still went home a winner.

Okay, they got a great season. Yes, they did what the hell you know about football and how come?

[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.640]
Jesus well when you stop I'm so tired of these people who try to suck around on the air because they think it

[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:05.120]
Engrageds themselves with the audience. You know you don't like football you don't care about sports you and your bird brain

[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:09.320]
Friend from Lakeland and you entitled to that your title. I mean there's a bunch of losers

[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.560]
They don't care what all about sports did you hear about sunny and I've lost seven pounds and five days

[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.200]
Which I notice you haven't said a word about and I can already feel it and look at it. I can even see it

[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.280]
How do you like that? I don't see your belt. Do you hear about sunny? Why?

[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:25.320]
You're about some I don't have a belt sunny fox is old news. He's coming to magic

[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.060]
They're gonna tell you if they don't give me a new mic cord in here

[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:34.980]
I'm gonna I mean it's bad enough. We don't have the triple cart deck up here that we need so desperately so when we don't have to play

[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.380]
carts from off on the floor here

[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:42.060]
Don't you think it's time we got some stuff in here that works. That's my opinion. I'm like Disney. Well then do it

[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:45.660]
Don't talk about it. I'm sorry. What happened to jerk before work

[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:52.960]
Gone history. Yeah. Why do you think he was a great broadcaster? He's a good. He's a crap good voice

[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.060]
Terrible. No no personality kind of like some other people in

[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.540]
On the coast maybe jerk before work. It'd be on the coast. There you go

[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:07.460]
I got to be honest with you Ron St. John does such a good job on the no listen to me at J. R. S in the dolphin games

[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:08.900]
But on the air he's well

[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:14.180]
He what where does that come from? It's like somebody's got lit a bunch of fireflies under his butter something when he's on the air

[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:18.640]
Yes, at the stadium. He does a very nice job. Maybe he doesn't use headphones at the stadium

[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:24.240]
Well, I don't know what it is, but boy. He is really grow magic. What oh two boys seven. Yeah, here's all a hitch all the time

[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.120]
Oh, yeah

God spastic. Now, how do you think Pudela is feeling about sunny going back face-on?

[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.800]
Yeah, get out the razor blades. Leave the gun bring the gun only

[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.980]

BDL what the TV show or the market the market

[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.280]
