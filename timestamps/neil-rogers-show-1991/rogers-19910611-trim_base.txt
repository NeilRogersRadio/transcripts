[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]
Now here's Neil Rogers, a new doc radio 610 WIOD.

[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.440]
We're sorry we're not home right now. We thank you for your call.

[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.700]
We are such very people. We love you one and all.

[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.760]
Please leave your name and phone number. We'll call you back with luck.

[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.320]
But if you should hang up to soon, go take a flying.

[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.580]
Hi!

[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.780]
Hi!

[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.860]
Hi! Here we go!

[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.160]
What a fly!

[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.500]
What?

[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.200]
5-2-3!

[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.380]
3-2-1!

[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.060]
3-2-1!

[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.120]
Holy God!

[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.700]
I don't care if I have nothing.

[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.700]

[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.660]
Well it's an old Eskimo trick of how to catch a polar bear.

[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.440]
Now what you do is you go cut a hole in the ice.

[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.160]
Right, right? And then you take little peas and you place them strategically,

[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.280]
four inches apart all the way around the hole.

[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.040]
Right? And a polar bear will crawl up and he'll look at it very much curiosity

[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.640]
as to what is going on there.

[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.860]
Now when he bends over to take a pee, you kick him in the ice hole!

[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.780]
10-17 at WIOD we got a mobile in Miami.

[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.980]
How you doing Neil?

[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.560]
Great!

[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.900]
Big league baseball football basketball big league town now.

[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.280]
And hockey right on the horizon maybe we hope we pray who knows.

[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.820]
I hope so Neil. I'd love to see you do the announcing for you.

[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.740]
No chance. Why not?

[00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.320]
Never happen.

[00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.860]
I mean it's fun to talk about it but if even if the station gets the games

[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.620]
there is no I'll be given no consideration to do it. They're not a chance in a million.

[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.620]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.660]
I'm too controversial, too many potty mouth words.

[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.120]
Oh, I know.

[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.840]
No I'm serious. They don't want people like that involved in baseball. They really don't.

[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.620]
Answer a question for me because this is your profession.

[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.300]
How do they go about taking people to that?

[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.380]
Do they do auditions? Do you submit tapes? How does that have to do auditions?

[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.020]
People send in millions of tapes.

[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.840]
And whoever is the biggest jock, of course, they have to have like two jocks on a broadcast.

[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.680]
Of course you do understand there would be television and radio.

[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.160]
Right.

[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.200]
And probably not the same people necessarily.

[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.820]
I mean you can go to the bank channel seven and get to TV because they're the only major independent station in the market.

[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.200]
Right.

[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.900]
And they've been just waiting for this day.

[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.720]
Well you're right because when you listen to the Yankee games the people who do the radio are not the people who do it on TV.

[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.980]
Right.

[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.260]
But you know, there are some exceptions.

[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.040]
I mean like here he does three innings on radio in Chicago but generally you're talking different people.

[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.060]
Well I haven't talked to you in a few months because there's really not much for me to call in for but I do.

[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.980]
I do want to say it all, you know, seriously that the first time I ever heard you or heard your voice was when you're doing the UM games

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.220]
and I was impressed very much then and I think anybody that heard you years ago doing those games.

[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.140]
And I feel this is the truth that it was the best baseball announcing I had ever heard and I was in May.

[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.540]
No further fucking funny.

[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.720]
I say there's no question about it.

[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.880]
No it's true and I remember very clearly that you know you used to do this thing with two outs and a guy on Nondec Circul, he would be next.

[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.540]
Well I stole that from Harry.

[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.380]
Yeah but it was great and it's a shame because I think you'd be just perfect for the job.

[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.540]
I know you'd love to do it.

[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.240]
Yeah.

[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.940]
I mean you really wouldn't if they said no.

[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.580]
But there's no chance.

[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.960]
I'm not going to get myself all wound up about it because there is no chance.

[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.920]
Well I say right now.

[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.200]
I mean I was going to do that one hurricane game with Hank and we could even do one lousy hurricane game and I did those games for six years.

[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.880]
Well you had those tight you know what's over at the University of Miami that's a whole different ball game.

[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.740]
I mean you know this is different and I want to say right now I want to start to give Neil a chance.

[00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.880]
Yeah.

[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.880]
You have Neil a chance.

[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.180]
Really?

[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.580]
How about it?

[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.260]
Dream on Cir is Aerosmith would say Dream on.

[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.000]
You have Neil a chance.

[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.400]
That's the key phrase for the day.

[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.940]
Okay let's start a big writing campaign.

[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.620]
I'm serious.

[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.140]
Okay.

[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.600]
You're serious.

[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.280]
People hurt you when you're at the University of Miami say the same thing.

[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.980]
If it's on Merritt alone you've got to get the job.

[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.080]
Yeah but nothing is on Merritt alone.

[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.960]
Ralph Keiner and Fran Healey and LaGuana Range wouldn't be doing the meds games.

[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.640]
Well.

[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.160]
And Bob Murphy who's been dead for 20 years.

[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.800]
Well you know sports broadcasting ain't on Merritt anymore.

[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.000]
And most of the guys who get in are like X-Jocks.

[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.200]
Yeah I think there are some cities where all the announcers are X-Jocks which is really pathetic.

[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.480]
Do you have any of your old tapes from the University of Miami day?

[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.180]
Yeah.

[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.160]
I'd love to hear.

[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.180]
I'd love to hear some of them.

[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.440]
Would you?

[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.940]
You did some of your...

[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.780]
He could have written a letter home before he tagged him out and he just dropped the ball right on the back.

[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.320]
Yeah.

[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.100]
That's fantastic.

[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.580]
Well that was exciting, wasn't it?

[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.720]
Well hey, I'm telling you both fast-farting and excited about it on the radio.

[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.440]
That's right.

[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.540]
Well that's how you build sports casting.

[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.720]
I make a big deal out of it because when I was a kid growing up I was like had a fetish listening to Bob Prince and Mel Allen or Red Barber and Harry and all the great ones.

[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.300]
But now mostly what you've got are a bunch of Jocks who are semi-eliterate and inarticulate and second like McCarve.

[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.620]
All he wants is sit there and second guess every pitch.

[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.020]
I mean it's boring.

[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.060]
Well it's not exciting.

[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:29.280]
The people upstairs feel that the people out there are getting more from it which is ridiculous because people listen to baseball and the radio no baseball.

[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.760]
Yeah.

[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.800]
And I used to go to University of America and I was going to leave early and go home listening to the radio because I enjoyed it as much in the radio.

[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.260]
Didn't have a chance.

[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.980]
Okay.

[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.500]
Goodbye.

[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.140]
Thank you.

[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.960]
Boy major leagues sucking around there.

[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.680]
21 after 10 at WIOD we have one open line that's in Dade County 751, Go Marlins.

[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.140]
It's almost unbelievable isn't it that anything good could happen in this God for a second place it's like a miracle.

[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.220]
And I told you this weeks ago man and he was just talking on his flap of his gums.

[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.460]
I told you this was a done deal Miami and Denver.

[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.680]
Score tied 3-3 in the bottom of the 17th.

[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.080]
One ball and one strike.

[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.240]
Cooms in the wind up in the one one pitch.

[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.660]
Swung on.

[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.140]
Oh baby did he get that baby out of sight.

[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.500]
Eight cream added it.

[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.020]
Revolves to strikes.

[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.800]
There's a try.

[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.300]
If the wind does the hole it up it'll be gone.

[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.440]
It'll be gone.

[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.460]
It'll be gone.

[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.860]
Holy God.

[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.080]
Okay calm down Harry 1025 at WIOD let's go to North Miami Beach.

[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.040]
Good morning Neil.

[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.580]
Yes sir.

[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.700]
I just got back from Houston my hometown I went in there just to watch the met series this weekend.

[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.020]
Nice game last night.

[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.940]
It was great.

[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.100]
Why didn't you see the one last night that's all the first two that we blew in the night.

[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.740]
You realize Houston could have swept the whole series.

[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.540]
Oh yeah very easily.

[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.980]
Seven walks in the night inning in one game and it gave away the other one too.

[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.560]
I mean can't complain about the Astros bullpen because they don't have any.

[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.020]
That's right.

[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.040]
The only head one relief pitcher in a let him go and we got him in the Chicago.

[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.960]
Of course we don't have any chance to bring him any more because we're never close enough.

[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.360]
Late in the game.

[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.000]
Well they played well they're exciting.

[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.800]
I'll tell you this.

[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.580]
Steve Finley maybe the next Andy van's like.

[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.160]
I mean that kid plays the outfit with reckless of bandings hitting 289 now.

[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.480]
Really come on.

[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.060]
Mark Craig Beasio is okay in my book.

[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.620]
There you go.

[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.080]
Next to God almost.

[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.400]
Yeah.

[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:33.340]
I was in the gallery down there and I was walking by the gungeal store and I thought about my favorite talk show host.

[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.960]
And I went in there and I bought you a few mac anito cigars.

[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.820]
Oh listen to this.

[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.100]
You were telling them bad ones.

[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.880]
Listen to this.

[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.780]
I was ripping the cigars that Al Goldstein sent the other day.

[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.580]
So this morning I get another package from New York FedEx no less.

[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:52.780]
And I opened it up and it's a whole bunch of white owl in these cheap day nobly cigars.

[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.360]
And a note in it from Al that says this is more your speed cheap pathetic rejects from George Burns.

[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.240]
Well anyway I just I went in there and I got him for you and I got a couple for you and one for George.

[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.520]
And I'll get him to you when I can.

[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.640]
I don't know when I can get over there.

[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.080]
I was going to try to get him to you at miracle game but I'm going to be working late at night.

[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.860]
But anyway I thought you think you might enjoy him and I'll get him to you as soon as I can.

[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.640]
You're a great American.

[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.320]
Thanks Neil.

[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:16.700]
Thanks.

[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.640]
1027 and WIOD we have open line at day 75.

[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.760]
One let's go to Miami.

[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.180]
Hello.

[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.000]
How you doing?

[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:23.660]
Okay.

[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.460]
I have a good idea.

[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.080]
Yeah.

[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.560]
Harry Carrey and Neil Rogers calling for the Miami Nailies.

[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:34.860]
Yeah.

[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.160]
Right.

[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.400]
Well you just played that short part of when you were calling one of the games.

[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.120]
I'm not a real big baseball fan.

[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.380]
But you sounded very good.

[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.560]
I think so.

[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.640]
So it winds up as a double steel.

[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.980]
Shields is thirty third.

[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.060]
Car has third.

[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.040]
And now for the fucking call you sounded great.

[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.980]
You sounded great.

[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.020]
I was thinking I am the best.

[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.660]
Yes.

[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.580]
And let me ask you something.

[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.520]
I have another question before I go.

[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.480]
I'll be honest with me.

[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.000]
Would you prefer calling baseball games or doing what you're doing now?

[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.240]
How long do I have to think about that?

[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.640]
Well by eleven o'clock.

[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.260]
I can give you an answer in about six seconds.

[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.020]
So what's the answer?

[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:22.660]
Baseball.

[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:23.880]
Not even close.

[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:24.600]
All right.

[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.580]
See if this were a different kind of town.

[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.180]
I mean like after days like yesterday.

[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.460]
Did you listen to this show yesterday?

[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.020]
No I was working.

[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:32.360]
I'm working.

[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.000]
Well everybody else was working yesterday too.

[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.620]
I wouldn't wish that show yesterday on Billy Martin or anybody.

[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.300]
I mean it was just the most every Monday in this town is like talking into a vacuum tube.

[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.320]
I could have a more intelligent conversation with my dogs and often do than I have a Monday's here.

[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.680]
Normally I listened to you a lunch but yesterday for some reason I couldn't.

[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.580]
It was raining outside.

[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.020]
I couldn't get to my car.

[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.600]
Before I go this weekend I'm going to New Orleans.

[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.420]
Have you ever been there?

[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.700]
Oh don't do it.

[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.020]
What a smartly crappy place.

[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.100]
Well I heard it smells this time of the year.

[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.480]
Do you like, are you a big drinker?

[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.920]
Johnny Walker Red.

[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.960]
No I'm not asking you what you drink but I mean are you a big booze sound?

[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.140]
If you are you'll love New Orleans.

[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.800]
If you're not a drunk there's nothing to do there.

[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.720]
It's a crappy town.

[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.040]
What I was trying to do is see if by any chance you've gone there to eat.

[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.560]
If you could recommend any kind of...

[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.320]
No because I haven't been eating for the last year or so.

[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.500]
I'm going there for the...

[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.700]
That sounds funny doesn't it have any?

[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.020]
I mean I haven't been eating in restaurants.

[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.120]
The food there is great.

[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.020]
If you want to eat you want to drink that's a place to do it.

[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.560]
Oh okay I'm working at the restaurant.

[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.940]
Just as long as you don't go outside.

[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.320]
Just as long as you don't walk around.

[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:34.880]
What a...

[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.600]
Oh really?

[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.780]
A lazy, smarmy dumb place that is.

[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.520]
I mean dumb.

[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.500]
There's a lot of people over there.

[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.680]
He says it smells by this time of the year and he says don't walk alone.

[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.480]
Yeah from February through in November it stinks pretty bad there.

[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.340]
He says don't walk alone.

[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.600]
I thought I didn't think that's the best advice he ever gave you.

[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.660]
Don't walk alone.

[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.220]
Really?

[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.140]
In fact just stay in a hotel maybe they got good room service.

[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.460]
Well we're supposed to have a party Saturday night at Hogshead Saloon.

[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.000]
That's New Orleans alright Hogshead Saloon.

[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.100]
Alright you got it.

[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.580]
I hope to hear you announcing for the Miami baseball team soon.

[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.780]
Okay don't walk alone.

[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:10.820]
See ya.

[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.580]
We should play and you'll never walk alone by Tony Bennett or somebody.

[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.160]
Oh what a horrible city that is.

[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.580]
There's an open line at day 751 Meng 751 WIOD Fort Lauderdale.

[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.380]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:22.860]
Great.

[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.700]
I just got a couple requests for Wayne Hazing if he's listening.

[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.340]
Yes sir.

[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.740]
Number one please name the team after Miami and not South Florida.

[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.060]
Yeah that's Miami Marlins.

[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.320]
Yeah well I don't even like Marlins.

[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.780]
Well listen I mean it's better than the Panthers it's better than anything else that they've been tossing around.

[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.760]
Definitely definitely I like to make those myself.

[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.000]
Miami Mico's not a pretty good.

[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:42.400]
The what?

[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.040]
Miami Mico's Mico's Sharps.

[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.340]
Mico's?

[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:45.600]
Yeah.

[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.060]
Never heard of a Mico?

[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.860]
Yeah but that's pretty weak.

[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.760]
Oh well.

[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.100]
It's pretty borderline you know like on the edge.

[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.640]
Well Marlins and Dolphins is too close to me and uh Miami definitely South Florida and

[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.580]
maybe not after reaching it.

[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.400]
I don't think I don't cut it.

[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.140]
And the other request is please do not give it the colors after the Dolphins.

[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.900]
Give it another color.

[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.800]
Tell them it's something new.

[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.440]
Dolphins have a weak color and I don't think it will be good on the other side.

[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:11.580]
Yeah.

[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.820]
How about Marlins with purple polka dots or something?

[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.140]
No actually I was thinking more like taking out to the seminal color.

[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.600]
Oh they got ugly uniform.

[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:20.380]
Starting to go now.

[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.420]
Yeah they got ugly.

[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.560]
I mean the colors may be okay but the uniforms are really ugly.

[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.720]
Oh yeah they have a couple of other ones.

[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.520]
They got a couple of nice ones.

[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.720]
Same with Miami Hurricanes.

[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.520]
Bad uniforms.

[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.600]
Couple of nice ones.

[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.680]
No they don't have bad uniforms.

[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.220]
Hurricanes?

[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.660]
They got a couple of goons like the away uniform that gray one that says Miami across is nice

[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.600]
and the white one that says Hurricanes across it.

[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:38.920]
Yeah.

[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.240]
But the one with the orange shirt.

[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.880]
Oh no I agree.

[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.520]
Those are gross.

[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.300]
Yeah those are gross.

[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.100]
Those are like something Charlie Finley would come up with.

[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.240]
Yeah that.

[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.660]
Couple of requests that maybe Wayne that he's listening to think about.

[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.140]
Okay.

[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:49.680]
Thank you.

[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.200]
See ya.

[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.800]
We love you Wayne.

[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.640]
Not Wayne Arnold.

[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.920]
But we love him too.

[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.700]
By the way he was in here with some more cigars this morning some good ones.

[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.540]
The ones we like since we're very choosy and when they're free we want them to be good.

[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.360]
And he lost 23 pounds Wayne Arnold.

[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.040]
How do you like that?

[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.140]
Because I jumped all over his case and I talked about what a fat sloppy become.

[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.080]
I couldn't tell.

[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.420]
And he got hysterical.

[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.120]
You can't tell.

[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.620]
You still look pretty damn fat to me Wayne.

[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.680]
Cut it out.

[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.680]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.080]
Hello.

[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.040]
She's gone.

[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:18.500]
Hello.

[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.640]
Oh there you are boy.

[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.200]
I was in the cold sweat.

[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.180]
Well that's close enough.

[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:22.460]
Hello.

[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.480]
Yes ma'am.

[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.700]
I happen to be a long time listener and a first time that I managed to get broodied.

[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.180]
Wow.

[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.120]
Neil I wonder if you know how popular you are as far as being the one to broadcast the game.

[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.240]
Well I think I'm in.

[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.120]
I think it's a lock.

[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.580]
Well I'm really seriously thinking of a writing campaign.

[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.520]
But I mean a real.

[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.480]
Well we don't even know which station is going to get it.

[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.840]
Suppose WINZ gets the rights to the games.

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.800]
Of course if Channel 7 gets the TV rights I'm right next door here to Channel 7.

[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.980]
They're my best buddies over there.

[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.700]
Oh I know they must love you because you can hide them up in the cell.

[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.440]
Ulrich Sanchez and Sally and Penny.

[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.720]
They're my buddies over there.

[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.220]
No I'm really serious.

[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.120]
Now if you listen to Hank last night or you caught any part of this show you'd be surprised how many people called in.

[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.460]
Not sucking up for you but really to suggest you doing the car.

[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.560]
I only heard a couple of minutes of Hank last night in the car and somebody was saying

[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.860]
that he should do the games with Bob Costas.

[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.660]
Of course Bob Costas gets the game.

[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.640]
I will personally go over there and shoot him because he's the biggest twerp that ever said foot on the face of their costus.

[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.160]
Isn't interested in doing games.

[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.320]
He just wants to make himself the focal point.

[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.760]
Just like during the NBA him and what's his name or doing all these stupid things shooting baskets.

[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.720]
Nobody cares about whether Bob Costas is shooting baskets.

[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.240]
You know it's a Pat Ryan.

[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:31.880]

[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:32.800]
Much a crap.

[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.700]
You're right.

[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.580]
People want to see it.

[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:39.780]
See it always bothers me when he's ex-Jocks or little twerps like Costas who isn't even next to him.

[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.040]
When they want to focus the attention on themselves rather than the game.

[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.280]
That's the big mistake they make.

[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.580]
Nobody gives a damn about Bob Costas.

[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:46.760]
You're right.

[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:54.460]
I'm a real sports fanatic and I cannot thank you enough for all the hours of pleasure you gave me when you broadcasted the UN Baseball game.

[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.920]
Well that's when those hurricane broadcasts were exciting if I do say so myself.

[00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:58.640]
They really were.

[00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.740]
And you're being a good person.

[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.500]
Not as excited as Joe's a Gaggy but.

[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.460]
Now really you're the fact that you are so controversial.

[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.600]
I think is a plus that me get a drill twice as many listeners.

[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.620]
Well we don't want somebody who's boring in terminal.

[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.340]
We want somebody who'll make it exciting and lively and you know even if it is boring they'll make it.

[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.200]
No that's why we want Neil Rogers.

[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.100]
Right okay.

[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.040]
I'm ready.

[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.040]
My bags are packed.

[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:19.560]
Okay.

[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:20.940]
Incredible.

[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.380]
That's what I say.

[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.480]
The infield in one-oh pitch inside almost did roll in with that one.

[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.780]
It's two and a one wider habit is control Bob.

[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.200]
I was in a crowd who's not happy.

[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.360]
Well I guess it sounds like I'm campaigning for it.

[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.900]
There's not a chance it's going to happen.

[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.080]
Okay. There's no chance.

[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.580]
So I don't want people to think I'm on here here campaigning to get the job.

[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.480]
We don't even I mean it's not even to done deal yet.

[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.320]
The owners have to approve the cities and then there will be a frantic bidding war.

[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.660]
And see the thing with the station is because WSB in Atlanta,

[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.180]
one of our sister stations owned by the cocksisters,

[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.380]
has the braves and has had for years.

[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.520]
And evidently either loses or doesn't make any money on it.

[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.380]
Well that's their problem.

[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.360]
Okay. I can't help it that they're stupid up there.

[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.320]
That's not my problem.

[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.140]
So they're not real enthused about getting baseball here.

[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.560]
From what I understand that's the rumor.

[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.500]
I could be wrong.

[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:06.340]
Hopefully.

[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.260]
I'm wrong.

[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.920]
There's a lady in town.

[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.900]
She's an orthodox Jew.

[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:20.380]
And she needs to buy bread that is unleavened.

[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.540]
But it's late and she knows that the stores are all closed.

[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:32.120]
And she really needs to make a sandwich.

[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.740]
And she's buying bread at seven.

[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.000]
He lives.

[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.600]
And the bread is wonderful.

[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.400]
10.55.

[00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.060]
I can hear.

[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.520]
Riva really got a feel of very embarrassed on that one.

[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.680]
As he had to ball-weighting for car car was even had...

[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.720]
He wasn't sliding, conceding, being out.

[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.320]
And Riva dropped it right at the back.

[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.080]
Drop this.

[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.140]
Okay. We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:14.760]
655WIOD.

[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.460]
Coral Springs.

[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.400]
I hear a deadly silence on that line, don't you?

[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.020]
That is the deadest sounding line.

[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:23.940]
Is there somebody on it?

[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.260]
Oh, listen to that.

[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.240]
Hello?

[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.280]
You there?

[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.420]
We catch you a little short.

[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:34.860]
Deal.

[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:35.420]
Yeah.

[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.080]
I'm sorry.

[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.380]
There's a customer came and walked out of that chance.

[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.640]
Hey, listen, the way things are now, don't pass up any customers.

[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.460]
Sir, believe me, the way this economy is.

[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.740]
I thought that was ignorant, but I was playing with that.

[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.280]
That's okay.

[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.800]
Timing was great.

[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.620]
Hey, I nailed it.

[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.700]
Now, you have to stand up for yourself now.

[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.040]
Right.

[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.500]
I want it, and I want it now.

[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.120]
Well, say you want it.

[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.540]
Make everybody make sure you find it.

[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.320]
I do want it.

[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.660]
I've been offered the fucking...

[00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.400]
Yeah, I want it.

[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.660]
Don't win back at this one now.

[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.480]
Hey, listen, I've been saying I want it for years and never accomplished much.

[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.380]
I mean, this might be the last rull you have before your...

[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.720]
Before I go to that big talk show booth in the sky, that's right.

[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.280]
Right, this is it.

[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:10.960]
I want it.

[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.040]
This station...

[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.000]
Let me say it right now.

[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.220]
Let me put it right on the table.

[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.740]
If this station gets Major League Baseball, and I'm not included as one of the announcers, I'm walking.

[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.540]
But don't say that.

[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.040]
Right downstairs to get my check on the way out so I can come back the next morning.

[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:23.960]
Don't sit back.

[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.260]
Do all this yelling and stuff like you usually do.

[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.660]
You'll be able to complain and make them...

[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.380]
But we don't even have the thing yet.

[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.260]
Don't you understand?

[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.380]
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.460]
Start winding now.

[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.300]
Then it'll get the point.

[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.120]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.300]
And the colors, they're going to definitely be the same as dolphins.

[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.140]
Yeah, they're going to be a variation on the same team.

[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.340]
I don't see anything wrong with that because it kind of fits them with the stadium.

[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.520]
You have to fit them with the stadium.

[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.360]
Well, I see you got all these people who are just belly...

[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.100]
The colors aren't going to be right.

[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.320]
We don't like the team's name.

[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.860]
We don't even know for sure what it is yet.

[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.400]
See, that bothers me.

[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.340]
This should be the most exciting week.

[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:02.260]
One of the most exciting moments in the history of this entire God forsaken Yahweh town.

[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.000]
And we still got all these people out.

[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.760]
It should be theirs.

[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.520]
It should be that.

[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.340]
The colors should be pink with yellow polka dots.

[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.080]
Who cares?

[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.360]
As long as we got it, right?

[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.840]
The stadium is great.

[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.240]
The stadium is the best.

[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.320]
It is state of the yard.

[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:13.980]
It's comfortable.

[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:14.680]
It's beautiful.

[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.600]
It's magnificent.

[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.860]
It's impeccable.

[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.320]
It's in a great location.

[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:18.900]
You're a driveway.

[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.240]
I mean, I've heard of drive-through fast food places.

[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.740]
But whoever heard of a drive-through stadium, you drive right in there.

[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.820]
I live in Coral Spray.

[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.860]
This is piece of cake on the back.

[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:26.300]
Exactly.

[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.600]
And it is so nice.

[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.080]
I mean, coming from three river stadiums in Pittsburgh, that was a pain getting in.

[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.480]
This is great.

[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.940]
You better have any better than this.

[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:35.380]
Okay.

[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.740]
I want it, sir.

[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.200]
Okay.

[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:37.980]
And I want it now.

[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.560]
We ride.

[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.080]
Take me out to the ball game.

[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.120]
Take me out to the crowd.

[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.040]
Fiveies on peanuts and crackers.

[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.420]
I don't care if I ever get back to risk food.

[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.400]
Food for the whole team.

[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.700]
And don't wait.

[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.700]
It's a shame.

[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:58.840]
No, it's one.

[00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.520]
Two.

[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.440]
Three tries.

[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.000]
You're right.

[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]
You're right.

[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:05.540]
Okay.

[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.020]
Hey, Neil.

[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.060]
I'm the guy you love to rip on.

[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.340]
I'm I'm his own.

[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.300]
Scotty man.

[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.680]
Carthard Shields at second.

[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.600]
Nobody out in field.

[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.440]
Drawed away in.

[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.880]
Here's the stretcher.

[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.140]
They two out of row to swing.

[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:17.880]
And a fly ball.

[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.720]
Well hit the left.

[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.500]
Men's are going back at the fence.

[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.540]
And it is.

[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.860]
Pull me down.

[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.360]
1115 at WIOD.

[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.600]
Let's go to Hollywood.

[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.020]
Hello.

[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.000]
Hey, Neil.

[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.560]
What about his baseball fever?

[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.200]
Yeah.

[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.020]
You sound pretty excited about it.

[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.580]
It's great.

[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.180]
Yeah.

[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.160]
Hey, speaking of baseball.

[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.120]
Okay.

[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.040]
Got that one for you here.

[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.320]
What do you do with an elephant with three balls?

[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.980]
Send him to Ripley, I guess.

[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.560]
1115 at WIOD.

[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.420]
Throw another one high and outside.

[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.640]
We have an open line at Broward.

[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.400]
5249463.

[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.040]
Opalaka.

[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.220]
I'm mad at self.

[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.560]
And you're not going to take it anymore.

[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.200]
I don't blame you.

[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:56.980]
Stayed up.

[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.120]
I was a little while ago said that the Spanish discovered America.

[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.920]
There were people living here when he showed up.

[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.920]
All he did was introduce plague, pestilence, etc.

[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.880]
I bet you he's never even been in Columbus.

[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.300]
Well, yeah.

[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.360]
I just...

[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.060]
I think it makes me crazy when I hear that the Spanish...

[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.580]
Oh, listen, sir.

[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.820]
All this ethnic crap.

[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.800]
I mean, forget about it.

[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.400]
Okay, baseball, there will be everybody.

[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.740]
There will be anglos and Cubans and blacks and whites and grins and purples and Jews and goyem.

[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.000]
There will be all kinds of people, young and old and in between having a great time.

[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.820]
Can hardly wait and we need the monocampane to get you on this announcer.

[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.100]
And Richard is a douchebag.

[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.480]
They're not for the fucking...

[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.160]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.480]
Take care.

[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:36.820]
Okay.

[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.160]
1116 on the voice of the Marlins, 610 WIOD.

[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.820]
Let's just pretend like we already got it.

[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:44.940]
Kind of a...

[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:51.140]
You're a news-weather traffic and Marlins and Dolphin station and just general fishing around WIOD.

[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.820]
They've already got the news-weather and traffic up there on the marquee out in front.

[00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.520]
Let's get Dumburdo to put Marlins station up there and see if we get a little rise out of somebody, okay?

[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.460]
Come on, Dumburdo.

[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.180]
We got enough letters in the thing yet.

[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.320]
Go on out there and put it up.

[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.460]
Could be his last act, though.

[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.360]
That's my opinion.

[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.140]
I'm Mike Disney.

[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.480]
We're having a great day.

[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.100]
Everybody's in a wonderful mood.

[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.360]
The phones are blazing.

[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.520]
We're actually getting people with IQ bigger than their jock size calling in.

[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.300]
And George tells me, eh, not only am I choking on a cheap cigar from Al Goldstein.

[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.160]
George tells me that it's pouring cats and dogs again.

[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.420]
This is getting old, man.

[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.980]
It is getting ponderous.

[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.560]
God, every stinking day.

[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.400]
And our weather people, they lie like hell.

[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.300]
I'll tell you that this is getting so f***ing ponderous I can't even describe it.

[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:38.860]
Blighten Beach.

[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:39.980]
Morning, Neil.

[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:40.960]
Is it raining by you?

[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.140]
No, it's not. It's cloudy, but it's not raining.

[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:43.840]
Well, just wait.

[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.720]
I know it happened to me yesterday afternoon.

[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.620]
I got it about three hours after you all did.

[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.640]
You got it about three hours after we did, huh?

[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:49.900]
Yeah.

[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:50.840]
Well, that's interesting.

[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.940]
Hopefully you got it early.

[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.760]
But, uh, we wanted.

[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:54.820]
Couple of things.

[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.920]
I'm going to change the subject before I say something I might have to admit to it.

[00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.240]
Okay.

[00:22:59.500 --> 00:22:59.660]
Okay.

[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.280]
First of all, in the dreaded Palm Beach Post this morning, there was an article.

[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.100]
There was a series of questions and answers about the team.

[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.920]
Have they discovered we're getting it yet up there?

[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.080]
Yes, we actually did.

[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.820]
And it made it a great day to work for them.

[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.040]
Good work for the Netscox and newspapers for it.

[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.760]
They're on top of it.

[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:23.880]
They mentioned that the team colors were probably going to be aqua, white, and some other, as they put it warm color, whatever that means.

[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.840]
Yeah, like Puse.

[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:25.280]
Right.

[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.720]
Also that, the thing about spring training, that they said that, uh,

[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.240]
High Zingah has some land near Joe Robbie Stadium.

[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.600]
They're speculating they think he might use it.

[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.640]
Well, you mean they would be here?

[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.220]
Yeah.

[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.280]
That would be incredible.

[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.540]
This would be the only team that had spring training, uh, in the same area where they play.

[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.720]
That would be amazing.

[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.820]
It's saving some money.

[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.780]
He's probably doing it.

[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.740]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:53.540]
And maybe if he wants to be real nice, if he's got a little change left over, he can build a bigger arena for the hockey team up there and for the heat.

[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.240]
That's right.

[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.540]
And finally, enclosing my nominations for, uh, broadcasters, including yourself.

[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.620]
And someone who has not been mentioned lately, who will be available in that year.

[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:05.960]
Yeah.

[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:06.720]
Ernie Harwell.

[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:07.820]
Oh, great.

[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.160]
How does that sound?

[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:09.720]
Fantastic.

[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.100]
That would be tremendous.

[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:12.700]
All right.

[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.840]
Well, that's about all I have.

[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.680]
Thank you, sir.

[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.240]
You're great, America.

[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:15.640]
OK.

[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:15.960]
Bye-bye.

[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.500]
1126 at WIOD.

[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.640]
In fact, we could, uh, one of our sponsors could be Brick Oven, because they already have the big, uh, Ernie and the big Neal.

[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.840]
We have an open line in Palm Beach, 655 WIOD.

[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.120]
Let's go to Miami.

[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:28.540]
Hello.

[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.500]
Hello, Neal.

[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:29.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.540]
Welcome to the Voice of the Marlin, sir.

[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.560]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.980]
Congratulations on your new job.

[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:34.320]
Yeah.

[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.220]
I can't wait to start.

[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.360]
We're going to do a mock game tonight just to get practice.

[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.020]
Hey, I'm a first time caller.

[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.600]
I'm 21.

[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.920]
Uh, my brother got me hooked on a show about two months ago.

[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.260]
I really enjoy it.

[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.820]
I'm trying to get my friends to listen to it.

[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.400]
They love it.

[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.480]
They love the cat noises.

[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.620]
They do love it.

[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.420]
They love it.

[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.140]
How about the show?

[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.020]
They love that too.

[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:52.860]
I'd like that too.

[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.280]
And I'm glad to see that our young people listen to your show.

[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.320]
Millions of them.

[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:56.920]
Jay and Zah.

[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.080]
I mean, you're one of those who admits to it.

[00:24:59.140 --> 00:24:59.760]
One of the lucky ones.

[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.800]
Hey, let me tell you all this crap about the colors.

[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:02.640]
Who cares?

[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:03.260]
Exactly.

[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.740]
Now, here's our kind of caller.

[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.860]
Here's the guy who's got the right altitude, man.

[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.500]
The color could be puke and fluorescent orange.

[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.040]
I don't care.

[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:10.880]
I'll still be out there going.

[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:11.980]
Wait a minute.

[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.240]
Puking fluorescent orange.

[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.220]
That sounds pretty good.

[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.500]
I like it myself.

[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:15.880]
Yeah.

[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:16.900]
How about the colors?

[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.480]
Hey, that guy with the signs.

[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.100]
Yeah.

[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:20.520]
Yeah.

[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.620]
Yeah, you keep bragging on me, huh?

[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.420]
That guy with the signs.

[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.800]
No, it's just that's just part of life, sir.

[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.400]
It's just part of whatever we're doing here.

[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.500]
Just to go with the flow.

[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.220]
Hey, you know that guy that called about the electronic sign

[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.380]
with the numbers and all that?

[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:31.620]
Yeah.

[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.880]
At least in my part of town, I know that the jerks would be raising to see

[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.460]
who could get the biggest number on the screen.

[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:37.900]
Exactly.

[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.340]
Well, they're always comparing big numbers in that part of town.

[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.500]
So far, they're only up to about a four, I think.

[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.140]
No, three.

[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:45.980]
Oh, wow.

[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.460]
Okay.

[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.280]
So, I just want to tell you to keep up the good work and, you know,

[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.640]
I'll be watching you soon on TV.

[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:52.560]
Okay.

[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:53.120]
Okay.

[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:53.520]
We're ready.

[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.500]
See ya.

[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:54.800]
Later.

[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.420]
Okay, it's a done deal.

[00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.380]
We're doing it.

[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.480]
Now, the question is, should we rip off Harry's shoot?

[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.600]
I do the games like Harry and Steele all of his stuff.

[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.620]
That would be Bush League, but it would be a lot of fun, though.

[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.060]
Hi!

[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.660]
Hi!

[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:09.920]
Hi!

[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:10.240]

[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.600]
Seven thinning stretch.

[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.420]
Can you see it?

[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:17.020]
One, two, five, three.

[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.080]
Only one problem.

[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.620]
I'd have to start drinking heavily, I guess.

[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.440]
28 after 11 at WIOD.

[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.120]
Palm Beach.

[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:22.880]
Look at that.

[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.240]
Well, I'm not going to chew them out, because they probably can't even hear us.

[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.620]
Is it really raining bad again?

[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.220]
Like a deluge from a hell, George said.

[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.280]
He said it's just coming down in buckets.

[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.020]
I think it stopped.

[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.820]
But it may have stopped briefly.

[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.020]
Okay, just long enough to give you a false sense of security.

[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.760]
These weather people in this town.

[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.860]
Did you hear the thing they did to teleport yesterday?

[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.120]
I think it was in the morning.

[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.780]
And one of the guys, great cause, by the way.

[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.580]
One guy was ripping a traffic patrol.

[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.460]
It was absolutely right on target about how they got no clue what's going on.

[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.060]
And another guy was ripping our weather in the morning, with Bob Soeper

[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.460]
that's been recorded from like six years ago on Puraum.

[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.760]
You're right, sir.

[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.860]
We haven't got any idea what the hell the weather is.

[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.160]
We just have like six different carts, and we play any meany, miny, and schmo,

[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.420]
and pick whichever one whichever color looks good.

[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.440]
Look at that, the star line even dropped off at star IOD.

[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.020]
I shouldn't know.

[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.040]
We had a tremendous start, and that's going to peter off.

[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.260]
Four-letter deal.

[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.780]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.280]
Great.

[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.100]
What the hell is Tampa Bay worried about?

[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.140]
Hey, school, man.

[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.320]
They're getting a damn hockey team.

[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.200]
Screw them, that's right.

[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.620]
They want everything over there.

[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.320]
They're lucky they got like high-button shoes over there.

[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.800]
See, it's all I see now.

[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.580]
What a bunch of greedy bastards.

[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.640]
Oh, they're crying in their beard too bad.

[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.400]
Screw them.

[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.380]
You got one thing at a time here.

[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:34.860]
You know what?

[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.240]
A bunch of last time you were over there.

[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.560]
Oh, geez.

[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.340]
Such a Yahoo place.

[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:44.360]
It's strictly a blue collar, a Neanderthal, kind of what they're also going to do, kind of place.

[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.680]
What's your bare game, a bare butt game, a football, but that was like eight years ago.

[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.060]
That's Stady Mothers, too, boy.

[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.320]
That's a real piece of work, and it looks like a block of cement that somebody dropped out of the stunt.

[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:55.920]
Yeah, kind of funny shape.

[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.380]
Yeah.

[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.240]
Anyway, I went to.

[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.720]
What's with this three-plane covers?

[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.700]
Where the hell are these planes when they're calling in?

[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.180]
You know, it's a guy who had a good point there.

[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:04.640]
Tampa.

[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:05.640]
Tampa.

[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.080]
Yeah.

[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.160]
On the way, because I, you know, I just, I just, I'm not much.

[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:13.520]
They're given, they're given like stuff that's going on the Cross-town Expressway in Tampa, an I-4 and 75.

[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:14.800]
They don't know what's going on here.

[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.820]
Listen, real, in closing, a, a, a fire report on green alligator he still hasn't crossed the finish line yet.

[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.140]
And he's now down to 75.

[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.980]
They're really, they're punching their guts out.

[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:24.900]
All right, take care.

[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.320]
You too.

[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.320]
6, 10, tough to fire your wing.

[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.080]
This is the show of the tomorrow with you, Rahir.

[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.920]
This is the celebro.

[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.260]
The Ares-Brenk will dust.

[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.740]
Enough of the fucking.

[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.820]
22-till noon at WIOD where it's raining cats and logs.

[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:58.360]
By the way, the lovely Maria Genero of Channel 6 weather is doing a weather this week because of what's his name Mark McEwan is on vacation on CBS Morning News.

[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.380]
And she's doing a great job.

[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.260]
I have a feeling she may not come back. She's a little bit too good for us.

[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.780]
Two balls, two strikes, two outs.

[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.120]
You know, the Cubs won all the way from their sixth to the roll.

[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.620]
The pits.

[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.700]
Hey, stick them out.

[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.400]
Cubs win.

[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:21.720]
Cubs win.

[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.680]
They win their sixths and the roll.

[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.440]
As we mark, it picks up his first save.

[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:28.880]
I can't believe that.

[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.820]
There's a drive right back to my feet.

[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.740]
It's going to be a great time.

[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.660]
Paul Leicard.

[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.020]
Sean Dunster.

[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.820]
Nice home out of the air.

[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.900]
Well, you know, those are all from the distant past.

[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.820]
It's 11.54 at WIOD.

[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:48.600]
Bointin Beach.

[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.580]
Well, that's the shame about Tampa, huh?

[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.520]
Yeah, that's a rough break, isn't it?

[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.140]
I'm going to lose a lot of sleep over that this weekend.

[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.600]
Yeah, they had their nickname.

[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.680]
They read an ex-picton.

[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.980]
The Yahoo's.

[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.300]
No big night over there is a crystal in the ABC lounge.

[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.120]
That's it.

[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.460]
Big guts for your buddy from life once working there.

[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.620]
God, I hope so.

[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.080]
How about resurrecting his last today for the all the people of Tampa area?

[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.800]
Oh, geez.

[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.380]
This sounds like a request to me, you know what, sir?

[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.380]
I could be wrong.

[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:22.220]
Maybe I'm prejudging, but it sounds like it's bordering right on the edge of, you know, something.

[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.400]
I don't know where the hell it is.

[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:25.320]
Where it is.

[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.480]
It's a little bit more fun.

[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:43.980]

[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:43.980]

[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.740]
I'm going to tell them.

[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.880]
I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.060]

[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:29.480]

I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:29.720]
I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:29.720]

I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.760]

[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:05.400]

[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:05.400]

[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:05.400]

[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:05.520]

[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:05.820]
I'll call them now to do spag.

I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.300]

[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.300]

[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.300]

[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.300]

[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.300]

[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.300]

[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.300]

[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.300]

[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:18.460]
I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:18.460]

[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:18.520]
I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:18.740]
I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.480]
I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.500]
I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.380]
I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.400]
I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.640]
I'll call them now to do spag.

[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.080]
I was born and raised in St. Louis, which means a lot.

[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:27.760]
I am not.

[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.180]
I am not.

[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:28.420]
I'm not saying.

[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.020]
Oh, oh, oh, don't start with that.

[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:30.380]
I'll wait.

[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.320]
Listen, I'm talking about baseball.

[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.740]
It's the man with a cap, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.180]
And I don't mean the Marlins cap.

[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.160]
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a town that had two major league baseball teams.

[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:40.640]
Yes, the Browns.

[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:41.280]

[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.540]
The St. Louis Browns.

[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.100]
I mean, you know, they were not really pen and winners a whole lot.

[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.760]
They had one World Series in my memory, which is 1946.

[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.820]
I was the little kid.

[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.420]
I was seven, eight years old, whatever.

[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:57.960]
But trying to explain the relationship that develops between a community and a major league baseball team,

[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.800]
to somebody who has never experienced that, is like trying to talk about people, maybe, or to somebody who never lived through it.

[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.880]
You just can't do it because there's an emotional tie there that is just beyond words.

[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:13.120]
And unlike football, which is once a week every Sunday afternoon or Monday night or whatever,

[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.160]
this happens almost on a daily basis.

[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:19.420]
And you can plug in, plug out, get involved to whatever degree you feel is appropriate.

[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.600]
And just great.

[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:31.500]
And I think the guy who really deserves an awful lot of credit, well, he guy, obviously, is he's putting what $125 million on the line here.

[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.560]
It's all set and done.

[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:38.000]
And you can take $125 million, put it in the bank and live very happily forever after on the interest.

[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.940]
So he's really sticking his neck out, eight miles.

[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:46.580]
And when you look at the fact that a year and a half ago, we didn't have a snowballs chance in hell of having a major league baseball team.

[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.540]
And now we're locked.

[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.200]
It looks like it's going to happen for sure.

[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.760]
That's a big turnaround and a pretty short time frame.

[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.000]
Do you hear what Rick and Judge did?

[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.140]
Or do you hear what you tell it?

[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.520]
Boy, you are just worked up like a lot of cloth.

[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.000]
Well, I'm proud of you.

[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:01.620]
I am thrilled.

[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.360]
I am happy.

[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:14.460]
I hope that everybody who has had somewhere in their background the opportunity to share what can happen when you have a major league baseball franchise in your community

[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:20.000]
is as pleased and thrilled and excited about the possibility as I am because it's just great.

[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:20.980]
It is great.

[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.460]
It's a best thing that's happened here since the mix.

[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.440]
Thank you, Neil.

[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.300]
That's Mix 105.

[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.160]
Oh, gee, don't start now.

[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.120]
Don't get carried away.

[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.340]
Johnny Jarkle be in here and knock us off the years.

[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.740]
I know you're a big baseball fan.

[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.480]
I was talking to Greg.

[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.140]
You know about it.

[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.280]
He's a big baseball fan.

[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.520]
I'm a big baseball fan.

[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.040]
So I just wanted to share that with you.

[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:38.720]
Thank you, Rick.

[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.100]
Okay.

[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:39.820]
Get a new hat.

[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.460]
Never got one.

[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:40.880]
See ya.

[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.140]
I'm a big baseball fan.

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.140]

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.140]

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.140]

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.140]

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.140]

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.140]

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.140]

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.140]

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.140]

[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.820]
Just wowed up as tight as a drum as a snare drum.

[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.200]
Wasn't he?

[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.320]
Man.

[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.320]
Just on and on.

[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.560]
That's the kind of stuff that we strive for.

[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.000]
I know.

[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.160]
118 at WIO.

[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.480]
That was the real Ricky Tickey ladies and gentlemen.

[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.160]
Man, just flowing it out.

[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.840]
Of course, he's not allowed to say much over there anymore.

[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:06.640]
So all these FM guys, you know, when they really have something to say, which isn't often, but they come right here to do it.

[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:07.760]
Cutler Ridge.

[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.380]
I call myself a major douchebag.

[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:12.980]
Uh-huh.

[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.360]
Now you're going to prove it to us.

[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.740]
Yesterday, uh, I called and you cut, I called myself off.

[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.220]
Yeah.

[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.980]
But first I want to, uh, did it hurt?

[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:21.020]

[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:21.880]
Oh, man.

[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:22.940]
Did it.

[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:29.720]
But, uh, this bad boy club, the other day you had a caller wanting to know where these stickers were the bad boy club.

[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.260]
Mm-hmm.

[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.220]
Sounds like a bunch of Yahoo's to me.

[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.160]
What about, but that's what it sounds like.

[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.340]
Well, they're not a bunch of Yahoo's.

[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.040]
You know, these little low riders and stuff that they go around in.

[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.900]
Yeah, they got a little rebel flag on their thing.

[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.540]
Yeah, and they got another one called salty dog.

[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.000]
I wonder if that's any, any, uh...

[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.900]
I've seen a few of those.

[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.340]
Something like salt, Peter.

[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.160]
I don't know.

[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.560]
I guess you didn't say that.

[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.120]
But, uh, no, that's in like with the hair.

[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.320]
The caller after said something about the hair and now you call it a porcupine tail.

[00:38:59.480 --> 00:38:59.700]
Yeah.

[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.380]
I cut mine off.

[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.660]
I had one of those for a while.

[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.120]
Yeah, exactly. Then you outgrow it.

[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.280]
You stop being so childish.

[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.120]
Exactly. Like if you're about 10, it's okay.

[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.820]
Well, I had a little girl.

[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.340]
And they liked that?

[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.200]
Oh, they love it.

[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.020]
Yeah, but the problem is they were 10, too.

[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:16.140]
They what?

[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.520]
I said the problem is they were like 10 or 11, too.

[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.220]
That's a problem.

[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:19.720]
No, no, no.

[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.680]
But, uh...

[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.620]
Yeah, and...

[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.340]
What do they like about that?

[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.180]
It gives them something to grab onto, is that it?

[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.340]
Well, no. Well, that's not a story with me,

[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.340]
because they got plenty of grab onto it.

[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.260]
I'm sure of that, yeah.

[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.280]
I take care of that part, but it's just for the look.

[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.060]
Uh-huh.

[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.660]
You know, it's a problem.

[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.820]
Well, maybe they got bad eyesight.

[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:36.880]
I don't know.

[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:38.580]
But, uh...

[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.320]
First of all, I mean, uh...

[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:40.860]
Last of all...

[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.640]
Last in closing.

[00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:42.100]
Right.

[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.040]
That, uh...

[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.700]
I hope we...

[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.560]
This team...

[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.300]
Hope it works out.

[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.460]
I hope it does as good as the braves are doing right now.

[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.720]
And I'm glad to hear that you're following the braves now.

[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.080]
What do you mean I'm following the braves now?

[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:54.800]
What did I say that?

[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.160]
Well, because now you're always talking good about them.

[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.540]
Well, because they're playing great.

[00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.920]
I try to be honest.

[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.720]
I love the cops, but they suck, okay?

[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.180]
They don't mean I don't love them, and I don't watch them and get, uh...

[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.200]
Heartburn and...

[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.300]
Asterical, but, uh...

[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.240]
You gotta be honest, sir.

[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.480]
One thing I'd like to see is, uh...

[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.620]
Harry Carey...

[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.120]
Come over here and do ours.

[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.020]
Now you're talking.

[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.560]
Now that would be good.

[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.140]
Well, let's take up a collection, okay?

[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.880]
If we get enough Budwizer and take enough money, we can do it.

[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:19.940]
And, uh...

[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.440]
Little thing from the archives, I just want to tell you, you know,

[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.480]
Them douchebags out there?

[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.340]
Why are you talking about my teeth?

[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.360]
Okay.

[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.680]
And, uh...

[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.140]
In closing.

[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.000]
And closing.

[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.600]
Bye.

[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.460]
See ya.

[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.980]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:33.740]
Wow.

[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.840]
Talk about a multi-faceted call.

[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:41.480]
That just had everything from A to Z, from soup to nuts, if we can say that.

[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.840]
Okay, 21 till 2.

[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:44.660]
Let's go to Miami.

[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.100]
Hello.

[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:45.880]
Hi, Neil.

[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:46.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.300]
First time caller.

[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:47.980]
Great.

[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:48.880]
And, uh...

[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.960]
Well, I don't want to smooth around, but I do have a request.

[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.780]
The number of the fucking...

[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:53.160]
Right.

[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:54.600]
Um...

[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:58.460]
Trying to record the quadricks from Nancy and Ron Reagan,

[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.680]
from Frank Sinatra, but every time you play them in the car,

[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:02.620]
I'm ideal.

[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.300]
Every time I play, you're in the shower?

[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.200]
In the car.

[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:05.680]
Oh.

[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.320]
And, um...

[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.960]
So I cannot record, I was just wondering if you can squeeze that out.

[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.900]
Wait, do me, Franky, Panky, is that the one?

[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:12.800]
Uh, no.

[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.700]
Where he records about Nancy, yeah, Franky, Panky.

[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:16.940]
Well, what do you mean, no?

[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.440]
Yeah, that's the one.

[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.640]
Are you sure?

[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.160]
Yeah.

[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.220]
Because I got it right now.

[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:21.720]
You do?

[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.800]
I'm ready to do it for you, but if it's the wrong one, that's the end of this, you know?

[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:26.920]
I bet you have the right one.

[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.760]
B.O.

[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.020]
You sure if you got your thing going?

[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.120]
Uh, it's going.

[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.280]
Okay.

[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:32.960]
Thanks a lot.

[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.220]
Don't do it again, though.

[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:34.700]
Okay.

[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.440]
One time per life per customer.

[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.040]
Sounds good.

[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:37.520]
So, yeah.

[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.800]
You think that is this the one he wants?

[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:45.760]
Bio Records presents Old Blue Eyes on an unauthorized new album called,

[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.240]
Franky, Panky.

[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.280]
When I'm around there,

[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.620]
she just can't say no.

[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.980]
That's why the first lady

[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.340]
has a tram.

[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.260]
Yes, Frank Sinatra is back.

[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.480]
And this time he's in the Lincoln bedroom.

[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:06.340]
And now your end is near.

[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.480]
And so I draw the bedroom curtain.

[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.980]
Frank Sinatra, the legend, the latch.

[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.940]
Run and Nancy, run and Nancy.

[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.800]
One was snapped while the others and see.

[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.260]
This album is so hot even the Reagans are smoking.

[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:34.580]
To be, to be, to be, to be, to be.

[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.260]
You'll get bitch crap.

[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.820]
It was a very good rear.

[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.100]
And of course.

[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:45.420]
And then you go and spoil it all by marrying someone stupid like Run Reagan.

[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.440]
Let me see your moon.

[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.040]
And let me send away the guards.

[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.980]
You'll get a kick out of Franky, Panky.

[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.120]
Available now on busybody records and tapes.

[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:02.960]
I did harm my way.

[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.060]
Well, I left a little space there at the end because he's taping it.

[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.440]
And I don't want to jump right in there.

[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.600]
Who knows what he's maybe playing it on another radio station.

[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.620]
We don't want to jump on it.

[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:17.740]
Hi, Alia.

[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.620]
How you doing?

[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:19.280]
Great.

[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:20.160]
I'm on a mobile.

[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.700]
And I hate people who drive in hi-alia.

[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.540]
The douchebag that designed hi-alia as an asshole.

[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.480]
Yep. Well listen, they can't even figure out what the names of the streets are.

[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.160]
What they'll you want.

[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.580]
They have to renumber them.

[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.380]
Give me a break.

[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.080]
Like 49th is 103rd and 102nd is 102nd.

[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.460]
Who knows what it is.

[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.860]
The budget crap is what it is, sir.

[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.000]
Yeah, sure is.

[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.540]
Separately.

[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.540]
I got a solution.

[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.420]
We could get this team together here.

[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.140]
All we got to do is get all these eastern airlines machine machines and draft them and start building.

[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:51.080]
We're working them out.

[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:51.500]
Okay.

[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.540]
We don't call them wild because we can get some of those airline pilots.

[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.100]
We can call it the Mimey pilots.

[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:56.740]
Yeah.

[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.220]
Nobody's using that name anymore.

[00:43:58.580 --> 00:43:59.080]
That's true.

[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.680]
That was it.

[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:01.460]
Okay.

[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.420]
Just want to call it the designer of ILEO-A2.

[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.080]
See ya.

[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:05.580]
Hey, listen.

[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.020]
They were the Seattle pilots.

[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.300]
I like pilots better than mariners.

[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.920]
Mariners sound like a bunch of old seafaring Cape Cod curmudgeon-like old farts, you know.

[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.160]
Those old salty nasty, surly guys with that Ricky Tiki-capped.

[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.360]
Did you hear that call, by the way?

[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.720]
You didn't hear Ricky Tiki's call.

[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.100]
He was wound up like an alarm clock in heat.

[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.980]
About the baseball thing.

[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.640]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, how he grew up in St. Louis in the 1820s.

[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.220]
And, oh man, just on and on and on and on.

[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.540]
He got to say more here in three minutes and he gets to say over there in like five years.

[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.300]
Let's go to Pembroke Pines.

[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:45.580]
Hello?

[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:46.860]
Mr. Rogers.

[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:47.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.540]
Hope you and South Ford appreciate what the Godfather has given you now.

[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.160]
Yeah, we do.

[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:51.860]
Okay.

[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.200]
Now, we know there's a couple of concessions that he made.

[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.840]
It will be named Miami Mafia.

[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.600]
Any wheel control, a concession.

[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.500]
The couple, they threw the two to the end.

[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.380]
There's a two to the end.

[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:00.800]
There's a two to the end.

[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.340]
200 wheel sleep with the fish.

[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.000]
Okay.

[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.180]
We got it.

[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.460]
143 at WIOD.

[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.480]
We have an open-lined and broiled 524 Tom Hagen is back.

[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.560]
Let's go to North Miami Beach.

[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.400]
Neil.

[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:12.700]
Yeah.

[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.980]
This is a guy that sent you the mung beans a few weeks ago.

[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.460]
Oh, yeah. They were delicious.

[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:18.440]
Yeah, I'm sure.

[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.000]
But, Joey Reynolds.

[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.760]
Better for those toads in my backyard.

[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.240]
Just to all of you and under back taking a long rest.

[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.240]
Joey Reynolds spy report.

[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:26.820]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.560]
This afternoon, for tonight.

[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:30.280]
WSRF.

[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.500]
Oh, today's the day, huh?

[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.500]
With special guest Sam Friedman.

[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:34.700]
Sam Fier?

[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.600]
Sam Far.

[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.120]
Who is Sam Friedman?

[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:38.820]
Who the hell is that?

[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:38.880]
Sam.

[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.620]
Another wash-up-

[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.300]
Wash-up old fart?

[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.000]
Yeah, you go.

[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.240]
I am that hemorrhoid now.

[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.320]
That sounds like it.

[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:49.680]
Yeah.

[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:50.640]
Today is the day.

[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.400]
It's 430.

[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.100]
It's a big show.

[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:52.960]
Okay.

[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.240]
We're going to-

[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.720]
I'll be listening with Bated Breath.

[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:56.380]
I'm sure.

[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:56.940]
Me too.

[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.440]
I'll get my shirts out just in case.

[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.200]
Okay.

[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.220]
Thanks for the warning, sir.

[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:00.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.240]
Okay. Speaking of radio celebrities,

[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.240]
you get to say very little while they're pumping out all those cornball hits.

[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.880]
That's not how you bet.

[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.480]
Yeah.

[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.600]
I had to call and tell you about this thing about Larry Kanga.

[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.000]
You know the thing I like about Joey Reynolds the most, though.

[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:15.680]
What?

[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.300]
He's dying stupid!

[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.000]
Oh, anyway.

[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.200]
This morning I was driving to work.

[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.600]
You can't get CNN up in Coral Springs at four o'clock.

[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.500]
So I was listening to Larry.

[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.060]
Why not?

[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.420]
There's a signal as well, so you can't get it.

[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:30.560]
CNN.

[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:31.980]
Oh, you mean CNN radio?

[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:32.840]
Yeah, I.N.Z.

[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:33.840]
Oh, God.

[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.220]
Oh, I like to keep informed before going on the area.

[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:36.660]
But anyway.

[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.860]
When I used to work at I.N.Z.

[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.220]
doing nights, I would drive going home to Pembroke Lakes.

[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.520]
I would drive up the road to Pembroke Road, which is like about, seriously, like about a mile away.

[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.060]
I couldn't hear the station.

[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.340]
It's depressing.

[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:48.500]
That's like working at surf.

[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.220]
Yeah.

[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.260]
Boy, is he going to be a monster over there?

[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.680]
Well, anyway, last night Larry had Dave Barryard.

[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.260]
That's what I heard, Mr. Historia.

[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:56.940]
Yeah, right.

[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:02.280]
And they were chuckling it up and somebody called from Miami and he had to dump them.

[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:07.340]
And a couple of calls later, someone called from Fort Vododya and said, there must have been Neil Rogers.

[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.860]
And then Larry, what a pony this guy is.

[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.300]
Larry goes, Neil Rogers is a East German radio and...

[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.160]
I don't know what to do with that.

[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:15.760]
Yeah, right.

[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.560]
And Dave says, oh, yeah, he's on I.N.Z.

[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:21.920]
He's on there.

[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:22.640]
He's on talk show.

[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.820]
He goes, Miami, because I thought he was in Fort Vododya.

[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.300]
And Larry says, well, Larry is the same market as if he didn't know.

[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:29.720]
Yeah.

[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.880]
And then he said, Neil, I haven't seen him in years.

[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.300]
I wouldn't know him if I saw him.

[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.980]
Well, I'm the only guy who weighs 8,000 pounds in town, so I probably stand out.

[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.360]
Well, no, there's a thing.

[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.280]
I talked about contradictory.

[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:43.860]
Just before he said that, he said, the last time I saw Neil was a pompadot harness track.

[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.120]
And then he proceeded to say, I wouldn't know if I saw him.

[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:46.440]
Yeah.

[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.680]
Well, the interesting part of it is I've never seen Larry at pompadot harness track.

[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.920]
And of course, he doesn't know anything about the show.

[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.540]
Hi, this is Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.440]
One thing about Larry, he may not be consistent, but he's sure full of crap, you know what?

[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:02.180]
That's for sure.

[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:02.500]
Yeah.

[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.500]
I just want to let you know that.

[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.720]
Well, listen, he's got a check in the mail for you for this car.

[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:06.380]
OK.

[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.980]
If you want to go play basketball tonight with a bullseye.

[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:09.260]

[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.200]
By the way, hello, hello.

[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:10.560]
Yeah.

[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:11.240]
One thing.

[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.040]
Don't panic now.

[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:12.520]
I'm still here.

[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:17.680]
If you don't, I took all the couple calls and the show this morning about baseball came up because of the headlines.

[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:25.220]
And other than you, which I think would be so astronomically revolutionary, you probably won't get the job.

[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:25.960]
That's right.

[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.740]
But somebody suggested Mel Allen, wouldn't that be great?

[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.560]
And now for the fucking...

[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:36.560]
Well, I would be great if Mel were still alive, because they have to prep him for 12 weeks before he tapes that this week in baseball.

[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.240]
So if he were still alive, it would be great.

[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.140]
Well, good luck here.

[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:39.800]
Thank you, Johnny.

[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:40.500]
Bye-bye later.

[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:41.160]
OK.

[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:42.940]
147...

[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.540]
Oh, that Larry King, man, I tell you.

[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.000]
He is a piece of...

[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.820]
I'm going to do it there.

[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:50.060]
Something.

[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.480]
OK, let's do our last break of the day here while we're still on a good mood and we'll be right back.

[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.000]
Yes.

[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:55.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:56.280]
Yes.

[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.180]
I put one of your...

[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.260]
One of your talking about...

[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.580]
These bridges...

[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.680]
About orange and boats that you talked about earlier?

[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.320]
About what?

[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.280]
Brigers, cars and boats.

[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.540]
Now, we're talking about bridges over the...

[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.720]
...causeway, not the ones in your mouth.

[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.180]
I don't have any of my friends.

[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:13.600]
OK.

[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.940]
OK. Yeah.

[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:15.800]
Calm down, sir.

[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:16.600]
Take a deep breath.

[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.060]
Those are regulated by the United States Corps of Engineers.

[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.080]
You got to choose.

[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:21.560]
No.

[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.780]
Well, it is.

[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.000]
All bridges over navigable waterways.

[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.660]
See if I knew that I wouldn't have been asking, sir.

[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:28.460]
But, sir?

[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.820]
I said if I knew the answer to the question I wouldn't have asked it in the first place.

[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:32.260]
OK.

[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:41.000]
Well, I'm saying, sir, is that the United States Corps of Engineers are the ones that regulate bridges over navigable waterways.

[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:41.680]
Over one?

[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:43.780]
Navigable waterways.

[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:44.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:44.600]
OK.

[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:45.660]
Yeah.

[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.540]
So it's up to them to decide what time the bridges should not be on.

[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.260]
It's open to the marine traffic.

[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:54.680]
Yes.

[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.380]
And what time should they not be open to marine traffic, sir?

[00:49:58.920 --> 00:49:59.080]
Yes.

[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:03.220]
I'm telling you that they come up with the times.

[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.540]
Well, what is the time?

[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:13.100]
I believe it's that rush hour times, sir, that they are not open to marine traffic.

[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.680]
Other than that, they are open to marine traffic.

[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.540]
So in other words, any slump with a boat can come along and back up traffic for two months.

[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:21.340]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:23.520]
Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crappers there?

[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.500]
That is not a communist bunch of craps.

[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:30.600]
Sounds like some kind of the end-of-the-all fascist Tommy Pico conspiracy to me.

[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.880]
There's got five people to be used to one boat.

[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:32.380]
Right.

[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:32.860]
Exactly.

[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.360]
What a boat is going to stop for five thousand cars?

[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.440]
Is that it?

[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:41.240]
No, I think that fifty thousand cars ought to stop for one jackass in his boat.

[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.500]
I think that's what they ought to do.

[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.000]
Man, you better know your laws, Mr. Because you sure don't.

[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:47.580]
That's right.

[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:52.400]
I suppose you want the man-briggs closed to both sides of the good heart and two.

[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.460]
I want the bridges closed period.

[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:54.900]
Okay?

[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:55.720]
I want them closed.

[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:59.520]
I want the bridge tenter to go home and watch your MTV and get the hell out of our lives.

[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.820]
In other words, you want those bridges closed?

[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.640]
Let them use the junior tunnel, okay?

[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:05.940]
You know, I'm not the one that has the most of those.

[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.600]
I think they ought to go out into George Washington bridge and jump all of bridge tenters.

[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.400]
How do you like that, sir?

[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:15.300]
Well, I don't know about you, but you shot like some stupid idiotic jerk.
