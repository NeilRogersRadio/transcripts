[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740]
The cops shot Miami. Hello. Hey Larry. Hi.

[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.200]
Yeah, so it looks like I'm going to get baseball down here.

[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.560]
I'm sure, yep. I think you'll know it by Thursday.

[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.420]
Oh, yeah. That's great. It's about time. That's how I got it.

[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.920]
They're talking about, uh, what do you like to do with the games?

[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.820]
What do you think of, uh, you have anyone in mind like?

[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.600]
To do the broadcast the games? Uh-huh.

[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.000]
Well, they'll get flooded with tapes from around the country of a lot of good second announcers.

[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.420]
Uh, I have no idea if they should get a good young announcer.

[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.800]
Uh, the kind of announcing it, I had a higher two good guys.

[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.680]
I wouldn't, I wouldn't hire an older veteran. I wouldn't do that for gimmick purposes.

[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.920]
Um, you know, you can say, well, it's higher any hardwell.

[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.940]
But I'd, uh, that, while that makes some, that kind of forced.

[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.280]
It's not till 93 that you're playing. I'd hire really two good announcers who are going to grow with you.

[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.560]
What do you have? Who are they?

[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.560]
I don't know.

[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.580]
They're mentioning the name Neil Rogers who walked down here.

[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.560]
Yeah, I, I, the last I heard him.

[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.580]
I do baseball was years ago and he did pretty good baseball.

[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.520]
But he's gotten a reputation now that I wouldn't hire him.

[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.040]
No.

[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.740]
Because the reputation is whacked. So I wouldn't want to, you know, that's tough break.

[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.420]
But, uh, normally I guess he'd be good.

[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.120]
Also, I don't know about his age. Portland, Oregon. Hello.

[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.740]
And then they'll do it that. Yeah. Right.

[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.700]
What a reputation. Let's get Dick Gerstein in here right now.

[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.920]
Okay. Write me a check.

[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.680]
1007, a W.I.O.D.

[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.860]
Our first piece of business today is Happy Birthday Spencer.

[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.900]
Spencer be 65 today and he's out there working his ass off.

[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.640]
Boy, and he's just, uh, he's feeling better.

[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.000]
He looks great for him.

[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.000]
And, uh, he wanted me to wish him a happy birthday.

[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.760]
He says, please, please do it.

[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.060]
I say, hey, why bother?

[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.480]
Happy Birthday Spencer. You okay at our book?

[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.620]
Just do a good job and don't know Nick's okay?

[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.480]
So anyway, thanks to Dave Hyde.

[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.300]
I don't want to make this whole thing.

[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.940]
You know, another one of these self aggrandizing things like the audience with all that sucking around.

[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.940]
Yes, they only want you to do the games.

[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.640]
But Dave Hyde in the Sunsettings Sports section this morning as a column 93 forecast where he's visualizing the first, uh,

[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.240]
Marlins game or whatever it's going to be at Joe Robbie Stadium in 93.

[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.180]
And he's going on about the first inning to face the New York Met's Vince Coleman.

[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.940]
And the pitcher winds up through and it says, oh, well, let's just say radio play by play man.

[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.320]
Neil Rogers called it incredible.

[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.100]
Can you believe that Dave Hyde in the prestigious Sunsettingal writes that?

[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.240]
The mentioning the name Neil Rogers a lot down here.

[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:48.660]
Yeah, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, the last I heard him do baseball was years ago and he did pretty good baseball.

[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.080]
But he's gotten a reputation now that I wouldn't hire him.

[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.720]
Here's the one old delivery on the way and here's a swing and a line drive.

[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.940]
The left center weaves going back still going back in reaches up and makes the chance.

[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.520]
And then we'll do it that. Okay, 10 way to WIOD.

[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.680]
That Larry man, he's the best. And he I love him.

[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.100]
Love him from head to toe, which is about like what two inches.

[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.060]
Anyway, it's 10.09. We got all kinds of stuff going on this weekend.

[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.240]
We got the big Friday night baseball fever day at the miracle.

[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.080]
Come on out and have a great time. All the veterans and their families with proper ID get in for free.

[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.920]
All military personnel, their families, all others admission is only 50 cents, which I think most of even you can afford.

[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.340]
And everybody entering the ballpark will get a free American flag.

[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.000]
We got other prizes, surprises, discount coupons from our sponsors, including advanced automotive lane, Arnold's Royal Castle,

[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.740]
Spice Apple restaurants, Danny's catering, etc. Game time is 705.

[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.500]
I'll be there at six. We got those ugly pictures, the bumper stickers and a good time will be head by all Friday night at Pompler on Municipal Stadium.

[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.120]
Let's pack it. Let's jam it. Let's fill it up. Okay.

[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.200]
Pompano Beach. Hello.

[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.880]
Can you believe that? Okay. How you doing? Get off that speaker.

[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.560]
I'll hear you, man. Listen, I was just kicking one of my sales and the butt. Good. How you doing? That could never be a bad idea.

[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.380]
Huh? Okay. I'm on the phone. What's up, big guy?

[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.780]
We're doing it. Listen, I read about that article this morning. I mean, don't you get any respect?

[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.820]
What article? You just talked about the Sunsendler with Dave Hoyt.

[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.360]
What's wrong with that? What do you mean don't I get any respect?

[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.300]
What do you think the article is about?

[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.600]
What do I think the article is about?

[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.660]
Yeah, a reference to you. Do you think he would agree that you would be a great announcer for the Mollens?

[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.140]
Why not? I would agree with that.

[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.620]
Well, I mean, he only meant it's like a little drop in there at the beginning. The article isn't about me.

[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.400]
The article you just say you don't... I'm in you window.

[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.560]
Yeah, the article's suggesting that I'm there doing the game.

[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.680]
I think that's not my opinion and I'm really glad I'm not Neil Rogers.

[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:59.300]
I think you would serve a better purpose taking over for Jim S. E. and because his days are numbered.

[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.940]
I got news for you. They're so pathetic. I don't want to discuss Chicago Cubs baseball because they don't play any, okay?

[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.660]
That thing yesterday, a Sandberg with an embarrassing error. He don't even get in front of the ball and knock it down.

[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.360]
I mean, that run made the difference. Then Big Dave Smith comes in at Big Fat Slob and the ninth inning.

[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.300]
We finally come from way behind. Get the lead.

[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.520]
The first man he faces, it's a homer to tie it. And this poor kid Wilkins, it's catching who's going to be a good major league player someday.

[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.620]
But it's not ready for prime time yet. It's just all these past balls and a run's a score and Smith don't cover the plate.

[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.220]
It's just... They're like a sandlot team. They're pathetic. But I don't want to get excited about it.

[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.800]
Why do they keep catching catches around? What about Barry Hill?

[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.680]
Barry Hill couldn't hit his way out of a paper sack and since he had surgery on his shoulder, he couldn't throw the ball from here to your nose, okay?

[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.600]
It's true.

[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.080]
And Big Hector hit a homerun.

[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.420]
They had a chance to deal Barry Hill and Walton in the off season when they might have gotten something for both of them when they're still a phantom.

[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.020]
And now that they've proven that they're both garbage, they just... Listen, I don't want to discuss it.

[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.020]
Well, I'll clear something out.

[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.520]
The Chicago Tribune is destroying the Chicago Cubs. It's all I can tell you.

[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.220]
You know, Essie and his strictly a minor league manager and as much as I wanted to see Zimmer go, why did he bring in a guy like Whitey Herzog or somebody with some experience?

[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.160]
There you go.

[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:18.800]
Not a guy who's like a minor minor, even David Johnson would have been, we could've ripped him, but a minor league manager, you don't know nothing who keeps doing all these stupid moves.

[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.440]
He don't know anything about baseball, Essie and he's a jerk.

[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.640]
Well, I got a guy on the meds that you should get and that's Ron Darling because he's ponders.

[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.320]
We'll pass.

[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.400]
Well, listen, I got to get back to work.

[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.840]
It's a nice talking to you and just keep up the good job, alright?

[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.700]
I'm a great day, sir.

[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.060]
Bye.

[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.980]
See you. 12 minutes past 10 at WIOD.

[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:45.180]
We got the sunny and joe out there in California and LA and other tough assignments covering the big baseball meetings where it may or may not be finalized.

[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.040]
They may or may not take the vote, but it's it's in. We're in.

[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.400]
We're in folks. We got it.

[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.120]
We're going to get it.

[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.740]
Let's go to North Miami Beach. Hello.

[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.480]
Hi, Neil. Saw. How are you?

[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.140]
Okay, saw.

[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.100]
Yeah. I see a problem with you and Hank being the announcers together.

[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.580]
Yeah.

[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:06.040]
Oh, there would be a lack of an ethnic balance. Could you see them announcing here? They come to two wild and crazy Jews.

[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.400]
Yeah.

[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.800]
The Acerning Rest you guys would be singing Shlup us out to the ballgame.

[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.560]
Two live Jews.

[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.000]
The two live Jews.

[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.520]
Or two fat Jews, one of the other.

[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.620]
I'll tell you about your beautiful.

[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.100]
Uh-huh.

[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.580]
Keep up the good work. We love you.

[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.960]
The mentioning the name Neil Rogers who went down here.

[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.640]
Yeah, I'm the last I heard him.

[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:39.820]
I was in the back of the

[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.000]
New York Times.

[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.000]

[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.000]

[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.000]

[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.000]

[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.000]

[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.020]
I was in the back of the New York Times.

[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.320]
I was in the back of the New York Times.

[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.760]
I was in the back of the New York Times.

[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.600]
I was in the back of the New York Times.

[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.380]
I was in the back of the New York Times.

[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.820]
I was in the back of the New York Times.

[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.800]
I was in the back of the New York Times.

[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.300]
I was in the back of the New York Times.

[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.380]
I was in the back of the New York Times.

[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:55.980]
524WYOD.

[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.860]
Here's a Miami Starline on a mobile.

[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.200]
I can't take this Larry King thing anymore.

[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.060]
I want to tell you something.

[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.620]
Or a Miami mobile on the Starline.

[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.700]
Number of years ago when he was in town,

[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.040]
I was an officer across the street of Capitol Bank.

[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.680]
We bounced and checked.

[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.540]
And then we do it this.

[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.140]
We bounced his check so often that we had to close the town.

[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:12.800]

[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.180]
Zoom and get a judgment.

[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.240]
You left town.

[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.680]
We couldn't even get paid on the judgment.

[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.820]
This is about as dumb as you can get.

[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.760]
That's all I got to say.

[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.160]
I'm not going to do it anymore.

[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:23.640]
Okay.

[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.140]
They hate him here like poison.

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.200]
Like poison.

[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.080]
That's because they know him.

[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.280]
To know him is to hate him and probably to be owed money.

[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.060]
To open line still and brow.

[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.700]
Is this your going to get off the road today?

[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.020]
Yesterday we were just sizzling,

[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.700]
but I have a feeling it's going to be back to normal.

[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.020]
I heard Rick and Suds Belieck and yesterday on my way home.

[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.560]
Just whining and carrying on and psychotic.

[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.220]
I think it's because of what his name's father now.

[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.680]
It's not bad enough we got the moonscope guy,

[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.200]
but now his father calls in.

[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.000]
If you think the moonscope guy is boring,

[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.080]
oh Rick, come on.

[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:52.940]
Give us a break.

[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.360]
Let's go to Miami.

[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:54.760]
Hello.

[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.820]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.220]
Good.

[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.020]
Listen, after Rick and putt signed off last night,

[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.420]
I switched over to FTL.

[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.460]
Believe it or not, Steve and the gang,

[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.660]
you know, how they just sit around and be as for a couple hours.

[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.000]
Yeah.

[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.060]
Because they don't have any programming.

[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.280]
Well they were talking about who should be the announcer in Steve's.

[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.780]
Well I hear that Neil does a good job.

[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.860]
Everyone around town says he does an excellent job.

[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.200]
Yeah.

[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.600]
And your best friend Rick Ciderman?

[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.280]
He speaks up into the, oh no, he's a l.

[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.780]
He has no sense of humor.

[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.200]
So evidently Rick Ciderman.

[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.480]
So let me say this to you, okay.

[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.300]
First of all, I really have no interest in talking about them

[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.740]
and the reason being that it's a one note deal, okay.

[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.840]
Every day that's all they talk about is Neil Rogers.

[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.600]
I mean, you know, in between the,

[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.720]
you're and lady and Alice talking about the drag queens

[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.620]
and all the other, in between all of that.

[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.300]
Basically it's just, let's talk about Neil Rogers' radio

[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.000]
and try to get him to give us some more publicity.

[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.860]
I'm not going to do it.

[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.560]
It's not worth it.

[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.640]
Because what they're doing is so pathetic

[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.900]
and so embarrassing, there's nothing going on there.

[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.160]
Why don't you get so many damn spots, Neil?

[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.820]
Because when you go out and sell them like for 20, 25 bucks a sponsor,

[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.380]
it's like a dollar a dollar, okay.

[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.040]
If you punched it up right now, there would be a commercial on guaranteed.

[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.020]
Well that's great.

[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.940]
That's why we don't waste our time, okay.

[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.100]
We'd rather hear more substance

[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.140]
and less, less 20 dollar commercials.

[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:07.860]
I agree.

[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:08.420]
Okay.

[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:08.980]
Take care.

[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.240]
Don't make the mistake again, sir.

[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.480]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

[00:10:44.940 --> 00:11:01.800]
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:20.840]
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:39.660]
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.760]
1040 at WYOD, we have an open letter line, that was a Freudian slip and

[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:52.980]
date, 751, thanks a lot for calling Dick, that was a Dick Salis on a phone, turnpike.

[00:11:53.540 --> 00:12:00.360]
Hey, the first side turnpike. What is it? What did you say? I said turnpike, turnpike,

[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:07.320]
okay, sorry about that. Surfside on the turnpike. Okay, I talked to Hank a couple of nights ago,

[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.260]
and we were talking about who could do the announcing how a knight it would be for you to do the

[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:19.540]
announcing for the Amalan. Yeah, and he came across to something like, well, that one of

[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:24.460]
the possibilities was Bob Costas, and he said, wouldn't you rather listen to Bob Costas?

[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.940]
And I said, not really. What does that mean? Wouldn't you rather listen to Bob Costas?

[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.720]
I don't want to get started, he didn't really say that. Well, he didn't say that, he said, well,

[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.240]
Bob Costas. Well, why are you putting words in his mouth? You're trying to start troubles?

[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.480]
No, I'm not, I'm not. Yes, you are. Why don't you admit it? You want to instigate some

[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.060]
trouble, or like everybody else to the world, or all psychotic? I thought he would be a little

[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.100]
bit more supportive of you. Well, Hank isn't supportive of anybody except Hank, I mean, that's

[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.660]
something I've known a long time ago, Hank has spent most of the time since I've been on the

[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.840]
station trying to get everybody else's can, so I'm not, you know, all that concerned about Hank.

[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.420]
Have heard some of the other colors call in just like myself. I'm not really a big baseball fan

[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:05.060]
product. We never had a team, but if you were doing the game, I think it would be just a natural.

[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.480]
I call it, look, I don't want to waste the next two years on this show every day, because that's

[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.880]
not what we do with all this sucking around. It wouldn't be, it's not going to happen number one.

[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.640]
Number two, I make plenty of money right now. I'm perfectly happy doing what I'm doing, and that's

[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.340]
in that's the way it is, okay? It's just, I couldn't care. I mean, it would be nice, but it's not

[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.980]
going to happen. So it's fun to talk about, and I appreciate all the compliments of the kind words,

[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.140]
but it's not going to happen. It's not, I don't know what you're laughing about, it is not going to happen.

[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.180]
Come on, Neil. No, it's not going to happen. We got it. We're going to try to put up a little fight

[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.160]
here. We got it. Yeah, I ought to hear put up a little fight. Forget it. There's nothing to fight

[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.160]
about. Let's just enjoy the team and have a good time. Let me ask your question. What not going to

[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.780]
happen? Okay, then first of all, let me, let me say this, I wasn't even going to get into this,

[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.040]
because there've been some things that have happened the last couple of days here regarding a

[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.720]
hank in the sales. There've been a lot of things that have been set inside this building,

[00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.040]
and people calling in with these stupid comments about, well, we get to baseball and IOD can get

[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.700]
it. We go all sports after two p.m. Let me say this to you, okay? Rick and Suts are doing a great

[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.060]
job. I like him whether they have an H-Share or a one-Share, and I felt that way right from the

[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.300]
beginning in spite of little clandestine dinners with Joey Reynolds and other people I know in

[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.540]
the business and people in this building who want their jobs. I'm sick and tired of it, okay,

[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.280]
sir. They're doing a hell of a job. We got a good thing going here. And the biggest problem with

[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.080]
this radio station has been, no matter how good things get going, they keep changing and change,

[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.140]
like people change their underwear. This station has been changing over the years to the

[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.560]
part where it's a laughing stock, okay? All sports radio ain't going to make it in this market, okay?

[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:38.060]
If A&K can make it in New York, because they got 15 million people and they got 75 professional

[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:43.380]
teams up there. This isn't a sports town, okay? So all these people in here who think that all

[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.900]
of a sudden Rick and Suts were going to kick them out and Hank is going to like the sports department's

[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.640]
going to take over the radio station. That's all wishful thinking of some of the people connected

[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.620]
with sports on this radio station and quite frankly it's a bunch of crap. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.160]
Just you're getting emotional. No, I'm not. Just telling you how it is.

[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.480]
All I'd like is to hear you do the game. What's not going to happen? I just got you're telling you

[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.080]
that. You want me to sit here and argue with you for four hours about it? It's not going to happen.

[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.800]
It's your time. Okay. 1044. He's right about that. It's a sister's dime actually. We have an

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.380]
open line on the star line, which is our dime. If you have Bells, South mobility star IOD, Hollywood.

[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.580]
Deal. Yeah. Do you hear about that fight with Gastonel? That boxing? No.

[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:30.360]
Hey, listen, don't call it boxing anymore. I mean boxing is barbaric and stupid as it wasn't

[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:36.040]
the first place. Now we got actors boxing and football players boxing and pretty soon Spencer is

[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.760]
going to be boxing the guy who washes the car on Monday, Sunshine J. They're going to be boxing.

[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.940]
You see the winner gets to wash the cars. I mean, it's just a bunch of friends. Listen to what happened.

[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.140]
He gets knocked down in the 12 seconds. Yeah. And comes to find out he's a professional wrestler.

[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:55.160]
And all his wrestling buddies noticed the fall that he took as a wrestling fall. Yeah.

[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.520]
And now the whole thing is on investigation. Of course, it's all a bunch of crap. The public is bored

[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.660]
of tears and they're all out there sucking it up because they've got nothing else to do. Exactly.

[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.560]
One more thing or two more three more things. Wow. Holy cow. All cats are no longer on sheet

[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.480]
is morning. Oh, forget it. Go. What's the next one? I don't want to.

[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.440]
Also, nobody care. See you people I want to call up with all these little spirals. I mean,

[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.480]
spirals used to be fun when it was about something that somebody listened to. Nobody listens to him.

[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.380]
Nobody listens to the light bulb. Listen to the voices. Listen to the voices who call in like on

[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:30.680]
Alice's. Hello. They're all the old rejects from WS news. They're all over the age of 100 drinker

[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.500]
proof. Nobody cares about that. It's a waste of time. Well, he was just trying to get in on it.

[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.940]
Exactly. What other thing? Yeah. I mentioned to my wife last night that I was thinking of buying

[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:46.060]
season tickets for this baseball and she about threw me out of the house. Why is that? Well,

[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.440]
I what I want to know is like kind of a slime ball. I mean, like there's like 80 home games.

[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:57.000]
81 to be exact. How many? 81. Okay. And that's like three or four in a row and then they leave

[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.260]
town. How are usually like five six seven in a row? Forget it. Forget what? I'd be divorced.

[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:10.860]
Hey, are you some kind of a whoo? No, but I'm watching basketball now. I watch baseball.

[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.840]
Yeah, by the way, I thought the game was last night. It's tonight that the boys are going to wrap it up.

[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.360]
How come they give him two days? I know they're traveling, but she's are they that wimpy that they got

[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:23.540]
at two days? I think it's LA. All the injuries are trying to, you know, pay off the people. Yeah,

[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:29.500]
but it's all over tonight. Also, one other thing. Could you get some people to dig up what happened

[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.160]
with Larry King? I mean, you guys keep talking about some about that. I'm not interested in digging

[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.720]
up what happened. It's all into history. See, I'm not going to turn around and play his game. The reason

[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:43.360]
listen to me. The reason Larry rips me is because when I was here in town, he used to suck around. He

[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.020]
had me on Michelle a couple of times, but anybody that doesn't kiss up to him and it's like he does

[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.220]
to everybody else. He will rip them. He'll never rip anybody else. But as long as you don't kiss up

[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.300]
to him and if you rip him, God forbid, then he'll just absolutely do anything and is powered to

[00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.520]
rip an attack and just to shred and tear. And that this is his response. Okay. And all the stuff that's

[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.960]
happened here, which is well documented. He just his memory has gone, bad. He knows nothing about it.

[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.060]
Well, that's the thing I would like to call and respond to his comment. He made about you saying

[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:15.320]
that you're not forget about why waste the time. It's just historically funny. Those cards that

[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:22.980]
Roger dubbed for me some of the funniest stuff I've ever heard in my life. And then we do it that.

[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.700]
Yeah, I gotta go. See you. Just like all those checks and everything and all the stuff with

[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:32.040]
the gurstein and all the stuff at the track with the tellers. He don't remember that. And then

[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.800]
to do it that course. Before he became a big star, you see no matter one thing I want to tell you,

[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:44.280]
no matter how much money you're making, no matter how much notoriety that you have,

[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.360]
a walking turd is still a turd. Okay. So by any other name, it's still the same.

[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.940]
Yeah.

[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:59.360]
Everyone knows the Kennedys have quite a record and now you can have it too. It's the Palm Beach

[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.200]
Singing all the Kennedys greatest hits.

[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.520]
The Palm Beach Boys will give you the willies.

[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.340]
Yes, it's a Palm Beach Boys. Cut. Why?

[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.600]
John John John John John.

[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.120]
All their dirty laundry is washing up on shore. My girls on the beach.

[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.260]
Say you're well when I put my head down here. I hear that. Can't hear the ocean.

[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.680]
My uncle's worst JNP.

[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.680]
We have cousin Patty and me.

[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:59.020]
Won't it be by sip, wink, wake up with the wages who is 17?

[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:05.120]
You'll also get little old Rosie from Massachusetts, Ted Man's Curve and twist in by the pool.

[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.140]
So next time you feel like hanging 10 or 10 catch the Palm Beach Boys.

[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.060]
Available on criminal records and tapes.

[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:18.440]
Enough of the fucking. It's 10.52 at W.I.U. Body by solo flex spot coming up if you have

[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.120]
MTV on. Don't get distracted.

[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.240]
Coral Springs.

[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.180]
Hey, Hi Neil. How's it going?

[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:24.760]
Okay.

[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.660]
I just want to say one thing. I just can't believe all these people down here.

[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.060]
I mean, you know, we're going to get a professional team down here.

[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.980]
I mean, what would they rather do? Watch TV, listen to the radio or watch the live thing?

[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.700]
I'd rather watch a live thing myself.

[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.740]
I mean, you know, this is the best thing that could ever happen to us. How can anybody?

[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.120]
Don't you understand where you are?

[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.820]
No, that's why you have to temper your enthusiasm because you got to understand where you are.

[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.220]
I've lived here all my life. I realized how stupid it gets down here.

[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.800]
But I mean, you know, this is like one of the best things that could ever happen.

[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.380]
You know, like I said, it's the live game.

[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.060]
You know, going to the world.

[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:08.240]
Yeah, but you got to understand. See, live is like out of place here because we don't have too many people

[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.940]
who are alive. Most of the people who have been dead for 20 years.

[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.200]
They're like your win-mores and your sins.

[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.980]
Sure, we'll see a lot of those people out there.

[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.200]
See, that'll be one of the great things about going to the ballpark because you won't see those

[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.780]
people out there. They don't come to the base part of it.

[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.100]
No, no, they can afford it. Are you kidding me?

[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.040]
But they don't want to part with the buck.

[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.820]
Do you think that all the people who schlep online at the Rascal House and go to the

[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.240]
really good that those people are all on food stamps that they're all on welfare?

[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.080]
Are you kidding me?

[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.460]
The ones that steal the salt shakers?

[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.200]
Yeah, the ones that are living in their 200,000 dollar condos over on the ocean.

[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.860]
They're 400,000 dollar condos. Let's get serious.

[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.560]
Just true.

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.260]
They're just a bunch of snores.

[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.140]
Well, like I said, it'll be great to go out there and see living and breathing people and have a

[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:50.640]
great time.

[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.500]
Yeah, true.

[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:57.320]
Well, anyways, Neil, once you have a good day and, you know, whoever announces the games,

[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.440]
you know, more power to them.

[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.060]
Exactly. Exactly. I mean, I'm not going to waste the next two years with all this,

[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.460]
enough of the fucking...

[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.140]
Exactly, with all these stupid calls. I mean, it's the nice, but it's not going to happen.

[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.440]
It's ridiculous, especially on this station.

[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.980]
All right, and you'll have a good day.

[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.920]
And the same to you, sir.

[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.760]
When the big tournament money's on the line,

[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.940]
professional women choose macho tennis balls.

[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.020]
Macho.

[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.480]
We give women the balls to win.

[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.080]
It's 1106 on a great Wednesday.

[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.900]
Should we say hump day? Because he's not here today, Mr. Hump.

[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.700]
So anyway, it's 1113. Let's take a look in the new times and see if we have anything really exciting.

[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.600]
In our one bastion of hope here in an otherwise grim journalistic community.

[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.400]
Sometimes complaining about horse racing and the cubbies.

[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.580]
As an occasional listener to the Neil Rogers show, I know,

[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.980]
and nearly when I see one, I figured that Mr. Salas had to come out of the closet soon or related

[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.860]
with his confessions. My personal favorite was probably his first one in which he admitted to his

[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:05.540]
psychosexual fetish for listening to a hostel of Cerbic Uncle Neil, which probably gives 90%

[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.000]
of his audience an amusing source for midday jollies. Myself included, she says.

[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:10.940]
And now for the second.

[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:11.740]
All right, come on.

[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.540]
Concerning Richard's for... That's not she, it's he. Tony.

[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.700]
Okay, Tony, sorry.

[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.300]
Well, Tony could be she couldn't it, but not with the why.

[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.720]
Now, not in higher Leah. Tony couldn't be she.

[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.500]
Anyway, Tony goes on concerning Richard's first two letters in which he outlined

[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.660]
and perfect to tell the things he found distasteful about Neil Rogers.

[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.360]
I have no comments except for the one referring to Neil's anti-biolinguilism xenophobia.

[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:39.440]
He does need to get off the anti-cuban wave that he's been writing for several years now.

[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.900]
My father and several other older Cubans, I know still insist he's a flaming communist.

[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.960]
Come on, Easter, come on Easter.

[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:47.660]
Yeah.

[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.540]
Up yours, George.

[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.120]
However, my big complaint about the Neil Rogers show is that incessant,

[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.880]
incessant, boring, moronic babbling on horse and harness racing that he does,

[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.100]
and the cubs give me a break.

[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.200]
It says Tony Rosales in higher Leah.

[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.040]
These are all phony names. They're all coming from the same person.

[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.240]
Dick, Dick on the beach.

[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.080]
But anyway, it's good that the, how come they don't mention 610 WIOD 10 to 2 in here in each letter?

[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.480]
That would be a little bit more productive.

[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.000]
Okay, so get your act together over at New Times, would you?

[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.760]
Well, what is that about on the front?

[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.280]
The Miami, oh, the main drag.

[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.040]
They got a drag story on the front page of New Times and look who's dressed up and pink

[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.000]
there. That's beautiful.

[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.940]
It's 1115 at WIOD, Helen Dale.

[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.820]
Hey, Dale, how you doing?

[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:35.300]
Okay.

[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.900]
Talking about journalistic things, you have the Sunsett and the Lair?

[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:40.960]
Hi, James.

[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.100]
Is this about Dave Hyde?

[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.600]
No, no, this isn't the classified.

[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:44.240]
No.

[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.920]
You were looking for some more promotions for your show.

[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.500]
In the classified under greetings, a little ad here says looking for something,

[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.020]
one excitement and fun.

[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.920]
Tune in Sunday, 7 to 9 p.m.,

[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.740]
A.m. 980 WIOD.

[00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.480]
Oh, no, wait a minute.

[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.900]
This isn't the radio of, what does he call me?

[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.340]
Don't tell me.

[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.960]
Radio, what do you call himself George?

[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.800]
The radio outlaw, is that it?

[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:07.300]
I don't know.

[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.600]
It says with Jay Allen and Charles Lex starting June 23rd.

[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:12.800]
Yeah.

[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.760]
Is that a promotional budget or what?

[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.460]
They take out classified ads telling you what?

[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.600]
Well, what station is it?

[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.100]
W-W-N-N.

[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.120]
Oh, the Motivate?

[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.140]
Well, that's all they can afford.

[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.060]
I haven't been able to motivate enough people to spend more than $2, $3 on that station.

[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.800]
They don't even show up anymore.

[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:27.780]
They're like non-existent.

[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.380]
Why figure today?

[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.220]
Are they still on the year?

[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.220]
I guess so.

[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.820]
Boy, we serve in the paper.

[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:32.960]
I got news for you, sir.

[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.660]
There are so many radio stations that are on the year in this market

[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.200]
that are serving no useful purpose whatsoever,

[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.800]
except a bleeding money out of a variety of people.

[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.120]
All these stations that broker the time.

[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.940]
And it's like K-A-T and V-C-G.

[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.680]
It's, you know, the commission is so concerned that somebody says crap on the year.

[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.820]
But then somebody gets a hold of a license and they just use it to play a game like they're running

[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.900]
the whole shop at home channel on a radio or television.

[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:57.560]
It's a joke.

[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.280]
I wonder though is it the step up or a step down of getting Jekyll to mention you?

[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.400]
No, it's a step up.

[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:02.860]
Is it?

[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:03.420]
You bet.

[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.000]
Let's stay.

[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:04.460]
Take care.

[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.020]
Have a great life.

[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.980]
Well, we understand Tom's going to be writing a big thing about

[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.860]
baseball coming to South Florida this weekend in the Sun Center.

[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.100]
It'll be interesting where his mind is these days.

[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.440]
My good former friend Tom.

[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.860]
See, I'm getting to the point in my life where I'm going to stop all the BS.

[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.360]
I mean, you know, for years I've, I've gone further than a lot of people.

[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.440]
But now I'm going as far as I want to go.

[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.780]
I mean, he's one of Jika.

[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.120]
He's a big phony.

[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.340]
He had me fooled.

[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.320]
And I admitted he had me fooled for years and the only reason is because I used to have

[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.760]
money show all the time and everybody'd suck around and he loves that kind of stuff.

[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.560]
But the minute you criticize him or the minute he has something that's absolutely stupid,

[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:43.260]
that whole bit about the winner book and the story he wrote like a week later.

[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.180]
And he says to Hank at the track, his good racetrack, but he says, well, would you write the

[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.320]
article when somebody on the era told you to write it?

[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.420]
Well, like if somebody got shot, you know, if the political leader

[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:58.320]
got shot and it didn't appear to paper next day, people were kind of wonder, well, what

[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.360]
are you waiting to write the story?

[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.760]
You write it when it's news, not when you want to play a game.

[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.680]
When you're playing games with stories, then you're not reporting the public.

[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680]
You just playing games.

[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.200]
And that's what Tom does with his column now.

[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.900]
And because of his vendetta against Rick Riley, you know, less and less, he writes about

[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.160]
this station, unless he's writing about his personal racetrack buddies and it over on

[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.420]
Q.A.

[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.220]
M and Hank over here.

[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.240]
And that's basically it.

[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.960]
So no matter what he writes, there's no credibility there.

[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.500]
Okay, Tom.

[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.960]
So you're not fooling me anymore and you're real, a real disappointment.

[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.380]
But that's not the first one I've had other disappointments.

[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:32.460]
I remember my old, old friend and really old Ed Cohen, who used to be on my show on WS

[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.460]
News and KAT.

[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:38.680]
I mean, going back to my earliest days in this town with those boring, boring shows about

[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.260]
politics.

[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.340]
And you know, even back in the days when politics was interesting, he was still boring.

[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.560]
But you know, Ed and I thought were good friends and we had a good relationship and he was

[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.900]
on the show and I'd put up with it.

[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.300]
And the way he used to talk, it was 100 years old.

[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.300]
And then as soon as I changed my format and I dropped all that boring tedious crap and

[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.940]
talking to 90 year old dead people, then right away he rips me in an article in some, what

[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.140]
is that paper in the Kindle, something or other?

[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.040]
The one that they put on the birdcage, some little Kindle news lead to something like whatever

[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.840]
they call it.

[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.760]
And ripping me in the fact that I'm wasting all this valuable air time and what a shame

[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.880]
it is and all these terrible things I say about senior citizens and all this other crap.

[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.360]
And what he's really saying is that now that I don't have money or anymore I'm a bad

[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.440]
guy and I'm a piece of crap.

[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.280]
So you meet a lot of people like that in this town especially.

[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.500]
You know, a lot of other places they say you make a friend, you make a friend for life.

[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.820]
When you make a friend here in this town, you make one for about what, like five minutes

[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.300]
usually.

[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.660]
Nice to make baseball is on the air.

[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.640]
Today's Miami Marlins, the Chicago Cups.

[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:43.940]
Now from Joe Robbie's stadium, the voice of the Marlins, Neely Rogers.

[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.760]
That's it.

[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.580]
Well wasn't that cute.

[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.560]
That was really cute, you know.

[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.560]
On a scale of what?

[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.460]
About six.

[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.280]
Tell my good friend Neil Rogers.

[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.560]
That's not my opinion and I'm Mike Disney, up yours.

[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.960]
It's 1125 at WIOD and let's go to Homestead.

[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:08.240]
Hello?

[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.100]
Yeah.

[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.100]
I'm asked about baseball.

[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:12.580]
They get a baseball team down here.

[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.440]
Where do you, where do they go for spring training?

[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.180]
Well somebody yesterday said that there's some land adjacent to the stadium that Huzanga

[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.000]
is either buying or owns a part of already since he bought half of the stadium and that

[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.420]
they might play right there, which would be unusual, but it would be great.

[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.840]
Well this would be the first team that would have their spring training home and their

[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.240]
regular home in the same state.

[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.160]
Right, right.

[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.040]
Okay.

[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.220]
It's just interesting.

[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:34.560]
Okay.

[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.060]
Thank you.

[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.400]
See ya.

[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.320]
That's just, you know, the rumor.

[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.360]
We don't even have it yet.

[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:38.640]
Okay.

[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.280]
I mean, we'd like 99% caught it.

[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.680]
But well, thank you so much, Henry.

[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.700]
What a great American.

[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.160]
That's, in fact, I wonder what your good friend, your good drinking buddy would have to

[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:48.740]
say about that.

[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.140]
You know the one I'm talking about.

[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.780]
Our good friend is a big superstar now.

[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.920]
They're mentioning the name Neil Rogers a lot down here.

[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:55.840]
Yeah.

[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:02.940]
I, I, I, I, the last time I heard him, the new baseball was years ago and he did pretty

[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.820]
good baseball, but he's gotten a reputation now that I wouldn't hire him.

[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:07.880]
What's the question?

[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:08.460]
Okay.

[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.000]
26 after 11 at WIOD.

[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.060]
I wouldn't hire you either, Larry.

[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.520]
I'll tell you.

[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.040]
We had an open line in the Star Line, Star I O D. In fact, if it weren't for Ed Little,

[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:23.160]
Larry would probably be still here doing like overnight in I O D. 1131 at WIOD.

[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:28.700]
I got sidetracked that article, well, that letter to the editor allegedly by who was it?

[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.640]
Tony Rosalus, Rosie in Hylia.

[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.200]
Maybe it is a girl.

[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.120]
But all of this crap about that he needs to get off the anti Cuban wave.

[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.400]
Now what, what do we talk about Cubans on his station?

[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:41.740]
Okay.

[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.320]
In fact, the only ethnic disturbing call we've had in a long time was from a self proclaimed

[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.000]
Hispanic.

[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.700]
I know we was Cuban or whatever the other day talking about how we ought to name the team

[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.980]
that conquisted the Dorees because it was Hispanics who would discover Florida.

[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.040]
And all this ethnic crap that we know it's old.

[00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:58.720]
It's tired.

[00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.100]
Okay.

[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.660]
And all of this crap about my being communist, am I being anti-Cubanade?

[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:09.140]
There's nothing more than a cover for blatant, embarrassing, terminal homophobia.

[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.000]
That's all it is.

[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:10.500]
Okay.

[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.680]
So you can call it anything else you want, but that old Super macho hysterical, excuse

[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.040]
me for wearing my dress homophobia that permeates parts of this community.

[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.940]
You're not fooling me and you're not fooling too many other people at this point.

[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.620]
So come out of the closet already.

[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.940]
1132, let's go to Fort Lauderdale.

[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.220]
Hello.

[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:28.960]
Hi, Neil.

[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:29.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.760]
Hi, long time listener, long time fan.

[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.380]
I've really disappointed though.

[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:37.980]
I called the kiss up and like the last six calls that I've been on hold except for the

[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.140]
last guy who have done all the kissing and there's really no further fucking.

[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:42.960]
Yeah, right.

[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.240]
There's nothing left to suck.

[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:50.540]
No, one thing that I wanted to tell you is that I was really disappointed in the name

[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.840]
that they picked for the baseball team.

[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.700]
Oh, come on.

[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.080]
Will you stop it?

[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:55.960]
Stop it.

[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.960]
Well, like a little child, well, that first of all, they haven't picked any name for

[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.720]
the baseball team.

[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.600]
It could be the Marlins or could be something else.

[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.360]
What difference does it make what they call them?

[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:10.740]
Well, here with Miami the way it is, if we could get one woman on a team, we could call

[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.260]
it the Miami Surf and Turf.

[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:12.840]
Yeah.

[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.960]
And is that it?

[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:20.840]
Probably should be.

[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:21.320]
Okay.

[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:22.780]
Very weak.

[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.120]
Call up Hank with it.

[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:39.740]
Eric Dickerson after four touchdowns on a Monday night football.

[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:40.760]
Where are you going now?

[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.200]
I'm going to get laid.

[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.160]
22 till noon.

[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.700]
And W.Y.

[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.020]
Okay.

[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.080]
No, 20 now.

[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.660]
Let's go to a deer field.

[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.000]
Hello.

[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:53.960]
Yeah.

[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.480]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.520]
Yeah, first time, Cola.

[00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:03.840]
Listen, Mel, I'd like your opinion of this baseball that's coming into Florida here.

[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.440]
Don't you think this is going to be the death knell on the paramutrious trotters?

[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.840]
I like him, Ray.

[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.420]
You're laughing.

[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.460]
You know, I got to be on it.

[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.460]
You know, the guy who called a couple of calls ago is absolutely right.

[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.000]
You know, about the negative people there.

[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.080]
Now how the hell is Major League Baseball going to be the death knell of paramutrious?

[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.000]
First of all, most baseball takes place in the summertime.

[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.480]
There is no harness racing in a summertime.

[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:28.900]
Okay.

[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.320]
They got this little quarter horse thing going on in addition to which how is it that the

[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.160]
Tigers have survived along with Hazel Park in Detroit all these years and the White

[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.580]
Sox and the Cubs in Chicago along with sportsmen in Maywood and Belmore, Lama, Harness,

[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.540]
Reasing, they have up there.

[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.080]
What are you talking about?

[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:43.380]
Yeah.

[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:48.240]
And up in New York, there was a race like when under one.

[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.100]
That had nothing to do with a meds, sir.

[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.120]
It had nothing to do with a meds.

[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.440]
It had to do with a meds.

[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.060]
The islanders came in the meds.

[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.760]
It had to do with a metal land, sir.

[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.700]
The harness racing people all went to the metal lands and Roosevelt couldn't compete.

[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.420]
And they went under.

[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.420]
And if it weren't for OTB, yonkers would be closed down too.

[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:05.740]
Okay.

[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:14.840]
Isn't there just so much money for sports fans to get out on sports there?

[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.900]
You didn't even, you didn't even, you didn't even hear what I just got to your

[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:18.440]
sand, did you?

[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:18.880]
Yes.

[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:23.380]
Football and basketball don't run at the same time as baseball for the most part, okay,

[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.040]
for the exception of a few play on the football don't run at the same time.

[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.720]
And Harness racing in this town doesn't run at the same time as baseball season.

[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.020]
And how's your house?

[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.480]
And how's my and Greyhounds?

[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.520]
What about them?

[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.480]
In the name run.

[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.220]
The summer.

[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.580]
They run all year long.

[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:36.960]
Right.

[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.220]
So what about them?

[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.060]
They'll go down.

[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.080]
They'll go down for what?

[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.600]
They'll go down the tube.

[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.560]
Sir, you go down the tubes, okay?

[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.040]
You're typical of what's wrong with this town.

[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.900]
Now why do we have to talk to these old boring old farts, okay?

[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.960]
Sir, go out, get your colostomy bag out and have a great time.

[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.000]
I'll write and leave us alone.

[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.740]
No matter what comes to this town, this is the most negative god damn town on the face

[00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.200]
of the earth.

[00:34:59.280 --> 00:34:59.780]
There really is.

[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.200]
That guy, too, calls a go, is right.

[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:08.340]
No matter if they drop million dollars in everybody's backyard here, we'd have some

[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.200]
old fart call them.

[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.440]
Oh boy, now the shopping malls are going to be so crowded because everybody's got so

[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.380]
much money to spend.

[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.380]
And the highways are going to be all congested with those big limousines and town cars and

[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.180]
people are driving.

[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.300]
What are we going to do now?

[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.540]
We can't get to the early bird, Danit.

[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.000]
You people make me sick, you old farts.

[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.600]
Sir, take a gigantic orange, okay?

[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.460]
Peagolet and stick it up your ass.

[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.420]
Sir, take a gigantic orange, okay?

[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.320]
Peagolet and stick it up your ass.

[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.680]
Peagolet and stick it up your ass.

[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.860]
Peagolet and stick it up your ass.

[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.840]
Sir, take a gigantic orange, okay?

[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.880]
Peagolet and stick it up your ass.

[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.260]
Sir, take a giant orange, okay?

[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.940]
It's 1141 at WIOD, your friendly state.

[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.980]
I'm just sick and tired of people like that.

[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.820]
No matter what the hell happens here, I mean we've been dying to get something going

[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.440]
in this, see that's what he's scared of.

[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:31.000]
He's scared that we might get some living and breathing people in this goddamn town.

[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.080]
Oh, hi, who cares, okay?

[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.440]
Let him rot in hell with her, hi, hi, okay?

[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.100]
Hey, screw him.

[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.840]
You people make me sick, you old farts.

[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.560]
You people make me sick.

[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.820]
You people make me sick.

[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.900]
Then what the hell do you want in the air?

[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.040]
You come on here and you bash me.

[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.240]
Miami.

[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:53.340]
Hello?

[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:55.420]
Neil.

[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.220]
Yep.

[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.040]
Yeah, did you see Good Morning America today?

[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.300]
I don't watch Good Morning America.

[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:07.100]
Okay, well our illustrious mayor Suarez were all in there and he said, what are you going

[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.840]
to call Charles Gibson System?

[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.980]
What are you going to call the new team?

[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.840]
What do you mean, what is he going to call a team?

[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:13.960]
Well, that's what he said.

[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.360]
What does he got to do with it?

[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.400]
You don't have anything to do with it?

[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.440]
Well, the wind up of the story is that he said, we'll call them the Miami Marlins or

[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.060]
the Miami Amigos.

[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.160]
They ain't going to be the Miami Amigos, sir.

[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:26.900]
That's for sure.

[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:27.220]
Yeah.

[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.900]
I didn't know if anybody had said anything about it, but you talk about bringing on.

[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.400]
Well he's in there doing his usual ethnic pandering again, so he's got to weigh.

[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.240]
Remember when we had the Miami Amigos several years ago?

[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:40.140]
Yeah.

[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.100]
Minor league team.

[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.940]
He was going to be this big hit because we had all the Latins love baseball and this

[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.660]
and that and they didn't draw flies.

[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.340]
They were around for a day.

[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.900]
They didn't even finish the season I don't think.

[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.500]
Now, I'm glad you're not yelling at me.

[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:52.220]
I'm not well.

[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.240]
So please, I'll say goodbye but don't yell.

[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:55.840]
Okay.

[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.340]
Bye.

[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.200]
Feel better.

[00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.280]
Love.

[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:00.780]
Haha.

[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:03.700]
Haha.

[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.220]
Watch your question.

[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.120]
Hey, I couldn't have said it any better, Larry.

[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:07.700]
Believe me.

[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.880]
Oh, let's take a call from North Miami.

[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.400]
Hello.

[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:10.960]
Neil.

[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:11.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:11.980]
All right.

[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:12.680]
How are you doing?

[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:13.320]
Okay.

[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.860]
Sorry, I'm in all these controversy today.

[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.340]
I don't want to be because my son is home from school this week and I keep telling my

[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:20.560]
boat.

[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:21.840]
No, no, no.

[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.400]
We're not playing requests today.

[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.860]
I'm going to be home from school this week.

[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.100]
He's home from school all summer.

[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.860]
No, but you never heard of bird and I wanted him to hear that one about the bird.

[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:30.480]
Oh, bird.

[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.460]
Should you please shut up?

[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:34.140]
Why?

[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.620]
They know the card where you did bird.

[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.500]
Can I please shut up?

[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.120]
What kind of thing is that to say to me, sir?

[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:38.920]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.440]
You did bird.

[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.780]
When a guy called the bird to say bird, really please play something and shut up.

[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:43.940]
You mean I hate the bird?

[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:44.380]
Yeah.

[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.040]
See, you don't even know the name of it.

[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.420]
I don't, I don't know the name.

[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.800]
Well, you got to start.

[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:51.660]
I don't keep a catalog.

[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.540]
Will you want?

[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.000]
I'm going to keep a catalog.

[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:54.680]
Right.

[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.940]
Whatever that means.

[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.620]
Just keep in touch, I know what I'm keeping.

[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.320]
Keep in touch with yourself, sir.

[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.640]
I better try doing that.

[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.060]
OK.

[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.340]
I really appreciate it.

[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.740]
I'm going to do it right now for you, sir.

[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.100]
All right.

[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.020]
Was it that nice of me?

[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.360]
Yeah, really great, man.

[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.340]
I really appreciate it.

[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:09.720]
Hey, Neil.

[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.120]
Don't be 50 dollars.

[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:11.680]
Hey, Neil.

[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.620]
I wonder about this, um, um, because...

[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:16.220]
See you later, Dave.

[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.360]
What is it now?

[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.960]
No, this guy, Hank.

[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.120]
He gets caught.

[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.620]
You know these cigars that Wayne brought?

[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.060]
This box is still.

[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:23.820]
Hey, Neil.

[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:24.200]
Yeah.

[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:27.020]
Yeah, I think you're the guy that should be doing the unknowns.

[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.420]
Sir, say goodbye.

[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.320]
It's not going to happen.

[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.780]
I appreciate all the tinkling and all the urinating, all the headache sucking around.

[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.740]
But if you want to hear this tape, you better say goodbye.

[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.220]
All right.

[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.880]
You say you can say goodbye.

[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:38.500]
Goodbye.

[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.160]
Have a nice day.

[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:39.620]
No.

[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.560]
Just goodbye.

[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.100]
Goodbye.

[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:41.580]
OK.

[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:48.360]
If you missed the Neil Rogers show yesterday on 610 WIOD, you missed this.

[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.000]
Is this the bird?

[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:50.500]
Yeah.

[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:51.540]
Bird, how you doing?

[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:51.920]
OK.

[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.520]
Listen, do me a favor, play anything.

[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.920]
Because I can't stand listening to you.

[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.520]
Are you sorry I could do this back?

[00:39:59.200 --> 00:39:59.500]
Do it.

[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.020]
Just do me a favor, play anything.

[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.960]
Well, can I ask you a question before you go?

[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:03.740]
Oh, God.

[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.020]
You sound so stupid.

[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.160]
I hate to talk to you.

[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:06.760]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.940]
Why did you call me?

[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.780]
I didn't call you.

[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.600]
No, I just want to tell you not to say anything.

[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.900]
Just play something.

[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.460]
Oh, God, can't stand it.

[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.940]
Well, then why are you listening?

[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.760]
I'll play something already.

[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.060]
Why won't you answer me?

[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.400]
I'll get stand it.

[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.400]
You won't see.

[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.400]
He won't talk to me.

[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.640]
Oh, we got a car here.

[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:25.000]
Hello.

[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.580]
OK, did that do it for you, sir?

[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.160]
And Son, I sure hope so.

[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:28.980]
I hope that made him happy.

[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.960]
Hope that made their day.

[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.280]
This time it doesn't take much.

[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.020]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.460]
Hello.

[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.080]
Hi.

[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.080]
Hi, yes.

[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.760]
I've got a name for your baseball team.

[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.900]
OK, we'll call up somebody else and tell it to him.

[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.460]
We have an open line in day, 7-5-1.

[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.880]
I mean, that won't put up with one of those.

[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.320]
OK.

[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.620]
I mean, I've been home yesterday.

[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.640]
And poor Rick and the Cud.

[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.180]
I mean, just one after another.

[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.460]
What is wrong with you people?

[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:52.820]
OK.

[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.700]
They've got it down to.

[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.800]
They've already decided what the name is going to be.

[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.400]
So, I mean, is that the best you can do?

[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.740]
I've got a name for the team.

[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.800]
How about the douchebag?

[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.460]
You know, forget it.

[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.180]
Forget it.

[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.320]
It's like a bunch of little overgrown children.

[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:12.560]
Like Andy.

[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.660]
Palm Beach Gardens.

[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:16.980]
Yeah, Neil, how you doing?

[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.680]
I'm doing a fair to Middleton.

[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.460]
That's good.

[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.400]
I'm up there in a Palm Beach post to have an article.

[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.140]
Oh, the Palm Beach post.

[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.180]
Well, you people get a real paper up there?

[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.760]
Well, it's the only one we got.

[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.200]
I know.

[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.000]
It's pathetic.

[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.960]
Anyways, they had an article about a lot of...

[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.600]
Cox newspaper.

[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:32.880]
It's a bunch of propaganda.

[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.660]
Well, they had an article about people up in Tampa,

[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.520]
say, Pete area.

[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.880]
They had that wide-washed Miami get it down.

[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.640]
Hey, they already got their hockey team.

[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.480]
They got the bucks.

[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.460]
They got all their patent leather shoes.

[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.400]
Let them, you know, get lost.

[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.220]
Yeah, well, they were saying that Miami, you know,

[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.520]
it's a big high crime area.

[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.020]
No crime in Tampa.

[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.100]
That's a wonderful place.

[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.020]
I like to hang out real late at night in E-Bor City.

[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:54.880]
That's my favorite.

[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.900]
Yeah, no, like Tampa doesn't have any crime.

[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.900]
Screw them, pal.

[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:58.900]
They're just sour grapes.

[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.340]
Yeah, well, at least I'm glad they're getting a team down here.

[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.000]
And at least now I can see the car will play one part.

[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.580]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.640]
All right, that's all I got to say.

[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.640]
Okay, just...

[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:07.920]
Good luck to you.

[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.360]
You'll need it.

[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:08.740]
Really?

[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:10.480]
1154.

[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:11.280]
We all need it.

[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.800]
Those of us who are trailing the pirates by many lengths coming into the last 16th of the race.

[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.980]
Open line in Broward, somebody just dropped off when he mentioned Cardinals at 524 and Palm Beach, of course,

[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:27.180]
where they just keep quoting incessantly from that ponderous Cox newspaper, the Palm Beach Post, the Palm Beach Post.

[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.120]
See, that's the problem with Palm Beach.

[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:29.460]
There's not...

[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.760]
There are a lot of the people up there aren't bad, but they've been...

[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.880]
They have had this narrow scope with that one-lousy paper up there for years.

[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:41.720]
They've had J&O and all that horrendous boring crap that they pump out and they had Andre Baruchin beway,

[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.700]
and he used to do the backstroke cross-lake worth.

[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.680]
It's not their fault.

[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:51.120]
I mean, the only excitement they get is every now, every like every few years when there's another Kennedy scandal into compound,

[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.140]
then they get a little excitement.

[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:55.760]
Pompano.

[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.240]
Yeah, I know.

[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.500]
What time is that game Friday night?

[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.200]
What time is the game?

[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.240]
Right, 7 o'clock.

[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.120]
7 o'clock.

[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:02.640]
You're gonna be there?

[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:03.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.560]
All right, we'll be there with those on.

[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:04.980]
Okay.

[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.840]
Open line in Broward, 524WIOD, Andy's running around nervously.

[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.520]
What's going on?

[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:12.500]
What's going on in the newsroom?

[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.120]
Is there something late-breaking story?

[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.500]
Is there something exciting going on?

[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.140]
Well, what the hell do you people acting like maniacs in here?

[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:22.500]
They're all like running around with these nervous, psychotic, about baseball?

[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.000]
What about baseball?

[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.160]
We didn't announce many yet.

[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.600]
How much money do we spend to send those two yo-yos out there to California?

[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.840]
What the man, oh man.

[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:32.820]
Yeah, why couldn't you go?

[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.620]
Elaine says, how come I don't get any of the good trips?

[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.160]
You know when Eri's on vacation in Kansas?

[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.820]
Oh man, Kansas!

[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.140]
Two weeks in Kansas.

[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.200]
Yeah, four-letter mail.

[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:48.640]
Hi.

[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:49.300]
Hi.

[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.280]
How you doing?

[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:50.820]
Great.

[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:51.940]
Hello.

[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.200]
Hello.

[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:54.320]

[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.840]
My God, what a change.

[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.440]
All of a sudden, the voice change is about two seconds.

[00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.120]
Hello.

[00:43:59.400 --> 00:43:59.720]
What do they do?

[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.160]
Just drop?

[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:02.020]
Hello.

[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:02.940]
Yeah.

[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.340]
Yeah, come on, come on.

[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.000]
Hey, hey, hey.

[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.220]
All right, wait a minute.

[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.000]
Wait a minute.

[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.620]
I'll give you a hey right over your nose.

[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:09.620]
Now listen to me, sir.

[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.080]
What was that all about that she had to make the call?

[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.820]
Are you some kind of a wimp that can't make the call yourself that has to have your...

[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.360]
Well, I got a problem, okay?

[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.060]
Have your mistress put you on the phone?

[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.380]
I'd like to say that, parents, do you know where you're children are right now?

[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:21.780]
Yeah.

[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.340]
See, we got out early today.

[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.100]
How old are you?

[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.520]
I'm 15.

[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:27.140]
15?

[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.100]
And who's that young lady that you have in a sack there with you, sir?

[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.500]
Yeah, no, let me...

[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:32.120]
Who was that?

[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.240]
Who was that?

[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.900]
No, don't worry about that.

[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:35.660]
Oh, I see.

[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:36.260]
Okay.

[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:37.900]
Praise this call, George.

[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.000]
Now, go ahead.

[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:44.080]
Okay, so we're exams and she needs like a little help studying, right?

[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.040]
Yeah.

[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.400]
And I was just wondering, I need some help.

[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:48.080]
I was wondering how...

[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.260]
You sound like you need some help.

[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.720]
Yeah, how am I supposed to get her to, you know?

[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.400]
Get her to what?

[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.060]
To cooperate?

[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.720]
Yeah, to cooperate, because my twin...

[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.280]
My twin size is too small.

[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.980]
And your size is too small?

[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.120]
No, you idiot.

[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.720]
My twin size bed.

[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.280]
Yeah, and listen, judging from the sound of you, I tried the queen.

[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.400]
It's 1258 at WIOD.

[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:16.800]
We have two open lines.

[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:17.700]
They're both in Broward.

[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:19.480]
5249463.

[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:21.080]
524, we got full on me.

[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.580]
I've heard from your kind before, sir.

[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:24.980]
They're back.

[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:33.020]
We're clearly in Lillie Artback at their slapstick best in the three stuages joined the Los Angeles Police Department.

[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:37.120]
Give these three goose guns a nice stick and get ready for some laughs.

[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.660]
Oh, oh, oh, look at those little lady do-walkin'.

[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:40.880]
I'll hand this one in, I'm sculled.

[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.780]
See the boys beat the entire LA populace with giant hammers.

[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.000]
Watch them tweak little babies on the nose.

[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.260]
And if the three stuages are on patrol, you better not get a ticket.

[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.040]
Yeah, why's he going five over to limit?

[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:53.980]
Why, I got him.

[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.640]
The police stuages joined the Los Angeles Police Department.

[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.980]
They'll bust you out.

[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.320]
That's right, you're the theater near you.

[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.340]
107 at WIOD.

[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.740]
It's our mammoth-wanted two-hour.

[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.240]
This is the hour that they're talking about down at City Hall.

[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.140]
Hi, Bob.

[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:09.320]
Hi, Tom.

[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.620]
Good morning, citizens of Guy.

[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.280]
We're the lab brothers.

[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:13.840]
Ah!

[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.380]
You know, Bob and Tom, be here at Rick's Cafe Docside.

[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.620]
A beautiful guy's reservoir.

[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.820]
It's given us a great idea for a new love brothers venture.

[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:28.960]
Yeah, Bob and Tom, how many times have you both been pleasure-boding on Guy's and Thought?

[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.200]
I'd give my left prune for a Conway 28 track.

[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:40.440]
Yeah, I mean, these people need naked women mud flaps just as much as the next guy.

[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.800]
Anyway, that's why we're opening Nick and Sonny's exit 69 truck stop.

[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:56.680]
Yeah, fellas, let's say you're carrying a heavy load and you desperately need to relieve so to speak.

[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.780]
Exit 69 is the perfect place for you to get off.

[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.500]
Well, put, Nick.

[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:11.820]
You know, guys, exit 69 offers a complete array of helpful services.

[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.780]
For instance, once you're in CB range, one of our lovely attendants will ask, what's your handle?

[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.820]
Oh, and fellas, police don't answer metricly.

[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.960]
The girls only relate to engine.

[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.360]
Once you've fallen to our truck stop, wash your brides once if you need fuel.

[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:34.020]
Oh, and for you rookie drivers who stop too far from the pump, our John Holmes Memorial nozzle has you covered.

[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:47.100]
Oh, and hey fellas, if you desperately need service, better kind of shy around girls, simply pump your own at our convenience self-survival.

[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.700]
So if it's fuel you need, no problem.

[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.560]
But if you want gas, come inside and visit Nick and Sonny's dump your load cafe.

[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:02.540]
Exactly, featuring world famous Oriental chefs, blown chow.

[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.460]
Wow.

[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.880]
Do you guys know what blown chow translates to an English?

[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:16.440]
No.

[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:17.280]
Wow.

[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:27.900]
Anyway, blown chow makes a Calico Manhattan you'll never forget.

[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.940]
Oh, and good news fellas.

[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.900]
Oh our follies are now totally declawed.

[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.480]
You know, we were so lucky to find blown chow, weren't we, sonny?

[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.640]
No doubt about it, Nick.

[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.820]
We spotted him one night while watching Bonanza the next generation.

[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.740]
He was playing hops things for placement.

[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.740]
Who flung done?

[00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:01.000]
Anyway, according to Indianapolis Water and Sewage, our most popular item is the hot brown.

[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.480]
Plus, our catch of the day is crappy.

[00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:12.340]
At least that's what our last patrons said.

[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:23.580]
You know, exit 69 also offers a convenience store for those everyday traveling needs.

[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:28.160]
For instance, we sell air fresheners like Lemon Lime, Cherry, and for you outdoorsmen,

[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:28.920]
Stevie Nicks.

We also offer souvenirs from all 50 states, so hey, you can tell your baby you've been

[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.200]
anywhere.

[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.860]
Oh, and our most popular item for those long haul is called the Driver's Best Friend.

[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.180]
We kind of stole the idea from Doc Johnson.

[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:48.040]
Oh, and fellas, if you reverse the switch, it makes us swell, tire pump.

[00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:00.660]
Also, don't be shy about asking Lawanna about our Stucky Special.

[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:02.420]
She'll give you a log and nut roll.

[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:03.260]
You'll never forget.

[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:10.540]
Anyway, before leaving exit 69, be sure and visit our topless truck wash.

[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:14.200]
Oh, sure you've got a feeder bill, but it hasn't been properly polished.

[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:22.360]
And instead of abrasive steel wool products, clear-reece uses only nature's brillo pad

[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.260]
to polish your rim.

[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:23.620]
Oh!

[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:26.640]
Oh!

[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:40.540]
Well, anyway, that's Nick and Sonny's exit 69 truck stop.

[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.860]
And don't forget our motto.

[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:48.100]
If you don't get off at exit 69, you must be a homo!

[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:57.480]
Okay, you'll be heard at about 330 on the coast as we have Noon Johnny Dark was just

[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.500]
enchanted with it.

[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:03.300]
Right in between Elton John and Lionel Richie, it's going to be tremendous.

[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:04.640]
And who?

[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.000]
Oh, Phil Collins.

[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.060]
He'll be right on top.

[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.800]
147 at WIOD.

[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:09.920]
We'll be right back.

[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.320]
I'm about to ask you a little bit about our stocky special.

[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.940]
You'll never forget.

[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.240]
Anyway, before leaving exit 69, be sure and visit our topless truck wash.

[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.860]
Oh, sure you've got a feeder bill, but it hasn't been properly polished.

[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:36.020]
And instead of abrasive steel wool products, clear-reece uses only nature's brillo pad

[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.540]
to polish your rims.
