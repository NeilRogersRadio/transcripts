[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]
Well, the bad news is Randy Martin is leaving.

[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.740]
Oh!

[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.680]
Oh!

[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.060]
Randy Martin heads north.

[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.000]
It says Randy Martin has been filling in his talk host question mark during the week at WJNO.

[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.900]
Weekends at WIOD has found full time work.

[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.240]
As a disc jockey at WWGF in Orlando, the Monday to Friday midday gag gig,

[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.080]
which he starts in two weeks is a return to our origins.

[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.220]
Before turning the talk, she was a DJ at Sarah and my, my, my, my.

[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.860]
Good luck to you, Randy and thank goodness, okay?

[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:46.960]
So you know what that means on a weekend now lots and lots more ball games and lots and lots more tapes and the best of and the worst of.

[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.380]
And speaking of that, no reconciled this week, they're gone on vacation.

[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.180]
They'll be eligible for parole a week from today.

[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.060]
So they're gone this week and the Chuck Marrow will be filling in in bad news.

[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.240]
All those Chuck's probably a little more humble now because of Braves kicked ass over the parrots over the weekend.

[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.140]
So that'll humble them up a little bit, although the penguins are going to be in the Stanley Cup finals against the North Stars.

[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.300]
I miss both the other day.

[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.660]
Far be it for me to ever make a mistake the North Stars did play in the Stanley Cup finals in 81 loss to the Islanders.

[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.780]
And of course the penguins have never been in it.

[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.800]
So I don't be pretty boring.

[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.620]
I mean, exciting.

[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.480]
How about those Braves? I bet you will get lots of Braves fans calling in today and crawling and carrying on like crazy and deservedly so.

[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.000]
They're in first place for there too.

[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.960]
They're pretty excited.

[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.360]
And there's three games over 500.

[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.660]
They're kicking ass.

[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.620]
They'll probably kick the crap out of the Cubs tonight.

[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.900]
Harry Skippenship will be their big family reunion at Rigglyfield tonight.

[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.600]
Game time is 805 Eastern daylight time.

[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.640]
And who we got?

[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.700]
We got Sean Bosky against Glamon tonight.

[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.800]
Also Friday night I got to tell you we had the time of our lives.

[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.700]
It was kind of like the good news, bad news syndrome again at Biscayne.

[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.100]
The show was a blast.

[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.620]
Tank was there of course doing the show and I was sitting around acting like a goofball and Bob Weaver.

[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.440]
Good old Weaver the weatherman.

[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.920]
One of our great friends in town was there former dog owner and former dog expert, but I guess not anymore.

[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.200]
And we just had a great time on the air.

[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.320]
The only problem was plunged our brains out.

[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.740]
Poor fat rich poor Neil poor Hank just plunged our guts.

[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.600]
Although I didn't pay for the beer and that even worse.

[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.020]
So that takes care of that.

[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.300]
We had a tremendous crowd nice people up there and also a few degenerates.

[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.780]
And then there was that one table of wise guys from North Miami that were caching every race.

[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.180]
There's nothing worse than that when you're losing your ass.

[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.620]
They have a bunch of people sitting there caching every stink and race.

[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.840]
Boy that pissed me off.

[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.900]
Anyway I got in the mail this morning among many other things from Pyramax veterinary and supply in Miami Springs.

[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.480]
Timson.

[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.380]
These packages look like they're from before my Bubby was born.

[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.180]
He sent me about a dozen packages or I think only eight actually.

[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.000]
Where's the rest of it?

[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.220]
Of Timson for my dog and I guess all the dog owners out there are going to be going nuts now.

[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.100]
Probably have 10,000 calls about this.

[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.960]
It says we suggest you use a product called octagon soap to wash your dog first.

[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.840]
And he sends me like the thing from the label cool gates octagon all purpose soap but not the soap.

[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.480]
Can you I never heard of that?

[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.440]
Can you get that in the store?

[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.260]
Octagon soap I never heard of it.

[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.460]
So anyway you wash him with that first or not as the case may be.

[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:41.480]
And then after he dries soak him to the skin with the Timson solution and he includes a page here with all the directions mixed two packets to one gallon of lukewarm water.

[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.160]
Let's stand in the zalbapapapap.

[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.380]
Saturate dry pet to the skin once a day for four to five days.

[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.780]
And this is supposedly spectacular relieving itching and fleas etc etc.

[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.080]
Even jokitsch.

[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.860]
How do you like that?

[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.880]
So if managing all the guys listening you might we might leave a couple of packets around for them.

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.200]
Oh!

[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.300]
Anyway it even eliminates the awful odor of cat urine it says.

[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.840]
So I don't know must be great.

[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.780]
It's one of these things that the miracle does everything.

[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.000]
Speaking of miracles ultra slim fast I got to be honest with you doing pretty good for me.

[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.340]
I've lost seven pounds since Wednesday and I haven't stuck right to it to the letter but I've lost seven pounds.

[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.760]
I already had my lunch in a little container.

[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.700]
And speaking of little containers how come it is that the little container that we have down on our machine downstairs is two and a quarter.

[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.760]
And I go into the supermarket over the weekend and there are a dollar eight a piece.

[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.920]
That's more than double what a rip off.

[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.360]
I hope the guy that fills the machines down here comes in today and somebody beats the crap out of them all right.

[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.980]
Two and a quarter for the honor of buying our little how much is in that let me see the empty container.

[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.700]
Oh!

[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.400]
It's um...

[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.140]
12 ounces.

[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.700]
Two and a quarter and in the store there are a bucket.

[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.340]
That's worth it.

[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.600]
That's worse I bet you didn't buy it and you float them store and it can be an in store.

[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.280]
So come to WIOD and get ripped off folks in our wonderful commissary downstairs.

[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.020]
But it's working pretty good and they have those frozen entrees and then Georgia of all people this morning

[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.420]
whips out a little ultra slim fast diet bar about the size of your thumb.

[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.420]
But he says it's real thick.

[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.680]
Yeah I've heard that line before.

[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.240]
But anyway...

[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.940]
It's 12 minutes past 10 at WIOD.

[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.520]
We're feeling slim and great.

[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.240]
We're doing it and then we'll be right back.

[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.440]
Well hello.

[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.540]
Hi there.

[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.960]
I'm your new neighbor.

[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.160]
I'm entertaining guests and I seem to have run out of coffee.

[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.340]
Well come in.

[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.060]
Would bulger's coffee be too good for your gas?

[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.160]
Oh!

[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.300]
That would be just perfect.

[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.400]
How could I ever repay you?

[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.940]
I don't think of something.

[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.520]
Well have a nice party.

[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.500]
Hey you, a nice new neighbor yet?

[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.300]
Hello.

[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.220]
I just popped in for coffee.

[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.080]
Bulger's coffee for those budding relationships.

[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.940]
Or as they say in a for a shop, a tisca to task it.

[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.180]
Let me double check your basket.

[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.620]
It's a 1015 at WIOD.

[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.220]
That's a little Scott Chapin Jim McQueen thing.

[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.680]
From a Detroit, Jim McBean.

[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.340]
I got a little note here.

[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.640]
I guess Scott Chapin was in town over the weekend.

[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.060]
Doesn't dare stop in this building.

[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.220]
I can understand his version of doing that.

[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.760]
And they left me a tape with a few little bits on it here.

[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.860]
Not bad club Ted.

[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.840]
And a couple of others that were giving to me at about 10 minutes to 10.

[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.520]
Laura sat on that damn thing all morning.

[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.680]
It's kind of warm too as a matter of fact.

[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.380]
But if she would have given it to me in time, I could have carded them all up

[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.500]
and had a lot of good stuff on it.

[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.520]
Anyway, it's 1015.

[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.960]
Let's take a caller to here.

[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.100]
Let me give them the numbers out.

[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.400]
Shall I?

[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.580]
We've got some calls on there already.

[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.180]
Not too many.

[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.200]
One in date, one open line in date, 7519463.

[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.520]
Two in Broward, 524WYOD.

[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.860]
And one in Palm Beach, of course.

[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.560]
That's all we got.

[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.320]
One too many.

[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.460]
655, 9463, 655WYOD.

[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.760]
Let's see Miami's gone.

[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:54.200]
Kendall.

[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.540]
Yeah, Neil, how are you?

[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.540]
Listen, I have the most insensitive question by a sportscaster ever.

[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.860]
Are you into Indie Racing at all?

[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.400]
No, sir.

[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.880]
Okay, there's a guy Gary Benton house whose family has been racing.

[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.840]
He had lots of trouble, you know, the family's, you know, actors and stuff.

[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.880]
So he, second day on the pole, which means he couldn't get the pole.

[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.900]
He ran the fastest of anybody, which means he would have had the pole position.

[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.200]
So the guy turns them and says, well, you could have had the pole,

[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.840]
but did you know that today is 30 years from the day your father died

[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.860]
and a fiery crash was turned through?

[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.060]
Nice.

[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.820]
I thought it was just like the guy looks and I'm like, you know, I love it.

[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.580]
I can't think of anything else to say.

[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.940]
Happy anniversary to you.

[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.500]
All right, you have a good day with mommy.

[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.400]
Did I have a good day with mommy?

[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.380]
I didn't go to mommy's.

[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.140]
I sent her a basket of flowers and that's it.

[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.880]
I don't go over there.

[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.400]
Do you think I have to make a human sacrifice?

[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.460]
I got to go there tomorrow.

[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.560]
Oh, it's once a year.

[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.040]
No, sir.

[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.260]
All right, have a good one.

[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.000]
You got the best shot.

[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.980]
Well, what would I have done there?

[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.460]
I'm not eating.

[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.340]
I don't eat.

[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:49.960]
Oh, that's right.

[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.200]
You're back on the olden slums.

[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.440]
I tried there.

[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.440]
I'm not back on it.

[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.640]
I'm doing it for the first time.

[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.580]
Is it worth trying to be?

[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.240]
Do you like it?

[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.080]
I just got your saying.

[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.000]
I lost seven pounds in less than a week.

[00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.820]
I'm sorry.

[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.660]
I didn't lose.

[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.620]
Well, don't be sorry.

[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.240]
Be happy.

[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.140]
I feel great.

[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.180]
All right, all the guys at CPT, their digital douchebag.

[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:06.560]
Okay.

[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.160]
All right, bye.

[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.120]
George is doing a show there on three.

[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.960]
So obviously we got all three deadlines here.

[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.260]
Because whoever he's talking to, I know he's not going to be on the air,

[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.020]
which means we got all the two calls so far.

[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.720]
I knew it was going to be a real slow day.

[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.720]
Because coming to work, there was no traffic at all.

[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.260]
Then I get off, I 95, to come to work at 79th Street.

[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.640]
And I'm just getting ready to turn.

[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.220]
I hear Joe.

[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.680]
Thank you, by the way, Joe Brennan.

[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.880]
When you're right, you're right, which is rare.

[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.120]
And when you're wrong, which is most of the time you're embarrassing.

[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.980]
But that's the first time in about year and a half

[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.120]
that you'll actually give a useful tip on the traffic.

[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.320]
And he said that the...

[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.160]
Was it bad coming across the bridge, George?

[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.560]
Was it bad coming across the bridge it was?

[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.420]
Now, see, I killed as much time going the way that I did,

[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.540]
but without the aggravation.

[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.360]
I just...

[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.280]
I don't know about you, but I would rather drive ten minutes out of the way

[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.720]
without any stopping and just zip along.

[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.020]
Then sit there and see for ten minutes.

[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.480]
So as soon as I heard that, I got back on 95,

[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.580]
went down to the Julia Tuttle and went over to the beach

[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.240]
and came up Collins Avenue, which there wasn't a dog on Collins Avenue.

[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.500]
I know I came up to 71st, enough for the causeway.

[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.880]
So even though I killed another ten minutes,

[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.280]
I didn't have all that sitting there and getting pissed off

[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.420]
and getting psychotic with the bridge and all that.

[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.220]
So thank you again, Joe Brennan, for a great job,

[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.620]
which goes to show you that if you throw enough crap up in a year,

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.300]
sooner or later, something comes down and hits the ground.

[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.540]
We have two open lines in Broward, 524WYOD, dear field.

[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.280]
Hey, Ne, how you doing?

[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:29.680]
Okay.

[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.160]
All right.

[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.080]
Is there any way to confirm of hockey finals on ESPN?

[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.500]
Is there any way to confirm what?

[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.420]
I believe that they're going to show them on ESPN.

[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.860]
So how could they do that?

[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.300]
How could sports channel have the games all season long?

[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.380]
And ESPN have the appeal.

[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.780]
I was watching the Indie town trial yesterday

[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:56.260]
and I believe one of the guys mentioned that they were going to have the shows.

[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.660]
I don't think so.

[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.820]
I hope so.

[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.780]
Well, somebody who knows for sure will call in,

[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.040]
but if it is, I'd be very surprised.

[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.220]
Nobody even sports channel, whatever, kind of contract.

[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:06.600]
I had a contract to...

[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.520]
You've been kind of in a little cable.

[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.180]
I'm ready to tell him to stick it.

[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.700]
I don't know what to do with these guys.

[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.100]
No sports channel, I'm continental.

[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.000]
I've boycott them as much as I can.

[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.120]
Lots of religiously.

[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.580]
I don't know.

[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:16.620]
I don't know.

[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.780]
I don't know.

[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.280]
I don't know.

[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.640]
I don't know.

[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.400]
I don't know.

[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.380]
I don't know.

[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.880]
I don't know.

[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:29.660]
I don't know.

[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.980]
I don't know.

[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.200]
I don't know.

[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:32.220]

[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:32.600]
I don't know.

[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.160]

[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.160]

[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:33.220]

[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:33.800]
I don't know.

[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:33.800]

[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:33.820]
I don't know.

[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:33.820]

[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:33.820]

[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.440]
I don't know.

[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:34.440]

[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:34.440]

[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:34.500]
I don't know.

[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:34.500]

[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:34.500]

[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:34.500]

[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:35.920]
I don't know.

[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.840]
I don't know.

[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.980]
I don't know.

[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.760]
I don't know.

[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.000]
I don't know.

[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.000]

[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.000]

[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.000]

[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.360]
I don't know.

[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:58.360]

[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:58.600]
I don't know.

[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.100]
I don't know.

[00:10:59.500 --> 00:10:59.660]
I don't know.

[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.360]
I don't know.

[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:01.360]

[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:01.460]

[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:01.460]

[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:01.520]

[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:01.520]

[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:01.900]
I don't know.

[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:01.900]

[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:01.900]

[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.520]
I don't know.

[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:02.800]
I don't know.

[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.040]
I don't know.

[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.360]
I don't know.

[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:03.680]
I don't know.

[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.400]
I don't know.

[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.400]
I don't know.

[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.860]
I don't know.

[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.880]
I don't know.

[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.000]
I don't know.

[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.740]
I don't know.

[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.360]
I don't know.

[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.360]

[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.360]

[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.360]

[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.620]
I don't know.

[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:29.720]
I don't know.

[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.240]
I don't know.

[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.240]

[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.240]

[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.540]
I don't know.

[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.400]
I don't know.

[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.240]
I don't know.

[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.240]

[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.240]

[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.440]
I don't know.

[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:33.440]

[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:33.520]
I don't know.

[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:33.520]

[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:33.900]
I don't know.

[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:33.960]

[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:33.960]

[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:34.300]

[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:34.960]
I don't know.

[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.560]
I don't know.

[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.120]
I don't know.

[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.520]
I don't know.

[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.120]
I don't know.

[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.320]
I don't know.

[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.720]
I don't know.

[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.620]
Who's that other geek that I can't stand the first basement?

[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.740]
Between the two of them, they're hitting like 900 against the cubs.

[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.920]
O'Neill's got six homers on the season 13 RBI's,

[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.040]
five of the homers and 12 of the runs batted in our against the cubs.

[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.900]
But here comes Steve Wilson again just apps and by the time he leaves,

[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.460]
it's eight to one the game is gone.

[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.040]
All right.

[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.300]
Just absolute blowout.

[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.720]
So why do they keep doing the same crap over and over again?

[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.040]
I think somebody ought to fry Jim Fry and send Zimmer along with him to sit in his lap

[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.000]
when he pulled a switch.

[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.560]
Bad.

[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.160]
Bad organization.

[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.180]
But hey listen, you know, it's a lot of fun.

[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.500]
Twenty one and poorer Greg Maddox pitched the game of a lifetime.

[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.060]
They pitched a great game and Dunston is like fumbling double play balls

[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.360]
and just can't get arrested.

[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:32.900]
He's not hitting.

[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.680]
He's not fielding.

[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.280]
Other than that, he's just a great guy.

[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.820]
Twenty one after ten at WIOD.

[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.960]
All your cup fans, you want to get away from all the grief.

[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.360]
Stop watching the games go to Ruth's Chris and have a great meal

[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.900]
and just eat and drink and drown your sorrows away.

[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.020]
Just chew it at some of that delicious corn fed Midwestern Prime,

[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.240]
richly marbled, never frozen the best U.S. Prime in the country.

[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.600]
They broiled it exactly the way you order it.

[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.500]
They rushed it to your table, still sizzling right in front of you.

[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.300]
Rugly knows, man, if that doesn't turn you on, nothing ever will.

[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.700]
There's nothing like the meat at Ruth's Chris.

[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.280]
And of course, also great seafood and all those great accompaniments

[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.980]
like those vegetable dishes broccoli, agrote and cream spinach

[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.260]
eight different kinds of succulent potatoes.

[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.300]
Like those creamy, fattening potatoes agrote and hearty green salads

[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.680]
with homemade dressings and irresistible enormous desserts.

[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.520]
So if you want a serious steak or just a serious meal,

[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.780]
this is always the place.

[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.460]
Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, with three South Florida locations,

[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.560]
they're in North Palm Beach.

[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.080]
They're in North Miami Beach right on the intercoastal.

[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.660]
And the original South Florida Ruth's Chris, my favorite 25-25 North Federal Highway

[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.900]
in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:04.840]
The North American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American South American

You got the white one baby You pulled the white one baby You picked the white one baby You picked the white one baby You picked the white one baby!

[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.580]
You picked the white one baby 1026

[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:41.660]
You picked the white one baby You picked the white one baby 1026

[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.900]
You picked the white one baby 1026

[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:42.900]

[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.020]
an ungracious

[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.620]

but i just wanted uh...

[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.180]
you know you're talking a while back about the uh... wonderful uh...

[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.080]
people on the uh...

[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.560]
bridge going to our seventy nine street

[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.040]
i didn't even know your head quarters were at the right by the day

[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.420]
and i used to live right down seventy nine three

[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.840]
i don't know who was worse

[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.000]
that the rich people or the book people that uh... wake you up at six o'clock

[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.600]
in the morning in the speedboats both

[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:02.640]
uh...

[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.140]
disgusting

[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.040]
as i was driving over the july a total coming over to work today out of the way

[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.020]
but still are getting across without waiting for some stupid bridge i was

[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.740]
asking myself

[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.200]
how can they were able to make this bridge high enough so all these jackasses

[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.260]
in their big pleasure yots wasting all of that gas and everybody's time

[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.480]
we don't have to wait for them on the july a total

[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.960]
but on seventy nine street

[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.380]
and on the broad causeway in all these other stupid bridges they're so low

[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.940]
that we have to sit there and wait for them

[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.660]
i'll tell everybody has to live their life at their own

[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.640]
and of course you wouldn't have a problem like we had to be because it would be

[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.360]
any bridge

[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.760]
and i'd like i didn't have an alarm clock i just wake up to the thing ding ding of

[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.080]
the bridge opening up the word

[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.120]
i think they're worth

[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.580]
i think people used to have sandwiches and they're waiting for the bridge open

[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.580]
and close because uh...

[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.420]
it'd be sitting there for hours upon hours upon hours of the guys in the

[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.140]
boats to go by

[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.140]
right you know these yahu's uh... with the big fail boats

[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.180]
well it tells you a lot about where the priorities are in this town sir when

[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.020]
they build the uh... roads for the convenience of the rich boating people instead

[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.900]
of the masses of millions of people who have to get to work

[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.360]
or wherever the hell they're going in their cars it gives you real good ideas

[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.560]
to uh... has the cloud in this god for second time it's hard

[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.040]
it is really hard

[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.220]
good luck to sir

[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.180]
yes

[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.200]
yes sir yes

[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.780]
uh... and one of the uh... one of the talking about uh...

[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.280]
he's the biggest

[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.820]
about one of the boats that you talked about earlier about one

[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.700]
bridges

[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.480]
cars and both

[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.700]
now we're talking about bridges over over the uh... causeway not the ones in your

[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.040]
mouth

[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.480]
i don't have any of my friend

[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:29.780]
okay

[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:31.840]
condoms

[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.740]
and then

[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.580]
was it regulated by the nine-year-old

[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.080]
engineer

[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.820]
right did you know

[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.080]
well it is all bridges over now look at the waterway

[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.400]
if i knew that i wouldn't have been asking

[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.340]
but i said if i knew the answer to the question i wouldn't have asked it in

[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:47.880]
the first place

[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.760]
okay well i'm saying sir

[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.600]
here that the united states core of engineers

[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.100]
are the ones that regulate bridges over now the boat waterways

[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.680]
over one

[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.620]
now the boat waterway yes sir okay

[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.700]
okay yeah

[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.800]
so it's up to them to decide

[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.440]
what time

[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:05.800]
yeah

[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.860]
the bridge should not be open

[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.200]
to the marine traffic

[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.640]
yes

[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.420]
and what time should they not be open to marine traffic sir

[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:14.480]
yes

[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.300]
i'm telling you that they

[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.120]
come up with the time

[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.660]
well what what is the time

[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.640]
i believe it that was our time

[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.320]
sir

[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.140]
that they are not open to marine traffic

[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.800]
other than that they are open to marine traffic

[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.960]
so in other words any slip with a boat can come along and back up traffic

[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.680]
we're doing that

[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.600]
well what kind of a communist bunch of crappers that

[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.560]
that is not a communist bunch of craps

[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.500]
sounds like some kind of the end of all

[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.160]
back this time he pinko uh

[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.940]
you got five people to be

[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.060]
able to run boats

[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.120]
right exactly

[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.480]
the boat is going to stop the five thousand cars

[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.540]
is that it?

[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.340]
no i think that fifty thousand cars out of stop for one jackass in his boat

[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.720]
i think that's what they ought to do

[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.700]
man you better know your laws mr because you should

[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.000]
don't that's right i suppose you want the man

[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.880]
bridges closed

[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.520]
to both traffic and a hurricane too

[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.300]
i want the bridges closed period okay i want them closed i want the

[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.340]
bridge tentative to go home and watch his mtv and get the hell out of our

[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:15.680]
life

[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.100]
in other words i want those bridges closed let him use the julia

[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:19.820]
turtle okay

[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.700]
let him use them a constant cause

[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.680]
what i think they all are going to George

[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.640]
Washington bridge and jump all of bridge tenders how do you like that sir

[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.240]
well i don't know about you but you shot like some stupid idiotic

[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.000]
church uh-huh okay well i guess that sums it up in a nutshell 1032

[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.300]
at w-i-o-d why can't they just let the boats go back and forth under the

[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.380]
julia total that's big enough they can get a just go round in a big circle

[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:43.840]
jerk

[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.700]
we have an open line in date 7519463 fort lauderdale

[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.540]
and you i will you welcome to your bridge oriented station six ten

[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.260]
bridge jumping station i got a question about the silence of the lamp

[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:04.000]
yeah i saw the movie so it was great uh-huh you saw it right uh-huh

[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.800]
i rented the the hip first movie

[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.540]
manhunter yeah i didn't enjoy it as much

[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.560]
do you agree or have you seen it well you know this business of trying to

[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.820]
compare all the time it's like godfather one and two and everybody instead of

[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.280]
just enjoying the movie i had to keep comparing it it was okay they were both

[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.800]
good they were both very good you know but they seemed to indicate that well

[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.780]
you really shouldn't see silence of the lamp until you see the first one and

[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:34.140]
oh that's a lot of crap i think a lot of baloney yeah i just thought you could

[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.340]
miss the first movie really enjoy the second movie but both were

[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.660]
were good but i just thought it's a lot of work saying you have to see

[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:44.760]
Alice in wonderland before you see the godfather i don't i don't get it i got

[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:51.540]
actually one thing about the uh-huh hunter yeah in the part where he uh- uh- uh-

[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.140]
discovers uh- uh- uh- uh- information about the uh- uh- uh- the killer on the

[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.720]
toilet paper what what was the significance that was in manhunter that was in the

[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.620]
silence of the lamp

[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.060]
that's where he got that's where he had it in the in the cell

[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.160]
well that's in manhunter huh that's manhunter i believe

[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.220]
well whatever okay whatever you what does this

[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.940]
mean because of it did he sneak it in or did he or did

[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.060]
electric write that himself just to remind him of the art

[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.040]
i haven't got any ideas since i didn't write the uh- since it's

[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.380]
fiction to begin with i didn't write it i don't know

[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.800]
oh i just thought perhaps i missed out

[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.320]
no you didn't miss anything it was just there uh-huh

[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.080]
well like toilet paper generally as it's kind of just there

[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.000]
but it was it was a great movie how i was good i wouldn't that would i think people

[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.600]
got a little too carried away with the whole deal you know it's fiction and uh- yeah

[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.560]
based on absolutely nothing i just uh- it was very they were very good but i think people

[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.580]
just got a little carried away because they're basically bored of tears which was

[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.580]
agreed that Hopkins was the best character uh- he was very important very very good yeah

[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.460]
okay i don't have a theory okay ten thirty four at w-y-o-d in other words when i'm

[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.540]
trying to say as i'm sick and tired of hearing about both of those movies already because

[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.640]
they're like uh- you know i was great but now on with uh- whatever's going on i saw a preview

[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.060]
for some of the new movies that are out there was one laurel would like a lot what is the name of

[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.520]
the movie it's basic about all these kids in a um- fraternity house or a dormitory somewhere

[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.880]
in one of them is standing around in his uh- jockey brief underwear for the longest time just uh-

[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:24.260]
went on and on in this preview i couldn't shut it off anyway ten thirty five well i just wondered

[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.720]
what was the purpose of his standing around with his uh- hot muscular tan body and his little

[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.620]
tiny jockey shorts for all at time and i guess obviously the purpose was just to stand around

[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:38.720]
in his jockey shorts for a long time let everybody take a peek twenty five till eleven at w-y-o-d

[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:49.780]

you about these damn bridges and we got them we got 37 bridges up here in Palm Beach County

[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:50.040]
we got a beautiful bridge just south of pgable of art and every afternoon without fail at about

[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:56.580]
five minutes after five this bridge tend to put the bridge up and it stays up until 23 minutes

[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:05.860]
after five while a virtual armada goes through it then it takes this idiot seven minutes to put

[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:11.680]
the bridge back down put it down for five minutes and boom puts it back up again the old up and

[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.080]
down yeah well we like to be consistent and soft floor to sir we like to have a bridge on every

[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.000]
street corner and we like to have a bridge in every residence well well we got to do the coast guard

[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.940]
regulates these not not the core of engineers like that idiot told you earlier they just

[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:30.420]
maintain the bridges coast guard sets the regulations and they tried an experiment a year ago that

[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.540]
really worked well they said specific times that the bridge could be open for and a specific

[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.880]
length of time that the bridge would be open for such it would open at five ten and must be

[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.400]
quite well you're getting pretty educated sir it's not going to change because they got people

[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.580]
with the boats got all the money and you and i got squat okay that's where the original purpose

[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:54.180]
of the law for the bridge was for maritime commerce that we should you know get after the coast guard

[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.460]
to set specific time are you listening to me or is it just going in one year and after you

[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:03.340]
okay sir good luck to you it's not going to happen i just wets kind of like getting back to

[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:13.100]
pay us your boss won't buy us hey sir let me say this to you okay one of the prerequisites of

[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:17.100]
staying in this country is to learn a little bit of English okay i can't hear all right

[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.340]
so we thought you messed up the language not asking no no where did you innovate in the language

[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:26.200]
you still haven't learned how to speak it that's your problem yeah hey all right then well listen

[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:32.220]
have a great day and you thank you okay that's one of the reasons i never wanted to go to England

[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.060]
is you know to go to a country where they speak the same language but you still need an interpreter

[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:41.300]

listens or who the distributor is or how that but uh we're out we're tapped and i'm just hooked on

[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.320]
that one thing i like about it best and this isn't even a spot yet is that it doesn't stimulate your

[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:37.680]
appetite i used to i used to poo poo that jazz about how diet soda or any kind of soda is like

[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.480]
stimulates your appetite because it's got caffeine and stuff it does and snapple don't

[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.860]
i'm going to be so good this week i bet you i'm going to lose another eight pounds this week

[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.360]
