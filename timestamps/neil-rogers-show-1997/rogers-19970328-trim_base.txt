You got me talking on the passion phone.

[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.880]
Okay.

Tell me the story about how you got flown. I got you down.

[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.060]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Holy cow.

[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.420]
Ho, ho!

[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.560]
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone. I got you down.

[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.420]
The lines are jammed up. Yeah, there isn't a doubt.

[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.880]
Call up and tell me what it's all about. I got you down.

[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.020]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Holy cow.

[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.160]
Ho, ho, ho!

[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.300]
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone. I got you down.

[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.660]
I got you down.

[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.760]
I got you down. I got you down.

[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.880]
I got you down.

[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.240]
Here on the show, there's a new topic each night.

[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.500]
Who do you have sex with with a black or with a white? I got you down.

[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.620]
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Holy cow.

[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.300]
Ho, ho, ho!

[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.920]
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone. I got you down.

[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.900]
10.02. Happy Friday. Happy Good Friday. Good happy Friday to you. Here we are.

[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.300]
Passion clones. Oh, before we do that.

[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.760]
Happy birthday to Fez. Fezzy is whatever he is today. He's what he is.

[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.540]
So anyway, I got you down.

[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.720]
Last night, a horrendous grotesque, I mean really pathetic excuse for a hockey game.

[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.840]
In addition to which I had a real busy and draining. Happy birthday, Fezzy.

[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.580]
Whatever you are. And so anyway, what was I about to say?

[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.120]
No, he said he's 22 today. Going on 45.

[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.380]
Hey, listen, when you work here long enough, you'll be going on 95 pretty soon.

[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.680]
Just get out there in a highway. You'll be going on 95.

[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.540]
So what was I about to say about how bad the hockey game was last night? It sucked. It was bad.

[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.060]
And anybody that's going to say, oh, you shouldn't have left after the second period, boy.

[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.000]
They made it real close there at the end. Yeah, right. Right.

[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.080]
Got one goal with like two minutes left and then Murphy threw the stick up into crowd and hurt that little kid.

[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.980]
And then got a goal with one second left made it real close.

[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.840]
Okay, three to two. It might as well have been 85 to nothing. That was pathetic.

[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.140]
So we had the opportunity on the way home to listen to passion clones,

[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.480]
which is our new nine to midnight show with Aaron K. I'm a Karen K.

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.620]
Is your name Aaron or Karen?

[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.040]
So anyway, see you didn't hear it. So you don't understand.

[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.280]
I think it's Aaron.

[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.880]
It's Aaron K. I got you down.

[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.260]
So this is like she's like a Aaron Summers clone and I'm listening to a Karen K.

[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.940]
And I'm thinking, wow, okay, I'm going to listen and with an open mind.

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.920]
And she had that same kind of real caddy. That's the only word I can think about it and has nothing to do with golf.

[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.160]
Okay. It's got teas instead of these.

[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.660]
They don't even have no Rick D's. What are you doing now?

[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.280]
There's a good job for that.

[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.780]
I got you down.

[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.660]
Oh, I love it. I saw that before. Where did that come from? Is that new?

[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.920]
No, it's been in there. It's been in there.

[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.840]
It's an I got you down.

[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.740]
Oh my god. I love it.

[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.080]
I'd love to get you down.

[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.540]
So anyway, I'm listening to Aaron K. Karen K on passion clones.

[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.520]
And now Harry Valentine, who's Harry penis Valentine,

[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.380]
our new PD who's coming one of these days and getting his ass down here too.

[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.700]
He told me the other day, just a couple of days ago, he said,

[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.200]
I want you to know this because there'll be talking to halls and better you hear it from me than in the hallway.

[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.820]
And he told me something confidential, which I never would have discussed on here because it would have been,

[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.460]
I don't believe that you discuss on here who's banging home.

[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.740]
Okay. I don't think it's anybody's business. All you nosy people out there with no lives.

[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.340]
I have no life.

[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.680]
Exactly. But it's great radio.

[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.980]
Here we go. Here we go.

[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.520]
Who the hell are you?

[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.000]
So anyway, I'm listening last night. We're coming back from a very depressing experience at the arena.

[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:26.540]
I mean, it's just coma inducing and she's going on and on and on about people who sleep with the boss.

[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:37.480]
And then she like makes this segue into the fact that she has for the last five years been the girlfriend of a radio consultant.

[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.940]
Then she becomes even more specific and announces to us that she's been the girlfriend of our radio consultant here at WIOD.

[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.200]
And then she mentions by name Walter Sabo.

[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.580]
And she's carrying on about, oh, why is everybody so hysterical about this?

[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.400]
Why does everybody care so much? And it didn't seem like anybody cared because they were like basically no calls in that 45 minutes going home.

[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.880]
There were two calls. One was a crank who said Paxen would fire by noon today.

[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.140]
And the other one was some fake fag with some ridiculous story that she was evidently buying into.

[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.080]
But at any rate, I'm thinking to myself, does this light is this a good way to start? Is this a good foot to get off on?

[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.940]
Assuming that she was great, which no comment, but assuming that she was doesn't this kind of like damage your credibility?

[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:33.560]
When you come on here and say that the consultant for the station who was certainly hand picking much of the talent that's being hired or at least involved in those decisions.

[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.120]
And also been critiquing their performance on the year. I mean, I know that consultants traditionally have screwed the talent.

[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.140]
They're famous for that, but not so literally I didn't think.

[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.600]
So where's the credibility factor? Now, in other words, if it turns out that she blows, I see I'm having a problem here.

[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:57.520]
If it turns out that she isn't the greatest thing, you know, on our format. If she has a problem on the year, how do I say this delicately?

[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:04.360]
Okay. I mean, where's the credibility? Because is the consultant going to say she sucks. There I go again. She just ain't cutting it.

[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.780]
How do I say this without all these quadruple and six-taple, sex-taple on tons that they get very upset about? Do you know what I'm saying?

[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.600]
You heard me.

[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.520]
Okay, I'll try.

[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:22.900]
But at any rate, you know, I just wonder that if she stinks the joint out of she gets all like always points is the consultant going to say, get her off the air.

[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.040]
She's got a one share. You know, I it's just a, you know what I'm saying?

[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.320]
So all I can say is.

[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.520]
Don't even bother coming back.

[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.500]
So that is on one note. Direct TV, by the way, I know that suds is probably sitting there. He won't be listening right now.

[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:42.620]
He's sitting there glued to his tube and the set to direct TV adds the new channels they're already on there for this morning.

[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.840]
The animal channel. My favorite part was segment on the frogs that was kind of cute filled in Quebec.

[00:07:49.860 --> 00:08:03.000]
They got Jan and Paul crotch you're on there. If you want to send your money in if you're like a sucker, if you're like real smart like these people that off themselves in San Diego, if you're almost as smart as they are and still barely breathing Jan and Paul crotch will take your money. That's on there.

[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.120]
And then WGN is on there.

[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.620]
How do you like them apples? Just in time for the start of the baseball season.

[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:18.780]
Hey Neil, fuck you. WGN and the Cubs and some of the white socks and a bunch of other good stuff is on there on the small dish and a few other rather meaningless channels.

[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:26.360]
So there you go. If you got direct TV, don't buy into your cable company all that propaganda because they're trying desperately to convince you that it's too expensive.

[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:33.260]
It's not a good idea. It's coming this plot. Believe me. Tell your cable company up your ass and get yourself direct TV.

[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:41.380]
Also last night before the hockey game, my first ever visit to Bayside. Wow.

[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:50.720]
Well, there is a very good Italian restaurant by the way where we ate last night and I can't take the name of it and one of the waiters and they're used to work at pizza loft.

[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.780]
And after I finished eating it on the way out, he comes running over.

[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.380]
I used to work at the pizza loft down on Flagler Street before Jeff wise up and moved to a real place. But anyway, good guy.

[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:10.780]
Good place. Pretty damn good place. We had San Pellegrino water. Let's see. I had penny apostatariata and it was pretty good.

[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.020]
And the waiter was like a real digger. I like that. Not a grito, but a real wild.

[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:36.280]
I'm not a real digger. I'm not a real digger. I'm not a real digger. I'm not a real digger. I'm not a real digger.

[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:47.280]
And what can I say about Bayside? It wasn't exactly jam packed for like 536 o'clock in the Friday evening. I understand that later on and evening on a Friday and on Saturday and a weekend, hard rock cafe gets jam packed.

[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:55.560]
But hard rock cafe anywhere gets jam packed. Right? So what's the big deal with that? I don't know. It's kind of like a flea market.

[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:07.460]
Have you been in there? And doesn't impress you at least one segment of it as a big on the water flea market. It's a very overpriced state of mind kind of. Yeah.

[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:14.840]
Yeah. But the people that were like wandering around in there and there weren't that many, but they didn't look like the overpriced crowd. You know what I'm saying?

[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.860]
It didn't look like they were dripping with expensive jewelry and like lots and lots of cash.

[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:27.680]
And down town Miami. Are you kidding? Oh, that's true. And there also were like several banana boats parked there at the dock. I don't know what the hell had meant, but they all did say banana boat.

[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:35.600]
And then once said the something about the Miami queen. And I thought they were honoring my presence. But so there was my first and probably last trip to Bayside.

[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:45.080]
All the way did like that. Rista Rante. That was very good. And somebody probably will call and tell us the name of it. If anybody out there is listening. If anybody is out there who doesn't have to work today, which is almost everybody.

[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:53.060]
What a much higher the trip into work this morning. And here was Pete Folger here this morning. All the other people all the corporate the front office doors locked.

[00:10:53.060 --> 00:11:05.560]
Everybody is gone, but Peter the tweeter. He's out there working his brains out. He is going. Good guy. Pete Folger. Always liked him. Tell him it wasn't business. It wasn't for how do you how does that go?

[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:17.680]
Be sure to tell Mike I always liked him. It wasn't personal. It was just business. And then of course they took him out in the back and the number on him. Oh, that was just an accident. But nobody got hurt. That was Tessio.

[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:35.420]
Here's our first call of a great good Friday. It's all request good Friday. By the way, the lady who called yesterday. I brought you that pin from the game last night. George is already sticking it in the mail. Done. That's right. How do you like that? We're efficient. We're on top of things. Your nice panther pin from that game last night, which I didn't even take it out of the plastic.

[00:11:35.420 --> 00:12:05.340]
I'm not going to grab with that other. Drecking there, whatever they had in there. So it's all your sweetheart. And you didn't have to show up the game last night to get it. What a guy I am. And that's what I always say. Here's Cooper City. Hello. Cooper City. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, let's talk about the idiots in California. Yeah, they're no idiots. They're no different than the fundamentalist Christians right? They won't believe in their prophecies. They're totally. You know the thing that I find very amazing is that if you look at the articles here. The first one in the hero on the upper left hand front hand.

[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:35.200]
Page genuinely very nice and all about their all their computer customers thought they were great and everybody who knew them. They thought they were little standoffish and kind of pale, but they were very nice. Why doesn't it say lunatics, you know, commit mass suicide? They always have to put a picture. I guess because they step it on religion here a little bit. And they don't want to step on anybody's religious beliefs. Follow them. Say because it gets too close to the other. Right. That's right. They're all saying the world's coming to a insanity man. It's mass madness. Humane acts like Howard Beall would say if he could. It was Jesus can't come back.

[00:12:35.200 --> 00:13:04.520]
But he's not going to let this world war three. Yeah. Now you always say like God knows the future and he gets pissed off. But that means he also made everything. That means he wants all this to happen. Of course it's already it's as they say in the it is it's by shirt. It's already written in the stone. It's engraved in platinum. And it's all destined this way, which means God the Judeo Christian God is a sadist. He want he's already designed this. And then they say, well, the devil Lucifer. Well, who the hell invented Lucifer? And if God is omnipotent and could do everything. Why does he just off Lucifer and blow his hand? He didn't have any problem getting rid of everybody else with a flood.

[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:34.360]
He saved that old slipper Noah and his family. He blew everybody else away. He's been doing this over and over again every time he gets pissed off. He kills everybody including the animals and the mosquitoes. And yet the devil. He has a problem with Lucifer. He just that's right. Now a little children who yeah. Speaking of even the fetuses who haven't even had a chance to come into sin yet. Speaking of no when you when you're on vacation to San Centil, that a great thing on Noah. Yeah. They were talking about like they had to talk to this Christian guy like how could seven people take care of all the animals? Yeah. They go rid of the bathroom. But all these animals go to the bathroom. Where do you dump them?

[00:13:34.360 --> 00:14:04.340]
We had a big shovel and they asked where were the dinosaurs and guy goes, well, the Lord didn't have a plan. Let me ask you. Here's our poll question today. Where would you rather have the shovel concession on Noah's Ark or at Paxen Broadcasting? Have a great day, pal. See you. He said no contest. We have an open line and day six to two. I got you down. Oh my God. Passion clone. She's sleeping with Walter. I mean, why did she say that? Why did she do that? It was like a active suicide. Maybe because suicide is in the news. Maybe she was in

[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:34.320]
the news. She was inspired by the San Diego cult. And of course, this the suicide note on the net shows that hail. Bops. Comment was approaching this signal of time. This was the end. Okay. Time to do it. Time to put on the. There's still time time to put on those neat outfits. Join up and get on the event. You first and catch the ship. Everybody that wants to go. What? The ship. It's hiding in the comments. Take my ears must be. I would have sworn. That's what Clemens said. We're going to catch the

[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:46.980]
hell. So don't be left out. Remember that? Get going. Yeah. When they were going to the mattresses, yeah, then we catch the hell. I was telling Mikey when, you know, you'll probably be able to come back four or five years and we catch all the hell. Lombardies, by the way, Lombardies was the name in

[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:55.460]
base side. Very good place. Real Italian restaurant with a real Italian menu. You can tell it's real Italian because they have primo pate, which is the first course, which is your pasta stuff. And then

[00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:02.540]
secondo, which is like a meat and stuff like that. Like you would aid in a real restaurant. They were trying to read in Italy. If you were Italian, you can eat like that without

[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:09.500]
gaining 100 pounds, which I can't. How the hell do they do that? How do they eat so many courses? They start out. I mean, not a huge

[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:17.140]
volaposta and they're drinking wine along with this and the tons of bottled water. And they have like a plate of spaghetti or

[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.840]
lasagna or some kind of pasta. Then they have their main course, either fish or veal or some kind of meat. And then they have

[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:32.060]
Dolce like gelato or torta or something for dessert. And of course, in salata salad, not necessarily before all of this salad,

[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.920]
somewhere like there in the middle. Like about a six course meal and there are almost no fat people over there except for the

[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:43.380]
damn pope and he's a polo. Oh, sorry, that's good Friday. Sorry. 1015 at W I O D.

[00:15:48.600 --> 00:16:12.460]
And look, he's crossing our yacht and hiding little chocolate Easter eggs. Little chocolate jelly bean. And little chocolate. Hey wait a second. That's what the

[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:25.300]
thing and going and going. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. 1019 at W I O D. So they had this mysterious, some Canadians, by the way, among these cultists out there in Rancho Santa

[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:38.500]
Faye, California. A few of them were cult Canadians, a few of them were Hispanic, George. A few of his few speaks in there too. Probably Mexicans. Yeah. Of course, greasy. And so at any rate, they just decided that this was the time the common

[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:45.160]
hail Bob popped in and they said, Okay, time to evade their containers, which we call human bodies. They believed in their leaders. They believed in

[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:52.880]
death and by the bang, they off themselves. And you notice how they did it very methodically in first 15 did it. And then the next to 15 took here like took the

[00:16:52.880 --> 00:17:01.440]
plastic bags off their heads and they cleaned it all up and met left a nice and medicinal. And then they did it and then they had like two left over. And instead of saying, Oh, we

[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:08.060]
changed our mind like anybody with a brain would do this. Okay, we'll clean them up. Then we'll offer ourselves and they did. So these were very nice

[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:16.880]
people were led to believe genuinely very nice. Did a great wake or work on their website was a beautiful thing. And the newspapers and all the media are like, Oh, yeah, this was right.

[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:37.920]
Of course, this is the way the real world operates exactly. Unfortunately, it is here is Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I worked 40 hours of this my first day off. I have a chance to call you. All right. Happy Friday to you. And back to you. Happy a bad Friday. Yes, happy good one for me. They off. Do you have a number for hydron skin care? Yes, sir.

[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:47.800]
I don't know about you back it around my forehead. My grandma knows when she. Brack, boom. Yeah, 1 800. The number four as in Quattro, right?

[00:17:48.080 --> 00:18:00.460]
H Y D R O N. Pretty simple. You can I can remember that very easy even a scene. I will fart like me. Remember that and that will fart you. Yes, I do. I'm sure in it. The work good. Yes. All right. No, can I call someone to do?

[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:20.400]
I haven't felt this good in ages as I feel today. I'm just feeling it. I tried everything. Nothing works. OK. And John will be from Pompelink, a mercury or a driving douchebag. OK, pal, have a good day. Good. Thank you. OK, we have an open line of day 622 W. What was the name of that restaurant again? I wrote it down, but I just a Lombardi's. Thank you so much.

[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:50.380]
Which you might think might be an Irish restaurant named after Vince, but Vince wasn't Irish any way he was a wop. Something about Lombardi. Didn't that say if is a Lombardi with a Y? Is that Irish and with an eye? It's a Taliano. Well, we'll find out. We'll probably have some drunk at Irish men out there. It's almost 10 30. Open line and day 622 W. I. D. Wanted. Broward 7679 463. I don't want to start that stereotype again about Irish or drunk. They just happen to be drunk. If they want to be drunk. What's wrong with being drunk? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I

[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:20.360]
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't have any and he wasn't drunk. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.720]
you know great

[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.040]
right i think it's good to get a chance to order your foot long a time

[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:25.760]
yeah

[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:26.940]

[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.060]
because they were fantastic this morning i was just glued to the radio coming

[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.660]

[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.660]
this network much are you aware of where they are yes i am in the reason i don't

[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.620]
talk about it is because i don't believe in it because uh... they conned a lot of

[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.340]
people are in the beginning and i have no idea what they're given people now

[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.560]
but uh... they don't have anywhere near what direct t v's got at least i don't

[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.120]
think so yet

[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.200]
well it's getting a lot better they're uh... merging with uh... rupert murdoch and

[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.700]
he's got two satellites over europe and uh... we have a tie in stations in

[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:57.140]
Greek stations in arabic and uh... spictations and but who wants that

[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:01.860]
i will i got a big dish i really get right i get right who know uh... uh...

[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.000]
probably i already get that in the big dish but who the hell down here wants to

[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.760]
see stations from

[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.440]

[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.200]
channels we don't need them all the love the foreigners we don't want to need a

[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.280]
to greci uh... a spaniards

[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.220]
well anyway time joker would be the big article about it and we're supposed to be

[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.200]
that they often come in the best and all that

[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.020]
and i just wondered we we i'm with this network

[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.560]
all i also gave you the hop along penis

[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.160]
the what you know how to long penis

[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:28.740]
oh yeah

[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.640]
for your buddies perfect that was good that that part was good

[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.900]
i think he's can't a hop along cast it any

[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.860]
he's a second cousin

[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.700]
which also was kind of david

[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.280]
yeah what do you know that the hellbott comets got something trailing behind it

[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.740]
yeah i wonder what it is

[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.100]
that the

[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.820]
have a great day pal

[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.200]
go pedal some of that crap

[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.840]
okay

[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.320]
we have an open-ended brown and maybe okay may turn out to be great to see

[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.380]
the i doubted but it make turn out to be done by guy needs to make a few bucks

[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.540]
we all need i was telling people to be for

[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.600]
we got to make a living

[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.060]
you know that's what life is all about making a living

[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.120]
that's all

[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.040]
and then you do the best you can you don't have to be perfect nobody is perfect

[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.820]
most of us are you know got our ass hole days and moments

[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.580]
you just go ahead you do the best you can and you survive and you try to be

[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.800]
as the least

[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.620]
uh... anxious in terms of your human behavior as possible that's all

[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.080]
that's all it is required and then before you take the coolator whatever is

[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.500]
the sign i'd and the uh... tapioca pudding i wonder if you'll cause me at

[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.360]
something to do with us

[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.460]
no seriously you're smoking but you notice that they took the uh... where's the uh...

[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.540]
putting an apple sauce

[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.540]
we have a putting an apple sauce and uh... what

[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.400]
sign i'd

[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:39.820]
no barbitcher it

[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.760]
barbitcher it's and then they had a white element barbitcher it's yes

[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.600]
that's not like amphetamines is it the opposite i know

[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.100]
and then they took a vodka that's why i said it was something yeah and watched it

[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.060]
all that's not like amphetamines is it no

[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.100]
that like speed

[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.880]
no it's like slow

[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.860]
as opposed to quick death like

[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.840]
fan of fan oh sorry

[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.880]
so anyway uh... they took uh... putting or apple sauce it doesn't say whether

[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.120]
was jello pudding or not

[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.400]
or there was approved by bill cause me

[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:15.780]
and mixed it with phenol barbitaal they drank it down with alcohol laid back

[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.940]
and relaxed

[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:22.220]
i guess you would kind of relax as in when a dot pass it out

[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.980]
and then of course just to make sure they put the plastic barbitch bag around

[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.660]
their head with a little tie down to make sure that uh... just in case that didn't

[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:29.980]
work

[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.140]
how about a bullet through the head i think would have worked a lot faster

[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.100]
maybe a little bit too messy too messy

[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.920]
and i don't know if that but then when they're going away to uh... serious

[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.580]
that probably would have interfered with their transition transmission by the

[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.600]
way speaking of transmission is uh... our buddy coming today for that awful

[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:46.700]
grotesque car

[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.180]
i don't want to say lumina

[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.720]
haven't heard but

[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.840]
as far as i know oh man i don't want to you know saying anything bad about the

[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.860]
lumina because the price was right but boy is that a car is that a car that's a

[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:57.180]
question

[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.320]
it's ten twenty seven a w i o d i would

[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.120]
six ten w i o d

[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.740]
i know that the board even loves neo-roder

[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.220]
it's time for another more music television history minute with your m m d d

[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.740]
hoes jaren so like this friday is good friday and i did some research on why they

[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.280]
call it that and it turns out it was actually like a really crummy day

[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.680]
well for jesus anyway i mean how would you like it if you woke up one morning and

[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.120]
you feel it kind of bloated because you ate this really big supper the night

[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.920]
before and all you want to do is like kick back and maybe watch a few videos

[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:32.260]
and then some roman gladiators burst into your room and arrest you and you're like hey gladiators

[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.960]
what gives and they're like wow we need you to carry this big wooden cross of a hill

[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.720]
so you carry the cross of the hill and then you go so like do you need me for anything else

[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.060]
because i'm feeling kind of bloated and they go well yeah now we have to nail you to the cross

[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.140]
and you're like all right then like why did i carry it up here because if i know

[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.060]
you were gonna nail me to it i never would have done it so then they nail you to the cross

[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.760]
and it's like really embarrassing because you're almost totally naked except for this weird baggy

[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.980]
loincloth that everyone can look up and see your business and you know they're looking

[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:06.280]
and then like you die and that's what they call good friday and i'm like i don't think so i mean

[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:11.320]
personally i've had like way better days okay this has been an mmdv history minute history is so

[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.600]
cool and it's like they keep making more of it all the time mmdv or history rocks

[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.640]
i'm a hell of you okay 1032 a w i o d happy friday why do i

[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.820]
unhappy good friday i don't know one of those very ambiguous holidays like yom kippur you don't

[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.680]
say happy yom kippur it's the day of a tumour when everybody's supposed to be sad and eat a lot of

[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.980]
jello putting it look at pictures of bill cars be naked i mean you'd be sad too looking at that

[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:39.720]
so it's good friday the day that he was put on the feelin little cross etc and so on i thought

[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.460]

gonna tell you something i met paul on saturday uh in between periods of the game buffalo game

[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:52.140]

[00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:00.180]

[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:48.280]
yeah i saw her add him a new times and here to me your wife had an ad another bimbo another blonde

[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:53.720]
bimbo yeah who knows nothing about dieting and less about these drugs and his non-the drugs and

[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.860]
never had a weight problem and admits that and has no training in it but nevertheless uh what

[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:01.440]
thinks that all those fat slabs the rather look like her you know i heard the interview i don't

[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:06.240]
want to look like her i heard the interview you did with her husband yes and it reminded me of these

[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:11.340]
people that try to take on mike wallis wasn't it it wasn't an interview was this psychotic phone call

[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:16.560]
it wasn't an interview well yeah exactly right but i mean you had i mean this guy was just back

[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:21.360]
peddling and back peddling and had nothing come now are you talking about the first call he made

[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:25.360]
or the one yesterday i know the first call okay now the first one you'll notice how he said he

[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.460]
would love to be my physician and get me slim and he was suck and a wait a minute he was sucking

[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:34.300]
around heavy duty now that his wife got canned number one and number two i'm on here talking about

[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.940]
what i think about fendfin which i hated right i'm reading a lot of articles that say a likewise

[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:42.700]
that it's bad now all of a sudden i'm a bad guy and packs not a fire my ass and i shouldn't be on

[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:47.380]
the ear and i'm disgusted i mean you know you can't have it both ways mr. hey right well the

[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:52.640]
position that uh when you got done with them i felt sorry for the guy i mean the guy just came out i

[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:58.060]
mean he had nothing every time you ask him a question the guy was tap dancing like uh

[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:03.000]
sammy david's junior yeah i mean the guy was all over the state only sammy ain't dancing too well anymore

[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:10.540]
right that's what these people yeah that's what the fendfin thing is all about bad stuff don't take it

[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:14.260]
and not only that but this business about you gonna have to take it out and off for the rest of your

[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:20.000]
life i'm sorry the idea of losing the weight for most of us is to get rid of the pills get rid

[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.200]
of the high blood pressure medicine get rid of the diabetes medication get rid of the pills any

[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:30.220]
doctor who's i mean that's what it's at absolutely right get an actin's book people and wise up

[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:36.180]
okay see ya we have an open line in date six two two nine four six three but i gained my weight

[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:40.620]
back on the edge and so i couldn't have any credibility big stinking deal how many people out there

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:46.360]
are fat never gained and lost and lost and gained how many i don't know anybody i've never met one

[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:52.440]
but i gained it back so therefore that must prove that it's a bad diet and then he goes on to say that

[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.740]
uh most people on any diet gain their weight back anyway and when it comes back i just go on

[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:03.860]
the pills again great hallelujah so my pulse can like my heart can like beat out of my chest like

[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:09.240]
bap bap bap bap bap bap like that i mean i don't know how everybody else reacts to uh some of those

[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:13.640]
drugs but man your heart you can hear your heart going bap bap bap bap bap bap bap bap

[00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:17.710]

[00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:40.550]

[00:58:57.450 --> 00:59:03.950]
hi look at my boobs you know when mtv first approached me about hosting my own sketch comedy show

[00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:11.090]

[00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.210]
that's the jennie McCarthy show on mv tv

[00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:34.610]
tune in and see some boobs

[00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:40.370]
11 19 and w i o d so i would say the worst that i've ever been on and i've been on a lot of bad

[00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:45.250]
diets and i've also a plug bad diets on here too which i guess i should apologize for but hey uh

[00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:51.410]
you know it's money we need to make a living um like ultra slim fast that was a sponsor for a while

[00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:55.470]
and i was drinking those cans and my blood sugar was still sky high and like i've said before

[00:59:55.470 --> 01:00:00.390]
because it's loaded with sugar it's loaded with carbohydrates and i'd be drinking the whole butt

[01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:04.390]
load of those every day and i still wasn't losing any weight and i couldn't figure it out i'm

[01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:12.550]
hopping on a scale i'm still fat as a cow but i would say the worst of all and i must confess my

[01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:16.490]
sins on this although you know they you get brainwashed with these things because fat people are

[01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:22.330]
desperate people and the desperate people are the dead people and at any rate neutral system that

[01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:29.590]
to me putrid system to me was just outrageous because they would come and or you would go to their

[01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:36.510]
joint and pick out a whole bunch of these silly little portions of uh makefully food all made

[01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:41.390]
from all kinds of synthetic and artificial loaded with carbohydrates and chemicals too of course

[01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:45.850]
and they would give you a week's supply which i would eat in like about two hours

[01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:51.910]
no because they're all like they're all refined carbohydrates mostly like little pasta things

[01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:55.830]
that you make in a microwave and you eat one of them and all of a sudden it stimulates your appetite

[01:00:55.830 --> 01:01:00.070]
and your ravenous and you discover that you're eating like a whole bunch of this stuff

[01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:04.990]
and even if you are losing weight on it you're like getting nauseous from eating crap

[01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:10.110]
and then when you finish eating all that crap all this artificial box pre-packaged

[01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:16.430]
dreck what do you do then and you weren't even paying for that stuff for you no it's very expensive

[01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:21.790]
oh i know that oh no they were bringing me a whole crap load full like i said when

[01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:25.890]
you were supposed to be eating one and the portions even a perikete candy to portion like that

[01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:29.210]
i mean is that realistic is that a sensible way to lose weight

[01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:33.190]
not to mention of course all those people i don't want to suggest you know that there's a

[01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:37.190]
correlation i did have my gallbladder out by the way i just thought i mentioned that in passing

[01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:43.390]
remember that deal lots of people reven problem with gallstones which may have just been a

[01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:47.610]
coincidence i'm not making no accusations here but i sure had to remember those great days

[01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:52.410]
in the hospital in Mount Sinai four days i do believe or whatever it was i thought it was going to die

[01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:56.950]
i thought it was all over i thought i was going to serious i kept saying get cereal

[01:01:57.470 --> 01:02:02.810]
because this uh oh man and fat reed said ah it's a piece of cake they'll just uh reach in there

[01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:05.690]
and yank it out i said how about the gallbladder so well that's another story

[01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:12.510]

[01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:39.090]
11.24 wyd our topic today farting in church on good friday here's west pondby chill out that's

[01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:43.370]
why they call him puse right now exactly hey uh did you see a sports illustrate story about the

[01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:47.690]
fighting in the till no i did not is that the new one yeah because i just got it in the mail yesterday

[01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:51.610]
but i haven't opened it yet in the magazine either i forget the guy's name of the capitals but uh

[01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:56.330]
he left the sport because that and uh he just claimed that uh it's a big insult if a coach

[01:04:56.330 --> 01:05:02.470]
ever told the guy to go out they knew what their job was to be a goon well to go and even even

[01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:07.910]
something up even a score yeah but uh if he said there's a quiz because the coach tapped

[01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:13.130]
my soul said go get that guy so right supposedly that just doesn't happen where the coach you know

[01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:18.650]
have to say something to the guy so that's you know the guy asked earlier about uh fighting if they

[01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:22.770]
wanted it they may want it but uh i'll be honest with you it gets very ponderous to me and you

[01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:27.490]
know once in a while i like for example that colorado detroit game two nights ago now that was because

[01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:31.950]
you knew they had extra security there and this was to get even game for what happened in a playoff

[01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:35.850]
last year and you knew it was going to be a bloodbath and then when when uh the two goalies when

[01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:40.530]
mike vernan and patrick frog got into it and that was just amazing and then when duren mccarty was

[01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:45.390]
beaten the crap out of cloud labia who deserved it and then some i mean that was that was exciting

[01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:52.030]
but most of these so-called fights is a lot of tugging and grabbing and guys swinging at air and uh

[01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:56.590]
it gets old it gets really old and these people like it all excited they're getting up and screaming

[01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:00.670]
it uh you know it's it's the rubber necker mentality again you know people want to see a car wreck

[01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:05.390]
exactly it's yeah it does give us some of the black eye to people who you know would uh otherwise

[01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:10.110]
maybe go see if you got knowledgeable fans they know that that's not what the game is all about they

[01:06:10.110 --> 01:06:13.890]
know that they are the really good for example you got a guy in buffalo like Matthew Barnaby who's a

[01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:18.090]
very tough guy in fights but he also sucks guys into a lot of stupid penalties because he gets

[01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:22.090]
them pissed off they think he's gonna fight and then he just you know he just stands there and sucks

[01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:26.810]
guys into a lot of penalties but he's a tough guy incapable of fighting but he's also a great skater

[01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:31.010]
and a great playmaker and a tremendous score he's a real player as opposed to these goons like

[01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:34.570]
Tony twist who can't play their way out of a paper bag and all they can do is go out there and

[01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:39.630]
beat the crap out of somebody now Neil who are these guys i didn't go to the game last night but who

[01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:44.390]
of these guys that are every call that we get called on they chant the ref i mean that sounds

[01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:49.250]
horrible you know something y'all i'm so glad that you mentioned that there's it's in 124 it's

[01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:53.810]
right next to where we used to sit in 125 and there's the one guy up there i'm afraid it's that rat

[01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:58.030]
guy which i thought he was a pretty good guy and he's the cheerleader he's got all these guys hey

[01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:02.970]
ref you suck and they do it even after the referee made an obvious call and it gets it makes us

[01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:07.330]
seem like such a bunch of cry babies and no nothings i mean i hate to break the news to you panther

[01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:12.310]
fans but yes our guys do commit infractions and do deserve penalties at times and sometimes you

[01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:17.350]
get the most obvious penalty in the world hey ref you suck and i'm thinking oh come on it's embarrassing

[01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:23.650]
already that i mean i love the sound of our build-in tv we've got a really loud building right right

[01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:28.850]
when they do that it's just that you know 124 need some help they need some help over there get a

[01:07:28.850 --> 01:07:33.390]
life stop being a bunch of lemons over there get a life but then he had a little funny last night

[01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:38.270]
after they got them they get it to a pretty loud one when after we have family one time and then he said

[01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:44.170]
god i remember here and that i feel really really fucky i might have to play that have a great day

[01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:48.730]

With not so big, you can hardly wrap your lips around.

[01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.790]
My young and loved Cowboy Dick.

[01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:06.230]
May him fill your posse with my Cowboy Dick.

[01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:08.010]
Oh, Cowboy Dick.

[01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:09.610]
Here, try it.

[01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:11.530]
How is it?

[01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:12.830]
I can't talk.

[01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:15.810]
My mouth is full of Cowboy Dick.

[01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:17.210]
She's smiling.

[01:09:17.530 --> 01:09:18.690]
She's smiling.

[01:09:18.690 --> 01:09:21.690]
Fill your mouth with my Cowboy Dick.

[01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.450]
A ballaboo in your grossest freezer.

[01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:26.430]
Once you've had your first Cowboy Dick,

[01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:29.650]
you won't ever go back when you're filled with Cowboy Dick.

[01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:30.730]
You'll scream.

[01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:31.030]
Woo!

[01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.910]
Woo!

[01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:36.010]
Sounds like Doug McCloud out there in Phoenix with the coyotes.

[01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:38.070]
Leaves and coyotes are one-one tire last night,

[01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:39.490]
by the way, pretty coma-inducing.

[01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:41.670]
1132 at WYOD.

[01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:44.410]
So thanks again to Gene and Jack Libo and all my friends

[01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:45.650]
down there at Tropical Chevrolet.

[01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:47.570]
How do you say thank you to people who treat you so well

[01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:48.990]
that it's almost embarrassing?

[01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:52.790]
Just brought me back my new purple 96-core,

[01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:54.790]
but not new, but the O'Hell might as well be new.

[01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:55.950]
It's pretty damn nice thing.

[01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.970]
And fixed the window on there so it can do the old up and down.

[01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:02.290]
And took away my Luma-na dammit.

[01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:03.830]
Oh, gee, I'm gonna miss that thing.

[01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.190]
God.

[01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:08.430]
I told Gene I said it is with great and deep sorrow and regret

[01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:11.730]
that I turned back to you the keys to that beautiful 1997

[01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:12.830]
Chevy Luma-na.

[01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:15.490]
What a piece of stuff that is.

[01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:18.390]
So now we got the Corvette quarterly.

[01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:20.350]
That's got the whole story which I've already...

[01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:21.270]
Oh, look at that.

[01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:22.070]
Look who's here.

[01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:24.410]
Oh, this ought to be a really terrible reunion.

[01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:25.970]
I better not say who it is on the air.

[01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:29.310]
Can I say it's a net on the air or not?

[01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:29.910]
Better not.

[01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:31.990]
Are you over the other building already or what?

[01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:33.250]
Or would just come by to see us?

[01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:34.350]
I'm good Friday.

[01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:36.970]
Well, isn't it a pleasure, a breath of fresh air to see you?

[01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:39.690]
A net from the coast and hot 105 is here,

[01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:41.630]
sitting in Georgia's lap as I speak,

[01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:43.210]
getting in her licks.

[01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:45.510]
Here's the West Palm Beach.

[01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:45.730]

[01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.390]
Hey, Neil.

[01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:46.930]
Yes, sir.

[01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:48.310]
Yeah, about that play last night.

[01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.970]
Sean Van Allen, he hooked or he slashed somebody

[01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:52.170]
and he popped a stick.

[01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:53.010]
Right.

[01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:56.310]
So my cuff, I guess, realizing the Panthers were going to go in a power play

[01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:59.130]
did a very smart thing, picked up the guy's stick

[01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.450]
and threw it into the stands.

[01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:02.410]
And he wanted it back.

[01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.510]

[01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:03.970]
The whole bit wanted us to go in a power play.

[01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.250]
Yeah.

[01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:05.550]
The way that looked last night.

[01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:08.030]
I'm glad my 10-year-old son already understood what a power play

[01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.390]
went with it.

[01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:11.170]
Very difficult for him to explain to him the Panthers

[01:11:11.170 --> 01:11:12.330]
on the power play last night.

[01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:12.690]
Right.

[01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.730]
Exactly.

[01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.050]
I don't think Eddie understood it.

[01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:16.690]
Oh, it was off.

[01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:20.610]
And I sit over 126 and I'm glad you're talking about these 124-80s.

[01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:23.030]
That manatee that sits in the back or up there.

[01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:23.770]
Yeah, asshole.

[01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:25.930]
And the loser stuff.

[01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:27.690]
I just want to throw some out of it.

[01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:28.650]
But I'm afraid I'll lose it.

[01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:30.370]
And all those people in there, see,

[01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:31.910]
it's like the people in my section.

[01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:33.610]
If one guy starts throwing peanut shells,

[01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:35.690]
then like about 10 of them, like a bunch of children,

[01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:37.930]
all these people are lemons.

[01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:39.730]
They don't have an original thought in their brain.

[01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:41.230]
And it's the same over there.

[01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:43.530]
You'll notice every time they yell out anything,

[01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:46.370]
loser, you got 100 people in that section yell and loser.

[01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:49.090]
If they start with this crap about, hey, ref, you suck.

[01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:50.990]
It's like a high school bunch of crap.

[01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:52.190]
It's bush league.

[01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:53.470]
It's bush league.

[01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:56.050]
We had ESPN 2 Saturday night for that game.

[01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:57.710]
I want to just go and wear a bag or something.

[01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:01.810]
We had CBC here, Hockey Night in Canada on the last Saturday

[01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:03.370]
for the Aliefsky, and we could go Saturday.

[01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:05.510]
And they were out there, hey, ref, you suck.

[01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:06.590]
And I'm thinking, oh, brother,

[01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:08.290]
this is really going to impress these guys.

[01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:08.710]
All right.

[01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:10.850]
Okay, nice talking to you, Neil.

[01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:11.550]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:12:12.130 --> 01:12:14.030]
We have an open line in the out of town line,

[01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:19.490]
1-888-4749-463-1888-4749-463.

[01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:20.490]
Here's Miami.

[01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:21.790]
Wait a minute, that ain't it.

[01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:22.570]
Here it is. Hello.

[01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:23.570]
4-6-3.

[01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:24.170]
Miami.

[01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:26.310]
When is this?

[01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:30.870]
He's got a sock over it.

[01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:35.810]
We have an open line in Broward, 7-6-7-7-9-463-7-6-7-W-Y-O-D.

[01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:37.310]
Here's North Miami Beach. Hello.

[01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:38.350]
Hello.

[01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:39.010]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:41.030]
Neil, I appreciate your talent.

[01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:43.250]
I'm a listener for a long time,

[01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:45.610]
and I'd like to make a shameless request for the court.

[01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:46.170]
Yes, sir.

[01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:48.250]
How about keep your pants on, Jimmy?

[01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:49.910]
Don't got it.

[01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.690]
How'd it all go?

[01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:51.490]
Oh, it's long gone.

[01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:52.750]
I know. I thought it would be easy.

[01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:54.910]
I told you somebody got their pants going yesterday, yeah.

[01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:56.730]
Thank you very much.

[01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:57.650]
I appreciate the courtesy.

[01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:58.670]
Okay, sorry, pal.

[01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:59.290]
No problem.

[01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.750]
See ya.

[01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:01.330]
We'll go out and buy some new ones.

[01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:03.470]
We'll go out there and see our friend at Peter Kent.

[01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:04.650]
We have an open line in the days.

[01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:05.310]
See how he's doing.

[01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:06.990]
622-W-Y-O-D.

[01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:08.690]
622-9-463.

[01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:10.670]
So I got two cars that both worked on.

[01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:11.330]
How do you like that?

[01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:12.530]
Oh, thank the Lord.

[01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:14.350]
See, it's good Friday.

[01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:16.310]
I told you miracles happen on Good Friday.

[01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:17.750]
You don't want to believe me.

[01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:20.230]
Just sit back and eat the pudding in the apple sauce

[01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:21.190]
and cut the crap.

[01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:24.310]
Oh, this insanity.

[01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:26.150]
What are they going to just say?

[01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:27.810]
These people are crazy.

[01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:31.730]
All this religious cock of this superstition, this garbage.

[01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:32.930]
Why?

[01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:34.910]
Because people, there's one answer.

[01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:36.170]
They can't deal with death.

[01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:37.470]
That's the whole deal.

[01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:38.450]
Oh, we're not going to die.

[01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:40.150]
We're going to go to a better life on Sirius.

[01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:41.090]
And we're serious.

[01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:41.950]
That's the worst part.

[01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.990]
We be serious.

[01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:47.090]
Oh, give me a break already.

[01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:47.470]
Will you?

[01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:48.810]
Nice outfits, though.

[01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:49.450]
I'll say that.

[01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:53.990]
Very kind of like the, I hate to say about the Mormons.

[01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:55.050]
You know how they all have those outfits.

[01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:56.610]
Very kind of medicinal looking.

[01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:58.710]
Very clean, preppy, medicinal looking.

[01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:59.970]
With the white shirt and the tie.

[01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:02.710]
That's how these people are very medicinal.

[01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:04.610]
They probably don't smell too medicinal now.

[01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:06.630]
There are your shoes.

[01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:07.110]
Huh?

[01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:08.550]
They all had brand new Nike's.

[01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:09.910]
No, well, they had to show the swish.

[01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:10.930]
Here's plantation.

[01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:11.430]
Hello.

[01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.710]
Hello?

[01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:13.250]
Yes, sir.

[01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:13.830]
Neil.

[01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:14.290]
Yes.

[01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:17.850]
Hey, I just want to say that guy Ed Jovenowski's a bum.

[01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:18.470]
Yeah.

[01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:20.730]
And they should have traded when they had a chance.

[01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:21.210]
You're right.

[01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.850]
You're right, pal.

[01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:23.770]
When everybody in the league thought he was really a hot shot.

[01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:24.630]
Now they're all on to him.

[01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:25.310]
I'll guarantee you that.

[01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:26.290]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:26.730]
Eddie.

[01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:27.450]
Eddie.

[01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:28.310]
Give it away again.

[01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:28.890]
Eddie.

[01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:29.730]
He's killing us.

[01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:30.090]
Yeah.

[01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:32.330]
He just has to stand there, bench and play with his right thumb.

[01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.630]
You know?

[01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:33.110]
Exactly.

[01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:34.230]
Hey, guys, up on.

[01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:35.950]
Well, thanks for the good news.

[01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:37.410]
Okay, we have an open line in front.

[01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:40.310]
That was a pair of Gustafson, by the way, crawling in and wants back into line up.

[01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:44.710]
Open line in Broward, 7679-463-767-W1.

[01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:46.070]
Come on, Eddie, grow up here.

[01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:46.590]
Will you?

[01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:49.070]
It's not personal, Eddie.

[01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:49.550]
We like you.

[01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:50.070]
You're a good guy.

[01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:52.130]
I never stole a freight train, not even in Windsor.

[01:14:52.730 --> 01:14:53.630]
But come on.

[01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:54.490]
Let's get with it.

[01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:57.970]
Let's get, I mean, every time he's out there, especially on a power play now, he just gasped.

[01:14:57.990 --> 01:15:00.370]
He hold your breath from to do something totally unacceptable.

[01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:01.730]
And he didn't let us down last night.

[01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:03.910]
Nice assist there, and at first out of a goal, Eddie.

[01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:04.410]
Beauty.

[01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:06.650]
Here's Bal Harbor.

[01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:06.970]
Hello.

[01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:08.250]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.510]
Great.

[01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:11.730]
Hey, what you're saying before about those religious people?

[01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:13.830]
I think there are a bunch of freaks.

[01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.250]
Yeah.

[01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:18.790]
And, you know, what's really the difference between the call of the religion is all the same.

[01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:20.130]
It's all a bunch of bull crap.

[01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:23.010]
It's all Hocus Pocus and Superstition, amen, sir.

[01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:24.070]
That's what I say.

[01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:26.170]
Can you play Sifilis Blue for me?

[01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:27.810]
Yes, I can, and I'll see you on Sirius.

[01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.430]
Thanks, buddy.

[01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:28.790]
Okay.

[01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:29.210]
Bye.

[01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:30.430]
Open line and day.

[01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:32.070]
What the hell do you want, Sifilis Blue?

[01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:34.010]
What kind of, I'm good Friday.

[01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:36.210]
This guy calls you and wants me to play Sifilis Blue.

[01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:40.350]
Here's my story, said by Drew.

[01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:45.870]
About a girl called Sifilis Blue.

[01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:46.650]
Oi.

[01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:50.890]
Had a bug and ran it around.

[01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:56.610]
Gave it to every guy in town.

[01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.830]
I like it.

[01:15:57.830 --> 01:16:02.750]
Hey, hey, I'm a little bit old.

[01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:11.830]
Hey, hey, the slow, the slow, the slow, the slow.

[01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:13.890]
Open line and day.

[01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:18.450]
Oi.

[01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:24.750]
I shouldn't order from the spot on the left.

[01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:28.050]
I didn't know whether you're an average of it.

[01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:30.990]
I'm part of all always be with you.

[01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:33.750]
So stay away from the Sifilis Blue.

[01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:36.830]
And be took a close, I should have seen your size.

[01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:39.650]
You know the sense of a friend of mine.

[01:16:39.650 --> 01:16:42.610]
You got infected now, I've got it too.

[01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:45.630]
So keep away from the Sifilis Blue.

[01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:49.630]
Hey, hey, keep away from that girl.

[01:16:50.130 --> 01:16:52.630]
Open a Sifilis Blue now.

[01:16:53.230 --> 01:16:55.770]
Keep away from the Sifilis Blue.

[01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:59.570]
She likes to sleep around.

[01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:02.430]
Gave it to every guy in town.

[01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:05.610]
We didn't dare to start a trick call.

[01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:10.230]
Now I'm afraid of falling off here tomorrow.

[01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:12.290]
I'm sorry for the guy who knows.

[01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:15.410]
Used to have a horse with his fungus rose.

[01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:18.290]
And scared me for all that she ever knew.

[01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:21.310]
A keep away from the Sifilis Blue.

[01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:25.250]
Yeah, keep away from that girl.

[01:17:26.050 --> 01:17:29.770]
I live in 39 at WIOD 21 till noon on a great good Friday.

[01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:30.490]
It's painless.

[01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:33.010]
I mentioned Pete Boulder was in the building this morning.

[01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:34.070]
Didn't have to be here, I'm sure.

[01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:35.910]
But he's got his nose to the grindstone.

[01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:38.030]
He's got his nose to wouldn't he's working on it.

[01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:40.670]
And guess who else was in the building briefly today?

[01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:41.710]
You're a latchman.

[01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:42.590]
There you go.

[01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:44.890]
Told me the real story.

[01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.950]
Well, I don't want to get into that.

[01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:46.590]
You're a latchman.

[01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.310]
About that business, you know.

[01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:48.830]
Roy!

[01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:50.970]
Here's the lady in Del Rey Beach.

[01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.170]
Hello.

[01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:51.930]
Neil?

[01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:52.650]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:53.650]
Hi, it's Betsy in Del Rey.

[01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:54.310]
How are you doing?

[01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:55.150]
I'm fine, thanks.

[01:17:55.390 --> 01:18:00.210]
I heard something the other night that kind of reminded me of our mutual alarmist friend Rick Sanchez.

[01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:01.530]
And I thought you might enjoy it.

[01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.810]
Okay.

[01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:04.850]
I was up at a bar in Hope Sound, Harry in the natives have you ever been there?

[01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:05.990]
No.

[01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:09.730]
Okay, well it's the, I consider it the Hurricane Anthem for 1997.

[01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:13.770]
It's called premature evacuation double doppler kiss my ass.

[01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:15.910]
Yeah.

[01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:17.190]
Would you like a copy of it?

[01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:17.750]
Oh, I'd love it.

[01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:18.590]
Fantastic.

[01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:20.490]
I'll send it to you if you give me your address.

[01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:21.450]
3000.

[01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:21.950]
Uh-huh.

[01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:23.350]
North 28th Terrace.

[01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:24.410]
Okay.

[01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:25.770]
Hollywood, Florida.

[01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.270]
Okay.

[01:18:27.730 --> 01:18:28.090]
3302.

[01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:28.630]
Oh!

[01:18:29.610 --> 01:18:29.970]
Great.

[01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.750]
You're going to love it.

[01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:31.110]
Okay.

[01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:32.970]
He's just a local guy and he's fantastic.

[01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:33.730]
All right.

[01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:34.810]
Keep up the good work, Neil.

[01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:35.370]
Thanks, sweetheart.

[01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:36.370]
Have a great weekend.

[01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:37.110]
Bye-bye.

[01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.510]
Okay.

[01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:38.930]
And find some nice Easter eggs.

[01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:40.330]
Find some of those Russell Stover ones.

[01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:42.230]
The chocolate ones filled with that cream filling.

[01:18:43.930 --> 01:18:46.710]
Wasn't bad enough that a net was just on George's lap rubbing something.

[01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:48.110]
Now Wayne is in there rubbing his shoulders.

[01:18:48.670 --> 01:18:49.970]
It's called rub George Day.

[01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:51.610]
Everybody's rubbing it.

[01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:56.350]
We have an open line and I think it's also called beat Rick Riley over the head with a 2 by 4 day.

[01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:57.190]
I forgot about that.

[01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:59.010]
Are they coming in today?

[01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:00.490]
Are they all of a sudden turning religion?

[01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:01.410]
They'll be here, right?

[01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:02.310]
Do we know?

[01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:05.190]
It isn't paid holiday, by the way.

[01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:06.410]
Ron and Ron were here this morning.

[01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:07.410]
Had a great show this morning.

[01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:08.550]
What got into you guys?

[01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:10.370]
Great show this morning.

[01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:12.150]
Paul O was a hysterical.

[01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.630]
hysterical.

[01:19:13.890 --> 01:19:15.150]
I was peeing in my pants.

[01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.830]
I was, this guy's been holding back.

[01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:17.450]
I'm telling you.

[01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.130]
And I want to apologize for the intemper thing.

[01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:21.750]
I mean, he is a putz, but he's funny.

[01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:22.570]
Funny guy.

[01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:24.230]
You don't want to see him.

[01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:25.910]
Believe me, you don't ever want to see Paul O.

[01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:27.930]
Nobody, even his wife, don't want to see Paul O.

[01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:28.950]
He's got a wife.

[01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.550]
That's frightening.

[01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:30.750]
What does she look like?

[01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:31.110]
I wonder.

[01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:32.350]
Worse.

[01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.790]
Okay.

[01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:36.250]
Oh, I'm actually made in heaven.

[01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:38.510]
But they had a hell of a show this morning.

[01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:39.510]
It may be an omen.

[01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:40.710]
Here's Carl Douted.

[01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:41.930]
Here's Carl Springs on a mobile.

[01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.350]
Hello.

[01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:43.210]
Hey, no, how you doing?

[01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.490]
Great.

[01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:45.850]
I sit in section 124.

[01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:48.810]
It's the most embarrassing thing in the world to be sitting there.

[01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:53.310]
I want everybody from 124 who feels this way to call in here today and express yourself.

[01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.770]
That's all yours.

[01:19:53.890 --> 01:19:55.090]
His name is Scotty.

[01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:55.710]
He's a loser.

[01:19:55.930 --> 01:19:56.850]
I gave tickets to a surprise party.

[01:19:56.850 --> 01:19:58.610]
Is that the guy who's the rat?

[01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.990]
Yes.

[01:19:59.190 --> 01:20:01.330]
He used to be the rat out for his name Scotty.

[01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:02.210]
Oh, that guy.

[01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:05.090]
I'm embarrassed that this guy used to pretend to be a friend of mine.

[01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:07.370]
He used to come around and suck around with me and through the playoffs.

[01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:08.310]
He was wearing the rat.

[01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:11.890]
And you know, we humored him during the playoffs because there was so much excitement with the

[01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:12.310]
rat thing.

[01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:13.550]
And sometimes there's a check.

[01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:14.970]
He screams and cries.

[01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.050]
I want to put skirts on the guy.

[01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:19.690]
My friend of mine lived in Toronto.

[01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:20.530]
I grew up there.

[01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:22.210]
I gave him my tickets to the Leafs game.

[01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:25.850]
He said he would never go to another game with me even if I paid him.

[01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:26.090]
Right.

[01:20:26.290 --> 01:20:27.770]
Because you can't stand that guy.

[01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:31.010]
He's like, these guys, this is a junior hockey.

[01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:33.010]
The guy is embarrassment to the actors.

[01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:35.210]
He knows nothing about hockey.

[01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:36.650]
He's dragging the rest of the morons.

[01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:38.550]
He's seen two hockey games in a life with them.

[01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:38.770]
Right.

[01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:39.370]

[01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:43.430]
He's a threw back and an asshole and I can't stand them.

[01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:45.910]
And the quicker they get a new state and the happier wall pay.

[01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:46.390]
All right.

[01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:47.110]
Later.

[01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:48.210]
God bless you.

[01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:50.970]
Oh, thank God we're getting to 124 people.

[01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:53.490]
Now, let's get a whole bunch of people from 124 to call in here.

[01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:55.290]
And tell us guy cut the crap already.

[01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.710]
Okay.

[01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.470]
Loser.

[01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:58.110]
Loser.

[01:20:58.190 --> 01:21:00.190]
Oh, when is some of you people going to grow up?

[01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:00.450]
Okay.

[01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:03.110]
That may be okay the first two years when it was really boring there.

[01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:08.270]
We were sticking to join out and just nearly missed a playoff thanks to Roger Nielsen and Joe Cerella and Brian Benning.

[01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:14.870]
But I mean, now after going to the finals last year and maybe learning a little bit about what icing is and maybe like even a two line off side.

[01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:17.370]
Now we're starting to move up into world a little bit, a little bit.

[01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:22.750]
And you people are going to follow this jackass up there into the awful, awful.

[01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:24.850]
Hey, ref, you suck.

[01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:31.370]
I mean, after an obvious penalty, you know, one of our guys spears this guy takes a stick and just throws it right to the guy's gun.

[01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:32.590]
It comes out his back.

[01:21:32.610 --> 01:21:33.830]
He speared him so bad.

[01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:34.650]
He gets two minutes.

[01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:36.970]
Hey, ref, you suck.

[01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:38.370]
I mean, give me a break.

[01:21:39.730 --> 01:21:40.850]
Aggravating and agitating.

[01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:42.230]
One of these fans ever going to get with it.

[01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:44.470]
We're not going to play as because they played a crap game last night.

[01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:45.570]
Okay, they're entitled.

[01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:47.850]
But the fans, you suck.

[01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:51.970]
I'd say about 40, 50% of the people in that crowd, they need lobotomies.

[01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:55.090]
They need to give the tickets away to somebody to appreciate what's going on, which ain't them.

[01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:57.390]
Because they're too busy self aggrandizing with their crap.

[01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:58.550]
And thank you so much.

[01:21:59.050 --> 01:21:59.450]
Batman.

[01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:03.910]
We have two open lines in date, 622 W.I.O.D.

[01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:05.590]
6229463.

[01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:10.370]
So what's the story about this air in K who's doing it with our consultant?

[01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:12.530]
I'm still in shock.

[01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:14.990]
We have no calls about that because evidently nobody heard her last night.

[01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.770]
Thank God for that.

[01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:19.950]
She's on here bragging about the fact or belly aching about the family.

[01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:23.790]
I mean, is somebody holding a gun to her head making her hang on this guy?

[01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:24.630]
I don't get it.

[01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:29.250]
Our consultant, Walter Sabo, she mentions him by name.

[01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:30.950]
She's doing them for five years now.

[01:22:31.150 --> 01:22:34.770]
She's there have a relationship is the way it was put.

[01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:36.390]
Okay, fine.

[01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:39.350]
Now let's talk about something exciting, which that ain't it.

[01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:41.770]
Oh, man.

[01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:43.430]
Aaron K.

[01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:44.930]
It's it's a passion clones.

[01:22:46.570 --> 01:22:48.030]
1145 at W.I.O.D.

[01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.770]
The most exciting thing.

[01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:50.450]
It's 10W.I.O.D.

[01:22:51.690 --> 01:22:52.730]
Enjoy your penis.

[01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:06.110]
I took a call from the eponix.

[01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:09.410]
They say the future beat right for me.

[01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:14.270]
Now I can't get snow job because I don't got no literacy.

[01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:17.070]
I was talking like an old Negro.

[01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:20.170]
Eponix thought they had this way.

[01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:22.310]
Now I can't do nothing.

[01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:25.330]
But my heritage says that's okay.

[01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:30.990]
Change my name to shoot, roll, drive a douce and a quarter and a Cadillac.

[01:23:34.650 --> 01:23:41.170]
I remember when I was stealing all the white men's cars hanging outside the Belman Air

[01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:41.510]
bar.

[01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:43.810]
Grind the blues about poverty.

[01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:46.750]
White there was God's know job for me.

[01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:51.710]
And so the bomb exploded my line of chains.

[01:23:51.970 --> 01:23:56.670]
Now I got you to go and sell more crack cocaine.

[01:24:12.170 --> 01:24:12.730]
Crack cocaine.

[01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:15.250]
Learning what a bar is in song.

[01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:19.310]
Eponix makes me sound funny.

[01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:21.990]
God's nothing to do with literacy.

[01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:24.450]
Now I got to make more money.

[01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:24.610]
But my heritage says that's okay.

[01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:27.530]
Labor books sounds good to me.

[01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:29.790]
I got plenty of nothing.

[01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:32.750]
Eponix ain't getting me anywhere.

[01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:38.130]
Maybe I'll mug an old white bitch steal a purse and pull her hair.

[01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:40.330]
Then I gonna take some money.

[01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:43.510]
My is thereio and the fridge are dead.

[01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:53.650]
I remember when I was stealing all the white men's cars hanging outside the Belman Air

[01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:53.970]
bar.

[01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:56.290]
Grind the blues about poverty.

[01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:59.070]
White there was God's know job for me.

[01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:04.090]
And so the bomb exploded my line of chains.

[01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:09.190]
Now got you to go and sell more crack cocaine.

[01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:10.350]
Crack cocaine.

[01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.830]
Crack cocaine.

[01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:15.350]
Crack cocaine.

Since your safety's light. With your flight, Cesar, light. He's got a job for you to do.

[01:29:59.710 --> 01:30:02.970]
You have a brand new style too.

[01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:06.790]
We love the way you want your doom.

You're bending those two-hour old friends.

Who's with the speed of a gazelle?

[01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:31.970]
Sex the bad guy straight to hell.

[01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:36.830]
When a building starts too low with your image then we know

[01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:40.450]
You're crushing grind with one mighty ball.

[01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.450]
Crazy!

[01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:50.390]
In the way, folks.

[01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:53.270]

[01:30:54.090 --> 01:30:56.650]
1204 W.I.O.D. Happy Good Friday from all your friends.

[01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:58.650]
All your paizons, all your lancemen.

[01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:02.570]
Here at 610 W.I.O.D. Thanks again for a sensation.

[01:31:02.710 --> 01:31:03.190]
Did I say?

[01:31:03.330 --> 01:31:04.690]
No, Phil Lonsman.

[01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:07.310]
Anyway, he was in here looking kind of putty this morning.

[01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:10.670]
He was telling me the real story behind the story which I don't want to elaborate.

[01:31:10.930 --> 01:31:11.990]
Because I don't want to cause him no trouble.

[01:31:12.170 --> 01:31:14.250]
But you know something, it was much into about nothing.

[01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:15.870]
Much into about nothing.

[01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:20.210]
These people here, these bureaucratic types, they get all bent out of shape

[01:31:20.210 --> 01:31:22.250]
and get all psychotic over like nothing.

[01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:23.450]
Don't even bother coming back.

[01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:23.890]
Exactly.

[01:31:25.090 --> 01:31:27.750]
That should be their biggest problem that somebody defaced.

[01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.390]
Roar!

[01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:30.830]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:31.150]
Hello.

[01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:32.750]
Hi, Neil. How you doing?

[01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:33.110]
Great.

[01:31:33.970 --> 01:31:41.030]
Listen, you know the vet that you won the 97 is like a mix between the Mazrx7 and the Accurandisex?

[01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:41.450]
Yeah.

[01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:45.830]
Only it's rated higher though by all the car magazines.

[01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:46.850]
Yeah, I know.

[01:31:47.130 --> 01:31:49.270]
How do you like that mix? Looks nice, huh?

[01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.750]
I love it.

[01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.850]
Okay.

[01:31:51.710 --> 01:31:52.850]
Well, I'll let you know.

[01:31:53.210 --> 01:31:53.770]
Thank you, sir.

[01:31:54.210 --> 01:31:54.550]
Thank you.

[01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:56.290]
Okay. You're welcome, Prago.

[01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:58.250]
We have an open line a day.

[01:31:58.390 --> 01:32:00.430]
Let me tell you again a great restaurant there in a base.

[01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:02.050]
I don't want to say great yet.

[01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:02.610]
I had one meal.

[01:32:02.610 --> 01:32:03.390]
It was very good.

[01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:07.890]
Surprisingly, because base I quite frankly looked to me like a flea market.

[01:32:08.330 --> 01:32:10.010]
Like George says, an overpriced flea market.

[01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:11.230]
What was the name of that restaurant?

[01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.430]
Lorenzo's?

[01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:13.170]
Not the renties.

[01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:15.530]
Lombardies, Lorenzo's, Lorenzo's, our Paisan.

[01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:17.890]
Our Paisan and I'm calling it Lorenzo's?

[01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:18.730]
That's all right.

[01:32:18.810 --> 01:32:19.230]
They wouldn't mind.

[01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:20.910]
They had like real digos in there.

[01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:23.990]
The waiter was like a real Italian guy.

[01:32:24.090 --> 01:32:27.990]
Not just somebody who's from the Bronx, a real Italian who spoke Italian.

[01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:29.610]
Grazio, Prago.

[01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:32.210]
That was about it.

[01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:34.110]
Those are the only two words he understood.

[01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.910]
Now he was very good.

[01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:36.710]
We have an open line a day.

[01:32:36.850 --> 01:32:40.370]
622-946-3622-Achepequia.

[01:32:41.170 --> 01:32:42.350]
Here's a lady in plantation.

[01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:42.850]
Hello.

[01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.830]
Hi.

[01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:44.410]
Hi, Neil.

[01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:45.450]
Bon pomerigio.

[01:32:46.130 --> 01:32:46.490]
Hi.

[01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:48.530]
I just wanted to tell you I'm really impressed by your show.

[01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:49.190]
Of course.

[01:32:49.810 --> 01:32:52.030]
Not that many people have the guts to speak their minds.

[01:32:52.090 --> 01:32:53.910]
As my mother would say, what's not to like?

[01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:56.570]
Are you a new listener?

[01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:58.670]
Yes, fairly recent.

[01:32:59.070 --> 01:32:59.890]
Oh my God.

[01:33:00.010 --> 01:33:00.650]
Thank the Lord.

[01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:08.950]
I just want to ask you, what's your theory on why that not that many women listen to your show or call up or involve?

[01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:10.090]
Or both of the above?

[01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:11.130]
Yes.

[01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:16.230]
Women generally are busy watching stupid soap operas and watching stupid talking heads on TV.

[01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:20.250]
And not only that, not too many women listen to AM radio.

[01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:25.250]
See, if more women would listen to AM radio, when I was on Zeta on FM, I had a lot more women than I do now.

[01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:27.050]
But women just don't listen to AM.

[01:33:27.230 --> 01:33:33.790]
If somebody would just teach them how to dittle with that knob and the radio button too, then they would know what it's all about.

[01:33:33.970 --> 01:33:34.350]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:35.350]
Oh, OK.

[01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:37.470]
Women need a course in how to dittle with that knob.

[01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:38.490]
Oh, really?

[01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.390]
Exactly.

[01:33:40.110 --> 01:33:42.090]
OK, well thanks for the advice to women.

[01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:46.090]
Well, obviously you already got plenty of experience and we appreciate that.

[01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.650]
OK.

[01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:47.450]
Have a great weekend.

[01:33:48.170 --> 01:33:48.410]
Bye-bye.

[01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:50.630]
She knows how to dittle it over to AM.

[01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:52.410]
What's all with all you women out there?

[01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:53.330]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:02.690 --> 01:34:03.910]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:03.970]

[01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:04.550]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:06.990]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.650]

What does wrong with you?

[01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:17.230]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.630]

What does wrong with you?

[01:34:18.890 --> 01:34:19.370]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:20.490]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:20.730 --> 01:34:22.110]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:23.130]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:23.190]

[01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.310]

[01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.310]

[01:34:25.710 --> 01:34:30.230]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:31.630]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:31.730]

[01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:31.730]

[01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:31.730]

[01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:31.730]

[01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:31.730]

[01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:31.730]

[01:34:31.730 --> 01:34:31.810]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:31.970]
What does wrong with you?

[01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:53.750]
said it

[01:34:57.090 --> 01:34:58.910]
Oh my god

[01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:01.510]
What a pathetic idiotic bitch

[01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:03.330]
Is that a woman or a kid?

[01:35:04.410 --> 01:35:05.350]
What was that?

[01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:09.510]
No that didn't go to work.

[01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:12.870]
The last time...

[01:35:31.650 --> 01:35:36.970]
We have an open line in day at 6229463622 to butter rhymes and we have one in

[01:35:36.970 --> 01:35:43.030]
Broward 7679463767 W I O D I think that Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition is

[01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:46.110]
right. We got to get that potty mouth bag off the or else you know what I'm saying?

[01:35:47.230 --> 01:35:51.050]
And that damn Dyke Ellen degenerate let's get her off of there too. Let's get everybody

[01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:55.570]
off we don't like. Let's just Christianize America by Christianizing the airwaves and the

[01:35:55.570 --> 01:36:03.010]
newspapers and the magazine. The Grand Magazine. The Grand Magazine which is in the Italian

[01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:09.390]
Department store. Here's Hollywood on a mobile hello. Hollywood.

[01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:13.490]
Hello Neil. Yes sir. Hey I was wondering if I could bother you and your listeners

[01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:16.770]
maybe you can help me out a little bit with a couple things. Yes sir. I just got a

[01:36:16.890 --> 01:36:20.530]
lot while I was about four months old now. We've had our problem with fleas and

[01:36:21.210 --> 01:36:25.270]
scratch themselves raw. Yeah. I don't know if it's the fleas or if it's the food. I

[01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:28.770]
know you had problems with your food. If he's got fleas he's got an allergy to a

[01:36:28.770 --> 01:36:32.230]
man and he's got to scratch himself raw and you need to get rid of the fleas. You

[01:36:32.230 --> 01:36:34.750]
need to take him to the vet. Why are you not taking him to the vet and getting a

[01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:39.110]
cortisone shot? I didn't get a shot. I got that thing you put on once a month. It's a liquid.

[01:36:39.250 --> 01:36:42.910]
You put on it. Is it working? It works. But like I said he's no one at himself. Of

[01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:48.150]
course because he's allergic to the fleas. Okay. My golden my golden retriever when he

[01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:51.570]
had fleas which thank goodness we haven't had in years but when he had fleas he

[01:36:51.570 --> 01:36:55.950]
was like he had just chewing his skin off. Yeah that's what he's doing. He's just

[01:36:55.950 --> 01:36:59.450]
not on himself raw. Allergic you got to get rid of the fleas man. Okay another thing.

[01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:03.530]
I've been here for about five years from Philly. Yes and I miss playing hockey

[01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:07.170]
desperately. Nobody down here plays that hockey or foot hockey whatever you want to call it.

[01:37:07.210 --> 01:37:10.730]
Yeah and if anyone listeners out there got a league or a group of guys they play

[01:37:10.730 --> 01:37:13.910]
pocket hockey down here. Yeah everybody's doing an insane playing hockey.

[01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:17.530]
I'm a little bit ponsial hockey once in a while. Roller hockey. I can't skate. I just want to play

[01:37:17.530 --> 01:37:21.070]
foot hockey or deck hockey whatever you want to call it. Okay. Anybody knows anything? Give

[01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:24.710]
a call in. Okay listen get rid of the fleas I'm telling you. Once you get rid of the fleas

[01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:27.350]
your problem will be gone for life. Didn't you have a problem with your food though?

[01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:32.870]
Huh? Didn't you have a problem with his food? Listen please I'm begging you. If he has fleas

[01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:37.690]
I am telling you he's allergic to the fleas. You've got to completely get rid of the fleas.

[01:37:37.690 --> 01:37:42.550]
Once you get rid of the fleas that problem will be gone long gone. Got you. Okay.

[01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:48.770]
Thank you sir. Do it. Okay. We have two open lines in Broward 767 W I O D we have the

[01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:52.130]
mobile one purple line available there for you. We're waiting on you. Our poll question

[01:37:52.130 --> 01:37:58.790]
today is canis mas macho Luis Miguel around reagacy. Pound I O D on a mobile one line

[01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:02.030]
open line and pop beach to the rest of the world. One triple eight four seven four nine

[01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:06.310]
four six three. We want to know are you serious about outer space? That's the question. We want

[01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:09.610]
to know about what's your name there? Aaron Summers Jr. That was on last night making

[01:38:09.610 --> 01:38:16.110]
her debut Aaron Kay who's doing a Walter Sabo. See the more she kept talking about that

[01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:20.410]
the more it made it unacceptable. I mean I already knew that. But as she wouldn't have

[01:38:20.410 --> 01:38:23.250]
said anything nobody else on the outside would have known it and it wouldn't have been

[01:38:23.250 --> 01:38:27.290]
a problem. But the more she kept talking to China about it the more unacceptable it became

[01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:32.210]
which is maybe the idea. I don't know to stir up some controversy and say hey no matter

[01:38:32.210 --> 01:38:36.150]
what this bitch does she's going to be on there because she's banging the consultant.

[01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:44.610]
You don't see any conflict of interest there do you? Here's coconut grove hello. Hey Neil

[01:38:44.610 --> 01:38:50.410]
yes sir. Alok boss you are the best buddy. I've listened to you for many years. I've

[01:38:50.410 --> 01:38:55.450]
called you. I'm the very best El mejor. El mejoring the moon to me. Do you see? Okay.

[01:38:55.450 --> 01:39:03.090]
Hey Neil you have that memo for no more speaking Spanish in the office. You could do that.

[01:39:03.130 --> 01:39:07.930]
That is so hilarious. I'm going to I'm going to whip that out man. It's so great. Anyway

[01:39:07.930 --> 01:39:14.990]
Neil happy Easter to you. I enjoy your show very much. Faithful listener. I mean when I move

[01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:18.770]

[01:39:18.770 --> 01:39:23.130]
lived up in Tallahassee and I've called you from up there before. Yeah. But I had to listen to you

[01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:29.470]
through a little AM out in the woods out through sun you know WS UN. Yeah. But I moved back

[01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:32.690]

[01:39:32.690 --> 01:39:36.290]
don't go out there in the woods again believe me. Well lucky lucky the first time do not go

[01:39:36.290 --> 01:39:40.750]

[01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:44.150]
hanging there from when you're hanging from the tree they'll be laughing and you'll be crying.

[01:39:44.370 --> 01:39:49.490]
They get a long fine with this cube. Okay. You got the right stuff for them. Okay. There you go.

[01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:53.070]

[01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:12.710]
example. Coneyo, carajo. Hey I found it. I've hung out of this thing. It says no manager

[01:40:12.710 --> 01:40:18.410]
under any circumstances will be referred to as El Ijo de la Gran Puta, El Cabrón or

[01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:23.770]
AC Maricón. Ijo did I get there right finally I have a very very good very hard time

[01:40:23.770 --> 01:40:27.490]
saying that because I want to pronounce when you get the H in the J together when I haven't

[01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:32.950]
separate I know what the H is all about as in God, shame God. I'll get back to that momentarily

[01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:48.390]
as in coma. You're a whole day or say Hodeo. I like saying that. Say Hodeo. But you didn't say

[01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:51.330]
make believe speak. You're not fooling me. I'm telling you for a second. I'm playing

[01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:57.290]
in Rique Gleise's. Do they attend? He says, Oh, is that Italian? I wasn't listening. Yeah.

[01:40:57.410 --> 01:41:02.710]
I was picking up a lot of words. That's why I get away from me with his crap already. Okay.

[01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:08.410]
Cherta Mente. And I'm talking sir. I'm so embarrassed that I said that promo you played.

[01:41:08.490 --> 01:41:14.850]
I said, certamente. That's Spanish. Certamente. It's like these ringers in our Italian class

[01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:18.450]
who are, you know, no, they're speak real fluently and they think that they're fooling us.

[01:41:18.490 --> 01:41:21.310]
And all of a sudden they'll throw in there like Nueva, you know, Ninal become the way.

[01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:27.850]
Sorry, Espadio and all of a sudden you go and the port goes back. You speak,

[01:41:28.050 --> 01:41:32.710]
sorry, fooling. I'll profess already. I'll tell you that 1214 at W I O D.

[01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:40.810]
610 W I O D not just for snack time anymore. Maybe a lot better at 7 o'clock.

[01:41:40.810 --> 01:41:41.330]
Good.

[01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:48.790]
1219 W I O D we must have some Julios in accounting in this company because it says salary increases

[01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:56.150]
will not be referred to as tremendous mierda. How do you like that? It says unusual or creative

[01:41:56.150 --> 01:42:02.470]
customer requirements will not be labeled as Paja Smentales. Lack of determination will

[01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:07.730]
not be referred to as Falta de Juevos or Maricone Ría. No real persons who lack an

[01:42:07.730 --> 01:42:13.110]
initiative be referred to as Weyván or Come mierda. I like to roll my Rs in the middle

[01:42:13.110 --> 01:42:17.430]
of that word mierda because that changes the meaning, doesn't it? No. Well, I said it

[01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:21.550]
did. So anyway, it's not easy to roll you around the middle of a word. You have to really

[01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:25.270]
know how to roll them. George Estlub went up by the way, a big brown one. Here's Fort

[01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:33.550]
Lauderdale. Hello. Hello. Yes, I am. Neil. Yes. Hi, Sue. Sifilis. Sue, that is. Hi, Sue.

[01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:40.250]
Anyway, I was wondering if you heard that new air intimate CD. No, I have not, but I will

[01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:44.270]
listen to it on a way home today, though. In your Corvette. Yes, I will. Hey, because I

[01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:48.310]
had that crappy, I had that crappy lumen of this morning that only had a cassette decadent.

[01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:57.330]
Hey, that song King, they wrote it for you. Yeah. Yeah. And good. Great. Okay. See you. I'll

[01:42:57.330 --> 01:43:01.650]
hear it. Sue. We'll see you. I see you. We'll see you. We have an open line at Broward.

[01:43:03.170 --> 01:43:11.610]
Drunk. 7679 463 767 WYOD. Blitzed. Let's go to a lady in Miami. Hello. Lady in Miami.

[01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:18.350]
Hello. Yes, ma'am. Yes. I'd like to play a three-quest. Yes. My boyfriend's back. Okay.

[01:43:18.450 --> 01:43:23.570]
Well, congratulations. We have an open line at day at 6229 463. He's probably the one

[01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:27.950]
on Stola Cart. See, for the woman that called before and we loved her, she was great.

[01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:31.670]
Three ladies back who was wondering why we don't have more women listening and more women

[01:43:31.670 --> 01:43:35.850]
calling and etc and so on. The reason is that by the time I come on at 10 o'clock in the

[01:43:35.850 --> 01:43:40.010]
morning every day, they're all plastered already. I mean, when you got a neighbor that's

[01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:43.250]
drinking a beer, she's out there with a little kid taking it into the school bus and with

[01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:47.290]
a beer in her hand 730 in the morning, you got to figure by 10. They're all blitzed.

[01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:51.650]
They're plastered. They're on the floor with her without somebody. Here's Athens, Joja.

[01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:55.790]
Hello. How you doing, Neil? Great. I turned on the internet this morning and I listened

[01:43:55.790 --> 01:44:00.930]
to your show and come to find out that Feds and I have the same birthday. Today? Yes.

[01:44:01.210 --> 01:44:07.970]
Yes. Sure. I'll be God-danged. There you go. Thank you very much. You're welcome. I went

[01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:11.510]
to see the Godfather yesterday. I was listening to you and it made me want to go see it. And

[01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:16.750]
just like you said, Neil, the median age in there was death plus 20. Oh my God. How

[01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:20.110]
do you press it? Why aren't they marketing this so that some living and breathing people

[01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:23.850]
go see the greatest movie of all time? I was surprised to see the movie in Athens,

[01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:28.390]
Joja, but there were these two women sitting about four rows in front of me and I guess

[01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:32.150]
their hearing was so bad that they could no longer whisper to each other. Oh no. They

[01:44:32.150 --> 01:44:36.190]
were talking to themselves as loud as I'm talking to you right now. Isn't that just

[01:44:36.190 --> 01:44:39.610]
what you needed in a movie where the dialogue is real low to begin with and you see you've

[01:44:39.610 --> 01:44:43.070]
got to pay real close attention and they're talking out loud like what did he just say?

[01:44:43.770 --> 01:44:50.090]
Exactly. And when Atholonia, when she started the car, the car blew up. Right. You should

[01:44:50.090 --> 01:44:54.530]
have a coronary right there. I love it. Beautiful. Yeah. Tell me to go see it again. Maybe

[01:44:54.530 --> 01:45:01.290]
it'll work the next time. Do you think that the two Barnes trade will make Brian Murray's

[01:45:01.290 --> 01:45:06.650]
reputation like Don Schuels' reputation was after a rafting Eric Kumaro? Let me just say

[01:45:06.650 --> 01:45:10.170]
this. Okay. Because Brian Murray has done a lot of good things too. But I just want to

[01:45:10.170 --> 01:45:15.290]
say this and I watched that team again. That team last night, the chemistry on this team

[01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:18.830]
has never recovered. I know we had a lot of injuries, a lot of excuses, but the chemistry

[01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:23.290]
has never gone back to what it was before that trade. I agree with you. That trade was

[01:45:23.290 --> 01:45:28.990]
like, oh, I agree. They just don't seem spirited. It's right. They just lost something there.

[01:45:29.230 --> 01:45:33.250]
Can I can I have a two request? A birthday request and a good Friday request? Yes, sir. It's

[01:45:33.250 --> 01:45:41.870]
possible. The Dennis Liri asshole song. Yeah. And the the tape of Ronnie D. Teller Ronnie B that he

[01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:46.990]
was going to quit. Oh, we have that. Don't we? What's that under, George? Running. Oh, I got it.

[01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:50.350]
I got it. All right. Both are both nice and long too, by the way. Well,

[01:45:50.530 --> 01:45:54.270]
be claimed during the break. We come out of breaks or something. Okay. And one more thing.

[01:45:54.510 --> 01:45:58.770]
Yeah. Somebody at these bags. Go ahead. Robert Raven and Derek Bostick. You two are a bunch

[01:45:58.770 --> 01:46:07.770]
at two spas. Okay, pal. Bye. See ya. See you in Aintree. We have an open line in Broward. 7679463. 7672. We got

[01:46:07.770 --> 01:46:11.250]
that toll free line to the rest of the universe on the audio net. And of course in Palm Beach,

[01:46:11.250 --> 01:46:14.830]
which forget about them, forget about those goyms. They're all in church today doing their thing.

[01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:19.650]
It's good Friday. They're all eating macaroni and cheese right now as I speak. And like I said,

[01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:24.290]
yesterday, what's wrong with macaroni and cheese? I happen to like macaroni and cheese, okay?

[01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:30.630]
As a matter of fact, there ain't quite nothing like a craft macaroni and cheese when you come right

[01:46:30.630 --> 01:46:35.210]
down to it. Hey kids, every three quarter ounce crafted cheese single is made with five ounces of milk.

[01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:40.330]
How do we do that? Dairy ferries. Excuse me. Dairy ferries. Actually, sir, I was talking to the kids.

[01:46:40.330 --> 01:46:44.050]
Yeah, everyone knows about dairy ferries. And night when you're asleep, the dairy ferries

[01:46:44.050 --> 01:46:48.510]
seeks into the kitchen and stirs it all the milk with a magic wine. Well, that's not entirely correct.

[01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:52.350]
You know, you're right. Yeah, there's the pasteurization process. I forgot about the part where the

[01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:56.810]
dairy fairy comes to my room afterwards and gives me a hot cheese enema. A what cheddar, I think?

[01:46:57.050 --> 01:47:00.250]
No, it smells like cheddar anyway. Sir, I don't know what's going on in your room at night,

[01:47:00.250 --> 01:47:03.270]
but I don't think it has anything to do with the manufacture of crafted cheese single.

[01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:07.170]
Oh, that's all right. So, you want to see my magic cheese log? No.

[01:47:07.170 --> 01:47:11.910]
Crafted cheese singles made with five ounces of real milk. Trust us, you really don't want to know

[01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:18.750]
how we do it. What you got to the meetings? No, that's my rule. I won't. That's true. That's the

[01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:23.070]
rule for me. You're in radio? I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to see you. I don't want

[01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:29.610]
to know you. You're in the business. I don't want to know you. Lose my number. Now, how do you

[01:47:29.610 --> 01:47:34.670]
really see out? The business has been mean to you over the years. You haven't taken enough out of it.

[01:47:34.670 --> 01:47:41.610]
The business has been so cool to me. I thank you. And now I can go away in peace very, very, very

[01:47:41.610 --> 01:47:51.950]
soon. Goodbye. I think we just signed off. No, no, no, no, just me signing off.

[01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:59.970]
How's the crib? How's it down south crib? Nice? Yes, great. It's great.

[01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:06.830]
Love the love the hood? You know, I'm just trying to get in. You know, my wife is here and

[01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:11.470]
these rumors about you leaving. Why did we buy a new house? I don't know, honey. He didn't tell me

[01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:16.610]
until after we already put the mortgage down. I told you before the mortgage, my friend. No,

[01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:21.010]
yes, I did. I remember talking to you about this. You never talked to me. I heard from someone else.

[01:48:21.250 --> 01:48:25.310]
I know. I talked to you in the middle of November. We all sat down in the middle of November.

[01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:29.450]
And you in the middle of a deal. You didn't do the deal and you did another deal. You told me that.

[01:48:30.230 --> 01:48:35.030]
I just said I didn't, man. You told me that you told me that in November, man. You did.

[01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:40.610]
We never talked in November. We did talk in November. We sat in a hotel room in November and talked.

[01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:46.330]
What hotel room? That hotel lobby and then we went up to the room in Tampa. That hotel room.

[01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:52.210]
Remember, we had lunch and then we went up to the room. By that time, I already had my place, man.

[01:48:52.210 --> 01:48:56.310]
Now, by that time you didn't have your place. I didn't talk to you. I talked to the people that you

[01:48:56.310 --> 01:49:01.130]
had told me. No, we all talked. We all sat up there and talked together. We did.

[01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:07.570]
We had a meeting. We all sat down, talked. And then you and I and two other individuals from

[01:49:07.570 --> 01:49:12.190]
the company sat down and had a meeting in the hotel room. And that's how I went down.

[01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:19.610]
That's what happened. And that was before Thanksgiving. And here we are January 6th.

[01:49:22.530 --> 01:49:27.890]
Are we going to have a conversation or what? Are we done? Should I walk away now?

[01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:34.470]
You're going to do whatever you want to do, man. I have done whatever I want to do.

[01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:39.910]
But should I walk away now? Would it be easier? I don't want to make this thing difficult.

[01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:52.190]
No, this thing is all about you anyway. It's not all about me. It's about this show

[01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:59.990]
we are. I asked me about how everything's going. I asked you about the crib. That's all.

[01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:06.410]
It's great, running. Man, I'll just leave now. If it's easier, that way I will.

[01:50:06.570 --> 01:50:11.650]
It's not easier that way. Then why are you saying what you're doing? I'm not doing anything.

[01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:15.290]
Let's go on. Let's act like everything's happy. What exactly what I was doing?

[01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:19.390]
And then you took your headphones off and didn't want to talk to them. Don't play. I'm not playing.

[01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:22.750]
I'm not playing at all, man. I'm being totally honest with you and I have been.

[01:50:23.210 --> 01:50:27.990]
Yeah. What do you mean, yeah? I'm glad. I'm glad everything's going down the way it's going down.

[01:50:28.170 --> 01:50:32.130]
It's all happy to me. It's all happy to me. I know it is.

[01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:37.570]
It's time for me to move on. That's all. All right, so let's change the subject.

[01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:42.030]
I didn't bring it up, man. I'm just having a conversation with you and you just stop talking to me.

[01:50:42.110 --> 01:50:45.590]
It's so embarrassingly true. Prove 28 at WIOD.

[01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:54.710]
Rock, dirty, to me. First, she set the screen on fire in basic instinct.

[01:50:55.250 --> 01:51:00.350]
Then you saw her in sliver. After that, it was intersection followed by the quick and the dead.

[01:51:00.750 --> 01:51:04.570]
But let's face it, the only decent movie she's ever done was Basic Instinct.

[01:51:04.930 --> 01:51:09.050]
So now Sharon Stone gives moviegoers exactly what they want.

[01:51:09.490 --> 01:51:12.050]
And that's more of what made her a household name.

[01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:18.550]
Sharon Stone stars in crotch. We all know she can't act, but it doesn't matter in crotch.

[01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:22.830]
Two solid hours of Sharon Stone crossing and uncrossing her legs.

[01:51:23.230 --> 01:51:27.630]
The New York Times says this film will give Sharon Stone a leg up on the competition.

[01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:34.590]
Siskel and Ebert give it two thumbs up. And Rex Reed says it would have been better with Brad Pitt.

[01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:40.470]
Sharon Stone brings her one true talent back to the screen in crotch. Now showing.

[01:51:40.890 --> 01:51:45.190]
But 1233 at WIOD. Happy Friday to you. Hope you've been to church. We hope you've

[01:51:45.190 --> 01:51:47.550]
dropped your rosary beads. We hope you got your necklace and your.

[01:51:47.770 --> 01:51:53.790]
Oh, and then I wish I would have saved the paper yesterday. It was a very short and stupid letter to the editor in the Sun Sentinel.

[01:51:54.290 --> 01:51:57.730]
About that kid at Boca High School. What is wrong with you people?

[01:51:58.830 --> 01:52:03.630]
All these goody two shoes assholes out there. Well, the school the school is absolutely right.

[01:52:03.690 --> 01:52:07.090]
And the school board is right on target about Peter Poppick there in his beads.

[01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:14.110]
He had he had the Cuban flex. See, this is just part of the Zena Fulby in his town.

[01:52:14.110 --> 01:52:18.610]
If he would have had like if he would have had like a star at David the Israeli flag on here.

[01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:22.090]
All the old Jews would be writing as a what's wrong with you? You're all anti-Semites.

[01:52:24.170 --> 01:52:29.650]
But because he had these chachkis there on his neck in the right away. Oh, it's a gang thing. You're right.

[01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:36.750]
What the Castro gang? Maybe it's a fact thing. Maybe it's the Castro street gang from Fritko.

[01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:39.350]
What is wrong with these people anyway?

[01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:45.390]
No matter what kind of craft, no matter what kind of restrictions, no matter what kind of inhibitions,

[01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:49.610]
no matter what kind of stupid ass and on constitution laws they pass and rules and regulations.

[01:52:49.890 --> 01:52:54.770]
Oh, they're absolutely right. That's right. If we just outlaw stuff like that then everybody

[01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:58.410]
will be obedient. We won't be killing each other in the God forbid that we should outlaw guns.

[01:52:59.190 --> 01:53:02.770]
Let's make sure everybody's got a gun. And if we just don't have no gang symbols in class,

[01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:06.650]
everybody will be alive. Right. Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:53:07.090 --> 01:53:14.210]
Leo, how you doing? Great. I just received my annual call from my very, very Catholic grandmother telling me,

[01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:19.070]
well, it used to be asking me to go to church today. But today it's telling me to go to church.

[01:53:19.090 --> 01:53:22.890]
Telling to blow it out of the race. Well, the crusades are still alive. Yeah.

[01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:25.950]
So it should probably be stopped by my house. Blow it out your ass, grandma.

[01:53:27.670 --> 01:53:30.710]
And the other thing I wanted to ask about the old tool.

[01:53:31.110 --> 01:53:32.570]
Brackdom. Yeah. Okay.

[01:53:34.810 --> 01:53:37.950]
Oh, yeah. She actually said, well, you should go. And I said, why? And she goes, well,

[01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:41.630]
because, you know, Jesus, the Lord is dead. And I go again. You know,

[01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:47.270]
dead again. Every year. Dead again. You know, he's dead every year. He's alive every year. He's

[01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:51.430]
born. It's just it's just getting to be a drag. But, uh, well, I hope you have a weekend. We're

[01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:56.270]
going to pull. He's running around and drag doesn't bother him. Well, I hope you have a real good weekend.

[01:53:56.270 --> 01:54:01.250]
And back to you. Enjoy your event. And back to me. Yeah. See you. Bye. We have an open

[01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:05.010]
line today. Your grandma's going to make him go to church. You people at a bunch of pussies out

[01:54:05.010 --> 01:54:09.310]
there. Tell grandma, mind your own business. Quilt with the crap. Okay. Go, uh,

[01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:14.030]
dovon over the candles and do something useful and get out of my face. Get out of my face with

[01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:19.030]
your stone age baloney. Okay. You let me handle my baloney. You worry about your baloney, grandma.

[01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:24.970]
Get lost. Go get a life with your bubble. My C's. Okay. With all this hocus, focus.

[01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:31.790]
Here's a lady in Coral Springs. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, ma'am. Long time listeners. First time call.

[01:54:32.110 --> 01:54:36.950]
Great. I was looking for you with a hockey game last night. I'm not sure what section you're in.

[01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:43.950]
I'm in 220 and I was looking around. I'm in 106. 106. 106. 106. Thank God. No, we're near 124.

[01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:49.390]
Okay. I've won a game. That was sad. That was so sad. I stayed till the end. I watched the last two goals.

[01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:54.730]
I knew it was hopeless and helpless. I stayed. But there, you know, my partying, so what do you

[01:54:54.730 --> 01:54:58.490]
think? I'm not sure. There were. There are second team or whatever. Anyway, be in front of

[01:54:58.490 --> 01:55:05.070]
the L.F. I'm kind of a flyer. Anyway, I do listen to W.I.D. I do know how to work my knobs,

[01:55:05.770 --> 01:55:08.370]
but I only listen when you're on. Otherwise, I'm listening to sports.

[01:55:08.890 --> 01:55:14.970]
Great. Good for you. So, you know, I didn't only listen to A.M. I think your humor is classic.

[01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:20.770]
You're one of a kind. You'll work every penny they pay you. And I had my macarony and cheese

[01:55:20.770 --> 01:55:25.550]
today, so if I have caution, both I can stress. Oh, great. You're definitely going to

[01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:30.130]
purgatory now. Oh, yeah. Really? Anyway, I'm on vacation in the teacher's. So it's the first time I

[01:55:30.130 --> 01:55:34.130]
really got to pull you off. Well, God bless you. Anyway, I want to call someone to be back. Yes?

[01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:40.150]
Michael Moraney, your be back. Okay. Okay. Have a happy. Boy boy. See you. Bye.

[01:55:40.630 --> 01:55:46.270]
Open line of day at 629-463. One and Broward, 767-W.I.D. Now we've got to run our women. We've got

[01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:52.930]
75,000 women on the line. Here's a lady in sunrise. Hello. Hello. This is a lady in sunrise.

[01:55:53.430 --> 01:56:00.010]
Oh, this is a kid. Oh, I'm a boy. I started listening to you guys a couple of weeks ago.

[01:56:00.190 --> 01:56:06.310]
Yes, sir. And now I bring my radio to school. Now you're talking. And I do that. And all my friends

[01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:10.830]
gather around after the lessons have been taught. It's pretty cool. All right. They're going to learn

[01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:14.550]
a lot more on this show that we'll let stupid schoolers. What school do you go to? What school do you go to?

[01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:25.370]
I go to a school down in Fort Lauderdale. It's called Sunset. Sunset. It's like a kind of private school.

[01:56:25.530 --> 01:56:30.230]
So the teachers don't really like it. Yeah. Bring the radio. Oh, they don't like the radio? No.

[01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:33.230]
Tom Too Bad. Tom to mind their own business. Tom it's America and you'll listen to whatever

[01:56:33.230 --> 01:56:39.730]
you want and they'll like it. Okay, pal. All right. Thank you. Keep it up. Okay. We have, look at us.

[01:56:39.810 --> 01:56:43.410]
Now we're starting to like die a little bit here. We're starting to slide. We're backslide. We've had

[01:56:43.410 --> 01:56:48.430]
a fantastic Friday here. Almost everybody's out of school to teach us. You're off this kid is off.

[01:56:49.370 --> 01:56:53.070]
All these kids, they take the radios to school, man, because they know that if they want to hear

[01:56:53.070 --> 01:56:56.470]
something, they might get a little amusement out of they might learn something about the real world.

[01:56:56.670 --> 01:57:01.230]
Instead of all the lies, all the brainwashing, all the inundating their little minds with bullcrap.

[01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:06.490]
This is the only place to hear the truth. Here's the only man with balls in his town is right there

[01:57:06.490 --> 01:57:11.750]
that fat fag knee arrangers on a radio. That's the guy that'll tell it like it is. Oh, well,

[01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:16.290]
cult members were very nice people here. They were crazy. You're that a bed bug. Okay. They're

[01:57:16.290 --> 01:57:22.030]
eating jello pudding. First of all, I rest my case. They're watching Old Bill Cosby reruns

[01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:26.170]
and eating jello pudding. Does that tell you how crazy they are and eat an apple sauce?

[01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:35.290]
And amphetamines. I don't wish barbiterates, but it's much more fun to say amphetamines killed all

[01:57:35.290 --> 01:57:43.130]
of those bastards. We have an open line at Broward 7679463 767WID. We had a story yesterday, I think,

[01:57:43.670 --> 01:57:47.570]
about some poor bastard that croaked found a whole bunch of fendfin on their bed of Christ,

[01:57:47.650 --> 01:57:54.510]
they got hit by a truck. But I don't think there was no coincidence myself. Here's a lady on a

[01:57:54.510 --> 01:58:02.790]
mobile in Pompano. Hello. Lady mobile is gone. The lady mobile in Pompano that we're paying for

[01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:10.010]
on mobile one's dime is gone and did not hold on that fucking bitch. Exactly. Open line in the mobile

[01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:15.390]
one line, Pound IOD. She's got some nerve that bitch. We have an open line at day at 6222WID and

[01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:21.710]
one in Broward 7679463 767. It's all request good Friday and are we having one damn good time,

[01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:27.990]
damn good time. Where's God, Sham God when he need him, huh? Yeah, that's another thing that whole

[01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:32.870]
business about that business, that monkey business, yeah, just wait. Here's a bokeh. Hello.

[01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:39.810]
Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. I was watching the game last night and the preview in Denise Potman,

[01:58:39.810 --> 01:58:45.150]
the In Your Body Rimmer. They announced that the dancers have officially clenched the spot and

[01:58:45.150 --> 01:58:50.530]
the playoffs. That is correct. And then Dennis says he goes, but they're not content with that.

[01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:55.570]
They've got their sights on Buffalo. Now what good would having their sights on Buffalo do?

[01:58:55.570 --> 01:59:00.090]
Another in-an comment because Buffalo's going to win the division. They're going to be the

[01:59:00.090 --> 01:59:04.970]
number two seed no matter how many points we've got. And anybody, anybody that understands anything

[01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:09.390]
about the game knows that, but of course that leaves out Denise. Exactly. Isn't that another

[01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:14.650]
in a series of classically in-an comments by Don't Call Me Denise Potman, unbelievable.

[01:59:15.130 --> 01:59:18.730]
I feel really, really, really, fucking. And so do we. Haven't listened all that crap.

[01:59:19.230 --> 01:59:24.770]
Could you play the stew barn song without stew? Without stew. I just might have to.

[01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:30.290]
See a pal back. We're going to beat Buffalo out no matter what tell we do. Get out of that

[01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:31.110]
division or be okay.

[02:00:00.110 --> 02:00:01.990]
We can't win.

[02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:05.930]
There's no winning soon stage.

[02:00:05.930 --> 02:00:09.030]
Right. It's too. We can't win.

[02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:13.630]
We can't score anymore.

[02:00:14.930 --> 02:00:16.790]
We can't win.

[02:00:18.590 --> 02:00:20.610]
There's no winning since they trade it.

[02:00:20.610 --> 02:00:22.910]
We can't win.

[02:00:25.330 --> 02:00:27.570]
We can't score anymore.

[02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:37.870]
Since the day they set stews leaving, well performance as us heavings, but the powers that

[02:00:37.870 --> 02:00:39.710]
we've had to say is big.

[02:00:40.130 --> 02:00:41.470]
And fast.

[02:00:42.650 --> 02:00:46.230]
The record shows he can't score goals.

[02:00:46.330 --> 02:00:47.870]
They're full of ra.

[02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:52.850]
They can kiss my hand.

[02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:54.390]
Right.

[02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:59.130]
We can't win.

[02:01:01.410 --> 02:01:03.470]
There's no winning since they trade it.

[02:01:05.370 --> 02:01:06.250]
We can't win.

[02:01:08.050 --> 02:01:10.370]
We can't score anymore.

[02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:13.810]
Oh.

[02:01:14.130 --> 02:01:14.130]

[02:01:17.890 --> 02:01:20.730]
Well, you know, we're trying to get it on the man. We made a great shot.

[02:01:20.930 --> 02:01:22.810]
It turned out to be a beautiful play.

[02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:25.670]
There's a man with some chees back in his shot at one.

[02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:26.370]
We're about to re-bounce.

[02:01:26.370 --> 02:01:29.390]
Oh, my barn's right there to title again again.

[02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:29.850]
I'm going to get free.

[02:01:30.610 --> 02:01:31.970]
The barn's going to land around.

[02:01:32.210 --> 02:01:33.030]
And he keeps going.

[02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:35.310]
He's going to land again.

[02:01:35.530 --> 02:01:36.530]
I'm going to fucking down.

[02:01:41.490 --> 02:01:43.330]
Okay, it's 1243 at W.I.

[02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:45.870]
What is this? Somebody sent me a video, Empire of Crime.

[02:01:46.210 --> 02:01:47.330]
Did we talk about this on the air?

[02:01:47.470 --> 02:01:49.190]
Did somebody threaten to send this?

[02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:50.750]
Well, here it is. Empire of Crime.

[02:01:51.250 --> 02:01:53.890]
And I'm going to go in the other room and watch it right now and screw everybody else.

[02:01:54.490 --> 02:01:55.710]
Two open lines in day.

[02:01:55.710 --> 02:01:59.030]
Six two two nine four six three six two two two W.I.O.D.

[02:01:59.430 --> 02:02:00.950]
And one in Broward seven six seven.

[02:02:01.690 --> 02:02:03.790]
After a very scintillating start, they're all in church now.

[02:02:03.870 --> 02:02:05.570]
Is that when did they go to church on Good Friday at noon?

[02:02:05.950 --> 02:02:07.630]
Is everybody good off at noon? They go to church at noon?

[02:02:07.970 --> 02:02:09.610]
They eat their macaroni and cheese and tuna fish at noon?

[02:02:09.870 --> 02:02:11.210]
The Pope changes his dress at noon?

[02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:14.650]
The Pope does his mightest muffler routine at noon?

[02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:15.790]
What are they doing over there?

[02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:18.350]
Anyway, I'll tell you what they're doing at Lorenzo's.

[02:02:18.370 --> 02:02:20.770]
They be celebrating and they wish you a very happy and healthy Easter.

[02:02:21.650 --> 02:02:23.150]
Don't roll too many. Eggs either.

[02:02:23.150 --> 02:02:26.050]
Six ten W.I.O.D.

[02:02:26.630 --> 02:02:27.850]
Wind lightning is coming.

[02:02:28.530 --> 02:02:30.010]
Here at your first.

[02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:33.030]
Here's a reward out of pedophile.

[02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:39.450]
Each year thousands of children are either killed or maimed needlessly by lighting fire.

[02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:42.210]
This is no laughing matter.

[02:02:42.410 --> 02:02:47.070]
A little boy in Brooklyn, New York accidentally sucked in the flame and inflowed it.

[02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:51.430]
His calling was found three blocks from his house.

[02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:57.230]
During a Maryland Manson concert as fans lit their lighters in traditional concert tribute.

[02:02:57.630 --> 02:03:02.750]
A teenager from Petaluma, California thought he'd won up the audience.

[02:03:03.170 --> 02:03:08.690]
Just as his friend bent over and let one lift, he lit his ribo in close proximity to the buttock area.

[02:03:10.370 --> 02:03:15.630]
However, most of the crowd thought the explosion was part of the lightsauk.

[02:03:15.630 --> 02:03:21.750]
The two suffered severe burns over his face and neck, requiring painful grafts of pig skin,

[02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:25.410]
which caused untold grief for his orthodox Jewish parents.

[02:03:26.690 --> 02:03:33.010]
Sure, farts can be funny, especially at school or during a wedding, but they can also be deadly.

[02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:35.170]
This message is brought to you by Mel.

[02:03:35.770 --> 02:03:37.150]
Mother's against lighting parts.

[02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:40.310]
Remember, friends don't let friends light farts.

[02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:42.050]
Friends don't let friends fart.

[02:03:42.130 --> 02:03:43.890]
I'll tell you that 1249 to W.I.

[02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:45.210]
Decorities is only one way to do that.

[02:03:45.210 --> 02:03:47.370]
Good cork in the rectum always works for a while.

[02:03:48.410 --> 02:03:48.970]
Here's one.

[02:03:49.090 --> 02:03:49.810]
My name is Jimmy.

[02:03:50.110 --> 02:03:52.810]
I've lost 53 pounds on a Atkins misspell.

[02:03:53.010 --> 02:03:53.650]
Okay, Jimmy.

[02:03:58.710 --> 02:03:59.510]
Oh, squirt.

[02:03:59.710 --> 02:04:00.110]
Squirt.

[02:04:00.210 --> 02:04:00.710]
I like that.

[02:04:00.850 --> 02:04:01.030]
Squirt.

[02:04:01.150 --> 02:04:02.050]
He must know Mikey.

[02:04:02.290 --> 02:04:03.470]
How's Mikey doing, by the way?

[02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:06.690]
By the way, in case anybody wants to know I'm going to work on Waxie,

[02:04:06.690 --> 02:04:08.470]
I'm going to be the newsman on a micro-neary show.

[02:04:09.170 --> 02:04:10.430]
Henry Barrow passed out.

[02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:11.790]
He can't do it no more.

[02:04:12.110 --> 02:04:12.770]
And the news either.

[02:04:13.670 --> 02:04:19.350]
Two open lines in date, 6229-463-622-W-I-O-D.

[02:04:19.410 --> 02:04:20.190]
I'm not going to mess with this.

[02:04:21.010 --> 02:04:21.590]
It's phony.

[02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:23.190]
This is the thing that you gave me away.

[02:04:23.310 --> 02:04:24.450]
I'm not going to waste my time with that.

[02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:27.410]
Guys, a major asshole obviously needs a serious life.

[02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:29.170]
And I hope that you might meet police fries ass.

[02:04:29.410 --> 02:04:30.650]
I hope fire comes out of his head.

[02:04:30.670 --> 02:04:31.790]
Okay, it's a message from God.

[02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:35.670]
I hope that flames come shooting out of your head or out of your rectum or both.

[02:04:36.690 --> 02:04:38.170]
Here's a mobile and Delray Beach.

[02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.410]
Hello.

[02:04:38.710 --> 02:04:39.790]
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

[02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:40.250]
Great.

[02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:41.570]
Two things.

[02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:42.270]
Stumpy.

[02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:42.850]
No.

[02:04:43.330 --> 02:04:43.870]
Stumpy, Jr.

[02:04:44.170 --> 02:04:44.410]
No.

[02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:45.330]
It's not?

[02:04:45.590 --> 02:04:45.830]
No.

[02:04:46.250 --> 02:04:46.530]
Okay.

[02:04:47.970 --> 02:04:51.950]
Anyway, I'm a coach with a hockey, uh, roller hockey league.

[02:04:52.290 --> 02:04:52.490]
Yeah.

[02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:57.970]
And the first thing I teach my kids when you're a defenseman is you don't play with the puck in your own zone.

[02:04:58.410 --> 02:04:59.610]
Don't play with it in your own end.

[02:04:59.730 --> 02:05:02.590]
Would someone please relay a message to Edge over now?

[02:05:04.890 --> 02:05:07.250]
I mean, the guy, I don't stand.

[02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:10.010]
I just don't understand what his problem is.

[02:05:10.250 --> 02:05:14.410]
Number one, number two, Rimo was having an orgasm last night with this, uh,

[02:05:14.650 --> 02:05:15.690]
Chris Wells got the assist.

[02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:16.090]
Yeah.

[02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:17.410]
I saw that.

[02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:18.750]
What a pass.

[02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:19.750]
Who's a beautiful pass.

[02:05:19.850 --> 02:05:21.130]
What a set up by Wells.

[02:05:21.350 --> 02:05:22.070]
What a blast.

[02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.470]
Yeah.

[02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:25.070]
I heard his name more than anybody else's name in the whole game.

[02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.490]
Yeah.

[02:05:25.650 --> 02:05:26.050]
I'm stable.

[02:05:26.290 --> 02:05:27.390]
You know, I don't understand.

[02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:29.810]
But, well, I don't know.

[02:05:29.890 --> 02:05:30.690]
I'm going crazy.

[02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:31.390]
Goodbye.

[02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:32.190]
Okay.

[02:05:34.190 --> 02:05:37.290]
See the guys trying to confuse back the fiction and the...

[02:05:37.290 --> 02:05:39.710]
Does Jeff Rimmer, Chris Wells, be high?

[02:05:40.170 --> 02:05:40.590]
Boy.

[02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:44.730]
Does he have a reason for defending this guy?

[02:05:45.290 --> 02:05:48.830]
He's constantly falling and the puck he can find.

[02:05:49.290 --> 02:05:51.870]
Does Jeff Rimmer, Chris Wells, be high?

[02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.710]
Okay.

[02:05:53.110 --> 02:05:57.310]
And ever since they've traded stores, they've been playing real prolly.

[02:05:57.310 --> 02:06:01.370]
The reason they gave was to save the team money.

[02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.770]
Are you?

[02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:05.390]
We know that Chris may be a pretty nice guy.

[02:06:05.670 --> 02:06:09.350]
Buddy, tuples and he stumbles and trips on the flu night.

[02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:12.350]
Is this the best at Ryan Murray can find?

[02:06:13.810 --> 02:06:17.550]
The teams in the Coles and they'll never say why.

[02:06:18.150 --> 02:06:19.710]
Defending his eans.

[02:06:19.730 --> 02:06:21.730]
He hits you die all the time.

[02:06:22.110 --> 02:06:24.650]
Does Jeff Rimmer, Chris Wells, be high?

[02:06:25.970 --> 02:06:26.330]
Yeah!

[02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:27.290]
Okay.

[02:06:27.550 --> 02:06:29.250]
It's a 12-52 at WIOD.

[02:06:29.590 --> 02:06:31.950]
We have an open line in Dave County for your perusal now.

[02:06:32.530 --> 02:06:34.850]
If you'd like to call in and save mankind from itself.

[02:06:35.150 --> 02:06:37.810]
If you'd like to call here and explain to us why these people off themselves

[02:06:37.810 --> 02:06:43.110]
with putting in Apple, Sous and Barb Richards and a partridge in a pair of three

[02:06:43.110 --> 02:06:46.730]
and plastic garbage bags and why they had the Nike swish on their sneakers.

[02:06:47.650 --> 02:06:49.830]
And if they were all really serious or not.

[02:06:52.630 --> 02:06:55.370]
Unfreeking believable and yet the public sits out there.

[02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:56.730]
They just, they can't see it.

[02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:57.490]
Oh, thank goodness.

[02:06:57.630 --> 02:07:00.350]
In fact, I guarantee all these people going to church today for good Friday.

[02:07:00.590 --> 02:07:03.330]
And the minister of the priest or whoever the Getzki gets up there and he says,

[02:07:03.330 --> 02:07:05.190]
well, this is a horrendous thing.

[02:07:05.230 --> 02:07:08.690]
Another example of these cults and the perversion of real belief in God.

[02:07:08.690 --> 02:07:09.690]
You had a rare right.

[02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:13.610]
It's a classic example of what all the bubble mice is they're all about.

[02:07:13.890 --> 02:07:14.910]
It's lunacy, man.

[02:07:15.170 --> 02:07:16.170]
It's insanity.

[02:07:18.970 --> 02:07:19.330]
Brainwashing.

[02:07:19.650 --> 02:07:22.650]
You see, it's much, it's much better instead of brainwashing people to drink

[02:07:22.650 --> 02:07:24.250]
cool aid and the cyanide, et cetera.

[02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:25.210]
Just give us your money.

[02:07:25.290 --> 02:07:25.850]
That's much better.

[02:07:26.050 --> 02:07:26.930]
Put some money into play.

[02:07:27.670 --> 02:07:30.590]
And just do what we tell you and don't do as we do, God forbid.

[02:07:30.970 --> 02:07:33.170]
Just do what we say and shut up and go home and make a lot of babies.

[02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:34.090]
Now you're talking.

[02:07:35.410 --> 02:07:36.850]
Here's a mobile in Hylia. Hello.

[02:07:37.290 --> 02:07:38.270]
Hey, Neil. How you doing?

[02:07:38.370 --> 02:07:40.590]
Great. I have a question on the panthers.

[02:07:41.130 --> 02:07:45.430]
Is it just my imagination or are they changing their entire dial of play?

[02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:49.850]
No. They used to dump it run and just pushing that hard.

[02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:52.810]
And now they're trying to be real fancy with the puck and it's no.

[02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.550]
Like it hurts them.

[02:07:53.710 --> 02:07:53.890]
Yeah.

[02:07:55.130 --> 02:07:58.650]
And I don't understand why don't they go back to work out the more they are.

[02:07:58.730 --> 02:08:00.990]
We'll go out into the family couple because they don't have the same.

[02:08:01.110 --> 02:08:03.570]
There's just not the same thing out there.

[02:08:03.610 --> 02:08:09.070]
It's just not the same feeling that you don't have the this team isn't playing like they're on fire most of the time.

[02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:10.370]
Which they were all about.

[02:08:10.490 --> 02:08:11.910]
Keep in mind, keep something in mind.

[02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:14.370]
They got hot right at playoff time last year.

[02:08:14.370 --> 02:08:16.190]
Okay, they were struggling right before the playoffs.

[02:08:16.250 --> 02:08:17.810]
They got out just at the right time.

[02:08:17.810 --> 02:08:19.750]
They started out phenomenal this year.

[02:08:19.770 --> 02:08:22.110]
Then they made that stupid, stupid, idiotic trade.

[02:08:22.150 --> 02:08:22.470]
Okay.

[02:08:22.710 --> 02:08:24.050]
And we were stumbling and bubbling.

[02:08:24.250 --> 02:08:26.050]
Then we got all these injuries on top of it.

[02:08:26.090 --> 02:08:27.190]
And we're still stumbling and bubbling.

[02:08:27.450 --> 02:08:30.310]
So this team don't be too surprised if when the playoffs start.

[02:08:30.550 --> 02:08:31.570]
We shock you again.

[02:08:31.650 --> 02:08:32.910]
I mean, maybe it's wishful thinking.

[02:08:33.230 --> 02:08:34.350]
But you never know where these guys.

[02:08:34.530 --> 02:08:36.430]
But right at the right at the moment, they're in a coma.

[02:08:36.750 --> 02:08:37.570]
They're in a coma.

[02:08:37.930 --> 02:08:38.130]
Right.

[02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.990]
There's no spark.

[02:08:39.330 --> 02:08:42.090]
I want to see them rush that and get pounded hard.

[02:08:42.090 --> 02:08:45.030]
And I'm going to tell you, well, they may be pounding at a heart, but not through in the game.

[02:08:45.230 --> 02:08:48.430]
And the bottom line is that without a guy like Barnes or Straca out of the lineup,

[02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:52.050]
which I pray he and Rani, they might have been bet well, at least Straca Saturday.

[02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:53.890]
There's no offense.

[02:08:53.890 --> 02:08:56.170]
You got Ray Shepherd and Melon B's also in a coma.

[02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:57.550]
You got Ray Shepherd, basically.

[02:08:57.550 --> 02:08:58.310]
That's the offense.

[02:08:58.610 --> 02:08:59.390]
Yeah, I agree with you.

[02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:01.010]
They'll talk for the best.

[02:09:01.210 --> 02:09:02.770]
Let's light a fire under their thing.

[02:09:03.130 --> 02:09:03.730]
Okay, pal.

[02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:04.410]
See you.

[02:09:04.830 --> 02:09:05.550]
That's what we need.

[02:09:05.670 --> 02:09:06.790]
We need Marty back out there.

[02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:09.490]
Okay, so he doesn't score a lot of goals, but he makes things happen.

[02:09:11.230 --> 02:09:13.070]
That's what we need is some chances, man.

[02:09:13.230 --> 02:09:16.850]
Well, the first period last night shots were what 14 to two for Ottawa.

[02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:18.230]
14 to two.

[02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:20.010]
What kind of a period is that?

[02:09:20.370 --> 02:09:20.910]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[02:09:21.230 --> 02:09:22.290]
Squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt.

[02:09:23.410 --> 02:09:24.550]
Open line of day at six.

[02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:25.590]
Well, you didn't see the facts.

[02:09:25.850 --> 02:09:27.050]
622 W.Y.O.D.

[02:09:27.150 --> 02:09:27.670]
What in Broward?

[02:09:28.430 --> 02:09:29.230]
7679 463.

[02:09:29.950 --> 02:09:31.570]
7677 W.I.O.D.

[02:09:32.230 --> 02:09:33.650]
Let's take a bunch of amphetamines.

[02:09:33.850 --> 02:09:34.070]
Okay.

[02:09:34.570 --> 02:09:36.330]
Get our pulse up to about 180.

[02:09:37.410 --> 02:09:38.350]
Here's the lady in Miami.

[02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:38.690]
Hello.

[02:09:39.590 --> 02:09:40.250]
Hi, Neil.

[02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:40.690]
How are you?

[02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:41.250]
Okay.

[02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:45.370]
Listen, I'm calling about what's her name last night after Brooke.

[02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:46.910]
Okay, here finally.

[02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:49.850]
It only took me almost three hours to get a call about Erin, the Karen Kay.

[02:09:50.170 --> 02:09:50.630]
Listen, I'm...

[02:09:50.630 --> 02:09:52.230]
You want to sleep in with the consultant, yes?

[02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:55.430]
I was a big, rainy road fan and I'd love Brooke.

[02:09:56.210 --> 02:09:56.490]
Wow!

[02:09:58.050 --> 02:10:00.970]
And this woman just comes on at 9 o'clock and I'm going.

[02:10:01.090 --> 02:10:01.990]
What the heck's going on?

[02:10:02.810 --> 02:10:07.630]
And all of a sudden, I had dinner at Dayland and I went all the way to Colourage

[02:10:07.630 --> 02:10:08.970]
and she was on and on.

[02:10:09.130 --> 02:10:10.350]
She didn't get off of that subject.

[02:10:11.010 --> 02:10:15.090]
Listen, it took us 40 minutes to drive home from the hockey game.

[02:10:15.330 --> 02:10:17.350]
That's the only thing I heard you're talking about.

[02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:19.350]
She kept repeating it over and over again.

[02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:22.330]
And why is everybody so worked up into a frenzy that I'm sleeping with a consultant?

[02:10:22.670 --> 02:10:23.790]
And Walter Sabo is a wonderful guy.

[02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:25.170]
But I mean, nobody cares.

[02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:26.430]
We don't care, okay?

[02:10:26.690 --> 02:10:27.630]
It was so sad.

[02:10:28.710 --> 02:10:29.010]
It was so sad.

[02:10:29.310 --> 02:10:30.890]
I really did feel sorry for her.

[02:10:31.670 --> 02:10:33.190]
And I hope I don't know.

[02:10:33.950 --> 02:10:35.010]
I love Brooke.

[02:10:35.550 --> 02:10:37.050]
I'm going to work on till midnight.

[02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.950]
She's a dog bit.

[02:10:37.970 --> 02:10:39.970]
Six to midnight sounds like an ice shift for me.

[02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:40.570]
Yeah, right?

[02:10:40.990 --> 02:10:42.190]
I'd like to call...

[02:10:42.190 --> 02:10:43.710]
Let her work a little bit of that flap off.

[02:10:43.850 --> 02:10:44.590]
I mean...

[02:10:45.410 --> 02:10:46.190]
Here's a bit.

[02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:46.670]
I know.

[02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:49.110]
Can I call some people this bad?

[02:10:49.210 --> 02:10:49.850]
Be my guest.

[02:10:50.130 --> 02:10:52.450]
Jackie Alexis Erica and Sandra D'Aldo.

[02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.570]
Love you.

[02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:54.490]
What was the last one?

[02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:55.210]
Salvador.

[02:10:55.710 --> 02:10:55.990]
Salvador.

[02:10:56.590 --> 02:10:57.510]
I like it.

[02:10:57.630 --> 02:10:58.010]
Okay.

[02:10:58.590 --> 02:10:59.350]
Have a nice weekend.

[02:11:00.610 --> 02:11:01.050]
Bonjournal.

[02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:02.530]
See ya.

[02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:04.330]
Uh, let's see.

[02:11:04.490 --> 02:11:06.790]
Feliz Estero.

[02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:08.810]
Estero is east.

[02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:10.870]
Happy east.

[02:11:11.370 --> 02:11:11.550]
Er.

[02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:13.310]
Two open lines in day.

[02:11:13.410 --> 02:11:14.550]
Six to two nine four six.

[02:11:14.630 --> 02:11:15.870]
How do you say Easter and Spaniol?

[02:11:16.290 --> 02:11:16.570]
Pasqua.

[02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.870]
What the hell?

[02:11:17.890 --> 02:11:18.370]
What is that?

[02:11:18.590 --> 02:11:19.030]
Pasqua.

[02:11:19.170 --> 02:11:19.350]
Whatever.

[02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:20.490]
Feliz Pasqua.

[02:11:21.210 --> 02:11:21.930]
Sure, okay.

[02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:25.090]
Feliz Ojo Deano Pasqua.

[02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:27.190]
Two lines in day and county.

[02:11:27.190 --> 02:11:27.730]

We're still waiting.

[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:15.170]

[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:15.170]

[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:15.170]

[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:15.170]

[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:15.170]

[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:15.170]

[02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:15.170]

We're still waiting.

[02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.810]

We're still waiting.

[02:12:36.770 --> 02:12:37.230]
We're still waiting.

[02:12:37.610 --> 02:12:38.630]
We're still waiting.

We're still waiting.

[02:12:49.710 --> 02:12:50.030]
We're still waiting.

[02:12:50.130 --> 02:12:50.470]
We're still waiting.

[02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.470]

[02:12:50.910 --> 02:12:52.930]
We're still waiting.

[02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:57.070]
We're still waiting.

[02:12:57.070 --> 02:12:57.330]
We're still waiting.

[02:12:57.330 --> 02:12:57.330]

[02:12:57.330 --> 02:12:57.510]
We're still waiting.

[02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.510]

[02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.510]

[02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.510]

[02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.510]

[02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.510]

[02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.510]

[02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.510]

[02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:58.510]
Roy!

[02:13:11.230 --> 02:13:13.690]
I'm Lee and I'll do you.

[02:13:14.910 --> 02:13:18.430]
I've had lots of money in the bank.

[02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:21.310]
A new England's a go-in like Roy.

[02:13:21.670 --> 02:13:26.610]
I'd have a radio network that nobody carries.

[02:13:27.010 --> 02:13:29.610]
But everyone has to run the spots.

[02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:30.670]
I'll be first in a while.

[02:13:31.130 --> 02:13:35.550]
TV cable, real estate, I would own.

[02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:40.230]
I'd have a half a dozen.

[02:13:40.370 --> 02:13:45.650]
Big FM stations and 607 AM stations too.

[02:13:46.690 --> 02:13:51.890]
And that's just in hell and there la la la.

[02:13:54.570 --> 02:14:01.550]
If I was but Texan, yeah, la la la la la la la la la la.

[02:14:02.730 --> 02:14:06.710]
Old day long guy fiddle with my knob.

[02:14:06.710 --> 02:14:13.430]
If I was my Texan's boy, I'd be the real hankster for math.

[02:14:13.650 --> 02:14:17.870]
The other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the bigger.

[02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:22.650]
I've had shakles, you know what I mean.

[02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:26.790]
I'd be richer than the freaking queen.

[02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:30.850]
Wayne High Zanger would be burning cream.

[02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:33.850]
If I was that Texan boy.

[02:14:34.330 --> 02:14:34.770]
Roy!

[02:14:35.370 --> 02:14:39.130]
104 at W-I-O-D. Jim Scholar, God, that's all I can say.

[02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:42.870]
Let's do a mobile in Pompano and it's big one and two hour man.

[02:14:42.970 --> 02:14:46.050]
This hour you're going to be, I'm telling you, this hour is going to set you on your ass.

[02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:47.850]
Make no mistake about it. I can just feel it.

[02:14:48.010 --> 02:14:51.410]
You can feel a gigantic something welling up in the pit of your stomach, can't you?

[02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:55.250]
Maybe it was that great lunch from the All American subshop.

[02:14:56.650 --> 02:14:57.750]
Did I get it right this time?

[02:14:59.410 --> 02:15:02.210]
Why do I have a problem with that? That's like not an unusual name.

[02:15:02.210 --> 02:15:06.450]
I just have a real serial problem. Get serious.

[02:15:07.050 --> 02:15:11.010]
I wonder if they have one on serious. Here's a mobile in somewhere. Hello, Pompano.

[02:15:11.410 --> 02:15:13.130]
Nail. Yes, sir. How are you?

[02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:14.650]
Great. Happy Easter.

[02:15:15.010 --> 02:15:16.350]
Happy Purim. Okay.

[02:15:16.770 --> 02:15:20.630]
Notice how Purim and Easter in face-offs are so close together. What is it?

[02:15:21.190 --> 02:15:23.890]
I went to my third Panther game of the year last night.

[02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:26.810]
Yeah. And the last game I went through was a shark.

[02:15:27.450 --> 02:15:29.290]
I remember how that game turned out.

[02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:35.250]
Yeah. And last night Ottawa, that was the stink of manure in the place was pretty bad.

[02:15:35.390 --> 02:15:35.570]
Yeah.

[02:15:36.570 --> 02:15:37.250]
Awful game.

[02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:40.250]
I'm glad you mentioned that by the way because where is it?

[02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:47.850]
A stench of cow manure covers over this performance by the Panthers.

[02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:51.090]
Yes. That was pathetic. There were three guys that tried the whole night.

[02:15:51.090 --> 02:15:52.010]
I thought it was pretty good, man.

[02:15:52.810 --> 02:15:56.710]
Besides Beezard, Lindsey, Lousa, Warner, the only guys even trying to skate.

[02:15:57.050 --> 02:15:57.190]
Yeah.

[02:15:57.730 --> 02:15:59.190]
Oh, God. I was frustrated.

[02:15:59.230 --> 02:16:01.490]
It was ugly. It was an ugly thing, man. It was terminal.

[02:16:02.350 --> 02:16:03.590]
I don't know what to say.

[02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:05.370]
So, all right. Get out of our system now.

[02:16:05.590 --> 02:16:08.150]
We'll get these last few games over there. We'll be smoking them during the playoffs.

[02:16:08.530 --> 02:16:09.310]
We got everybody back.

[02:16:09.410 --> 02:16:09.450]
I'll hold the cup.

[02:16:09.770 --> 02:16:10.830]
Yep. Okay.

[02:16:10.970 --> 02:16:12.050]
Okay, pal. Good luck to us.

[02:16:12.250 --> 02:16:13.090]
And back to you.

[02:16:13.330 --> 02:16:15.110]
Open line of day. That's right. Garper Loth will be back.

[02:16:15.190 --> 02:16:16.990]
Maybe Robby will butcher up a little bit, but I doubt it.

[02:16:17.290 --> 02:16:19.890]
And of course, Marty's going to be back. Marty's going to be the catalyst.

[02:16:19.890 --> 02:16:23.490]
He's going to surprise everybody, including the coaches busy getting his wife a necklace.

[02:16:24.430 --> 02:16:26.030]
He's going out to buy her a necklace.

[02:16:26.410 --> 02:16:27.810]
And of course, we've all heard that spot.

[02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:30.930]
We do love our friends at Beverly's Jewelers, but I didn't know they sold necklaces.

[02:16:31.130 --> 02:16:31.310]
Did you?

[02:16:32.670 --> 02:16:33.770]
How about shoelaces?

[02:16:34.570 --> 02:16:35.930]
Here's Watson Island. Hello.

[02:16:36.490 --> 02:16:37.090]
Hey, Neil.

[02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:37.890]
Brand new home of the Parachungal.

[02:16:38.610 --> 02:16:38.810]
Hey, Neil.

[02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:39.590]
Home of a good year, Blimp.

[02:16:39.730 --> 02:16:40.510]
And the Parachungal.

[02:16:40.630 --> 02:16:41.430]
And how are you up there?

[02:16:41.610 --> 02:16:43.310]
Great. Yeah. Parachungal like Blimp.

[02:16:44.050 --> 02:16:46.090]
Who knows, right? It's up for grabs of the Denley.

[02:16:46.650 --> 02:16:47.970]
Listen, Neil. Shameless request.

[02:16:48.270 --> 02:16:48.450]
Yeah.

[02:16:48.450 --> 02:16:52.650]
You've got a tape with Jack Nicholson working a fast-food counter about chicken.

[02:16:53.210 --> 02:16:53.850]
Oh, geez.

[02:16:54.650 --> 02:16:55.230]
You're a ratchmin.

[02:16:55.430 --> 02:16:55.630]
OK.

[02:16:56.070 --> 02:16:59.250]
Two open lines in day six, two, two, nine, four, six, three, six, two, two, two, two, two,

[02:16:59.250 --> 02:17:00.410]
I didn't hear what he said.

[02:17:00.510 --> 02:17:01.290]
Did you? Didn't hear a word.

[02:17:01.530 --> 02:17:04.110]
We have an open line in Broward, seven, six, seven, nine, four, six, three.

[02:17:04.330 --> 02:17:04.930]
Something about you.

[02:17:04.930 --> 02:17:05.490]
You're a ratchmin.

[02:17:05.790 --> 02:17:07.330]
Let's go to a Palm Beach. Hello.

[02:17:07.930 --> 02:17:08.470]
Neil, how you doing?

[02:17:08.650 --> 02:17:08.830]
Great.

[02:17:09.690 --> 02:17:13.150]
Just called to give my two cents about the panthers last night.

[02:17:13.330 --> 02:17:15.090]
OK. Now all of a sudden, they're coming out of the woodwork.

[02:17:15.170 --> 02:17:16.610]
All these panther basures. Go ahead, sir.

[02:17:16.930 --> 02:17:17.470]
They deserve it.

[02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:22.870]
I've, I've, I've, first of all, I've seen that annoying puts in what, what, 124 is?

[02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:24.350]
Let's hear it about 124.

[02:17:24.450 --> 02:17:30.010]
I want a lot more calls from the 10 sane people who sit in 124 and aren't a bunch of sheep being led down the horse's ass.

[02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:32.530]
Oh, God. It all started last year with that rat.

[02:17:32.630 --> 02:17:32.850]
Right.

[02:17:33.170 --> 02:17:34.830]
Oh, I was willing to heal more and more with that.

[02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:35.990]
I mean, you guys was in his glory.

[02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.930]
We were having a good time.

[02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:38.690]
He was running around. He's stunk like hell.

[02:17:38.690 --> 02:17:41.090]
But I mean, you know, but now get on with life.

[02:17:41.090 --> 02:17:42.850]
I think the fans had done a great job.

[02:17:42.970 --> 02:17:43.930]
We don't throw the rats.

[02:17:43.930 --> 02:17:45.030]
We don't get to team penalties.

[02:17:45.490 --> 02:17:46.650]
Everybody's trying to control themselves.

[02:17:46.650 --> 02:17:51.630]
But this bunch of goofballs over there, they let this guy lead him around by the end of the nose like a bunch of lemons.

[02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:54.490]
And you think the peanut thing is bad in your section?

[02:17:54.670 --> 02:18:00.130]
Oh, this guy, this guy is the type that stands up screams and spills beer on people.

[02:18:00.210 --> 02:18:00.590]
Oh, nice.

[02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:01.090]
Yes.

[02:18:01.250 --> 02:18:03.170]
Nice. He's the best. He is the greatest.

[02:18:03.350 --> 02:18:05.810]
I say, let's ban his ass from the arenas, what I say.

[02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.910]
And go and let him go.

[02:18:07.010 --> 02:18:11.690]
If I didn't, you know how the, the, the mascot comes down the, what the hell do we call him?

[02:18:11.930 --> 02:18:13.470]
Stanley Stanley, see panther.

[02:18:13.490 --> 02:18:15.990]
How he comes down at wire there before the beginning of the game.

[02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:19.950]
I think we ought to let this guy try it once and cut the cord.

[02:18:20.050 --> 02:18:21.130]
Big set now you're talking.

[02:18:21.490 --> 02:18:23.230]
Now, let's move from one asshole to another.

[02:18:23.370 --> 02:18:24.850]
Did Mike Mayo ever write anything?

[02:18:25.250 --> 02:18:25.450]
No.

[02:18:25.690 --> 02:18:28.490]
Of course he had another big column today, which I got a right here.

[02:18:28.630 --> 02:18:31.430]
It's a column about some crap, which has nothing to do with anything.

[02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:35.270]
Hold the whole of left side of the front of the sports section.

[02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:39.210]
One word again, liar, liar pants on fire, man.

[02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:40.250]
His name ain't mosquits.

[02:18:40.330 --> 02:18:41.990]
I think he's the anti-Christ myself.

[02:18:42.510 --> 02:18:43.550]
And I'm good Friday.

[02:18:43.710 --> 02:18:44.650]
Yeah, how do you like that?

[02:18:44.970 --> 02:18:45.370]
Unbelieveable.

[02:18:45.370 --> 02:18:47.510]
David Halberstam, who everybody loves David.

[02:18:47.530 --> 02:18:49.670]
I never heard anybody say anything bad about Halberstam.

[02:18:49.670 --> 02:18:50.210]
They love him.

[02:18:50.390 --> 02:18:51.810]
He's a great guy. He does a good job.

[02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:52.250]
He's funny.

[02:18:52.370 --> 02:18:52.830]
He's amusing.

[02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:53.530]
He's colorful.

[02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:57.290]
And this, this maniac over there, the sun sent him lied to us.

[02:18:57.290 --> 02:19:00.830]
He made a blood oath right on the ear here to apologize and retract.

[02:19:00.990 --> 02:19:02.370]
I say retract this.

[02:19:02.510 --> 02:19:02.830]
Reckoam.

[02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:03.070]
Exactly.

[02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:05.450]
Can you play a little something for him?

[02:19:05.450 --> 02:19:06.250]
Anything you want, pal.

[02:19:06.370 --> 02:19:07.350]
Star Wars can't teen up.

[02:19:07.350 --> 02:19:07.870]
You got it.

[02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.250]
Thank you.

[02:19:08.390 --> 02:19:08.930]
Have a great life.

[02:19:09.130 --> 02:19:11.450]
So, oh, I bet that's not in here, though.

[02:19:11.490 --> 02:19:12.470]
Do I have to get the thing out?

[02:19:12.590 --> 02:19:13.250]
Oh, geez.

[02:19:13.710 --> 02:19:14.530]
Oh, I'll do it.

[02:19:14.530 --> 02:19:16.030]
Because he's a good, good guy.

[02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:17.510]
He's a good guy.

[02:19:17.570 --> 02:19:18.250]
That guy right there.

[02:19:18.350 --> 02:19:19.370]
He sounded like a real American.

[02:19:19.510 --> 02:19:21.390]
Okay, he sounded like he might not have looked too bad either.

[02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:23.550]
We have an open line in Broward, 7, 6, 7.

[02:19:23.630 --> 02:19:24.770]
How do you know that he might not have looked bad?

[02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:25.130]
I don't know.

[02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:29.390]
Because people here buy voices on here and they think they know how somebody looks.

[02:19:29.630 --> 02:19:31.470]
For example, would you know how what's his name looked?

[02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:32.490]
What is his name?

[02:19:33.090 --> 02:19:33.330]
Jacob.

[02:19:33.610 --> 02:19:35.010]
You wouldn't know what Del Jacob looked like.

[02:19:35.850 --> 02:19:36.150]
Uh-oh.

[02:19:36.630 --> 02:19:37.510]
Look at that, George.

[02:19:37.650 --> 02:19:39.250]
I think I lost my plastic thing.

[02:19:39.930 --> 02:19:43.150]
Oh, if I lost my plastic thing, what am I going to do now?

[02:19:45.290 --> 02:19:47.290]
I think I lost my plastic thing, man.

[02:19:47.970 --> 02:19:48.410]
That's real.

[02:19:48.550 --> 02:19:49.050]
Oh, here it is.

[02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.950]
Here's my plastic thing.

[02:19:50.050 --> 02:19:51.150]
I found my plastic thing.

[02:19:51.310 --> 02:19:52.930]
Very Jackson can put it in your column.

[02:19:52.930 --> 02:19:54.650]
Neal found his plastic thing, okay?

[02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:58.170]
Which number do you think it's on?

[02:19:58.210 --> 02:20:00.350]
I know it's cut number 17, but which one do you think it's on?

[02:20:00.750 --> 02:20:01.490]
Oh, I got it.

[02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:02.330]
What a great job.

[02:20:03.170 --> 02:20:03.890]
Quarenta Novi.

[02:20:05.490 --> 02:20:05.850]
What?

[02:20:06.190 --> 02:20:06.750]
That was right.

[02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:09.970]
That's in a Quarenta Nueve or Quarenta Novi.

[02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:11.710]
See how similar they are?

[02:20:11.710 --> 02:20:13.590]
And if you start seeing Nueve and you speak the time,

[02:20:13.650 --> 02:20:14.570]
they'll slap you right in the post.

[02:20:14.850 --> 02:20:16.750]
Pope will come over there and slap you right up side of the head

[02:20:16.750 --> 02:20:18.250]
and say, cut the crap.

[02:20:18.490 --> 02:20:18.610]
He ain't Italian.

[02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:18.890]
Huh?

[02:20:19.470 --> 02:20:19.890]
He ain't Italian.

[02:20:20.050 --> 02:20:20.510]
What does he care?

[02:20:21.010 --> 02:20:21.710]
The Poloq.

[02:20:22.330 --> 02:20:24.190]
He speaks 14 languages, none of them right.

[02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:25.110]
Exactly.

[02:20:25.810 --> 02:20:29.050]
And he speaks them all with an accent to it's all with a Jewish accent.

[02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:34.310]
Here's the Pope who's Polish and a Catholic with a beanie and address.

[02:20:34.570 --> 02:20:36.450]
And he speaks every language with a Jewish accent.

[02:20:36.810 --> 02:20:37.370]
Why is he guy?

[02:20:37.950 --> 02:20:39.470]
Give us back to beanie 2 while you're at it.

[02:20:44.530 --> 02:20:45.850]
Who made a glia, man?

[02:20:45.890 --> 02:20:46.690]
I'm Tonya.

[02:20:46.690 --> 02:20:47.810]
Help me, Ocronc.

[02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:48.170]
Help me.

[02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:49.710]
Come on, let me go.

[02:20:50.810 --> 02:20:52.530]
Her name was Lea.

[02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:54.650]
She was a princess.

[02:20:55.770 --> 02:20:59.770]
With the Danish on each ear and our bear drawing me in her.

[02:20:59.770 --> 02:21:01.130]
So I'm too deep to.

[02:21:01.710 --> 02:21:03.250]
The men can no be.

[02:21:03.410 --> 02:21:03.890]
Oviwa.

[02:21:04.090 --> 02:21:08.170]
We have to put the desktop plans into the rebellion's hands.

[02:21:08.410 --> 02:21:11.690]
So Luke and Obi-Wan have to get to all the things.

[02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:14.510]
So they run, so they stopped in Tumorsight.

[02:21:14.690 --> 02:21:18.350]
Leaks to have a drink with Han after Star Wars.

[02:21:18.650 --> 02:21:20.390]
Star Wars can't be known.

[02:21:20.970 --> 02:21:24.850]
So with his creatures you've ever seen him.

[02:21:24.930 --> 02:21:26.850]
He has the Star Wars.

[02:21:27.410 --> 02:21:29.450]
Star Wars can't be known.

[02:21:30.470 --> 02:21:36.470]
Music and laughter then all Jedi masters after Star Wars.

[02:21:36.470 --> 02:21:38.430]
We have to pass for this.

[02:21:38.570 --> 02:21:39.450]
His name was Solo.

[02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:40.130]
Hunter.

[02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:41.670]
He was a pilot.

[02:21:42.810 --> 02:21:44.510]
With the laughter at his time.

[02:21:44.970 --> 02:21:48.170]
And a smile will flash that's why they're with Tupacca.

[02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:50.310]
He was a wolf key.

[02:21:50.930 --> 02:21:56.630]
They met with Luke and Obi-Wan about the millennium for conducting bay 94.

[02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:59.290]
Don't troopers after door.

[02:21:59.930 --> 02:22:01.570]
With a flash of Ben's light play.

[02:22:01.810 --> 02:22:03.750]
Come as an art on the floor.

[02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:05.450]
The Star Wars.

[02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:07.430]
Star Wars can't be known.

[02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:11.390]
The weirdest creatures you've ever seen.

[02:22:11.930 --> 02:22:13.850]
He has the Star Wars.

[02:22:14.210 --> 02:22:16.410]
Star Wars can't be known.

[02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:22.990]
Music and laughter then all Jedi masters after Star Wars.

[02:22:24.050 --> 02:22:25.590]
House ice is space.

[02:22:25.930 --> 02:22:31.350]
We will never find the more wretched high of scum and filament.

[02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:33.710]
Mr. Corners.

[02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:35.070]
His name was Yoda.

[02:22:35.770 --> 02:22:37.190]
He was a muffin.

[02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:38.670]
He was a muffin.

[02:22:38.670 --> 02:22:40.250]
Darth Vader was so bad.

[02:22:40.510 --> 02:22:42.210]
And by the way, he's Luke's dad.

[02:22:42.450 --> 02:22:43.730]
Luke is his sister.

[02:22:44.530 --> 02:22:45.870]
His hand got caught on.

[02:22:46.890 --> 02:22:48.950]
In that galaxy far far away.

[02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:50.730]
Luke has had a lousy day.

[02:22:50.970 --> 02:22:52.730]
Bova fed was so mean.

[02:22:53.130 --> 02:22:54.750]
Jabba had bad hygiene.

[02:22:55.310 --> 02:22:57.270]
Why didn't they all just relax?

[02:22:57.710 --> 02:22:59.670]
Back on Tattooine.

[02:22:59.670 --> 02:23:01.050]
At the Star Wars.

[02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:02.990]
Star Wars can't be known.

[02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:06.990]
The weirdest creatures you've ever seen.

[02:23:07.430 --> 02:23:09.550]
He has the Star Wars.

[02:23:09.850 --> 02:23:12.150]
Star Wars can't be known.

[02:23:13.090 --> 02:23:18.730]
Music and laughter then all Jedi masters after Star Wars.

[02:23:19.710 --> 02:23:21.290]
The Star Wars will be with you.

[02:23:21.930 --> 02:23:24.170]
Star Wars.

[02:23:24.970 --> 02:23:25.350]
Star Wars.

[02:23:26.910 --> 02:23:27.310]
Star Wars.

[02:23:28.890 --> 02:23:29.290]
Star Wars.

[02:23:29.290 --> 02:23:30.310]
You know, it's really amazing.

[02:23:30.450 --> 02:23:33.470]
I didn't realize it before I'm glad he brought it up again.

[02:23:33.610 --> 02:23:38.230]
Michael Mayo not only had a big column today about some stupid stadium that went up there in West Palm Beach.

[02:23:38.590 --> 02:23:43.570]
He not only covers the whole column, the regular column, based on a front page of the Sun Central Sports this morning.

[02:23:43.810 --> 02:23:48.150]
But also if you open up to page 10c, it's like another eighth of a page.

[02:23:48.830 --> 02:23:51.630]
So it's like the equivalent of one and a half columns at least.

[02:23:51.630 --> 02:23:57.350]
And when I realized this thing was continued to open up and I'm thinking, well, maybe at the end it's kind of like some after notes and after thoughts.

[02:23:57.350 --> 02:24:00.250]
He's going to write a little retraction in there or say something.

[02:24:01.370 --> 02:24:01.690]
Nothing.

[02:24:02.090 --> 02:24:03.330]
Zipini Duda, okay.

[02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:08.810]
The man's got 47,000 words on his stupid, stinking word processor that he's written out there.

[02:24:09.410 --> 02:24:10.290]
And not one of them.

[02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:13.050]
Not a stinking one word saying, I'm sorry I apologize.

[02:24:13.410 --> 02:24:15.710]
Let me live up to what I promised on Neil's show the other day.

[02:24:18.610 --> 02:24:19.090]
Unbelievable.

[02:24:19.490 --> 02:24:20.330]
Michael Mayo.

[02:24:20.530 --> 02:24:21.070]
Oh my god.

[02:24:21.070 --> 02:24:24.070]
If anybody's going to wind up in purgatory, you know what's going to happen to Michael Mayo?

[02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:26.250]
He's not really going to purgatory.

[02:24:26.250 --> 02:24:29.210]
He's going to wind up eating ham sandwiches with mayonnaise every day.

[02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:30.810]
Hammond she's with Mayo.

[02:24:31.930 --> 02:24:32.850]
Hold the Michael.

[02:24:34.590 --> 02:24:35.650]
Oh my god.

[02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:37.590]
Talk about an immediate ticket to hell.

[02:24:38.610 --> 02:24:39.090]
Treyf.

[02:24:39.430 --> 02:24:43.590]
We have an open line at Broward 7679 463 767.

[02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:45.990]
You can slather the mayor slather the hydron.

[02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.750]
It's your choice.

[02:24:47.170 --> 02:24:48.790]
The heat player said, hold the male.

[02:24:48.970 --> 02:24:50.150]
Get a monitor as a matter of fact.

[02:24:50.370 --> 02:24:51.090]
We'll take the hydron.

[02:24:51.090 --> 02:24:51.510]
Thank you.

[02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:52.010]
That's right.

[02:24:52.270 --> 02:24:54.010]
The Miami heat are used in those hydron products.

[02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:55.890]
Maybe you've seen them advertised on QVC.

[02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.810]
You know what that is, don't you?

[02:24:56.890 --> 02:24:57.490]
I bet you do.

[02:24:59.150 --> 02:25:00.650]
16 W I O T.

[02:25:01.610 --> 02:25:03.230]
He couldn't believe that she was banging Walter.

[02:25:03.370 --> 02:25:03.750]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:25:04.310 --> 02:25:05.410]
111 17 and W.

[02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:07.370]
While like I said, it would have been a nice secret.

[02:25:07.730 --> 02:25:09.410]
And it would have been inside Joe Kages.

[02:25:09.610 --> 02:25:10.430]
And nobody would know.

[02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:13.130]
But he decided to make it a cause to let last night on the show.

[02:25:13.130 --> 02:25:14.890]
And bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

[02:25:14.910 --> 02:25:16.310]
That's basically all she talked about.

[02:25:16.450 --> 02:25:17.210]
What you heard it.

[02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:21.370]
I mean, I'm just, I don't get it.

[02:25:21.470 --> 02:25:23.870]
I mean, if you want to establish credibility right off the bat.

[02:25:24.030 --> 02:25:26.850]
The last thing you do is say you're sleeping with the boss or the consultant.

[02:25:26.890 --> 02:25:32.510]
And basically whether you stink the joint out or not, you're going to be here because the consultant is, you know what I'm saying?

[02:25:32.770 --> 02:25:33.670]
I don't want to get too graphic.

[02:25:34.510 --> 02:25:35.370]
He's consulting it.

[02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:39.090]
We have an open line at day 6222 W I O D.

[02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:42.470]
We have one in Broward 7679 463 767.

[02:25:42.470 --> 02:25:44.050]
Don't forget tonight 6 to 9.

[02:25:44.130 --> 02:25:45.030]
Oh, that's where we got basketball.

[02:25:45.250 --> 02:25:46.610]
Well, ordinarily 6 to 9.

[02:25:46.750 --> 02:25:47.730]
It's Brooke Daniels.

[02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:50.430]
So we have, if she eats enough for drama, we have no problem with Brooke.

[02:25:50.670 --> 02:25:52.510]
And the night to midnight, it's passion clones.

[02:25:53.710 --> 02:25:54.630]
She won't be on tonight.

[02:25:54.910 --> 02:25:55.150]
Who?

[02:25:56.010 --> 02:25:56.850]
Brooke won't be on.

[02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:57.770]
We got a basketball game.

[02:25:57.810 --> 02:25:58.370]
Who won't be on?

[02:25:58.430 --> 02:25:58.690]
Karen.

[02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.310]
Why not?

[02:26:00.430 --> 02:26:01.350]
I got to doubt.

[02:26:02.050 --> 02:26:02.570]
Why not?

[02:26:02.990 --> 02:26:04.110]
Because of the basketball game.

[02:26:04.110 --> 02:26:05.650]
And she had something to do.

[02:26:06.310 --> 02:26:07.130]
Is what I was told.

[02:26:07.430 --> 02:26:07.430]

[02:26:07.770 --> 02:26:08.730]
She had something to do.

[02:26:08.730 --> 02:26:10.010]
This is only her second night.

[02:26:10.010 --> 02:26:10.010]

[02:26:10.010 --> 02:26:10.010]

[02:26:10.010 --> 02:26:10.010]

[02:26:10.010 --> 02:26:10.110]
And she had something to do.

[02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.110]

[02:26:10.910 --> 02:26:12.350]
Well, you know, when you together.

[02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.930]
Wait a minute.

[02:26:13.170 --> 02:26:13.610]
The game.

[02:26:14.490 --> 02:26:15.230]
I threw it out.

[02:26:15.310 --> 02:26:16.550]
But I know the game is a home game.

[02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:17.190]
Right?

[02:26:17.490 --> 02:26:18.370]
He'd are playing home tonight.

[02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:19.390]
Detroit, I think.

[02:26:20.370 --> 02:26:21.170]
So it's a home game.

[02:26:21.210 --> 02:26:22.850]
So the game starts at 7 or 7 or 7.

[02:26:22.850 --> 02:26:24.270]
30 to be over by 9.

[02:26:24.490 --> 02:26:25.570]
30 basketball games.

[02:26:25.610 --> 02:26:26.570]
Only last a couple of hours.

[02:26:28.530 --> 02:26:29.710]
And she's not going to be here.

[02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:30.710]
Because she's got C E.

[02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:31.270]
I see this.

[02:26:31.390 --> 02:26:33.050]
This tie in with what I just got through saying.

[02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:37.890]
How do you start a job in the first night you come on for three hours and the next night?

[02:26:38.010 --> 02:26:41.870]
Oh, well, it's only gonna be a somewhat short like two and a half hours short anyway, so I can't be here

[02:26:41.870 --> 02:26:43.690]
I got something else to do. So who's gonna be on?

[02:26:45.430 --> 02:26:46.970]

I know I can smell it from here. Here's a mobile in Kendall. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir

[02:27:19.890 --> 02:27:23.690]
I got a letter from a Delphi cable yesterday they're changing the whole lineup

[02:27:23.690 --> 02:27:28.490]
Yeah, and they had to drop a couple things because they had to put another shopping channel on a few more

[02:27:28.490 --> 02:27:33.610]
Managed station right they're dropping action and playboy. They both suck anyway

[02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:40.690]
Well, I mean for the Delphi that's the only thing they had yeah, not too much not too much pretty weak get a big dish

Open line of date if they love him wait till they hear a passion clone so she's not gonna be on tonight

[02:27:56.230 --> 02:28:00.990]
It was just kind of like a cameo last night and now she's gonna get some other material. That's amazing

[02:28:00.990 --> 02:28:08.150]
I think we need a little consultation on oh, I'm sorry. Let's go to a mobile in sunrise. Hello. Hey, how are you great?

[02:28:09.010 --> 02:28:09.970]

The baseball they all play a hundred spring games every year. They play a hundred spring training games and the regular schedules

[02:28:17.810 --> 02:28:24.050]
Now been expanded since we have interleague play to 428 games. I just don't remember him playing so many spring games

[02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:26.530]
I know they've been playing for a year already. Yeah

[02:28:27.210 --> 02:28:32.630]
Yeah, and they keep winning and winning and winning and winning and winning and winning and winning way and it's still

[02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:37.270]
Don't mean nothing yet. I'm out of loss about the Panthers. I don't they're not playing with any hard

[02:28:37.270 --> 02:28:41.670]
No, they have no spark. They don't have it. They just I mean you can see it out there even now

[02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:45.090]
They did play a great game against New Jersey. We played pretty good against Buffalo

[02:28:45.090 --> 02:28:49.490]
But thank goodness Buffalo took the night off and other than that we don't play very many

[02:28:49.490 --> 02:28:57.490]
Emotional games. We just don't have no no verb no drive no nothing and they just keep on winning and nobody's and still nobody cares

[02:28:57.490 --> 02:29:03.770]
Yeah, could you play the Dave games for a song for me? Dave game. Yeah, we don't have it heard that in a while. Amen

[02:29:28.490 --> 02:29:28.990]

Yes, you know how Jesus came down earth and was nailed up for all of our sins. Yes now they nailed them

[02:32:15.030 --> 02:32:19.270]
They nailed them now and he died for for everyone since here now

[02:32:19.270 --> 02:32:24.990]
Assuming of life on Mars to forget about Mars. What about on serious. Let's get serious

Well, wherever I that's where all these getch keys are going at the off themselves with Bill Cosby's putting

So Jesus dying on earth

[02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:38.350]
Save the sins of the people on other worlds or you mean a Jesus has to die on each planet on each

[02:32:38.870 --> 02:32:43.210]
Individual well you don't see him around here now do you that's because he's busy making cameo appearances elsewhere?

[02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:45.630]
It's a big wide universe out there man

[02:32:45.630 --> 02:32:51.150]
He's doing cameos. Yes, he is wow didn't you see he's over there on Washington Street that the cameo this weekend

[02:32:51.150 --> 02:32:56.910]
I see wow extra security of course does that mean that each planet is gonna have a Pope of their own correct

[02:32:57.910 --> 02:33:05.070]
So it it so that means because they're all under a lot of duress. Okay, we have an open line at Broward 7679 463 767

[02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:08.110]

You better watch yourself in fact. I had a nice atkins lunch from our friends at Atlantic City subs

[02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:19.850]
And it was great in fact. I think so, but it's uh, I was picking at it. You were picking on it. How about the food

[02:34:20.470 --> 02:34:24.370]
So at any rate I'm going on this atkins that lose 800 pounds by the end of next week

Here's a lady in bokeh. Hello

[02:34:36.510 --> 02:34:39.990]
Lady in bokeh. Hello. Yes, ma'am. Hi Neil. How you doing great?

[02:34:40.450 --> 02:34:44.890]
My husband listens to you all the time, but I never get to because I'm a teacher, but I'm off today

[02:34:44.890 --> 02:34:47.430]
Right, and I wanted to make a couple requests

[02:34:47.430 --> 02:34:53.130]
First of all, he told me that I need to learn my ABC. So I need to hear something called the abonix ABCs

[02:34:53.130 --> 02:34:56.830]
Yeah, can you play that for me? I might okay and also Barney

[02:34:58.170 --> 02:35:02.730]
You have a song about Barney. Barney takes a dump. Yeah, I think that's it. I'll work on it

[02:35:02.730 --> 02:35:05.010]
Okay, thank you very much. I'll see you if Barney's eaten yet

[02:35:05.850 --> 02:35:07.650]
Okay, all right. Thanks. Bye. Bye

[02:35:07.650 --> 02:35:13.550]
All right, we play this again. You can't this is what you can't play too often. I'll be telling you that right now, okay?

[02:35:14.730 --> 02:35:18.910]
Because all you young people out there if you'd be wanting to learn something if you want to be getting real real smart

[02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:21.110]
I took a call from the abonix

[02:35:21.870 --> 02:35:26.670]
They say the future be right for me now. I can't get snow job

[02:35:26.670 --> 02:35:32.490]
Because I don't got no little recipe eyes talking like a no-need roll

[02:35:32.490 --> 02:35:37.370]
You bondix taught me how to sway now. I can't do nothing

[02:35:37.930 --> 02:35:40.370]
But my heritage say that's okay

[02:35:41.050 --> 02:35:45.850]
Change my name to shoot roll drive a doos and a quarter any Cadillac

Jesus Christ for extra strength dexedron

[02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:55.930]
When you're getting crucified

[02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:58.210]
The last thing you need is a headache

[02:37:58.850 --> 02:38:03.670]
There's so much pressure hanging around with the whole world sends weighing on your shoulders

[02:38:04.290 --> 02:38:07.270]
Then some f**k gladiator sticks a spear on your side

[02:38:08.470 --> 02:38:09.830]
Jesus Christ that hurts

[02:38:10.890 --> 02:38:13.890]
So when this thorny crown feels like a vice around my head

[02:38:14.490 --> 02:38:16.210]
That's when I reach for dexedron

[02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:19.450]
Well I uh, I don't reach for it

[02:38:19.450 --> 02:38:20.110]
Hey

[02:38:20.110 --> 02:38:22.330]
Anybody got any dexedron?

[02:38:22.710 --> 02:38:25.450]
Hey Judas could you throw a couple into my mouth?

[02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:28.510]
Come on I'm the savior for Christ's sake

[02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:30.150]
Extra strength dexedron

[02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:32.790]
Because a headache is a heavy cross to bear

[02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:33.490]
Happy Easter

[02:38:34.350 --> 02:38:37.230]
We have an open line in day at 622-9463

[02:38:37.230 --> 02:38:38.190]

It's all a bunch of bubble miceys

[02:38:39.490 --> 02:38:42.510]
Look at the bodies of those 39 pathetic bastards out there

[02:38:42.510 --> 02:38:44.110]

To catch the spaceship

[02:38:48.250 --> 02:38:49.110]

Yeah, not too late you better hop aboard

[02:38:51.010 --> 02:38:52.930]

We had a call earlier today from Joja

[02:39:10.010 --> 02:39:10.650]
How do you like that?

[02:39:10.650 --> 02:39:11.410]
That was it

[02:39:11.410 --> 02:39:13.870]
That was a medley of our audio net lines today

[02:39:13.870 --> 02:39:15.770]
And it's just uh you know kind of bizarre

[02:39:15.770 --> 02:39:16.750]
It's kind of bizarre

[02:39:16.750 --> 02:39:18.750]

[02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:21.270]
We know you're listening up there in Edobicoke

[02:39:21.270 --> 02:39:22.090]

So anyway before we do that

[02:41:44.710 --> 02:41:46.190]
I'll be back, kids

[02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:47.390]
Stop

[02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:48.690]
Pandas

[02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:51.170]
Do I gotta go?

[02:41:51.810 --> 02:41:52.990]
I'm gonna do it here

[02:41:54.150 --> 02:41:55.590]
Hold on, the pants

[02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:56.670]

[02:42:22.690 --> 02:42:28.590]
I'm in here. I'm in here. Busy right now.

[02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:31.190]
Oh.

[02:42:32.110 --> 02:42:51.290]
We'll be eh it

[02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:54.310]
was STUP PANDAS.

[02:43:04.450 --> 02:43:07.310]
I know that the Lord even loves neo-rodgers.

[02:43:11.850 --> 02:43:14.390]
All the white folks hate the black folks,

[02:43:14.550 --> 02:43:17.750]
and the black folks hate the white folks to hate all,

[02:43:18.110 --> 02:43:20.950]
but the right folks is an old established rule

[02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:23.770]
but during national brother to each.

[02:43:26.430 --> 02:43:31.550]
Lean a horn and sheriff Clark are dancing cheap to cheegus.

[02:43:31.550 --> 02:43:38.690]
Fun to utilize the people you despise as long as you don't let them in your school.

[02:43:42.030 --> 02:43:44.430]
Older poor folks hate the rich folks,

[02:43:44.650 --> 02:43:46.710]
and the rich folks hate the poor folks.

[02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:48.950]
All of my folks hate all of your folks.

[02:43:49.190 --> 02:43:53.670]
It's American as apple pie, but during national brotherhood,

[02:43:54.610 --> 02:43:58.670]
national brotherhood, New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans,

[02:43:59.390 --> 02:44:00.730]
cause it's very cheap.

[02:44:01.310 --> 02:44:05.470]
Step up and shake the hand of someone you can't stand.

[02:44:05.730 --> 02:44:08.330]
You can tolerate him if you try.

[02:44:11.770 --> 02:44:14.010]
Older Protestants hate the Catholics,

[02:44:14.470 --> 02:44:16.490]
and the Catholics hate the Protestants,

[02:44:16.670 --> 02:44:18.430]
and the Hindus hate the Muslims,

[02:44:18.450 --> 02:44:21.190]
and everybody hates the Jews but do.

[02:44:21.190 --> 02:44:23.310]
Older National Brotherhood,

[02:44:23.310 --> 02:44:25.610]
National Brotherhood,

[02:44:25.610 --> 02:44:26.210]
who he gets,

[02:44:26.530 --> 02:44:30.490]
National everyone smile at one and neverhood week.

[02:44:30.750 --> 02:44:34.990]
Be nice to people who are inferior to you.

[02:44:35.210 --> 02:44:38.150]
It's only for a week, so have no fear.

[02:44:39.090 --> 02:44:42.450]
Roll, be grateful that it doesn't last all year.

[02:44:45.690 --> 02:44:47.130]
He covered just about everybody,

[02:44:47.310 --> 02:44:48.290]
you know who he left out?

[02:44:48.290 --> 02:44:49.090]
You'll that's me.

[02:44:49.430 --> 02:44:51.450]
Okay, 142 at W-I-O-D.

[02:44:54.470 --> 02:44:57.290]
610 W-I-O-D.

[02:44:58.130 --> 02:44:59.330]
What's up, I'm Max!

[02:44:59.710 --> 02:45:03.050]
And now this public service announcement about Sally Struthers.

[02:45:04.490 --> 02:45:07.090]
For $90 you could close a child.

[02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:09.770]
For $90 you could help fight cancer,

[02:45:10.130 --> 02:45:13.130]
or you could feed Sally Struthers for a whole day,

[02:45:13.530 --> 02:45:14.390]
for just $90.

[02:45:15.210 --> 02:45:16.890]
I'm Sally Struthers.

[02:45:16.890 --> 02:45:20.830]
Working with starving people like I do can make you pretty hungry.

[02:45:21.370 --> 02:45:23.710]
And since there's not enough food to go around here,

[02:45:23.890 --> 02:45:26.090]
my food has to be shipped in every day.

[02:45:26.670 --> 02:45:29.130]
Your $90 will keep me fat and sassy

[02:45:29.130 --> 02:45:32.550]
so I can set a good example for these skinny to-leaf the old fans.

[02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:35.770]
Remember, it takes more than shoulder pads

[02:45:35.770 --> 02:45:37.770]
and a big hairdo for Sally to do good work.

[02:45:38.070 --> 02:45:39.310]
It also takes food.

[02:45:39.890 --> 02:45:40.790]
Don't be a meathead.

[02:45:41.350 --> 02:45:41.870]
Give us $90.

[02:45:42.550 --> 02:45:44.930]
It'll feed Sally Struthers for a whole day.

[02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:49.090]
Or Jeff Hyde or Dave Game.

[02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:51.450]
Okay, we have an open line on the out of town line.

[02:45:51.450 --> 02:45:53.430]
You won't get on the air because that's just the way it is.

[02:45:53.590 --> 02:45:54.090]
Life ain't fair.

[02:45:54.350 --> 02:45:55.290]
That's what Jimmy Carter said.

[02:45:55.410 --> 02:45:55.690]
It ain't fair.

[02:45:55.770 --> 02:45:57.170]
You ever see his family? That's living proof.

[02:45:58.030 --> 02:45:59.470]
Here's North Miami. Hello.

[02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:00.610]
Neil.

[02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:01.170]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:02.170 --> 02:46:03.030]
God in radio.

[02:46:04.210 --> 02:46:05.990]
On Good Friday, how about Bill Calder?

[02:46:07.010 --> 02:46:08.970]
Do you have any type of tape around you

[02:46:08.970 --> 02:46:11.850]
that you can share with us from Bill Calder and yourself?

[02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:21.410]
Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by.

[02:46:23.970 --> 02:46:29.890]
Sometimes I feel that people don't want to smile.

[02:46:32.210 --> 02:46:35.430]
But when I listen to your show,

[02:46:36.130 --> 02:46:38.030]
you make me smile like a child.

[02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:42.510]
And you can help me get by my friend.

[02:46:42.510 --> 02:46:45.410]
Mick Older on my radio.

[02:46:46.590 --> 02:46:48.870]
Mick Older on my radio.

[02:46:49.970 --> 02:46:51.370]
On my radio.

[02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:55.010]
On my radio.

[02:46:57.030 --> 02:46:57.550]
Mmm.

[02:46:59.590 --> 02:46:59.590]

[02:47:00.270 --> 02:47:00.790]
Mmm.

[02:47:02.990 --> 02:47:06.070]
147, a W I O D. Happy Good Friday to you.

[02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:08.090]
We're having a very reverent show here today, as expected.

[02:47:08.270 --> 02:47:09.790]
And if you don't like it, too bad.

[02:47:10.270 --> 02:47:11.010]
That's the way it goes.

[02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:12.410]
If you want to be reverent, go to church,

[02:47:12.610 --> 02:47:14.510]
put your unease on the floor and do something useful.

[02:47:14.750 --> 02:47:16.790]
OK? Something that God will approve of.

[02:47:17.050 --> 02:47:18.130]
Does he approve of anything?

[02:47:18.410 --> 02:47:19.350]
Not too much these days.

[02:47:19.710 --> 02:47:21.210]
He's getting pretty pissed off.

[02:47:21.930 --> 02:47:23.470]
Here is the Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:24.790]
Neil, Godfather.

[02:47:24.910 --> 02:47:25.250]
Yes, sir.

[02:47:25.770 --> 02:47:27.970]
Oh, what a great thing about working for a glory.

[02:47:27.970 --> 02:47:29.050]
You get the day off today.

[02:47:29.790 --> 02:47:30.050]
Yeah.

[02:47:30.430 --> 02:47:30.790]
Anyway.

[02:47:30.890 --> 02:47:33.030]
I could have taken the day off. It's a company holiday.

[02:47:33.430 --> 02:47:34.030]
Well, it's, it's easy.

[02:47:34.030 --> 02:47:35.910]
But talk about being a hypocrite.

[02:47:35.950 --> 02:47:36.890]
That would have been ugly.

[02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:39.190]
Well, yeah, I just became Christian today.

[02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:40.130]
So I can get the day off.

[02:47:40.170 --> 02:47:41.390]
All right. He kept getting me.

[02:47:41.490 --> 02:47:42.890]
Well, you can work today. I said no.

[02:47:43.710 --> 02:47:44.910]
Nothing like being a Jew on you.

[02:47:44.950 --> 02:47:47.070]
I'm Kipper and a Christian on Christmas and Easter.

[02:47:47.490 --> 02:47:47.810]
Absolutely.

[02:47:48.310 --> 02:47:49.710]
Anyway, I had a hockey question for you.

[02:47:49.770 --> 02:47:50.070]
Yes, sir.

[02:47:50.090 --> 02:47:50.910]
We can't call because I'm a work.

[02:47:51.750 --> 02:47:55.450]
I was on vacation when Brian Murray made the trade with Kurt Mueller.

[02:47:56.170 --> 02:47:56.410]
Yeah.

[02:47:56.930 --> 02:47:57.530]
Kurt Mueller.

[02:47:57.750 --> 02:47:58.150]
Kurt Mueller.

[02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.790]
Thank you.

[02:47:58.830 --> 02:48:00.190]
Not looking too good, by the way, Kurt.

[02:48:00.310 --> 02:48:01.530]
I know that Uncle was bothering him.

[02:48:01.530 --> 02:48:03.150]
But last night he was in a coma again.

[02:48:03.410 --> 02:48:04.770]
He's not showing me too much anything.

[02:48:04.990 --> 02:48:06.550]
Come on, Kurt. It's not the least no more.

[02:48:06.710 --> 02:48:07.910]
This is a playoff team, man.

[02:48:07.970 --> 02:48:08.570]
Let's get with it.

[02:48:08.570 --> 02:48:09.710]
Yeah, but he's no Chris Wells.

[02:48:10.030 --> 02:48:10.670]
Yeah, that's true.

[02:48:10.750 --> 02:48:11.830]
Chris had a great game last night.

[02:48:13.250 --> 02:48:14.770]
That's what I heard.

[02:48:15.530 --> 02:48:16.290]
I was just wondering.

[02:48:16.490 --> 02:48:17.450]
I wanted your opinion.

[02:48:17.610 --> 02:48:21.850]
Do you think that Brian Murray is trying to make Kurt Mueller the next time Hagen?

[02:48:22.370 --> 02:48:22.530]
All right.

[02:48:22.610 --> 02:48:24.650]
I mean, Brian Scruel and the next time Hagen, you're out.

[02:48:25.150 --> 02:48:25.470]
Yeah.

[02:48:25.470 --> 02:48:26.190]
You're out.

[02:48:26.470 --> 02:48:26.970]
Could be.

[02:48:27.390 --> 02:48:29.990]
I'm just wondering about that because he was a leader at Toronto.

[02:48:30.210 --> 02:48:31.430]
I'm a big leaf fan.

[02:48:32.110 --> 02:48:32.510]
Living up in the air.

[02:48:32.510 --> 02:48:32.990]
Now, come on.

[02:48:33.010 --> 02:48:33.870]
Now, let's get serious.

[02:48:34.010 --> 02:48:35.810]
You're saying Kurt Mueller was a leader on the leaves.

[02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:37.650]
Yeah, he let us write down to where we are today.

[02:48:37.650 --> 02:48:38.810]
And last place in the division.

[02:48:39.350 --> 02:48:40.490]
Kurt Mueller didn't do nothing.

[02:48:40.490 --> 02:48:41.990]
He was like a minus 8,000.

[02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:43.430]
Yeah, but it wasn't completely his fault.

[02:48:43.490 --> 02:48:44.290]
Yeah, I know.

[02:48:44.410 --> 02:48:45.730]
I know, but Kurt Mueller.

[02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:46.890]
I mean, he had his moments.

[02:48:46.890 --> 02:48:48.630]
You know, I think you've been done cherry-eyes.

[02:48:48.710 --> 02:48:50.990]
You know, because he's, because Kurt is from Kingston.

[02:48:51.070 --> 02:48:52.550]
So, Cherry thinks that he's great.

[02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:54.290]
Like everybody is from Kingston.

[02:48:54.410 --> 02:48:55.750]
I mean, Doug, he'll more his great, okay?

[02:48:55.850 --> 02:48:58.190]
But Kurt Mueller is, he runs hot and cold.

[02:48:58.430 --> 02:49:00.650]
And you'll notice everywhere he goes, there's problems.

[02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:03.510]
I'm not saying I don't like the trade because I think Padal is, uh,

[02:49:03.730 --> 02:49:05.650]
okay, he had an assist for Leafs the other night tonight.

[02:49:05.650 --> 02:49:07.670]
So, he's okay, but nothing special.

[02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:09.650]
And so, it's a good deal if Mueller plays.

[02:49:09.890 --> 02:49:11.850]
But I mean, if he doesn't upgrade from last night.

[02:49:12.170 --> 02:49:13.590]
And the Buffalo game, I weren't trouble.

[02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:14.650]
Right, I agree.

[02:49:14.770 --> 02:49:15.530]
I have a lot of him who was.

[02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:16.130]
Too much CBC.

[02:49:16.430 --> 02:49:17.810]
I do have the dish and everything.

[02:49:18.210 --> 02:49:18.350]
Yeah.

[02:49:18.570 --> 02:49:20.470]
Anyway, I do have one strange request.

[02:49:20.730 --> 02:49:21.050]
Yes, sir.

[02:49:21.330 --> 02:49:22.570]
I lived in Cleveland for a few years.

[02:49:22.730 --> 02:49:24.530]
And I turned a lot of people on to you.

[02:49:24.650 --> 02:49:27.030]
In fact, I had some friends down last week when I took my vacation.

[02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.650]
They were down.

[02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.750]
And we were listening.

[02:49:29.210 --> 02:49:30.810]
I was just wondering, as a strange request,

[02:49:31.050 --> 02:49:33.290]
could you relate to story about when you were living in Michigan,

[02:49:33.490 --> 02:49:35.510]
how you went to Northfield down on that guarantee,

[02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:36.330]
horse you had?

[02:49:37.010 --> 02:49:38.730]
Could you relate that over the air?

[02:49:38.850 --> 02:49:39.510]
To Northfield Park.

[02:49:40.470 --> 02:49:41.230]
To Northfield Park, yeah.

[02:49:41.530 --> 02:49:41.650]
Right.

[02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:42.730]
Could you relate to that?

[02:49:42.730 --> 02:49:44.790]
Well, with somebody gave us, in fact,

[02:49:44.890 --> 02:49:47.430]
there was somebody who was a jockey at DRC in the daytime.

[02:49:47.870 --> 02:49:50.370]
And there was a girl who was a friend of a friend of mine.

[02:49:50.570 --> 02:49:51.930]
And she was dating the jockey.

[02:49:52.210 --> 02:49:55.510]
And he said, a friend of mine is driving a horse at Northfield Park in Cleveland.

[02:49:55.510 --> 02:49:56.750]
And I called Mr. Z.

[02:49:57.210 --> 02:49:58.670]
And this horse is going to win.

[02:49:58.710 --> 02:50:00.070]
He's going to be like seven or eight to one.

[02:50:00.310 --> 02:50:00.850]
So, we left.

[02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:03.650]
We made our picks at Hazel Park that night and left with our friends,

[02:50:03.650 --> 02:50:06.410]
money to bet on the horses, and Hazel, all of which, by the way, lost.

[02:50:06.510 --> 02:50:06.910]
They were nowhere.

[02:50:07.370 --> 02:50:08.990]
We get in the car and Detroit in the afternoon.

[02:50:08.990 --> 02:50:11.190]
We drive all the way to Cleveland at Northfield Park,

[02:50:11.190 --> 02:50:13.630]
which I remember just west of the city, I believe.

[02:50:13.970 --> 02:50:14.410]
Just east.

[02:50:14.730 --> 02:50:16.410]
Or just east, just outside of the city, anyway.

[02:50:16.770 --> 02:50:17.510]
We go all the way there.

[02:50:17.850 --> 02:50:20.130]
And it's like in about the sixth or seventh race.

[02:50:20.250 --> 02:50:22.950]
Now, the first five races, I pick four out of the five winners.

[02:50:23.270 --> 02:50:25.470]
Okay, but I'm hardly, I'm betting almost nothing,

[02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:28.650]
because I'm saving my big plunge for Mr. Z.

[02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:29.210]
Right.

[02:50:29.670 --> 02:50:32.110]
All these other horses are coming in four to one, five to one,

[02:50:32.170 --> 02:50:32.630]
seven to two.

[02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:33.250]
Pretty good prices.

[02:50:33.350 --> 02:50:35.010]
I'm betting like almost no money at all.

[02:50:35.330 --> 02:50:36.110]
Now we go to the window.

[02:50:36.110 --> 02:50:37.510]
Mr. Z opens at six to one.

[02:50:37.510 --> 02:50:38.210]
It's the one horse.

[02:50:38.310 --> 02:50:39.470]
I'll never, this is 20 years ago.

[02:50:39.650 --> 02:50:40.570]
26 years ago.

[02:50:41.050 --> 02:50:42.510]
Now he goes to five to one.

[02:50:42.530 --> 02:50:43.930]
And we're going to the window a little at a time.

[02:50:44.010 --> 02:50:45.450]
We don't want to knock the odds down too much.

[02:50:45.590 --> 02:50:46.550]
So there's four of us.

[02:50:46.590 --> 02:50:48.430]
We're going to the window of betting 20 here, 20 there,

[02:50:48.550 --> 02:50:49.930]
because we don't want to knock it down too much.

[02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:51.830]
We met the horse down to three to one.

[02:50:51.990 --> 02:50:53.930]
He gets away from the start of the race, fourth.

[02:50:54.210 --> 02:50:55.250]
He sits on a real fourth.

[02:50:55.430 --> 02:50:57.490]
He finished fourth, and we can drove home.

[02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:58.190]
Neil.

[02:50:58.530 --> 02:51:01.130]
All the way from Detroit to Cleveland to lose our ass.

[02:51:01.130 --> 02:51:02.810]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:51:02.810 --> 02:51:03.310]
Thanks Neil.

[02:51:03.330 --> 02:51:03.690]
See you.

[02:51:03.730 --> 02:51:05.570]
Then I came down here at Mr. Z, of course.

[02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:07.230]
Member Mr. Z, the limo driver.

[02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:09.810]
Talk about a pain in the ass.

[02:51:09.890 --> 02:51:10.450]
It was an omen.

[02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:12.990]
I knew in my life Mr. Z was a loser all the way around.

[02:51:13.150 --> 02:51:16.370]
Then we wound up with Lenny the limo driver.

[02:51:17.390 --> 02:51:18.350]
Oh my god.

[02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:20.190]
You know who he was close buddies with, don't you?

[02:51:20.310 --> 02:51:20.450]
Woo!

[02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:21.470]
Oh, brother.

[02:51:22.310 --> 02:51:22.490]
Brooke.

[02:51:22.730 --> 02:51:23.530]
I mean, what's your name?

[02:51:24.930 --> 02:51:29.550]
So what do you think Brooke makes of this new situation there?

[02:51:31.470 --> 02:51:33.090]
The Walter Sabo S.

[02:51:33.270 --> 02:51:36.650]
And then he says also last night that he's going to be moving down here very soon.

[02:51:38.350 --> 02:51:40.490]
Just remember, just remember what I told you, okay?

[02:51:40.770 --> 02:51:44.690]
Remember in the godfather he says, whoever comes to you with this meeting, that's the traitor.

[02:51:45.190 --> 02:51:47.050]
Walter Sabo is the chigger in the wood pile.

[02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:48.590]
She's in the building by the way.

[02:51:48.730 --> 02:51:49.370]
Oh, Karen.

[02:51:49.890 --> 02:51:50.070]
Yeah.

[02:51:51.070 --> 02:51:52.250]
Welcome to season the building now.

[02:51:52.330 --> 02:51:53.170]
She ain't going to be on the air tonight.

[02:51:55.930 --> 02:51:57.430]
Or is that a mistake on your part?

[02:51:57.610 --> 02:51:58.570]
Is he going to be on the air tonight?

[02:51:58.570 --> 02:51:59.210]
No.

[02:51:59.750 --> 02:52:01.150]
She's, you're positive about that.

[02:52:01.370 --> 02:52:02.090]
That's what I was told.

[02:52:02.410 --> 02:52:03.150]
No passion clones?

[02:52:05.010 --> 02:52:06.370]
Okay, here's Miami and a mobile.

[02:52:06.530 --> 02:52:06.670]
Hello.

[02:52:06.930 --> 02:52:07.430]
Hey, Neil.

[02:52:07.730 --> 02:52:08.150]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:08.270 --> 02:52:09.350]
Hey, I got a story for you.

[02:52:09.390 --> 02:52:10.910]
What are you like inside the engine?

[02:52:13.170 --> 02:52:14.530]
I think the space ship's taken out.

[02:52:14.590 --> 02:52:14.790]
Woo!

[02:52:15.750 --> 02:52:16.110]
Hello!

[02:52:18.410 --> 02:52:18.770]
Hello!

[02:52:19.370 --> 02:52:20.630]
Okay, over and out.

[02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:21.870]
He's on a way to, uh, he's serious.

[02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:24.890]
Here's, uh, enjoy the, uh, putting by the way.

[02:52:25.370 --> 02:52:26.050]
Here's, hi, Alia.

[02:52:26.050 --> 02:52:26.550]
Hello.

[02:52:29.370 --> 02:52:29.730]
Neil.

[02:52:30.010 --> 02:52:30.170]
Yes.

[02:52:30.610 --> 02:52:32.110]
Is this all request radio?

[02:52:32.350 --> 02:52:32.550]
Yes.

[02:52:33.710 --> 02:52:34.390]
Come on, Linda.

[02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.850]
Let's go.

[02:52:35.130 --> 02:52:35.690]
What is it?

[02:52:35.890 --> 02:52:36.850]
How about laying off the hockey?

[02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:37.790]
Yeah, how about laying on this?

[02:52:38.710 --> 02:52:40.190]
Here's, uh, how about hockey in China?

[02:52:40.330 --> 02:52:41.210]
The show's almost over.

[02:52:41.330 --> 02:52:42.110]
How about laying off the hockey?

[02:52:42.410 --> 02:52:42.930]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:52:42.990 --> 02:52:44.430]
Man with nothing to say in no material.

[02:52:44.630 --> 02:52:46.630]
Just a little cute sound effects and out well done, either.

[02:52:46.710 --> 02:52:46.890]
Okay.

[02:52:47.130 --> 02:52:47.850]
Very poorly done.

[02:52:49.010 --> 02:52:49.610]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:52:49.810 --> 02:52:50.010]
Hello.

[02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:50.910]
Neil.

[02:52:51.130 --> 02:52:51.430]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:51.730 --> 02:52:53.410]
Why is he to the one holiday?

[02:52:53.410 --> 02:52:54.510]
He keeps bouncing around.

[02:52:54.610 --> 02:52:55.950]
You don't know if it's March or April.

[02:52:56.530 --> 02:52:57.610]
Same with Paisa.

[02:52:58.130 --> 02:52:58.810]
Okay, I'm sorry.

[02:52:58.910 --> 02:52:59.290]
I'm not Jewish.

[02:52:59.490 --> 02:53:00.030]
Well, why not?

[02:53:00.730 --> 02:53:02.230]
Uh, what are you anti-Semitic?

[02:53:02.430 --> 02:53:03.810]
Uh, don't trust, don't trust knives.

[02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:04.470]
Okay.

[02:53:04.690 --> 02:53:05.410]
Around those lowest parts.

[02:53:05.630 --> 02:53:05.890]
Uh-huh.

[02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:07.330]
You know, what are you saying?

[02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:08.250]
You're not circumcised?

[02:53:08.850 --> 02:53:09.630]
That's correct, sir.

[02:53:09.710 --> 02:53:10.410]
You are not circumcised?

[02:53:11.350 --> 02:53:11.470]
No.

[02:53:11.850 --> 02:53:12.790]
I have no force, can you?

[02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:13.630]
Oh my god.

[02:53:14.490 --> 02:53:17.910]
I'm just, I'm just a goi.

[02:53:18.050 --> 02:53:20.210]
Never, my parents didn't take me down there.

[02:53:20.470 --> 02:53:22.050]
Now, I'm about to do it at this age.

[02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.390]
Okay.

[02:53:22.810 --> 02:53:24.890]
Um, we call this cult.

[02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:26.670]
This thing a cult in San Diego.

[02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:27.230]
Yeah.

[02:53:27.410 --> 02:53:29.310]
But if Dan and Paul Krouch got on TBN,

[02:53:29.410 --> 02:53:30.850]
told them, make up some magical aid.

[02:53:31.170 --> 02:53:31.530]
Yeah.

[02:53:31.790 --> 02:53:33.550]
You think we'd have a few dead people around?

[02:53:33.610 --> 02:53:34.470]
Five million, probably.

[02:53:34.990 --> 02:53:35.710]
And because...

[02:53:35.710 --> 02:53:36.650]
What a blessing that would be.

[02:53:36.730 --> 02:53:37.590]
Let's try it this weekend.

[02:53:37.730 --> 02:53:38.370]
Let's see if it works.

[02:53:38.770 --> 02:53:40.450]
Because one time they were on there,

[02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:43.250]
talking about how one of their new satellites going up

[02:53:43.250 --> 02:53:45.410]
was one of the angels foretold in Revelation.

[02:53:45.730 --> 02:53:46.350]
Right, that's right.

[02:53:46.610 --> 02:53:48.870]
In fact, I think Pat Boone could win his good graces

[02:53:48.870 --> 02:53:50.790]
back into the fold of he be the first one to sit

[02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:51.830]
from the cup this weekend.

[02:53:52.610 --> 02:53:53.110]
Oh, yeah.

[02:53:53.170 --> 02:53:55.530]
By the way, with baseball season coming up,

[02:53:55.590 --> 02:53:57.630]
you're going to take a gang or any of the couple of games.

[02:53:57.970 --> 02:53:58.330]
Maybe.

[02:53:58.810 --> 02:54:01.450]
Because you get the Marlins and the old cubbies coming up.

[02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.590]
You never know.

[02:54:03.370 --> 02:54:05.030]
Too bad we're not playing the Tigers, though.

[02:54:06.510 --> 02:54:07.790]
Oh, yeah, because...

[02:54:08.450 --> 02:54:09.130]
Well, I guess what?

[02:54:09.210 --> 02:54:12.730]
They just put the game to pick the interest of people,

[02:54:12.930 --> 02:54:14.790]
you know, Yankees and they have like cross-down rivalries.

[02:54:15.530 --> 02:54:16.150]
Orioles, yeah.

[02:54:16.730 --> 02:54:19.670]
Well, what about the, what the owner of the White Talks

[02:54:19.670 --> 02:54:21.630]
is doing, picking off the Cubs fans.

[02:54:21.970 --> 02:54:22.470]
By doing one.

[02:54:22.890 --> 02:54:24.390]
If you want to go to the White Talks games,

[02:54:24.570 --> 02:54:26.330]
you got to fight four other tickets,

[02:54:26.750 --> 02:54:28.630]
three other tickets for other White Talks games.

[02:54:28.930 --> 02:54:29.330]
Oh, nice.

[02:54:29.730 --> 02:54:31.250]
And I have two and a little packet.

[02:54:31.370 --> 02:54:32.750]
So the Cubs fans will say, Scrum.

[02:54:34.070 --> 02:54:34.870]
Yeah, that's it.

[02:54:35.050 --> 02:54:35.570]
Okay, pal.

[02:54:35.730 --> 02:54:36.010]
Oh, yeah.

[02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:37.470]
Can you play, come a lot?

[02:54:38.770 --> 02:54:39.750]
Let's go to...

[02:54:39.750 --> 02:54:41.630]
Let's go to a poppano.

[02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.930]
Hello.

[02:54:42.350 --> 02:54:42.710]
Father Neil.

[02:54:42.970 --> 02:54:43.270]
Yes, sir.

[02:54:43.430 --> 02:54:43.770]
Oh, yeah.

[02:54:43.930 --> 02:54:44.190]
Okay.

[02:54:45.090 --> 02:54:46.250]
Uh, circumsides Canadian.

[02:54:46.950 --> 02:54:47.270]
All right.

[02:54:47.270 --> 02:54:48.030]
Now we're talking.

[02:54:48.330 --> 02:54:49.410]
I have no force, can you?

[02:54:50.050 --> 02:54:50.050]

[02:54:50.050 --> 02:54:52.850]
Hey, listen, I was watching the game last night,

[02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:55.910]
and uh, the batter's murmur, like my second favorite team.

[02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.330]
Yeah.

[02:54:56.670 --> 02:54:58.310]
I didn't like seeing Ottawa win.

[02:54:58.570 --> 02:55:01.070]
You know, it's nice to see that Tina's been sucking for so many years,

[02:55:01.070 --> 02:55:02.630]
you know, play Appdease and Frachange.

[02:55:02.770 --> 02:55:04.690]
They played circles around his last night.

[02:55:05.110 --> 02:55:07.090]
Yeah, I thought I enjoyed watching it last night.

[02:55:07.090 --> 02:55:09.490]
Title first, he and that Alfredson kid in Yashin,

[02:55:09.610 --> 02:55:12.310]
they ran circles around his last night all night long.

[02:55:12.490 --> 02:55:14.310]
Yeah, it's nice to see the underdog win for a change.

[02:55:14.690 --> 02:55:15.810]
I didn't mind watching that.

[02:55:15.810 --> 02:55:18.350]
Oh, they like smoking Boston.

[02:55:18.730 --> 02:55:19.890]
That's a surprise this year.

[02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.250]
Yeah.

[02:55:20.690 --> 02:55:22.510]
And leafs, well, that's a surprise.

[02:55:23.170 --> 02:55:25.790]
Another big tie last night, 61 points, baby.

[02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:26.290]
We're doing it.

[02:55:26.290 --> 02:55:27.230]
We're not going to finish last.

[02:55:27.470 --> 02:55:29.830]
Denny Pothan, eat your heart out because the islanders

[02:55:29.830 --> 02:55:31.210]
are going to get that number one draft pick.

[02:55:31.510 --> 02:55:33.970]
In fact, it looks like we're going to finish no worse than third from last.

[02:55:34.270 --> 02:55:34.850]
Third, you mean?

[02:55:35.010 --> 02:55:36.930]
And we're only like one point behind the Kings.

[02:55:37.090 --> 02:55:38.610]
We could finish Fort from last.

[02:55:38.750 --> 02:55:39.310]
How do you like that?

[02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:40.270]
Beautiful stuff.

[02:55:40.570 --> 02:55:40.750]
Amen.

[02:55:41.050 --> 02:55:41.770]
Can I have my request?

[02:55:42.210 --> 02:55:42.970]
If we got time.

[02:55:42.970 --> 02:55:44.410]
Now, let's take sauce one you got.

[02:55:45.190 --> 02:55:46.270]
Let's talk that's what's called.

[02:55:46.510 --> 02:55:46.730]
OK.

[02:55:46.990 --> 02:55:47.410]
Thank you.

[02:55:47.530 --> 02:55:47.890]
See you.

[02:55:48.350 --> 02:55:49.350]
Now, by the way, is that in here?

[02:55:49.410 --> 02:55:49.990]
I'm sure it's not.

[02:55:50.110 --> 02:55:52.230]
I'm going to check though to be a hot non-salt.

[02:55:52.530 --> 02:55:53.050]
Oh, there it is.

[02:55:53.430 --> 02:55:54.890]
New from Bobco Foods.

[02:55:55.050 --> 02:55:57.890]
It's the all-new taste enhancing palate pleasureing wonder sauce,

[02:55:58.090 --> 02:55:59.530]
just in time for barbecue season.

[02:55:59.790 --> 02:56:01.130]
It's gay one steak sauce.

[02:56:01.450 --> 02:56:02.030]
Pile it on.

[02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:03.410]
Your taste buds will thank you.

[02:56:03.570 --> 02:56:06.370]
Whether you're having a rump roast or a thick hearty tube steak,

[02:56:06.770 --> 02:56:07.810]
gay one makes it better.

[02:56:08.070 --> 02:56:10.050]
My bottom-round roast was the hit of the party.

[02:56:10.050 --> 02:56:12.990]
And my tube steak goes down easy thanks to gay one steak sauce.

[02:56:13.130 --> 02:56:15.130]
Gay one steak sauce is not available in stores.

[02:56:15.130 --> 02:56:17.270]
Just call 1-800 gay sauce and we'll drop it.

[02:56:17.390 --> 02:56:19.110]
Two full of gay sauce right in your mailbox.

[02:56:19.570 --> 02:56:20.270]
Are you on a diet?

[02:56:20.650 --> 02:56:22.350]
Gay one steak sauce is low in calories.

[02:56:22.610 --> 02:56:23.810]
But high in protein.

[02:56:24.130 --> 02:56:25.190]
Gay one steaks sauce.

[02:56:25.430 --> 02:56:26.570]
Packin' in the flavor.

[02:56:27.030 --> 02:56:27.970]
Now, we're going to do that.

[02:56:28.130 --> 02:56:29.290]
See, the consultant is going to let us,

[02:56:29.310 --> 02:56:30.810]
our us critique of passion clones.

[02:56:31.930 --> 02:56:33.530]
So anyway, so she's not working tonight.

[02:56:33.650 --> 02:56:34.310]
Did she tell you why?

[02:56:34.490 --> 02:56:35.190]
She going to...

[02:56:35.190 --> 02:56:36.090]
Bob pizza for everybody.

[02:56:36.250 --> 02:56:37.510]
I'm having somebody taste her right now.

[02:56:40.470 --> 02:56:42.690]
Just remember the one who comes to you with this pizza.

[02:56:42.710 --> 02:56:44.010]
That's the Chigarine Woodpile.

[02:56:45.730 --> 02:56:46.090]
157.

[02:56:46.250 --> 02:56:47.970]
Hey, welcome to W-I-D, Aaron K.

[02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.990]
Whatever your name is, okay?

[02:56:49.230 --> 02:56:49.950]
And cut it out.
