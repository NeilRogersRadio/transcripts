[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.440]
610 W I O D Miami Fort Lauderdale

[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.080]
610 W I O D presents the Neil Rogers Show

[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.480]
The talk with Neil calls 622 W I O D and Dave

[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.520]
767 W I O D and ground

[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.320]
Somebody on this station said cracky head

[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.320]
Why are you just going to call it when I dream that

[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.820]
Somebody on a run and a ride you'll say cracky head

[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.260]
They go forward and I just lean across the nation

[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.260]
And somebody on this station called toll free at 1-888-474

[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.380]
Did some trailer park trash say and now the Neil Rogers Show

[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.320]
Hey Brian, are you happy?

[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.920]
I hate W I O D again

[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.560]
I suck my d- I'll be no happy

[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.580]
Are you sure?

[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.080]
No, I'm not just foul and distasteful

[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.940]
The dolphins are cursing and man it's distraightful

[00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.240]
Cause Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying

[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.000]
Somebody take my b-

[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.020]
She got you, mother f-

[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.560]
Words of love, they toss in the microphone

[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.820]
The dump button just can't seem to be left alone

[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.620]
And all of this is because they like saying

[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.760]
Somebody take my b-

[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.500]
She got you, mother f-

[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.200]
Okay

[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.940]
Oh, but they play football badly

[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.860]
I'm so bad

[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.040]
How did the patriots kick their ass?

[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.580]
Somebody take my b-

[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.620]
Well, they make it to the Super Bowl

[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.100]
But with an attitude as bad as theirs

[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.340]
They were, they tossing our hopes down the stairs

[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.800]
Oh, man, rude, obnoxious foul and distasteful

[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.640]
The dolphins are cursing and man it's distraightful

[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.400]
Cause Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying

[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.780]
Somebody take my b-

[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.680]
She got you, mother f-

[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.720]
Oh, they're saying

[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.660]
Somebody take my b-

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.800]
She got you, mother f-

[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.500]
She got you, mother f-

[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.240]
I like it

[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.260]
So did somebody on this radio station

[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.280]
Some cracker from some trailer park say

[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.840]
Crackhead Nigger Horror on Ron and Ron show it about the 10 minutes before the hour

[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.500]
Did I dream that? Was I having like hallucinations?

[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.820]
Did I just imagine that?

[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.020]
I mean, I realized that that show was geared strictly toward trailer park trash

[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.960]
toward Redneck Yahoo's with big pickup trucks and dobermans

[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.800]
Excuse me, I like dobermans, pit bulls

[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.860]
But I mean, what the hell was that?

[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.500]
And then they left her on the air, that was the best part, okay?

[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.180]
Redneck Central, baby, that's where it's at

[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.720]
Crackhead Nigger Horror

[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.760]
And the caller they were referring to was somebody that said

[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.420]
Hey, you guys with your racist crap, you're all done

[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.000]
And you know what, I think she had a point

[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.400]
I think she had a point

[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.060]
I mean, I could be wrong about that, but I think she had a point

[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.420]
In fact, my prediction is in just a few months

[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.200]
There will not be one show left on this radio station that was on it

[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.160]
Back on September 30th of 1996

[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.640]
Anybody want to take me up on that?

[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.640]
Other than of course, what's the one we got on the way?

[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.840]
Toys for Graham, he'll still be on here

[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.420]
He's got the naked pictures that Steven J. Gay

[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.940]
Now I understand that the new regime does not like those special interests

[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.340]
Okay, like I said, they're all out including that bitch Irene Richard

[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.540]
They don't like those shows, what they do like is some of what I heard last night again

[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.060]
Oh my God

[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.320]
Oh my God, did I tell you that Walter Sabre was the anti-Christ or not?

[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.620]
By the way, happy paysock

[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.180]
And I'm really pissed off at the Sunsend or from putting these old Jews

[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.900]
On the front page of the paper

[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.720]
Oh hey, man, look, there's a Jew

[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.480]
Yeah, do you see that?

[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.840]
You see what they got on the front page?

[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.800]
All these, and if you read the caption which nobody does

[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.860]
The headlines says celebrating the start of Passover

[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.340]
And it shows all these Stone Age, all Haseedum there with their pay us in their heavy coats

[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.020]
And God, they must smell really good

[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.080]
And they got a fire going over there

[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.600]
They got the burning bush on fire

[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.640]
And it says preparing for paysock

[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.720]
Altra Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem

[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.780]
Use bonfires to burn 11 food items or objects tainted by them

[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.240]
Oh my God, they're burning it over there

[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.860]
People are starving to death, they're a bunch of shleppers over there

[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.900]
They haven't had a meat in their meal in the last six years

[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.320]
And they're burning crap because it's 11

[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.560]
So anyway, getting back to a Walter Sebel

[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.920]
And the stuff I heard last night

[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.420]
I mean, I hate to break the news to you

[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.260]
But all of these trite little cute topics that people are bringing up now this topic driven

[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.300]
Which I told you was going to happen that they denied it because they lie a lot

[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.720]
I told you that's their idea of what a talk show is all about

[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.580]
Of course they're going to sell it anyway so who cares

[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.480]
But what did I tell you?

[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.680]
Oh no, we're not going to do that

[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.640]
It was hot button topics baby

[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.340]
So last night we had what's your name?

[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.540]
We had Aaron Keon and also the ski master

[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.200]
Who's not a bad guy by the way, he's a pretty good guy

[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.940]
Kind of like a doll on the ear, you know what I'm saying?

[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.400]
But nevertheless, she was talking about some story from Kansas

[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.700]
About some guy that gave his girlfriend a $9,000 engagement ring

[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.020]
First of all, who in his right mind unless they're loaded

[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.380]
Unless they're, gives anybody a $9,000 ring

[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.500]
Unless they're out of their mind

[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.560]
And then they split up does he get the ring back

[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.460]
And she's reading this article over and over

[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.040]
Somebody's got a call and of course like three or four insipid calls

[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.840]
Then we had here about water again

[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.160]
How they were house looking for houses

[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.360]
And water doesn't want to send a lease because they're not married

[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.380]
Anyoddy, yoddy, yoddy

[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.120]
And then ski gets on Aaron he's doing a thing about

[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.200]
About service in retailers

[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.500]
I really can't even tell you what the topic was

[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.940]
I can't put my finger on it

[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.360]
And all I hate to break the news to all these experts who have come up with this

[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.300]
And they're going to come in here to try to reinvent w-i-o-d

[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.640]
Which is what I predicted months ago

[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.260]
All of these tight little cute topics years

[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.760]
They've already been done over and over and over again

[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.700]
And they're bible by the way which Walter Sabo was the president of

[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.480]
This talker's magazine

[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.220]
Which you notice this is all over the building now

[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.300]
If you're looking at another copy of talker's magazine

[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.820]
Even I'm on the mailing list now

[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.020]
So if we want to start our own bonfire we got some good stuff

[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.400]
Here's the talker's 10

[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.040]
Here's the top 10 hot topics

[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.320]
Here are those hot topics that we can get those peaks of 20 shares with

[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.120]
Like buddy bud would say

[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.620]
Peaks of 20 shares if we just listen to Walter

[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.860]
Number one, cults and madness

[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.080]
Number two, science

[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.360]
Number three, politics and scandal

[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.480]
Number four, the legal system

[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.060]
Number five, conspiracies

[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.000]
Ooh it must be the trilateral commission

[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.960]
It must be the new world order

[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.940]
That's responsible for that crack head nigger horror call on that show this morning

[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.200]
Can you believe that?

[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.020]
And they left around the air

[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.560]
That's the best part of the whole deal

[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.520]
You saw my reaction

[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.320]
Crack head nigger whole

[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.200]
What the hell is that?

[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.320]
Man, oh man, number six is natural disasters like the run and run show

[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.540]
Number seven is sports

[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.140]
So we don't want to talk about that not here

[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.320]
Number eight gay rights and lifestyle

[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.380]
Number nine, arts and entertainment

[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.720]
And number ten, relationships and gossip

[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.920]
Those are the top ten, those are the hot topics

[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.520]
They're going to put WIOD over the top

[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.040]
I say, by the way, Phil Henry and could have been here today is doing a deposition

[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.560]
That's why I played that thing at the beginning

[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.100]
Just, you know, for little nostalgia

[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.560]
For little nostalgia because you know what?

[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.600]
Back in those days, back before this new regime took over

[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.720]
When Rick and Suds were struggling in the morning but never less doing okay

[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.800]
And I was sitting here fun a little long in the mid days with seven and eight shares

[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.280]
And Phil Henry was in the afternoon entertaining the hell out everybody

[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.320]
And even the sex bitch at night, you know something

[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.760]
Compared to what we got certain hours which I don't want to mention no names

[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.100]
She wasn't all so bad

[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:04.380]
Her biggest problem except for that fake voice in the a phony laugh was the fact that she ran out of topics after the second week

[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.400]
But she was another graduate of the Walt Sabo School of Media remember

[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.620]
Oh but you don't know who is coaching her every day

[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.820]
Harry penis

[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.140]
Coaching every day on the topics that is

[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.840]
I mean every single day

[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.000]
And she was a big star up there in Orlando

[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]
See I hate to break the news to these guys but what plays in Orlando

[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.060]
Ain't necessarily going to play here. This is a Mickey Mouse place

[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.100]
But not quite as Mickey Mouse is Orlando which is a real real nose pick in place

[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.860]
I mean it's like light years ahead of Tampa but it's still a real real serious nose pick in place

[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.980]
Up there in Orlando lots and lots of Bible thuppers and good old boys

[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.680]
I mean if you took Disney World out of there all you got is a bunch of fruit growers

[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.960]
And a few fruits and that's basically all you got that's Orlando for you

[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.660]
So anyway I hate to break the news to these experts that are going to reinvent this radio station

[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.260]
But all those great trite topics they've all been done until they're coming out of your ears

[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.240]
Nobody wants to hear about service in God damn Florida okay

[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.980]
Nobody wants to hear about it

[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.980]
Nobody gives a flying crap about hearing about what's your name is dating the you know after the first five weeks of that

[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.340]
Enough is enough already okay

[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.680]
I want to hear more about the ear wax though

[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.760]
I want to hear more about those cute tips

[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:22.400]
Do you know what I'm saying? That's what we all want to hear a lot more about is that waxy build up

[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.180]
Because because behind that whole thing there's something really I can't put my finger on

[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.660]
Want a lollipop little boy?

[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.360]
I really can't figure out what that's all about

[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.460]
Here's a mobile on W-I-O-D

[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.480]
Neil

[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.020]
Yes sir our first call of the day

[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.560]
This is going to be a great Tuesday man

[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.700]
You are so right you got no idea and the proof is in the pudding because nobody called in

[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.580]
There was such a low and phone calls you couldn't believe it

[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:47.800]
Yeah

[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.620]
And she was just grabbing for work

[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.700]
She must have read that article 400 times in an hour and a half

[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.160]
And how come she was only on for two hours and the ski for Msky was on what's that all about?

[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.600]
She ran out of things to say it was almost embarrassing

[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.440]
What do you mean by that?

[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.120]
She had nothing to say and nobody called in

[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.920]
So she just left?

[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.680]
There were times with nobody was talking

[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.040]
What do you mean?

[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.220]
Did we just dead air?

[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.540]
Just for you have for a moment

[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.180]
You could have a woodburning maybe she would have had a woodburning

[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.900]
You better watch yourself mister

[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.040]
You better watch yourself because she's in tight with the consultant man

[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.760]
This is a joke

[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:30.980]
This is like I was listening to the stuff that was going on on and off on this station last night in between 85 hockey games

[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.420]
And I'm going to tell you something it's enough to make me cry

[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.460]
What are these people thinking about?

[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.380]
I don't know when we listen in the evenings but I got to tell you something

[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.300]
They must think we're in Jacksonville South Carolina or somewhere

[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.060]
They don't they have no clue

[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.420]
They have they're totally out of touch with what this place is all about

[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.540]
You're right

[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.560]
But hey, have a great day

[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.220]
Thanks a lot

[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:52.720]
Okay

[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.080]
Hey, that's the first day of Pasa or what the hell you want

[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.100]
Look at that board we got we got no calls here today

[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.500]
Panta is playing the Rangers in New York tonight

[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.640]
I'm going to play all my hockey huts stuff today

[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.540]
I got some great exciting stuff I got Rick Jennerette

[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:11.940]
I got Bob Cole from one Edmonton tie that came up on Sunday night with three goals in a minute and 56 span

[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:19.280]
I got some great stuff because I'm not going to say to read talk about some asshole paid $9,000 for an engagement ring in Kansas somewhere

[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.980]
And should he get it back?

[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.280]
You know something I don't care if he gets it back

[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.960]
Do you care if he gets it back?

[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:26.960]
I don't care

[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.500]
I do care about that crackhead nigger or comment on Ron and Ron this morning

[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.740]
Next thing they're going to be talking about the hurricane football team

[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.040]
I mean what the hell is that?

[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.040]
And if anybody can't tell the difference I feel really sorry for you okay

[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.520]
Okay, let's take these hot topics one by one

[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.920]
Cults and madness what do you say

[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.260]
622 W

[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.180]
What do you mean by that?

[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.540]
No, that's the way she did it last night she read the article

[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.600]
She read like a little blurb out of it

[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.760]
Okay, he spent $9,000 he wants to ring back okay

[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.880]
622 W.I.O.D. it's called contrived man contrived

[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.780]
And be sure and present it in such a way that it'll really get the audience whipped up into a frenzy

[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.900]
Contrived controversy what do you think are you pissed off or what?

[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.560]
There we go let's get him pissed man

[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.600]
It's a pay song it's even a work day today for teachers

[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.540]
Why can't they just be honest and say it's a Jewish holiday

[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.920]
Why can't they say that?

[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.700]
The Jews are celebrating pay song today they're eating cardboard

[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.500]
What's wrong with telling kids the truth?

[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.660]
Oh, it's a teachers a work day isn't that what they're calling it by the way?

[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.000]
Teachers work day when it's a glial show holiday when it's Easter

[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.160]
It's Easter it's Christmas it's Easter it's whatever

[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.740]
Which I guess basically that's it

[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.320]
But when it's a Jewish holiday it's never like a Jewish holiday

[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.980]
Because Jews are a small minority so it's a teachers work day today

[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.480]
We got to pacify the Jews you know that's the way it goes

[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.620]
Kind of crap is that it's pace it's pace over man

[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.960]
Oh God I'm gagging on something here I think they got the poison gas going again speaking of Hermann Gehring

[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.800]
I think they're piping a poison gas in here the Paxing people

[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.580]
I wouldn't be surprised if Walter Sebo has got his fine finger in that

[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.640]
Or maybe his fine q-tip is stuck in the middle of this conspiracy

[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.380]
And conspiracies is number five on the list by the way

[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.680]
Let's talk about the Paxing conspiracy that's one of those hot topics

[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.480]
That sure to get his peaks of 20 shares

[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.040]
They don't like all that inside talk. Oh, that's right

[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.960]
Let's see we don't like the inside talk we don't want people talking about W.I.O.D. because nobody cares about the station

[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.520]
We don't want to talk about any of the things that are going on inside

[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.660]
We don't want the producers talking on the air. Sorry

[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:31.720]
Asshole

[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.560]
We want those hot button topics let's get back to what it's all about

[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.560]
Okay, what do you think war or peace?

[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.660]
Life or death? Right or the far right or the far left?

[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.620]
Has it him with long a piece?

[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.960]
Who's got the better dreadlocks the Hasidim or Ronnie B?

[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.840]
That's our poll question today, okay?

[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.760]
Crackhead nigger whore what what kind of animal?

[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.040]
What kind of piece of redneck trailer park trail she's on Jenny Jones today?

[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.080]
Okay, be sure to check that out

[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.920]
Comes up with a comment like that

[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.680]
See those guys haven't figured it out yet this ain't Tampa

[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.840]
They haven't figured that out yet

[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.180]
And to show you what geniuses the Paxen people are

[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.720]
Their show goes off the year at nine o'clock in Tampa on a station that they own

[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.300]
Paxen owns the station they cut their show off at nine o'clock in the morning

[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.280]
Which was their home base up until three four months ago

[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.400]
Can you figure that out?

[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.620]
I mean how many cubic sir Coney is the half to buy before you can figure what that's all about

[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.240]
Six ten W.I.O.D.

[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.460]
Oh Neil Rodden, what are those on your feet shoes?

[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:40.960]
What else?

[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.080]
S.O.C.K.S.

[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.460]
You just said kiss my ass in Cantonese

[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.260]
Oh, I'm sorry

[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.320]
Don't be sorry, hey what's that around your waist?

[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:48.620]
About?

[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.240]
Spell it

[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.780]
You just told someone to f*** off in Zulu

[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.420]
Oh my

[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.700]
And that's just one of the many techniques you'll learn with the National Profaniks language cassette program

[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:04.200]
National Profaniks can have you cursing in Spanish, French, Italian, German, and a host of other languages in just a few weeks

[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.520]
So call 1-800-F*** you today

[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.160]
Because the most important thing you'll need to know about other cultures is how to tell somebody off

[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.540]
Say buddy S-O-C-K.S.

[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.380]
Okay, okay 10-19 at W.I.O.D.

[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.200]
Here's a lady in Miami, hello

[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.020]
Hi

[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:20.900]
Yes ma'am

[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.520]
I got a change of topic for you today

[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.740]
What do you think about mandatory sterilization for kids who are on adults who are on welfare

[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.820]
That have more than three kids with three different fathers

[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.880]
Well how come your radio is up in the back first of all?

[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.720]
I think they're definitely ought to be mandatory sterilization for trailer park trash

[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.960]
Do you think it's that farly just civil rights?

[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.160]
Did you hear what I just said?

[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:41.540]
Yeah

[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.160]
Yeah

[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.760]
I think that anybody who lives in a trailer park first that we should do that by the end of the week

[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.900]
Sterilize everybody in America who lives in a trailer park

[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.400]
Sounds good

[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.480]
That's a good start?

[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.180]
Sounds good

[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.300]
Then I think that anybody who makes under 50 grand a year they ought to be sterilized

[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.980]
Because they can't afford to raise kids

[00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.480]
Right

[00:15:59.480 --> 00:15:59.940]
Right

[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.240]
I think that what will happen is we'll form a commission and you and I can be the co-chairman

[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.480]
And we'll decide who can reproduce and who can't

[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:07.620]
Okay

[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.380]
No seriously I am all for four sterilization

[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:15.360]
I think that if people can't pass if their IQ is like smaller than their penis size

[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.180]
That those guys should be sterilized

[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:22.820]
And women whose IQ is smaller than their breast size must be sterilized immediately

[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.520]
Well America's biggest problem is dumb people reproducing

[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:26.920]
Right

[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.500]
Dumb people making more dumb babies

[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.120]
Happy people don't even know who the father is

[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.380]
Right

[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.740]
Okay I just want to get your opinion

[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.280]
Okay see you at the trailer park

[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.900]
Okay we have a day lines wide open here

[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.140]
Come on we got a hot topic going here today we can get these peaks of 20 shares

[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.160]
And we get this one going

[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.480]
Let's yank it and rip it and pull it and squeeze it and pound it

[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.120]
And bang away at it until they finally get pissed off about it

[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.180]
That's the way you work this thing

[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:50.560]
Okay

[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.760]
$9,000 for an engagement ring

[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.220]
Oh that's the wrong one okay with him

[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.900]
Okay here we go

[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.440]
So anyway sterilization

[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.560]
Well you got to get in the right page I got my list here I got my 3x5 cards

[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.040]
It's the stabilization of WIOD

[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.480]
Come on 622 WIOD we're going to have a wild day here today man

[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.600]
622 9463

[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.120]
2 and Broward 767 WIOD

[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.980]
The purple one the mobile one line

[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.200]
Whatever that thing is pounded purple at pound IOD

[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.180]
Let's hear it

[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.120]
$9,000 for an engagement ring

[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.040]
He wants it back

[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.000]
Should we sterilize him or what?

[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.020]
Should we sterilize consultants is what I say that would be the best idea

[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.840]
Let's bring back Aaron Summers is what I said

[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.960]
And really you know what this broad is doing

[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.360]
She's doing like a watered down Aaron Summers thing without the insects

[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.460]
Are you following what I'm saying?

[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.100]
It's like watered down without the sex

[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.580]
And there's no spots in there anyway when you come right down to it

[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.560]
So why not just shut off the thing at 9 o'clock sounds good to me

[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.980]
Here's coconut creek hello

[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:49.760]
Hi

[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.540]
Yes sir

[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.060]
Listen I'm all for sterilization of trail attract

[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:55.700]
Yeah

[00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:01.780]
And as for your question about what kind of person could say crack head nigger hoe

[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.040]
Well that's got to be one of them fish people

[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.560]
So can spear a cults and

[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.720]
Are you saying to me that she might be a born again Christian?

[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.500]
She might be an expert

[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:15.000]
That's probably attending a prayer meeting at the Paxen headquarters today in Tampa somewhere

[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:15.880]
Absolutely

[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.840]
And what I want to say about cults and events

[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.660]
Yes

[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.340]
Yes

[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.160]
What about science?

[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.360]
Don't start giving over my topics here man

[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.900]
You're going to screw it all up for me

[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.160]
What about science?

[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.620]
You just said cults and events science?

[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:28.320]
Yeah

[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.160]
Science rules

[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:29.680]
Okay

[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:30.940]
Okay

[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:31.560]
Excellent

[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.520]
Number one, cults and madness

[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.880]
Well the greatest cult of all is them fish people

[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.640]
Christianity, the number one cult in the world today that's right

[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.760]
And it's caused more madness

[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.120]
More murder, more mass may him right?

[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.120]
Absolutely than any other so-called cults

[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.600]
So I think it's interesting I think it's interesting that the mafia people are like very big in the Roman Catholic Church

[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.660]
Because the Christian religion taught them how to give people off or they couldn't refuse

[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:00.780]
Absolutely

[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.660]
And it melts in your mouth, not in your hand

[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.020]
Exactly

[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.980]
I think you covered all ten

[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.920]

[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.500]
Here's Pompano on a mobile hello

[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.220]

Natural spring water in honor of Passover how do you like that?

[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.820]
How does water get to be kosher?

[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.740]
The rabbi comes and squirt squirt does a little number in it

[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.900]
That's right

[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.780]
Neil now listen

[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.940]

They had no idea how to put together a radio station

[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.260]
What do you think the new station is going to be any better?

[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.060]

[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.300]
I'm glad you're bailing Walter Sabo has taken over this radio station

[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.240]
It was a bloodless coup because the Paxon people bought it

[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:24.300]
They don't have the foggiest idea what to do with it or what it's all about so here's Walter Sabo sold them a bill of goods

[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.600]
I'll come in and show you what it's all about I'll show you how to make it into a Bush league talk station

[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.260]
And man is he ever going to do it trust me when I tell you

[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.660]
WGVA and Geneva never had nothing on us to give him about six months it's going to be dynamite

[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.440]
Sounds like Mike on the have a great day

[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.040]

[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.840]
Pound IOD on a mobile one purple line we have an open line and date 622 WIOD we have unbroward

[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:10.980]
7679 463 this misconception that everybody who's a Gentile is somehow a trailer park trash type

[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.920]
I think that this is one of the grotesque generalizations

[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.760]
What you're what are you smiling about?

[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.660]
Do hoole but hoole was don't live in trailer parks do they not as rule can't afford it

[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:29.860]
Okay, here's Miami Beach hello good morning you sir I turned on WIOD last night at midnight to get some ball scores

[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:38.680]
Yeah and that guy named Jackie was on ski was on yeah yeah what's the deal I haven't got any idea in fact George who makes out the schedule

[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.900]
When I was asking him about it this morning you looked at me with kind of a blank look like huh?

[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.800]
I just did he was talking about no not k ski he kept saying k

[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:53.460]
He was talking about his wife toenails that she clipped and found on the he found on the

[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.980]
Oh wait a minute that's topic number seven yeah topic number seven toenail clippings

[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.060]
Yeah and he didn't want to get rid of him but he didn't know what to do with him

[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.940]
Oh my god just lick him

[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:11.820]
Yeah he kept repeating the same thing you know something it's you it almost be like a joke you think it's a put on but but they're serious

[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.680]
Because this is what they've been brainwashed into believing is how you do it here this is how they want to do the station

[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:27.160]
They're going to make it into light bulb junior are they light bulb light are they thinking that people are tuning in and tuning out so quickly that they have to keep repeating the same thing over and over and over again

[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.000]
Yeah especially at that hour the night

[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:37.980]
God beautiful beautiful beautiful so what do you do with those toenail clippings anyway I don't know how I made a necklace let him fly in all directions what I do let the dogs have

[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:44.420]
Have a happy bye bye happy a forum even though it's the wrong holiday we don't care let's have some

[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:50.640]
Homotouch and the food is much better on forum time and also at Hanukkah mobile one purple line is waiting on you today pound

[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:57.980]
I OD we have an open line and date 6 2 2 9 4 6 3 1 and Broward 7 6 7 we're inviting straight people and

[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:05.040]
Goiim to call it today which you're nearly there excluded of course but they will make an exception because it's a tough day it's paysock baby it's

[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:12.340]
The day when the orthodox Jews there that embarrasses that humiliates I find that so degrading reminds me when I went to school to Michigan state in East

[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:20.620]
Lansing Michigan and of course Michigan state is a state university so the kids who live in Michigan get much cheaper tuition than those out of

[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:27.400]
Staters so there was a kid from Owaso Michigan I could trying to think of his name was Allen something I don't know what his name was kind

[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:36.520]
Like a real Yahoo gay looked like a Yahoo because he was a Yahoo but not a bad kid but he was just a Yahoo he was the good Yahoo but anyway he was from Owaso

[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:49.720]
And of course there were many of us from like from New York and from around other parts outside of Michigan who were Jewish and when he met me I was the first Jew he had ever met

[00:30:50.380 --> 00:31:00.040]
And he thought that there were going to be like horns sticking out of my head and that I have paced like sticking down the sides of my thing and have a beanie sold at the top of my head

[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:12.380]
You didn't show him your tail did you know I did not I didn't even show my back home but now that I think of it now he wasn't that good but at any rate you know this is and you look on the front page of the newspaper

[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:28.940]
You're talking about perpetuating ugly stereotypes like that crackhead nigger horror comment on Ron and Ron this morning and here's these old ultra orthodox Jews which I'm going to say it again nobody reads make one person out of a hundred is going to read the thing underneath a caption

[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:37.520]
They all look at the headline celebrating the start of passing they probably think that's in sunrise all the people are read the sun sent they take a look at that

[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:47.700]
They were looking to picture celebrating the start of Passover here's the fire is burning here's all these get keys with their big coats and their pay us and their big heavy hats looking like something out of those stone age

[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:57.820]
You crazy crazy ultra orthodox Jews you're out of your mind and let me tell you another reason by the way that they're the ones saying now that the only real Jews they're not Jews

[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:15.440]
Because it's a oxy moron there's no such thing as a conservative Jew not possible because liberalism is the essence it's the big forget about you can scrape away the gulf of fish and all the all the mots of balls scrape all of that away put it over there I'll have to be with it in a minute

[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:40.820]
But the bottom line is the fundamental liberalism of the Jewish code of the whole concept of Judaism without that you can't be real Jew I don't care how close to the bone they cut it you know what I'm saying I don't care if you've been sliced so small you're like an acorn like some of the rest of us you still can't be Jewish so the whole concept of that's like Jews for Jesus same same thing ultra right wing Jew can't happen can't be sorry you're out

[00:32:42.380 --> 00:33:10.800]
Here's a mobile in Miami hello hello yes sir I got a question for you yes now I know facts and screwing you over but how come Ron and Ron had Betty boobs or something having a live sex act and they're worried about your program that's so well you're asking me how about giving me an answer I don't know I found out in I found out in the last week that they're doing like live sex stuff during the show I don't care what they do out of the show but during the show they're doing like live sex acts on that

[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:40.800]
show and this and this man is supposedly a goody a man of the cloth and goody two shoes in hallelujah and don't say God damn on here and all this other phony baloney born again bull crap that this company portrays with their Christian ethics in her manual and everything how can you how can you do business the Christian way when you got guys having sex on you're during a morning show I mean afternoon show that's another story what I don't understand that either I don't know why there maybe maybe one of those good Christians can answer it for us today sir I think you should try to get some trying to answer that

[00:33:40.820 --> 00:34:10.220]
maybe somebody out there's got a good head on their shoulders are just a stop us your balls okay I think you're good so you should go to WQA I am going I'm going I'm on my way good for you see you okay I thought they already knew I'm going I'm going I'm going I'm going I'm going I'm going I'm going already okay it's a slow process I'm going someday open line and day six two two we have one and Broward seven six seven the mobile one purple line is open which is a bad sign pound I OD space off course in the orthodox use they can't call us today can I

[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:21.040]
I'm not really sure see how I'm I'm like in limbo and this one on y'all I'm sure they couldn't call and certainly not on shabbos but we're not on the air on shabbos anyway so what differences are make what the hell is shabbos I don't know

[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:32.900]
but on paysock can the orthodox use call us today that's the question right now that this gentleman who just called wants to know can the orthodox use have sex in the morning on a morning show if buddy but facts and don't find out

[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:39.280]
they have to cover their faces and they have to cover it up and are the Mormons still wearing those feel good what do they call those things

[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:48.840]
the holy clothes with little hole in them the sacred garments the secret undergarments are the Mormons wearing their secret undergarments today and which side do they have the little hole on

[00:34:48.840 --> 00:35:02.880]
uh exactly where's the flap of the what temple garments temple garments okay temple garments I thought the Jews would be wearing those I thought

[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:11.180]
that's a good question let's find out today I think slumys has got a sale on them right next to the stale maca you can get one of these real neat hats look like an old Jew

[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:19.260]
I mean take a look at that is that pathetic is that make you want to care make you want to sit down on on a curb somewhere and cry like a baby

[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.160]
taking a look at that you wonder about the condition of the world today this is what people ought to be talking about and they're worried about

[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.740]
the martial apple white huh that faggot who the hell gives a crap about that he's dead already

[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.100]
he's dead who cares about him but you talk about madness and cults this is what they ought to be talking about these

[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:43.240]
geckys here right in the front page of the paper and these born again fish people this is insanity man nobody wants to talk about that

[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.800]
they're too busy talking about let's sterilize everybody we don't like which ain't a bad idea

[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:54.300]
we have an open line in brow at 767 w i o d the purple one line the mobile one line is open which you know that's the barometer

[00:35:54.300 --> 00:36:00.860]
when that line is open you know it's pays off pound i o d we pay for the call mobile one we're desperate today baby

[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:06.900]
we only got 400 calls lined up here so you better get with it pound i o d no music today no music

[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:13.460]
because i've made up my mind that i got my list of i got my three by five cards i got my list of

[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.900]
six hundred hot button topics today and we're going to make it work whether walter sabreux it or not how do you

[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:23.780]
like that because this man is reinvented talk radio as we used to know it he's brought it back to the old

[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:29.040]
old tired boring Ludlow porch i mean we're talking about yahu nose picking crap that even

[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:35.580]
Ludlow porch don't want to talk about that's how bad it is okay let's talk about cult suicides let's talk

[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:41.000]
about the hellbob comment let's talk about the things that nobody in his right mind gives a flying

[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.160]
crap about okay but the consultants and all these talk experts they think this is what you people

[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.140]

what you do you got to have one of their products for example if you replace ports menthol ice

[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.480]
from hydron is a must you'll also want to be sure and use hydron hand lotion because hydron

[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.480]
products moisturize your skin without leaving it feeling greasy because when it gets greasy

[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.820]
have a tendency to drop the quarters on the floor hydron works like this is it dries on your skin

[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:50.940]
it creates an invisible shield that is water insoluble moisture holding long lasting the sheatel

[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:55.440]
lets your skin breathe because it lets the oxygen in in the carbon dioxide out even hydron cleanser

[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.680]
won't take away any skin natural protection the way so many of those other skin care products do

[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:05.620]
hi now i'm uh my am a resident and i just happened to hear the meal talk show

[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.640]
on my way home and i think it's absolutely horrible and i don't understand how anybody

[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.980]
with values and morals or social conscience can allow such a thing to be broadcast on their

[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:21.960]
station this guy is just cursing at people insulting blast feeling just spreading anger and hatred

[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:28.720]
i don't understand that i mean do you have children do you have a family do you care what's going

[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:36.500]
on you know in the world here that that just this bad stuff should be going around someone just

[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:42.060]
venting all their hatred and anger at innocent people i mean he just left somebody crying on the

[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:47.100]
sun the air and uh maybe it's very popular and makes a lot of money for your station but

[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:52.400]
this is really not what the world needs i mean things are bad enough i don't think we need a guy

[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:59.420]
like this and i really find it very offensive and and just horrible i mean how would you like

[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.460]
if your children were listening to that and growing up in a world where this kind of thing is

[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:09.620]
acceptable where people can talk like that and and be pain for it and be endorsed i mean

[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:16.740]
i'm just horrified and disgusted and i'm sure i'm not the only person to feel that way

[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.380]
please try and take consideration of you know the rest of the world and the other people that

[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:28.620]
have to listen to this kind of garbage and i hope you will because this is really something that's

[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:33.520]
not acceptable if you want this world it gets to be a better place this is not the way to do it

[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.140]
all right the who have to listen to this kind of you know as that they have to listen to it they

[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:42.620]
have no other choices of course and either you cheat she's the one to tell us what's acceptable

[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:47.100]
and what's not another good Christian i'm sure she probably got a fish on her thing

[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:53.000]
she's got a fish on her pus but she's going to tell us what's acceptable and what's not hey there's

[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:33.940]
panthers after all season long that's the way they do it and uh don't pithed off well i understand

[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:38.920]
i mean i understand let me say it again do when they have the marlin conflict the game should be on

[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:44.980]
their fm it should be on kiss and if it were if it was my team i would demand that would be on one

[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:49.440]
of their stations not farmed out to this waxy thing okay not that i want to create a problem over

[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:54.200]
there for my close friend Greg read but those games should be on kiss on a fm which people can hear

[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:59.540]
with a post game show well you can straighten it out hey listen sure what happens to the sabers now

[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:04.080]
with the dominator out what do you mean what happens they won the game last night and uh he's day

[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.500]
today he might be back next game you think he'll be back she'll be played great last night what do you

[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:13.140]
complain about well i understand that i mean if he's out for a long period of time i might you

[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:17.320]
know he's not out for a long period of time they said it's day today so it can't be you know that bed

[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:22.580]
okay very good in fact it might it might be uh he doesn't play that great in a playoffs anyway

[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:27.060]
he never has they never go anywhere in a playoffs maybe it's the best thing that happened to him

[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:31.160]
could be because i thought them to be very similar to the panthers last year with great gold

[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:35.220]
tend to they don't have to worry about him they got to get Matthew Barnaby back that's the spark plug

[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:43.160]
that's the guy that uh they need badly okay Matthew Barnaby very good uh rangers to panthers four

[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.280]

[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:37.160]
w i o d happy twos day happy paysox baby don't eat too much motsol your kids out there don't let

[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.060]
your parents force you to eat that crap. It'll kill you man. Sooner or later you're

[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:46.020]
going to die if you eat that crap. So anyway here's some pretty interesting stuff. It says

[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:51.860]
proof that Jesus was Jewish. He went into his father's business. He lived at home until

[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:56.200]
the age of 33. He was sure his mother was a virgin and his mother was sure he was

[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:06.340]
God. Proof that Jesus was Irish. He never got married. He never had a steady job. His

[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:13.640]
proof that Jesus was Puerto Rican. His first name was Jesus. He was always in trouble with

[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:20.280]
the law and his mother didn't know who his father was. Three proofs that Jesus was Italian.

[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:25.880]
He talked with his hands. He had wine with every meal and he worked in the building trades.

[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:32.900]
Three proofs that Jesus was black. He called everybody brother. He had no permanent address

[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:40.460]
and nobody would hire him. Three proof that Jesus was Californian. He never cut his hair. He walked

[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:45.620]
around barefoot and he invented a new religion. All right. What was that? What was that?

[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:50.560]
What was that too? Well got some good facts stuff here today. Some good anti-religious stuff.

[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:55.840]
Thank you so much by the way. The more the merrier from Nick who talks about the

[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:01.160]
contradictions of all this the Bible and all this hocus, focus and bullcrap and has got a whole

[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:09.140]
great list of them here. For example Exodus 20 verse 8. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it

[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:14.560]
holy but then in Romans 14 5 it says one man is steameth one day above another. Another

[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:19.000]
steameth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. In other words,

[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:25.720]
say do whatever the hell you want. On the permanency of the earth ecclesiastes one four, the earth

[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:32.320]
abided forever. Peter the element shall melt with fervent heat the earth also in the works that are

[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:39.660]
there and shall be burned up. Ah. And on and on and on. Here in Genesis it says I've seen God face to

[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:44.880]
face and my life is preserved but in John it says no man has seen God at any time. How do you like that?

[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:50.380]
And it's got a whole list of what two million 485 contradictions in all this biblical gobbledy

[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.660]
book but don't confuse these people with the truth because they want to wear all that heavy clothing.

[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:59.700]
Save that for me please. Okay. We have all the Broward lines. Why don't we hear today?

[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.120]
Man kneel us on the ear. He's like foaming at the mouth. He's ready to rock and roll and Broward is not.

[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:12.460]
What a shock. What a surprise. 767 W. I. O. D. and Broward are topic today. The Halebob comment.

[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.000]
You like it or don't you? How about that tail? Anybody out there one other? It's got a turd tail.

[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:23.940]
Can't be all bad if it's got that many tails. 767 W. I. O. D. The mobile one purple line is open

[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:29.760]
pound I. O. D. Out of town to green lines forget about them. Even to go him up there and

[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:36.320]
Palm Beach or all Jewish today because it's paysox. Here's Halea. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Is this new?

[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:40.200]
Yes it is. Hey new man. This is the first time I ever talked to you man. You're the best.

[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:46.460]
I am. Yes you are. You know it's I'm lucky to be listening today. I had to stay home.

[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:50.320]
Yeah because it's a Jewish holiday today. No because you know I was sick today.

[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:56.320]
Isn't that a holiday indeed? No no seriously they have school in day today.

[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:03.420]
Yeah. Oh my god. What a bunch of anti-semites on paysox. Yeah. Man. No but you know I was like

[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:08.080]
I did the right thing. You did the right thing. Stay at home. No man but you know I've been

[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:12.420]
all listening to you from almost two years now you know you're the best man for me. Yes I am.

[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.260]
Say it again. I do the man. I don't know why people bitch about your show man.

[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:20.460]
Because they can't deal with the truth because they're a bunch of mental cripples that's why

[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:25.220]
they're emotional cripples. Listen to it. That's right. I know that's true man. Well can I

[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:29.600]
pick off somebody douchebag? Go ahead. My brother Abraham and his girlfriend Vicki

[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.160]
her a bunch of douchebag. And brother his name is Abraham. Yeah. Is he Jewish?

[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:38.600]
Yes. Have a great day pal. All right. Happy paysox. Hello. All right. Okay we have an

[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:46.340]
here's a Julio with a brother's name Abraham. A.B. Hey A.B. Okay. Open line. No his sister's name is

[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:51.760]
K. Indeed. 629 463. We have Broward County. We're still waiting on Broward. Look at this. Look at

[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:56.380]
this on paysox. No less. You're going to burn in purgatory if you don't call me today and talk

[00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:02.860]
about life on Europa. If you don't talk about golf and tag your woods today man. Let's hear

[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:07.160]
about tag. Oh and speaking of golf by the way. Another little contra-dumps. I don't see Michael Mayo

[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:13.620]
writing no column about this. About fuzzy zealard. Don't you love that name fuzzy zealard. Another

[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:20.200]
golf hole. He said Monday he was only joking when he was suggested that Tiger Woods not make fried

[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:25.000]
chicken and collared greens. The featured dishes at the champions dinner next year at the

[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.600]
Masters. But he says he'll apologize if Woods is offended. And by the way Tiger Woods made some

[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:34.160]
anti-dike comments in an interview that he didn't know we're going to be printed too. So all

[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:40.340]
these golfers are nothing but a bunch of far-bisoned goy-m. So David Halberstam just makes a little

[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:45.260]
a little comment that was much into about nothing and people are trying to get his ass fired which by

[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:50.260]
the way Michael Mayo still hasn't apologized yet. And fuzzy zealard says something about collared

[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:55.540]
greens and fried chicken. And Ron and Ron have got some bitch on there talking about crack head

[00:57:55.540 --> 00:58:01.120]
nigger hose and nobody cares about that. I don't see where Michael Mayo calling to write a

[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:09.200]
column about that. Oh, there's kosher waters killing me. Oh God. Open line of date 622.

[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:16.800]
Broward County last call and Broward 767 W I O D. We got the big game. The Rangers and the Panthers

[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:25.240]
in New York tonight. Any interest whatsoever. Any interest in anything today. If I spent $9,000

[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:33.340]
on an engagement ring for my dog. And Karen case swallowed it. And the ring too. Would you take it

[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:38.920]
back? That's the question today. Okay. I had one in my mouth once. Here's Miami. Hello. Now. Yes.

[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:44.420]
Oh, I'm there. Let's get with it. I didn't want to get French or anything but I hate listening to the phone.

[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:49.260]
Yeah. What's going on? I haven't talked in a long long long long. Not a goddamn thing going on

[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:53.420]
this place. This is dead as a door nail. We've got to wake these bastards up. Get some of these hot

[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:57.740]
button topics to get these people going. But you get them pissed off. You're still in room for

[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:02.100]
dude. Yeah. I'm going to be in room for them all day today. I feel great. I'm finally over this crap.

[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:06.540]
I've had for 15 weeks. I'm finally all healed up and ready to rock and roll in this town. They just

[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:12.220]
can't do it. Well, let me give you some of the places. So dead. This town is so dead. It's dead. Isn't

[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:18.020]
this a dead place? That kind of God. But listen, when I was when you were there screaming for calls,

[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:22.700]
like casually walked over and called you. Now, if you would have said the magic words, I would have

[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:28.560]
ran and jumped for the phone. In reek. Oh Louise. Oh Louise. You don't like Louise? You don't

[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:34.480]
like Louise? Oh, what's not to like? Oh Louise, do not. How about you? Say I'm going to play

[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:41.840]
Louise. How about in reek. Uh Louise Miguel. But you don't mind in reek. I think you got a

[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:46.320]
thing for in reek. No, not really. But it's just like last time I told you when you had said,

[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.820]
I'm going to start playing Louise Miguel songs. Somebody doesn't start calling. Yeah. I mean, I jumped.

[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:54.560]
I'm going to start. I'm going to start playing Rick Riley bits of people don't call.

[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:03.880]
That'll do it. What station is, um, is, um, uh, still had me on in the California. KFI. KFI.

[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:10.100]
FI 50,000 watts. How do you call? You were letting all you doing or anything like that? We talked

[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.940]
to him on Friday. We called him and we'll come up. He's doing great. He's doing excellent. He's

[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:17.380]
doing great. There's some assholes think that he wants to come back here. I got news for you. He's

[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:22.240]
only here for those depositions and that stupid Brian Cox lawsuit. And once he gives the last word

[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.500]
on that, he's on a plane and out of here. The best anybody that gets out of here, they'd have to be

[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:31.860]
out of their mind to come back here. Other friend of mine, he was also a big kneeler. You left

[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:37.240]
from here to, um, to Georgia. Right. And he loves it. I said, yeah, he made the big move and

[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:43.380]
not too soon. I can't wait to get out of here. Oh, my, my man. What a place. This place is a

[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:49.260]
point. The people are like about as friendly as a cobra. What's up with that lady? I

[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:55.440]
I didn't go for a couple of minutes. I thought it was like a joke. I thought Aaron was back.

[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.000]
Karen Kay makes Aaron Summers sound like Walter Cronkite on a great day.

[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:08.980]
She is unacceptable. Exactly. But what do you put? What did you find her? How did you get her on

[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:13.100]
the show? She's the girlfriend of the consultant. The Walter Sabo's girlfriend. Haven't you heard her say

[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:18.220]
that 4,000 times? I did hear you say that. There you go. Incredible. I'm sure that had nothing to do

[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:23.640]
with the fact she's got the job, but just a coincidence. But she doesn't talk about anything. Yeah.

[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:29.540]
She's got the hot topics, baby. She's got the hot topics. What do you think? Should she give the ring

[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:36.260]
back or not? Should she give the freaking ring back or not? Oh, well, this asshole spends nine grand

[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:41.300]
on an engagement ring. They break up. He should get the ring back, right? Yeah. I think they ought to

[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.500]
stick their ring in his neck. That's what I think. Incredible. Have a great day, Pat.

[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:51.360]
Number one, dude. A rivet archie. Ciao. Now we got two open lines in date. We just can't keep the

[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.500]
going with it today. The Jews, they're busy. They're still doing their satyr thing. They're drinking wine.

[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.060]
They're passed out on the floor too much wine last night from their big satyr. If it was good enough

[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:06.800]
for Jesus, it's good enough for them. That's what Bonnie said. 1115 at W.I.O.D. Here's something that's

[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.380]
good enough for you. It's family bank. It's good enough for me. Let me put it this way. If it's good

[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:15.240]
enough for me, it's good enough for you. Okay? If family bank, I don't want to sound like arrogant

[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.240]
or condescending, but if family bank is treating me great, they're going to treat you great. It's just

[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:23.640]
as simple as that and they will. They don't care whether you got like five dollars or five

[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:27.480]
million dollars or something in between, which is more likely. They'll take great care of you and

[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.660]
your money. They're not going to make mistakes every five minutes. And if they do make a mistake,

[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:38.460]
they'll look corrected humbly like, oh, we screwed up and what can we do to make you happy? And

[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:42.020]
do actually occasionally, depending on which teller you get, they do stick a lollipop in your

[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:45.440]
thing once in a while just just because they're great people. They got seven convenient

[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.260]
brower locations. They got the lowest service fee in Broward. They got all the features you want.

[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.560]
They have a drive-through that opens early eight o'clock in the morning every day. They're open

[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.540]
Saturday morning even for your convenience. They have eight TM's at all locations. They honor

[01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:00.840]
Syrus, they honor Presto, they honor Honor. And you're just going to love doing business with

[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.060]
these people. The old fashioned way of banking man, they get to know you. They treat you friendly.

[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:09.840]
No big song in a dance when you try to do a transaction. So fire your unfriendly big chain

[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.300]
bank that treats you like a number in a computer. Say goodbye. See you. Give me all my money. See

[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:18.440]
you later. Good luck to you and head for Family Bank. They'll treat you great. Family Bank member

[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:31.980]
FDIC. 16 WIOD. When the Don is in town, she's not listening to us. Okay, 11, 18 at WIOD. We have an

[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:36.300]
open line on the mobile one purple line, which is not doing too good today. See, when that line

[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:40.060]
ain't doing too good, that should be like doing bio rhythms, like doing psychic readings.

[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:45.080]
As soon as that goes out, it should light up again because everybody and their brothers out there

[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:49.360]
driving around. I didn't see no light traffic today. Traffic was heavy duty coming to work.

[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:55.600]
That was all right for me. Huh? But it wasn't lighter than usual just because it's paysock,

[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:59.000]
just because the kids are out of school in Broward. Are you telling me the kids in

[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.040]
day to have to go to school today on a Jewish holiday? Sounds to me like that. Mayor penis must

[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:09.980]
be anti-Semitic, huh? The one that sold everybody out to Mickey Ererson who just happens to be Jewish,

[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.840]
too, by the way. I just thought I threw that in there for good measure. Just in case you didn't

[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:20.100]
know that Alex, you two faced piece of third. Mickey Ererson happens to be Jewish and his daddy

[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:24.200]
Ted is over there in Israel with nine billion dollars that we ain't never going to see no taxes on

[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:30.120]
here. Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Hey, deal. Yes, sir. Are you being great?

[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:35.160]
Rangers are going to kick up. That's what I know. Yeah, I doubt that. Four two Panthers.

[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:40.460]
Four two no. It's already done. Four two Panthers. We have an open line in day at six two two nine.

[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.880]
By the way, get get out from underneath that thing, whatever you're under. Okay. Do you hear the way

[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:49.400]
sound like Lloyd Bridges? Six two two W. I. O. D. in day. We have an open line in Broward. Seven six seven

[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:58.140]
nine four six three. Here's Opalaka. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Science rules. What is it? Science rules.

[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:03.920]
Science rules. Okay, but we already heard that. You're the best. You're the best. Yeah, we know that.

[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.440]
Hey, question. Well, let's move down to list women. Maybe you can give me a quick comment on some of

[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:15.860]
the how about politics and scandal? They can't hand in hand. Legal system. It sucks. Conspiracies.

[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:23.080]
The way of life. Natural disasters. Can't help it. Gay right. Gotta have it.

[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:29.100]
Art the Netter Tamad. Oh, that's the same thing. Relationships in gossip. Go ahead and hand.

[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.780]
I just, Adam was asking for an interesting question. That is that if, oh, who was it? It wasn't Adam.

[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.820]
Somebody was asking an interesting question. That is the water sable breaks up with Karen K. Does she

[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:42.260]
have to give the show back? Of course. Okay. Okay, Neil. Love you.

[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:42.920]
Haha.

[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:49.900]
Two open lines in day six, two, two, nine, four, six, three, gasping for oxygen.

[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:55.580]
As they can try topics, just don't get the job done, sweetheart. It doesn't get the job done.

[01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:01.620]
Because nobody gives a flying crap about some stupid little article out of a newspaper

[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:06.580]
that somebody bought a nine thousand dollar engagement ring in dumb fork Texas somewhere,

[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:11.580]
or Kansas, wherever the hell it was, nobody cares. Actually, I should know it for baited by heart

[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:17.020]
by an other whole article because she read it 65,000 times. Nobody cares. What does it have to do

[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:21.340]
with the price of rice? How does that affect our lives? Why should we care? Oh, it has to do with

[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.660]
relationships. That's right. We're doing relationships without the sex. We're doing errands summers

[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:29.940]
without the spice, without the penis and without the vagina that we're doing it.

[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:38.320]
Here's the lady in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi. Yes, ma'am. First time call up a very long time listener.

[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:43.520]
Great. Neil, want to let you know just well talk about two things. One, the fact that

[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:50.460]
Broward schools are closed today and my son is home. Yeah. They're still a little bit bogus here

[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:56.700]
in that it's a teacher planning day. They did not have the you know what to close the school for

[01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:01.160]
pass over. That's what I just got through sand. If it's a if it's a Goya shaholiday, if it's

[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.420]
Christmas, if it's Easter or some Goya shaholiday, they're closed for Christmas. Okay, but when it's a

[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:10.280]
Jewish holiday and we got to close up to pacify the Jews, then it's a teacher's planning day. It's

[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:15.140]
a teacher's work day. The teachers went to the matinee at Highlight. It's something like that. Why

[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:21.100]
don't they have the cajon's to say it's a Jew day? Oh, absolutely. And better still my last comment.

[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:29.200]
Last night, sitting around first night, satire, family, friends, having a good time. I like it. I like it.

[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:36.320]
Yeah. Yeah. Long rings. Hi, I'm from the Miami Harold. Would you like a subscription? Yeah, Tom,

[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.540]
Cox a hoist. Oh, don't ask what I didn't tell them. And this morning, call circulation vice

[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:48.560]
president and ask if they have solicitors on Christmas Eve calling the subscriptions. Right in the

[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.020]
middle, well, you know, they're anti-Semites at the world anyway. So that proves it. That proves it.

[01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:57.080]
That proves it beyond a shadow of it. The only reason they let Bob Rubin and Howard Kleinberg stay

[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:01.140]
on staff there is because they have to have a couple of tokens. Exactly. Exactly. Well, go

[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:05.500]
panthers tonight or two panthers tonight. Peace of cake. We're going to wake up tonight. We went

[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:09.620]
into a little coma or waking up from your mouth. They had some a pace of power. Pace,

[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:14.020]
aqua and it's a mogen. David. They'll be okay. Well, my surprise. They'll be ready to skate. Okay.

[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:19.440]
Goodbye. See you. So we're our poll question today is where do we find the chocolate mottes?

[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.140]
Brook was having trouble finding that. Brook, by the way, will not be on tonight again because it's

[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:31.120]
it's a pace often. She's real Jewish right now. She. Oh, she's looking. Okay. We have two open

[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:36.060]
lines in day six, two, two. We have one in Broward, two in Broward. It's very weak, very, very weak.

[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.180]
This is always the worst couple of days of the year. Why? Do we have no glam in this audience?

[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:46.700]
Is the whole audience Jews? All those Julios out there while a one guy, even his brother's named

[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:51.660]
Abraham. What does that tell you? Even our Julio listeners are Jews. They're jubens.

[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:57.120]
Six, two, two W. I. O. D. And I'm going to play this Bob Kualtsegment from the Edmonton

[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.960]
Games Sunday. It's about three and a half minutes. Great stuff, man. It'll blow out all the calls,

[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:05.980]
but it's great. I mean, it's scintillating. The last couple of minutes there when Edmonton came

[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:10.060]
from down three, nothing tied it up. And then of course went on to win it over time. Just unbelievable.

[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.980]
Phenomenal. Gut wrenching. Teres your kiscus. Broward County, two open lines in Broward,

[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:21.500]
seven, six, seven, nine, four, six, three. As we we haven't had a call in Palm Beach today.

[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:27.780]
Have we all in a half, not a call on the out of townlines? What the hell did the rabbi do?

[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:31.580]
Squirt score in this kosher water, man. I'm gagging on it. Good God.

[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:39.240]
Nothing nice Jewish scam here. Life kosher water. What's not to like?

[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.340]
And these guys are real comedians. They say, oh, we're having a good time with it. What does that

[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:49.160]
mean? It's got a star of David on it on the label. Does that make it kosher? Does it have a little

[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:54.840]
circle K? It has a circle jerk on it. Yeah. It says a little, does it have a circle you want it?

[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:01.240]
Let's see. It says sodium free big deal. Big Macia. Oh, it says big Macia on it. That's what does it.

[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:06.260]
It don't even have a little circle you want it. How do you like that? Fet. I think it's trife.

[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:11.160]
Let's go to a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey, good afternoon, Neil.

[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:16.180]
When is evening to you? Hey, listen, my new daddy would I'm so excited to talk about it. Yeah.

[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:22.540]
Anyway, this last lady she reminded. Whatever that means. I mean, we don't have anything for new

[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:27.200]
daddy so that'll have to do. Thank you. This last lady reminded me about the incident I had with

[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:34.040]
my new, my new staper delivery person, the Harold. Yes. I was sleeping very soundly one evening and

[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:44.140]
the 550 doorbell rings. So I got my rundown stairs in a in a in a a sleepwalking super.

[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:52.940]
Apparently she had thrown the neighbor's newspaper up and it landed on my roof and she wanted me to

[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:59.960]
get it down for her. And the paper too. Can you believe that? Unbelievable. 550 in the morning.

[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:06.460]
Incredible. I got you down. Have a good day, Neil. Nice call, pal. See you. See you.

[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.300]
Okay, we have a deadline. He's reproducing. Daylines are open. 6229463. All of them. 6222. I think

[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.760]
that guy gave me a good idea before Luis Miguel. Haven't heard a lot of Luis this year.

[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:22.140]
Too much Enrique, not enough Luis. I mean, we love Enrique at least I do. I love him dearly. You have no

[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:28.280]
idea. But Luis, exactly. Luis is so great. In fact, I was coming to work this morning,

[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.500]
listening to Luis during the middle of that show that I don't listen to on our station. And I was

[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:37.640]
taking to myself how come when he does his concerts here? The Harold always has to do this obligatory

[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:42.880]
review where they take a few shots or when he has a new album come out they have to do. They take

[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.520]
a few shots because they know that I am obsessed with Luis Miguel. And therefore, it's the anti-neil

[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.980]
thing. If Neil likes it, we got to knock it. Kind of like excess magazine, New Times, same mentality,

[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:59.300]
same much assholes. Dave County, 6222, WYOD, all alike. What am I doing this for? What am I doing

[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:05.320]
this? Why do I go through this? I'm not even going to be here. I'm a lame duck. I'm not even

[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:09.280]
going to be here. And I'm still pumping and pushing and yanking and pulling and twisting. And with

[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:15.560]
the numbers too. I mean, the guy spent $9,000 on a freaking ring for Christ'sakes. Can't you make a

[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:20.700]
comment about it? If you spent nine grand on a ring, what institution should we stick your ass in?

[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:24.980]
That's the question. And if you brought that as an opposite topic on a talk show,

[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.560]
do you really belong on a year? No. There you go.

[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:30.980]
610 WYOD.

[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:33.740]
Don and Mike blow.

[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.360]
All right.

[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.480]
All right.

[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.260]
1132 WYOD. I'm going to have some more of that stale Shamura Matsu in there. But it gets nice and

[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:32.500]
hard like a brick on the second day. And oh, man, it's great. Nothing like having it on a brick

[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:39.080]
when it's going in and coming out. Here's sunrise. Hello. Happy Paisach, Neil. And back to you, sir.

[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:44.140]
Just before Paisach, I went over to Admiral Coast Restaurant. Yeah. Oh, phenomenal food.

[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:48.720]
Yes, it is. Oh, thank you. While waiting online, though, which also was phenomenal, thank you.

[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:54.500]
Yeah. I walked around the park. Oh, yeah. I found this place called Secrets. Have you been there?

[01:13:54.980 --> 01:14:00.480]
Called what? Secrets. What the hell is that? So, lingerie boutique, adult boutique. No. This place

[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:05.880]
was great. You got to get there. Yeah. Check out their back room. Uh-huh. Well, what's going on in there?

[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:11.920]
Huh? What's going on in there? What's going on there? Last of adult video, Falcons. Everything

[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:17.940]
you could want. Yeah. You'll enjoy it. I promise. All right. Can you do me a favor for my father,

[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:21.140]
the can't do who ran the state of the last two nights? Could you play Rostadjou?

[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:25.080]
Rostadjou? Rostadjou. On Paisach, I'm going to play that.

[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:14.980]
Rostadjou. Rostadjou. I say, I deny. I say, well, you're your boy. How come you don't

[01:15:45.100 --> 01:16:00.220]
do that? I like gochetsu. And I ride the motorbike. Chicken soup with carnada. That's what I like.

[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:11.120]
Have you ever tasted? Cretchfish, fresh and cringe. Flanting and give filter fish.

[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:24.080]
That's much more my speed. Rostadjou. Rostadjou. Rostadjou. Rostadjou.

[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:29.300]
I want me tell you Rostadjou.

[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:40.400]
Oi.

[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.680]
I'm dying out of here.

[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:21.680]
Oi. Rostadjou. Rostadjou. Rostadjou.

[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.680]
Yes, my Rostadjou.

[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.340]
How are you doing? It's like you're smoking a nose-pike, bro.

[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.540]
Rostadjou is keeping your pants on butt.

[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.120]
Rostadjou is getting up and shaking.

[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.680]
Do you want me to come for that?

[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:44.100]
I'm going to get crazy. I'm going to get crazy.

[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:44.760]
I'm going to get crazy. I'm going to get crazy.

[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:51.660]
I'm going to get crazy. I'm going to get crazy.

[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.440]
How much do we just play this all day? I'm obsessed with this.

[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.120]
Oh, right.

[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:11.600]
Just the lick up.

[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.840]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:21.620]
11.37 at WIOD. Happy Passover, man, which is another one of these silly holidays.

[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:26.260]
When everybody sits around, they have a satin, they drink wine, and they eat this, uh, this matzah.

[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:30.040]
Which, by the way, if we had some shmuckers preserved today, man, we'd be shmiering it.

[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.740]
It would be great. Thank you so much.

[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:34.200]
We'd be shmiering it on our shimura matzah.

[01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.960]
Ever shmier your shimura matzah?

[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.880]
Here is a fact that says you are unacceptable.

[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.900]

[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:45.140]

[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:49.060]
all of the list the difference between ron and ron and you was that

[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.600]
everyone knows ron and ron are pure satirical comedy

[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.800]

[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:59.500]

[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.540]
i don't want to work for people who have no idea what the business is all about who want to try

[01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:07.300]

[01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:51.600]

[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:12.760]
to understand

[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:17.720]

[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:30.180]

[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:32.100]

[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:38.020]

[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:39.880]

[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:47.440]
see uh

[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:48.680]
the one

[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:50.500]
we have an open line in the uh-

[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:53.360]
a purple line a mobile one line pound i would do we got all a

[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.200]
browered again we just we just can't get brower's going today man

[01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:00.220]
too many stators too much mana shevids and mogen david

[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:00.960]
and attempt

[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.160]
trying to get going again is mirrored putting up

[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:04.860]
the martshow

[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:05.460]
Homer

[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:06.180]
that

[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:06.460]
that

[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:07.440]
Although bigger Неferi's

[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:13.600]
Bring the

[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:14.860]
Yeah

[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:30.280]
They have

[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:11.320]
the third. I'm going to check the lineup. This Anderson messily and

[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:14.820]
pretzzy in this lineup. They used the score goals and

[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:20.560]
punches and the current edition. The 1997 payoff of this one of the

[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:26.520]
letters are ripping a page out of the historic pass by scoring three in a

[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:31.220]
minute 56ers. Two or four to go and these fans are delighted.

[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:38.200]
Any other half folks this is unbelievable.

[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:40.480]
Absolutely.

[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:45.820]
Surprise new game with a minute 55 seconds left.

[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:50.120]
Three of the series. Three three time.

[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.480]
Three or yet the time goal.

[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:58.080]
While Adela Starr's are going on the attack.

[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:19.260]
What's signed up now?

[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:25.880]
But I'm going to treat it.

[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:25.880]

[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:27.180]
Twoacie.

[01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:27.860]
CK play back to tactical,

[01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:32.340]
and settering him on a save by Joseph and other stop by Joseph and it cleared out a

[01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:33.320]
breakaway comment.

[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:36.700]
Aaron and Breastling in, that's the truck coming back.

[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:38.500]
Aaron is the back of the neck.

[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:41.020]
Setters it, it's paired away.

[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:46.240]
But not out of his own, Miguel has beaten in ready shot all.

[01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:48.080]
That just missed.

[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:51.840]
Dallas now hanging on back under heels.

[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:56.300]
We're in the final minute of the third period in a three-three tie.

[01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:01.960]
An unbelievable turn of events here in Eiffenton 10-Eight.

[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:08.700]
If the audience coming on for them, her posky shot.

[01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:12.960]
It'll go into the crowd, deflecting off the stick.

[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:15.880]
The crowd can't believe it.

[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:17.800]
What am I talking about?

[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:19.760]
I can't believe it either.

[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:20.500]
Unbelievable.

[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:24.080]
That was one of the great sporting events in the history of the human race Sunday night

[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:26.980]
Edmonton, where that great comeback was just spine tingling.

[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:30.200]
If that doesn't, then goose bumps up and down the insides of your neck.

[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:31.020]
Then you're not alive.

[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:32.000]
I'll tell you that right now.

[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:33.040]
You don't know nothing.

[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:35.920]
Broward County, everybody else is a filled up at Broward.

[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:37.800]
What do we got to this problem in Broward today?

[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.580]
What is the story with you assholes in Broward today?

[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:43.580]
If you got some kind of a mental defective problem in Broward today?

[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:44.400]
What is the story?

[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:45.240]
Too much MOTSA?

[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.060]
Too much MOTSA?

[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:49.240]
Too much smear in with the cream cheese and the schmuckers?

[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:50.540]
That's the problem, baby.

[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:51.540]
It'll kill you.

[01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:56.960]
Broward County, 7679, 463, 767WIOD.

[01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:59.620]
What about if he only spent $2,000 for the ring?

[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:00.540]
Does he get it back anyway?

[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:04.040]
What about if he spent $4 million for the ring?

[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:05.800]
I say the word stupid is operative.

[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:09.000]
767WIOD.

[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:11.600]
Let's hear some stuff about Karen K today, okay?

[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:14.940]
Let's hear how great she is and why she was only on for two hours last night.

[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:17.440]
It was enough.

[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.640]
1226 at WIOD.

[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:21.800]
WIOD.

[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:24.700]
Holy MAKA-NAH.

[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:29.260]
This is Joe Bowen, the voice of the Toronto May beliefs and you're listening to the Hockey Authority

[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:30.280]
NEO GOD.

[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:31.200]
Thank you, Joe.

[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:32.780]
1231 at WIOD.

[01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:34.220]
Here's a facts from Sitzel.

[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:37.180]
Sitzel, that's his name, okay?

[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.680]
His name is...

[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.100]
Oi!

[01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:41.220]
Sitzel, can we say that on here?

[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:43.020]
He says I'm a new listener.

[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:45.580]
I understand you were asking if Jews can call you on Passover.

[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.780]
The answer is absolutely...

[01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:48.000]
No.

[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:48.400]
Not.

[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:53.840]
Not only phone calls but no driving, numerous other no-nose, numerous other...

[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:54.440]
No, no.

[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:59.460]
I know because I was... I know because I was religious at one time, says Sitzel.

[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:05.360]
I still believe in God because of a few undeniable miracles that have occurred in my life, but

[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.380]
became tired of feeling guilty all the time.

[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:12.200]
I'm undecided about whether I like your show, but I'll listen for a while before I make

[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:13.520]
up my mind, says Sitzel.

[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.060]
Some things you say offend me, but other things you say make sense.

[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:18.680]
Thank you, Sitzel.

[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:21.600]
Why don't you go back to Canada, you Jew bastard?

[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:26.340]
1232 at WIOD, we have an open line in Dade.

[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:28.780]
Is that like Sitzes?

[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:33.880]
That's right, that's not a dirty word for all you glamour that are tittering right now, okay?

[01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:36.940]
Sitzes is something you wear on... it's like today.

[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:41.340]
On important days, like whenever it's real hot outside and you want to smell bad, you put

[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:46.480]
on your tefillin and your Sitzes and your talus and your Yamaka and your big, big silly

[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:46.760]
hat.

[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:48.740]
Did anybody ever call on tell you what those hats are?

[01:54:49.020 --> 01:54:51.720]
What do we call those hats besides silly and heavy and smelly?

[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:56.600]
What do we call those big Jew hats that they're wearing over there in Jerusalem right now in

[01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:57.060]
a front page?

[01:54:57.220 --> 01:55:00.300]
I'm telling you, I really believe that that was in sunrise, not in Jerusalem.

[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:02.040]
Look at that, right on the front page.

[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:07.060]
It says celebrating the start of Passover and here's a bunch of ultra orthodox, they're

[01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:08.280]
getting ready to go to the Emerald Coast.

[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:10.440]
Look at that, they're dovetting, they're rocking back and forth.

[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:11.480]
We're rocking tonight.

[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.460]
They're getting ready to their praying for the Panthers tonight.

[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:15.480]
That's right, it can't hurt.

[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:17.080]
Say an extra brookho, okay?

[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:20.980]
Say an extra brook that Wayne Gretzky will break a leg.

[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:23.280]
Here's West Palm Beach, hello.

[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:25.520]
Hey, what's happening?

[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.100]
Yes sir.

[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:29.620]
Hey, this is a guy I call on on Pesa from Connecticut, man.

[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:32.000]
All right, great, congratulations to you.

[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:32.900]
I like your show, man.

[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:33.820]
What's not to like?

[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:35.100]
Hey, you're all over it.

[01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:36.420]
Listen, got a question for you.

[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:36.700]
Yes.

[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:38.900]
It's kind of deviates from the topic and it's up to you.

[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:39.880]
Did you say deviate?

[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:41.140]
Did you say deviate?

[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:41.980]
Deviate.

[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:42.860]
Are you a deviate?

[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.120]
We like you already, yes sir?

[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:44.760]
That a boy.

[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:48.180]
Listen, it's just, you know, not the reason it's kind of like a need to know basis.

[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:49.900]
Let me ask you, can I ask you a personal question?

[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:50.600]
Absolutely.

[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:51.880]
I already know the answer.

[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:53.020]
You are circumcised, right?

[01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:55.780]
Mellow, big guy.

[01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:57.200]
Listen, I got a question for you.

[01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:58.100]
No, no, seriously.

[01:55:58.460 --> 01:55:59.640]
My favorite team is the Yankees.

[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:00.940]
Wait a minute, wait a minute, slow down.

[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:01.600]
All right.

[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:03.860]
You don't know what the word mean, circumcised?

[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:05.860]
Well, it's just actually not my favorite topic, my brother.

[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:10.060]
No, no, but is that a difficult, in other words, you can't deal with that?

[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:11.140]
Is that personal?

[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:15.320]
Well, I just want to know if there's any homosexual baseball players on the Yankees.

[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:16.420]
On the Yankees?

[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:16.600]
Yeah.

[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:20.100]
Let's see, Yankees, they got Yankees.

[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:20.300]
Who that?

[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:21.660]
There's nobody left on the Yankees.

[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:22.340]
David Cohn.

[01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:23.820]
No, Cohnhead.

[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:24.780]
Oh, yeah.

[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:25.600]
Cohnhead.

[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:26.420]
You're killing me.

[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:27.320]
Yeah, David Cohn.

[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:28.700]
Joe Gerardi, he's a fact.

[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:31.900]
Listen, let me ask you this, because I'm not going to talk about that.

[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:33.880]
Well, I'm going to say it for the more lives in the Yankees and the World Series and

[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:34.160]
I'll call it.

[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:38.360]
Oh, and then at Wap Pitcher, they got with all his name that, that Grease, who?

[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:39.000]
Nelson?

[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:39.680]
No, no.

[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:41.280]
The Greaseball pitcher, the Yankees.

[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:43.800]
Oh, millionaire, don't be paying it on Grande, you go up there?

[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:44.760]
That's one, yeah.

[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:45.260]
That's one.

[01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:46.140]
There you go.

[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:50.080]
Listen, any chance of the mones, because they'll all hop in a pan.

[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:54.840]
Any chance of them picking up like either John Melendez or perhaps Fred Norris or even

[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:55.260]
Howard Stern?

[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:56.660]
Yeah, all three of them.

[01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:57.140]
That a boy.

[01:56:57.140 --> 01:56:57.900]
They're all coming tomorrow.

[01:56:58.240 --> 01:56:58.600]
Thanks, mate.

[01:56:58.760 --> 01:56:59.220]
OK, Paul.

[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:00.320]
And of course, you're going to be helping.

[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:02.260]
We have open line in the out of town.

[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:03.340]
What are you looking at me like that?

[01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:05.540]
For I do not understand the West Bonnolo.

[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:06.940]
OK, I have no idea what he said.

[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:08.120]
What are you talking about, China?

[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:06.300]
Oh, I'm not going to be a good guy.

[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:06.920]

[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:06.920]

[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:06.920]

[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:06.920]

[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:06.920]

[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:06.920]

[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:10.600]
OK, he was a commie pinco bastard, I think.

[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:12.040]
Here's a mobile in Oakland Park.

[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:12.380]
Hello.

[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:12.980]
Hey, Neil.

[01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:13.520]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:15.720]
I was wondering, you don't read the hero, do you know?

[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:16.520]
Why do not?

[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:17.180]
I know.

[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:20.300]
Why did they have a bunch of Jews on the front page of that paper, too?

[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:20.720]
No.

[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:22.920]
I'll talk about Jews in a kind of way.

[01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:24.400]
All right, let's get to those Jews.

[01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:31.060]
The day they had all the picks from the draft and the Dallas Cowboys picked that David LaFlure

[01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:31.860]
a tidiac.

[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:32.540]
Gila Fluria.

[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:33.860]
He's playing with the Cowboys now.

[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:36.880]
And it said he was 66280.

[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:38.120]
Pretty good looking guy.

[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:42.260]
And it said Troy Aikman put his stamp of approval on him.

[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:42.620]
Yeah.

[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:43.600]
And the guy's quote.

[01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:44.700]
He put something on him, yeah.

[01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:48.260]
The guy's quote was, I couldn't believe he came down to see me.

[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:50.200]
I think you must read it.

[01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:52.200]
I think it said he put his stamp of approval on him.

[01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:55.380]
Anyway, out of Bonnolo, yes, the idea of deliveries.

[01:58:55.580 --> 01:59:00.500]
And there was more skull caps out there yesterday than I've ever seen in my whole entire life.

[01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:00.800]
Yeah.

[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:03.160]
Little kids running around with beanies.

[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:08.260]
Oh, man, with the curls coming out of the sides of their hats, long, gross beards.

[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:10.820]
It was like a sewer plant out there.

[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:14.280]
Well, you know, that's an old Jewish saying, if you can't have a big weeny, at least we're

[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:14.840]
a big beeny.

[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.560]
Well, they have a national weeny, I think.

[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:18.200]
There you go.

[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:18.760]
All right.

[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:20.160]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:21.600]
Give Troy a big kiss for us, OK?

[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:23.640]
I'm playing.

[01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:24.080]
I'm playing.

[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:24.700]
OK, I'll play it.

[01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:25.280]
I'll play it.

[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:25.700]
I'll play it.

[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:26.480]
Go play it.

[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.320]
So what choice do you say?

[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:36.820]
When this quarterback gets lonely, she likes receivers that are why.

[01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:38.100]
I like it.

[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:43.180]
Some people say that number eight is gay.

[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:44.540]
Yes, I am.

[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:49.420]
If they say Troy loves the big brown eye, a-men.

[01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:51.400]
Brackdom.

[01:59:51.680 --> 01:59:54.560]
He goes down on his knees, a-men.

[01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:59.880]
His guy's he likes to please, a-men.

[02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:01.420]
Just lick him.

[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:05.060]
He loves to slap cowboys on there behind.

[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:07.260]
Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.

[02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:12.880]
He's got a spotless reputation.

[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:17.600]
You've heard America's team has world renowned.

[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:35.560]
He goes down on his knees, a-men.

[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.460]
I can't some balls to squeeze, a-men.

[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:47.580]
Don't clip him cause he likes it from me.

[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:47.580]

[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:47.580]

[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:51.280]
What is that?

[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:51.940]
More paychecks?

[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:52.980]
We're getting some more paychecks now.

[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:53.480]
Just mail.

[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:55.460]
Come on, let's get a bunch of paychecks in here.

[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:57.180]
One would like a whole bunch of zeros on it.

[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:01.120]
In fact, Wayne was telling me before he said all the paychecks, he gets all that's on it.

[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:01.760]
It's a bunch of zeros.

[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:05.200]
We have an open line at Broward, 7679463.

[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:07.580]
I said it kind of reminds me of that morning show you work on Wayne.

[02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:08.360]
A bunch of zeros.

[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:10.280]
Here's Coral Gables.

[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:10.600]
Hello.

[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:12.560]
Coral Gables.

[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:14.240]
Gone.

[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.220]
Coral Gables is gone.

[02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:18.520]
Some spicken of Gables left us in a lurch.

[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:19.820]
Well, thanks a lot, Julio.

[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:22.220]
We have an open line in day at 622946.

[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000]
Thank you so much, Leslie.

[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:24.580]
I mean, Lisa.

[02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:28.900]
Well, I'm gonna call you Lisa for the rest of the time that I'm here cause at least I like being consistent.

[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:30.720]
Even if you're wrong, be consistently wrong.

[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:35.600]
I call Leslie Lisa one day and George is never gonna let me live it down.

[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:37.640]
That was embarrassing.

[02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:42.400]
See, when I've discovered the best thing is just pretend you don't know anybody's name

[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:43.520]
cause then you'll never make a mistake.

[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:44.900]
Is this a letter or a check?

[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:45.580]
It is a check.

[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:46.020]
Look at that.

[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:47.320]
See, when I psychic or what?

[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:47.840]
Look at George.

[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:48.820]
I open up the envelope.

[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:49.560]
Here's a check.

[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:52.980]
Made out to center one for 20 bucks.

[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:54.640]
They probably want something.

[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:56.160]
So just cross out center.

[02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:57.020]
I want to put your name on it.

[02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:57.620]
Just a joke.

[02:01:58.320 --> 02:01:59.320]
Been a big fan.

[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:00.560]
Bapapah from Coral Springs.

[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:01.500]
Tom and Coral Springs.

[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:02.160]
What does he want?

[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:03.120]
Tom wants something.

[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:04.040]
No question about that.

[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:08.480]
Tom wants, uh, thanks for getting out from the oppressive tax regime.

[02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:09.560]
Getting a big raise.

[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:12.000]
And getting a paid European vacation.

[02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:12.700]
Bapapah.

[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:13.580]
What does he want?

[02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:15.920]
Twenty dollars represent.

[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:18.300]
Oh, this guy lost 20 pounds on the Atkins.

[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.360]
And he's sending us a buck for everyone.

[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:21.020]
Nice going.

[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:21.980]
Tom and Coral Springs.

[02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:22.700]
Thank you, Tom.

[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:26.980]
A lot of people promised that they would send us a buck for every pound they lost to center one.

[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.140]
On the Atkins diet.

[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:28.700]
Didn't do it.

[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:32.420]
We don't even hear about Atkins much anymore except the guy to call me for lost 90 pounds.

[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:35.100]
Here's another dumb facts from Pa squally.

[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:40.480]
Karen Kasey that on her first date, she and her boyfriend were deciding to move in together.

[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:45.420]
She told him that she was a high maintenance bitch and he would have to quit smoking cigars

[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:48.440]
and he did and she trained him to put the toilet seat down.

[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:56.880]
One thing about Walter Sable, baby, everywhere he goes, the toilet seat is down because they know that there's going to be a heavy load soon.

[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:04.300]
At one point in her show, she sneezed and after her commercial break, she came on complaining that something was all over the microphone and said,

[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:05.680]
what the hell is this stuff?

[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:07.840]
Who knows what disease the people before me have?

[02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:09.040]
And I don't want their germs.

[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:10.000]
How do you like that?

[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.400]
She don't want to catch our germs.

[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:13.740]
Well, there you go all over the mic sweetheart.

[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:15.700]
And here's another one.

[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:17.960]
I want to give you a cap.

[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:19.280]
There you go.

[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:23.760]
Mo brother, she's something or what, huh?

[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:24.700]
Snooty bitch.

[02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:27.400]
So anyway, here's a check for center one that you can give to Tracy.

[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:29.440]
How do you like that?

[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:32.040]
We're not even raising money right now and this checks her still coming in.

[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:34.120]
Thank you, Tom and Carl Springs and keep up the good work.

[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:35.140]
Here's Carl Gables.

[02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:35.440]
Hello.

[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:36.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:37.980]
Can't hear you.

[02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:38.880]
All right.

[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:40.360]
Are you on a, are you on a pay phone?

[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:41.300]
I want a pay phone.

[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:41.920]
Bad phone.

[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:44.000]
Speak up.

[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:44.560]
All right.

[02:03:44.700 --> 02:03:45.100]
Can you hear me?

[02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:45.480]
Yeah.

[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:46.140]
All right.

[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:47.660]
I just took the thing.

[02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:50.280]
The reason why your phones, uh, are not getting any calls,

[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:52.060]
is your phones aren't working when you were calling,

[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:53.560]
when you're requesting call.

[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:55.600]
I was trying to get through and it was all busy.

[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:56.060]
Yeah.

[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:58.420]
Sounds like somebody's are pushing it around.

[02:03:58.520 --> 02:03:59.560]
They're patching with our phones.

[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.220]
It's probably that, uh, Roy again.

[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:02.540]
And one last thing.

[02:04:02.740 --> 02:04:03.760]
Probably a Paxon plaque.

[02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:05.200]
What is it?

[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:06.540]
Are there Paxon plaques?

[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:07.280]
Take it.

[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:08.360]
Want to play on?

[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:09.200]
Yes.

[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:09.800]
They are.

[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:10.980]
I think so.

[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:12.080]
Aren't there?

[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:12.520]
Maybe not.

[02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:12.900]
I don't know.

[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:14.200]
I have to find out for you.

[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:15.680]
If they could find out, it can't be.

[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:16.260]
Okay.

[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:16.880]
Thank you.

[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:18.240]
See, I'm not really sure about that.

[02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:19.020]
Are there, Adam?

[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:19.560]
Adam would know.

[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:21.620]
Not Panther Pack for the playoffs.

[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:24.460]
What?

[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:25.360]
We don't know.

[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:25.900]
We'll find out.

[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:26.460]
Okay.

[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:27.980]
We have an open line in day six, two, two.

[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:29.280]
We go on a mobile and purple line.

[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:30.180]
Somebody just hung up there.

[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:32.140]
If you're real fast, pound IOD, grab it.

[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:32.820]
Squeeze it.

[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:33.260]
Yank it.

[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:33.700]
Pull it.

[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:34.780]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:35.160]
Hello.

[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:36.280]
Hi, Neil.

[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:36.680]
Hi.

[02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:39.220]
I used to listen to Jim Phillips up in Orlando.

[02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:40.380]
Oh my God.

[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:42.200]
Oh my God.

[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:45.040]
So I know you're not the only one that schleps for food.

[02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:45.600]
Yeah.

[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:47.000]
I'm a fat shlip for food all the time.

[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:49.340]
Everything that I do on a year, people rip off.

[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:50.940]
Lee Fowler is begging for food.

[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:53.000]
Jim Phillips is begging for food on a year.

[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:53.800]
But you're not really.

[02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:54.460]
You're not begging.

[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:56.900]
You're just saying you're talking about food and people.

[02:04:57.100 --> 02:04:57.580]
Not really.

[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:58.940]
People are bringing it.

[02:04:59.120 --> 02:04:59.500]
That's right.

[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:00.640]
And the food too.

[02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:01.340]
I have to bring it.

[02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:01.800]
That's right.

[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:06.960]
I'm bringing it for, you know, so if it's anybody's problem, it's people that are bringing in and...

[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:11.340]
This broad that we got tonight, this bitch, she's got a problem with everything that everybody else does here.

[02:05:11.540 --> 02:05:11.640]
Okay.

[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.620]
Everything that everybody else does, she's got a problem with it.

[02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:17.440]
I didn't realize what a toothpaste bitch she was.

[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:17.620]
Yeah.

[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:19.000]
She's been here three and a half weeks.

[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:23.700]
She's the expert because the consultant's her boyfriend and some of us are leaving anyway.

[02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:24.900]
So she's the expert.

[02:05:25.220 --> 02:05:25.980]
That f***ing bitch.

[02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:26.520]
Right.

[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:28.660]
But anyway.

[02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:30.320]
Have a great day.

[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:31.060]
She just vanished.

[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:31.680]
Okay.

[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:34.920]
We have an open line in day six, two, two, nine, four, six, three, six, two, two.

[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:36.000]
One on the out of town line.

[02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:36.860]
Sometimes that happens.

[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:38.460]
They just freeze.

[02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:42.940]
They're just so overwhelmed by my magnificence that they just can't deal with it.

[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:44.560]
Anyway, good points, sweetheart.

[02:05:44.740 --> 02:05:45.360]
Thank you so much.

[02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:50.840]
I have a great pass over in Paisach and Easter in Pura and whatever you're celebrating because it's all a bunch of bubble miceies anyway.

[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:51.160]
Okay.

[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:52.440]
Don't ever forget that.

[02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:53.940]
That's the one message from this show.

[02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:55.840]
More important than all the others put together.

[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.780]
More important than all these contrived topics.

[02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:58.200]
Okay.

[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.880]
See, there's something called credibility.

[02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:05.340]
In other words, if you come on here and you're talking about stuff and you got some credibility and it means something.

[02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:06.560]
Nothing we're going to change the world.

[02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:09.260]
But all these stupid lists of stupid ass topics.

[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:10.440]
Guess what water?

[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:12.640]
You wouldn't know a talk show if they slid for it.

[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:15.360]
If they slid, whoa, Rush Limbaugh and Gordon Litty up your record.

[02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:16.740]
You still wouldn't know a talk show.

[02:06:16.900 --> 02:06:17.000]
Okay.

[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:19.540]
You wouldn't recognize it with a magnifying glass.

[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:21.060]
And the show either.

[02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:25.240]
Fony, phony, phony is the day is long.

[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:26.140]
Phony, baloney.

[02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:27.760]
And his clone, the same thing, man.

[02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:28.640]
His clone.

[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:31.200]
Send in the clones.

[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:34.720]
Yeah, hold us business about cloning humans.

[02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:39.620]
I mean, what's the big controversy about that when we already got water, say, bow and his clone?

[02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:42.820]
1244, WIOD.

[02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:44.820]
Let me tell you about something no cloning around here.

[02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:46.220]
There's your check, by the way, Tracy.

[02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:47.820]
Tracy just came in here and grabbed it.

[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:49.060]
And the check, too.

[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:52.480]
Put away those purple pajamas where you people are starting to talk.

[02:06:53.540 --> 02:06:55.720]
Six times WIOD.

[02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:58.100]
The station that reaches the beaches.

[02:06:58.740 --> 02:07:00.100]
The kid be heard in the office.

[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:02.120]
Hey, we know our limits.

[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:04.880]
Rock, dirty, tell me.

[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:16.660]
Yeah, but wait, yeah, but wait a second.

[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:23.320]
Yeah, I'm the Walter Sable.

[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:24.320]
We look like a sedan.

[02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:26.380]
I want you hop inside my company car.

[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:29.360]
I got the pictures and taxidies out of my hand.

[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:31.360]
I'm going to make it you and Rainy old-style.

[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:31.820]

[02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:33.380]
I'm going to save up, baby.

[02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:36.360]
I can do anything I want to do.

[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:38.400]
I'm your consultant woman.

[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:41.320]
And I'm going to make it so to you.

[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:42.720]
I'm giving that phone.

[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:43.980]
On a crap show.

[02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:44.960]
And a formula.

[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:46.640]
I've got the phone.

[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:46.640]

[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:46.640]

[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:46.640]

[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:46.640]

[02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:50.640]
I've got the power to hold and control you.

[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:55.440]
Whoa, you know I do.

[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:01.320]
Where are I have a way to get your own show?

[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:03.040]
At a station down in Hollywood.

[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:06.260]
And I don't care if you're waiting alone.

[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:08.260]
Just as long as you can stroke me good.

[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:10.400]
I'm also saying, oh, baby.

[02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:13.020]
And you'll do anything I want you to.

[02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:14.640]
I'm your consultant woman.

[02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:18.060]
Spread your leg when I desire you.

[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:19.700]
I'm going to bone you.

[02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:20.860]
Oh, bone you.

[02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:22.120]
Oh, I've done sloth.

[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:23.940]
I've sat in a real dog.

[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:26.060]
That's why I'm a consultant.

[02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:28.740]
Cause I'm just an asshole.

[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:32.100]
Yes, I am.

[02:08:32.260 --> 02:08:34.240]
1250, a W-I-O-D.

[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:36.200]
We're being saber-wise here at W.I.

[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:36.780]
You can help.

[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:38.700]
You can help it and feel it and smell it.

[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:39.840]
Helet.

[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:41.980]
Here's a mobile in South Miami.

[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:42.400]
Hello.

[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:43.840]
Neil, how's it going?

[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:44.240]
Great.

[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:46.180]
I think the pants are as well.

[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:48.020]
Take them and I three to one.

[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:48.840]
Four to two.

[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:49.680]
Four to two.

[02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:50.920]
We'll take whatever we can get.

[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:52.440]
Four to two sounds real good to me.

[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:54.320]
I got a real strong feeling on it.

[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.100]
Are you going to play that last goal?

[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:57.460]
The winning goal?

[02:08:58.220 --> 02:08:59.020]
Or was it the audit?

[02:08:59.300 --> 02:08:59.440]
The audit?

[02:08:59.500 --> 02:08:59.500]

[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:01.560]
I beg your pardon?

[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:02.580]
The winning goal for Ottawa?

[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:03.320]
No, no, no.

[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:05.320]
The one you just played.

[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:07.000]
You mean Buffalo?

[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:08.120]
The game.

[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:09.080]
Yeah, the three three.

[02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:10.380]
But they want it four to three.

[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:12.520]
Or you're talking about the winning goal for Edmonton?

[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:12.820]
Yeah.

[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:13.560]
Well, that was good.

[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:14.780]
It was about the 18th time.

[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:16.100]
Yeah, I might be able to do that.

[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:17.580]
Okay, I appreciate it.

[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:17.880]
Okay.

[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:20.000]
And uh, douchebag?

[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:20.640]
Yeah.

[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:22.320]
Frank, fat,

[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:24.880]
Ron, you're all douchebag.

[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:25.620]
Bunch of fags.

[02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:26.220]
Okay, pal.

[02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:27.060]
See ya.

[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.800]
We have an open line at day six, two, two.

[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:29.660]
By the way, speaking of that,

[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:31.580]
Bokeh Brian just came in and looking fat.

[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:32.600]
Oh, look at that.

[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:33.980]
As soon as I said that, he pulled his poop again.

[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:34.420]
You see that?

[02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:35.960]
Boy, that was amazing.

[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:38.740]
Didn't, and it didn't help too much either.

[02:09:38.740 --> 02:09:41.320]
So anyway, Bokeh Brian says that

[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:42.500]
Kieran Key is really something.

[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:43.800]
He wishes he could say it on the air.

[02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:45.220]
Here, camp stop it.

[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:46.740]
Aaron Alvis back there.

[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:48.380]
He has played an attractive

[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:49.980]
tonight for Robinson.

[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:51.000]
Here they come.

[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:51.560]
The Irish.

[02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:53.780]
It's dropped back for Bokeh.

[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:55.620]
Shoot stars.

[02:09:57.380 --> 02:09:58.200]
Bokeh Burger.

[02:09:59.000 --> 02:09:59.720]
The Irish.

[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:04.400]
Winniths.

[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.560]
Bokeh Burger.

[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:07.000]
The Irish.

[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:07.000]

[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:07.000]

[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:07.020]
Bokeh Burger.

[02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:07.240]
Bokeh Burger.

[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:08.360]
Bokeh Burger.

[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:08.420]
The Irish.

[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:08.420]

[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:08.660]
Bokeh Burger.

[02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:12.100]
Be a leaveable.

[02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:12.440]
Amen.

[02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:13.640]
Boy, that was some game, boy.

[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:14.380]
That was some game.

[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:15.460]
Sorry, you missed that.

[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:16.800]
Because what can I tell you?

[02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:19.920]
We have an open line today at 629-463.

[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:21.380]
If you guys had the right sets of dishes,

[02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:23.020]
if you had your milkshake and a

[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:24.000]
big dish and a small dish,

[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:25.860]
then you'd be, I'll say you'd see some good stuff.

[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:27.800]
Here's Miami.

[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:28.220]
Hello.

[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:30.640]
Miami, Buenos dias.

[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:31.140]
Hello.

[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:31.800]
Yes, sir.

[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:32.520]
How you doing, Neil?

[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:32.860]
Great.

[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:34.600]
Listen, I think badminton players

[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:35.760]
are the toughest players.

[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:37.940]
I would say next to a golfer is your right.

[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:39.700]
I say badminton and tidley wings.

[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:41.820]
You got to have a good grip on your handle while you play with it.

[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:42.700]
How about chess players?

[02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:43.180]
Right.

[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:43.620]
Yeah.

[02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:45.980]
No, I think badminton players have got it on there.

[02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:47.500]
Yeah, watch out for that shuttlecock.

[02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:49.120]
Anyway, yeah, that too.

[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:49.500]
Yeah.

[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:51.240]
I got a request for you.

[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:52.000]
A couple of weeks ago,

[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:54.140]
you played something, a buddy of mine was driving on this truck

[02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:56.420]
and you played something called Cowboy Dick Ichring.

[02:10:56.680 --> 02:10:56.920]
Yeah.

[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.620]
And he ran over his neighbor's dog.

[02:10:58.880 --> 02:10:59.160]
Did he?

[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:00.180]
From laughing to hard.

[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:00.700]
All right.

[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:01.580]
I guess you could play that today.

[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:02.580]
What kind of a dog was it?

[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:03.520]
Oh, it's just a mud.

[02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:04.400]
It's a dead dog now.

[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:05.340]
Okay, then we'll play it.

[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:05.880]
Thank you.

[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:06.420]
Okay, see you.

[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:07.600]
Okay, what happened right there?

[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:08.440]
We were smoking, man.

[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:09.900]
We hit him lit up like a Hanukkah bush.

[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:10.860]
Walter would have been proud.

[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:11.900]
He would have been pissed off.

[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:14.200]
We have an open line at Broward 767.

[02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:15.820]
We have two in day 622.

[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:18.180]
These hot topics are doing it for me today.

[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:19.500]
Alan Ginsburg.

[02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:20.600]
This audience wouldn't know.

[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:22.280]
Alan Ginsburg from Arnie Ginsburg.

[02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:23.140]
Hey, what's eating?

[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:24.280]
Cowboy Dick.

[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:25.940]
Hey, Buck of Roos.

[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:29.260]
There's nothing like a little cowboy Dick Ichring.

[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:31.020]
I want something.

[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:32.580]
I've got a craving.

[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:35.000]
Yeah, well, how about some cowboy Dick?

[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:35.760]
Sure.

[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:38.540]
All the cowgirls love my cowboy Dick.

[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:41.500]
And I should know, because I'm cowboy Dick.

[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:44.220]
I like my cowboy Dick with some nuts.

[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:46.300]
No problem, partner.

[02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:48.280]
Introducing cowboy Dick.

[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:51.640]
With not so big, you can hardly wrap your lips around them.

[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.260]
My young and loved cowboy Dick.

[02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:57.760]
Hey, I'm Phil Yearpossi with my cowboy Dick.

[02:11:58.180 --> 02:11:59.540]
Oh, cowboy Dick.

[02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:01.080]
Here, try it.

[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:03.020]
How is it?

[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:04.360]
I can't talk.

[02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:07.380]
My mouth is full of cowboy Dick.

[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:08.760]
She smiling.

[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:10.240]
She smiling.

[02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:13.200]
Phil Yearpossi with my cowboy Dick.

[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:15.080]
Available in your grocery freezer.

[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:19.360]
Ooh, once you've had your first cowboy Dick, you won't ever go back.

[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:22.060]
When you're filled with cowboy Dick, you'll scream.

[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:23.620]
Woohoo!

[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:25.780]
Say it again.

[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:27.920]
Okay, 1254 at WIOD.

[02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:28.840]
We have an open line in date.

[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:30.860]
If you move quickly, if you get right on a hot topic.

[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:34.920]
If the one to do our...

[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:50.040]
...then hold that magic, slap me on my ass.

[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:54.060]
That same old magic that used to jump and pass.

[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:58.280]
Then he got eats and had to quit the sport.

[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:02.400]
Although he liked guys if tight still be sure.

[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:06.800]
He was always stealing everything with joy.

[02:13:07.440 --> 02:13:10.720]
He even nailed a couple of Asian bulls.

[02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:11.620]
Oh, I don't want to run.

[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:15.120]
Down and down he went in and out.

[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:16.720]
He went like a redneck.

[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:18.320]
Does to his goat.

[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:21.000]
Well, he should stay away.

[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:23.040]
But he could not.

[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:25.540]
He needs the cash.

[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:27.400]
And he likes ass.

[02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:31.000]
And soon he'll feel that burn in desire.

[02:13:31.940 --> 02:13:33.400]
But he's got eight.

[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:35.560]
And his dark sunfire.

[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:40.720]
He's had lovers all around the world.

[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:44.720]
The only three of four of them were girls.

[02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:46.240]
And now he's old.

[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:48.240]
And he's got eight.

[02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:51.700]
And soon down and down he'll go.

[02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:54.460]
Under and around he'll go on magic.

[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:56.420]
Because a box of bones.

[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.320]
104 W. What are you saying now?

[02:13:58.440 --> 02:13:58.780]
What is that?

[02:13:59.320 --> 02:13:59.780]
What is it?

[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:02.700]
A Fargo tape.

[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:06.580]
What the hell is that thing?

[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:07.580]
How would you send it to?

[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:09.720]
It's a wide screen collector set.

[02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:11.820]
Which has got one of those.

[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:12.820]
What do you call it?

[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:13.760]
What do you call those things?

[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:14.860]
A snowball.

[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:16.500]
Is that what you call them?

[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:20.920]
All these years I've lived and I never knew what you call those things.

[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:23.140]
You know, with a little thing with a snow inside.

[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:25.020]
It's a snow but that's not what they call it.

[02:14:25.420 --> 02:14:26.020]
Shake me.

[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:28.200]
It's a numbered snow globe.

[02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:29.060]
That's what it's called.

[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:30.120]
It's a snow globe.

[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.860]
Fargo collectors letter box edition.

[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:33.520]
Wow.

[02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:35.060]
Suds are being pressed by that.

[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:36.820]
What's that other crap?

[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:37.520]
Why do you want this?

[02:14:38.060 --> 02:14:39.660]
Because I bet your audience would like it.

[02:14:40.260 --> 02:14:40.860]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:41.560]
There you go.

[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:42.060]
It's all yours.

[02:14:42.260 --> 02:14:43.120]
Free stuff for George.

[02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:46.000]
And that's not to be given away either because I need a bargo.

[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:47.860]
So what's the point?

[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.120]
So what are you talking about?

[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:50.800]
Given away.

[02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:52.400]
Who said anything about giving away?

[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:53.420]
God damn it.

[02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:56.480]
We have an open line in day at 622.

[02:14:56.540 --> 02:14:58.320]
So how's peaches Paxton coming by the way?

[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:02.960]
We have an open line in Broward 7679463 767WID.

[02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:05.480]
Here's West Palm Beach.

[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:05.720]
Hello.

[02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:06.380]
Hi Neil.

[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:07.160]
Yes ma'am.

[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:07.840]
How are you doing today?

[02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:08.180]
Great.

[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:09.180]
I will have some of that though.

[02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:10.380]
I'm going to eat the topping of the great.

[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:11.100]
Fantastic.

[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:12.640]
The best day of my life.

[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:14.680]
It's the best day of your life.

[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:16.520]
Wait a minute.

[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:17.080]
One second.

[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:17.840]
Let me take a look.

[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:18.460]
Let me see it.

[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:20.320]
Let me see that your sausage is your Adam.

[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:21.800]
Oh!

[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:22.660]
I'll have the pepperoni.

[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:23.960]
No, I'll have the sausage.

[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:26.220]
No, I'll sausage.

[02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:26.960]
Yes ma'am.

[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:27.700]
You got the sausage.

[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:28.720]
I got the sausage.

[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:29.080]
Cool.

[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.400]
And it's George taking the snow globe.

[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:33.240]
Yeah.

[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:34.220]
Oh god.

[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:35.860]
Wasn't you already on the phone?

[02:15:36.140 --> 02:15:36.480]
Who am I?

[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:36.860]
Yeah.

[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:40.040]
It was listening to when he picked up for the snow globe.

[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:40.520]
Yeah.

[02:15:40.620 --> 02:15:41.660]
When you were talking about the snow globe.

[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:43.500]
And so you called just for something for free?

[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:44.000]
No.

[02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:46.400]

Are you feeling great?

[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:47.320]
Neil, I might want to ask you about a hockey, uh, if you can explain to me, uh, the new rule about the, uh, you can't shoot from the crease.

[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:49.700]
You can't shoot from the crease?

[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:50.860]
Is that correct?

[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:54.160]
Yeah, you can't shoot from the crease. It's too close. You have to back up 10 feet.

[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:57.020]
We have an open line in date. 6222 WIOD.

So far so good.

[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:18.160]
Neil, I wouldn't ask you before any other thing.

[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:20.020]
How's Juan Minierta doing?

[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:20.960]

[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:30.560]
Yeah. Neil, another thing. You've been on business for 21 years, right?

[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:33.580]

[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:41.580]
Like what?

[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:46.720]
Like, for example, every time I try to make a comment or a...

[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:49.320]
Try to talk the truth, you hang up on me.

[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:49.800]
Yeah.

[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:53.120]
Well, I mean, what does... I mean, you can't handle that.

[02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:55.840]
What are you talking about, sir? What are you talking about?

[02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:57.640]
What kind of kaka are you talking?

[02:25:58.040 --> 02:25:59.400]
No, no kaka. I mean, that's what...

[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:01.220]
What kaka are you spewing, sir?

[02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:03.520]
You're talking about the night. What is it?

[02:26:03.780 --> 02:26:05.840]
You're more in the radio than I am, so I was talking about the night.

[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:08.780]
So what's the point? What is it? What is it? What do you want to say?

[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:10.160]
No, because you know...

[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:10.780]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:15.140]
Here we go. Here's a special dedication for this guy.

[02:26:15.140 --> 02:26:45.120]

Oh by the way, I can't believe that you want these CDs.

[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:03.660]
I can't believe it.

[02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:05.280]
I just want a couple of things off of them.

[02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:07.580]
Yeah, I bet I know which one of them is here.

[02:27:08.660 --> 02:27:11.740]
I think George has been hanging around with people that were purple, but Jam is

[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:22.840]
or something. I mean, what what the hell is this? Oh God. Talk about a bag song. Oh, if I were

[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:27.800]
here, Donner, Donner Summer again, it'll be too soon. Oh, here we go. Here's another one.

[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:31.520]
Wait a minute. One moment please. Okay. And even realize this one was on there. One moment

[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:40.180]
please. This will do it for you. This will set you right on your ass on Paisach. Okay. What

[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:49.580]
I tell you, George is converting and we're not talking Judaism. I like it. You facts know

[02:27:49.580 --> 02:28:01.300]
your music. It doesn't lick them. God help us at the Aberlora Macarena. That's a great spot

[02:28:01.300 --> 02:28:05.760]
that Pepsi spot. Pepsi's got the best spots, man. Pepsi and Snickers. In fact, there's nothing

[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:08.720]
like heating about two or three of those big king size Snickers bars while you're down

[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:14.200]
in some real not diet, but regular Pepsi with all that heavy sugar in it. All right. Here's

[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:24.060]
Dear Field. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hi. Yes. Seven year listener and first time caller.

[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:33.940]
Great. What is it? I know it is. Fact my my medicines run out. So I need you. Sounds

[02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:41.240]
good. And I don't know. I just want to say hello. Okay. And goodbye. We have an open

[02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:45.740]
line today at 622 W. I. D. and two and Broward 767. I'm trying to get this other one open.

[02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:50.440]
It's one of those. It's got to look at how I munged on my shirt. Oh my God. You're going

[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:54.760]
to burn in hell when you mung on your shirt on Paisach. God, I look like fat rich on a

[02:28:54.760 --> 02:29:02.380]
bad day. I got to this guy after I'm going to have to do with my teeth. Come on. Open

[02:29:02.380 --> 02:29:07.640]
up already. Will you? Oh, I just broke the plastic. You're never going to be able to play

[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:11.680]
this thing by the time I get this thing open. What? I don't need that. Just one moment, please.

[02:29:11.780 --> 02:29:17.460]
Just relax. I'm just going to dig this damn thing. Like I said, I think I need that. Okay.

[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:22.820]
Open line in day at 622 2 and Broward 7679463. Got some great music in here. We could play.

[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:27.160]
We got Diana Ross. We got wait. Wait a minute. Before we open this, let's see if there's

[02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:31.880]
anything worth opening it for. This is crap. And Donna Summers on here again with last

[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:37.800]
dance. Okay. Enough with Donna Summers already. That bitch. Oh my God. There's nothing but

[02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:42.160]
crap on here. Last dance reprise. The one that goes on for like seven and a half minutes.

[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:46.900]
That one's on here. Tell my Houston. Get this crap. Give it to that spicken here. That's

[02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:51.220]
silly. Holy God. Oh, my God. He acted like, Oh, don't give that stuff away. There's really

[02:29:51.220 --> 02:29:54.780]
important stuff. It like what? What was on there that you want that anybody would want?

[02:29:55.220 --> 02:30:00.640]
Bunch of crap. Thanks again for more crap. Tracy. Needy. What is your problem? What is this

[02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:03.860]
sweat you keep sending us? She just sent it to you. She didn't send it to me. It's all

[02:30:03.860 --> 02:30:08.140]
about your crap you're taking home, including that nice thing with a snow globe that

[02:30:08.140 --> 02:30:12.900]
that woman wanted so badly. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing?

[02:30:13.060 --> 02:30:17.000]
Great. I was wondering if I could ask you a question or sub request. I'll be following

[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.880]
hockey. Now, I was just a panther. She came in. I have yet to come across someone who

[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:24.560]
can explain to me what the plus and minus statistic is and what the purpose of it is.

[02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:28.940]
The purpose of it is to have something to talk about. It's a stupid statistic for the

[02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:33.860]
most part. And it means how many goals are scored when a player is on the ice for and

[02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:39.180]
against the team at full strength penalties, power plays don't count. So when a man is out

[02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:43.300]
there and the teams are at full strength, six aside, how many goals are scored for the

[02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:46.880]
team while he's out there and how many schools are scored against? Is there any like any

[02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:51.620]
award at the end of the season for this or anything? Yeah, there's the Alka Celter plus

[02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:57.840]
minus award. Also, also the prediction on the patches one three to one on an empty, empty

[02:30:57.840 --> 02:31:03.100]
net score by it's available tonight. And also, I wonder if you can. Can you play Star Wars

[02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:09.340]
just in casino? How about Star Wars Cantina? Yeah. That'll have to do. Okay, pal. Have a great

[02:31:09.340 --> 02:31:14.260]
life. Okay, two open lines in day six, two, two, nine, four, saying he just obsessed with

[02:31:14.260 --> 02:31:17.900]
that. Is he the guy? There's one whole year. I think it's him loves that thing. Just

[02:31:17.900 --> 02:31:21.300]
calls every five minutes for that. And of course, if we want to format this thing right,

[02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:24.200]
we don't want to keep playing the same stuff over and over again, because Walt Sable

[02:31:24.200 --> 02:31:29.360]
can't really upset. But you know what I say? School Walt Sable, that's what I say. I think

[02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:33.040]
it's on just 49, don't you George Cut Number 17. Let's give it a shot. Yes, sure.

[02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:37.320]
Sure. You're going to sure. Okay, sir, I can't play it for it because George is going

[02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:42.740]
to sure. No, I think it really is. Let me just check it out. What a genius, man. What

[02:31:42.740 --> 02:31:49.660]
a freaking genius. So what do you think? Politics, scandal, science, the legal system, conspiracies,

[02:31:49.660 --> 02:31:51.880]
natural disasters. Let's have one.

[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:21.660]
The boss will do with you.

[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:27.480]
All the six, seven, ten, ten, no.

[02:34:35.820 --> 02:34:40.080]
One twenty eight of W.I.D., where everybody is Jewish, man. This place is vacant today.

[02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:43.940]
Isn't that it's like deadly here? Everybody got the religion today, man. Everybody is

[02:34:43.940 --> 02:34:46.740]
passing it over. They're eating the monster. They're drinking a wine, mostly the wine

[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:53.740]
part.

[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:31.000]
George, George.

[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:38.500]
Too much Bill Cosby will do it every time on thirty three at W.I.O.D. on a great Tuesday.

[02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:44.080]
Happy Pace套, baby. This is the kind of day it's hard to pass over. Here's a mobile

[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:46.960]
in Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Good afternoon, sir.

[02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:49.680]
Buenos dias. Buenos tardes.

[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:57.680]
See, I got a roll. I did. Listen, first of all, topic flow. Topics only concern the few

[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:00.480]
amount of people that are interested in whatever particular topic that is. That's right.

[02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:04.160]
That's what I tried to explain to Walter Sebo as he was trying to pick my mind and steal

[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:08.720]
my material a couple of months ago when we had a very nice, very mediocre meal at Denny's

[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:13.080]
up the street. I explained that to him. Immediately as soon as you hear somebody with one topic

[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:17.800]
and it's really boring in term and like about that stupid engagement ring, 98% of the

[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:21.020]
people who don't give a flying crap about the engagement ring, they're turning it off.

[02:36:21.140 --> 02:36:24.960]
And then you lose any carryover people that may be listening from whatever, like your

[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:27.020]
shelter carries on to Rick and Sous and so on and so forth.

[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:31.700]
Right. Who cares about some asshole with his stupid, damn engagement ring anyway?

[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:35.720]
Not me. That's for sure. If I had $9,000 like that, I sure wouldn't be buying no ring for

[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:39.020]
the wine. And if you could afford to buy a $9,000 ring, who'd help with care if you got

[02:36:39.020 --> 02:36:42.040]
it back anyway, you're probably loaded. You're most cubic of the colony and they won't

[02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:44.820]
know the difference. Right. Tall up buddy, bud. Get a pubic zirconia.

[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:50.200]
But listen, I called you last week and left a message. Why don't you leave a message

[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:55.420]
with those people over to QIM about once again tonight. I'm going to have to listen like

[02:36:55.420 --> 02:37:00.840]
a radar station with the 790. I know we had a call on it earlier and belongs on kiss.

[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:05.340]
It belongs on the FM Greg. Get it on the FM and stop short. Change it our panthers, damn

[02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:09.700]
it. I came out and get it on a station that somebody can hear with a full post game show

[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:13.620]
and give it some justice. This is a playoff game for Christ sakes. What do you think the

[02:37:13.620 --> 02:37:17.760]
odds are? I was very fortunate. I do have a big dish. I did not have to watch that stupid

[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:22.020]
blue and red puck thing. I got to watch it on the CBC Sunday. Great. Will it be on here

[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:26.640]
tonight, you think? Oh, yeah, they're doing our series. Are they? It'll be on. Oh,

[02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:30.520]
they were down here. It'll sure be on from up there. You bet. Oh, man, great. And I don't

[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:34.760]
have to even worry about 790. Do I? There you go. Chris Cuthford, John Garrett, you

[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:39.420]
could do worse. You're right. I could have to sit out here like a radar. In fact, I'm

[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:43.960]
glad you reminded me that I'll have two choices. I can take both feeds tonight. Just in case

[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:47.240]
Rimmer screws up. You know what I'm saying? I was so grateful. I thought it out when I

[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:51.380]
turned the game on. And I thought that little blue thing. I said, wait a minute. You

[02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:55.940]
said, what's that? Gotta be. And so I flipped it on. There it is on a boxes and abortion

[02:37:55.940 --> 02:38:00.060]
man. They're killing the game. The game's last for four hours. They're it's long. It's

[02:38:00.060 --> 02:38:04.240]
ponderous. They delay it. They stall it. They did it out. They got that stupid blue thing

[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:08.300]
that's three rows up in the crowd. The whole game Fox hasn't got a freaking clue. They

[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:12.520]
don't. Well, Neil, you have a good day. Go panthers and please no topics. Okay. Take

[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:17.760]
care now. See you. So what do you think about your capital punishment? Let's bring

[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:21.080]
it back to tried in the true. Let's bring some new ones back. How about service in the

[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:25.900]
department store? How about if you went in and wanted to buy some batteries? Okay. First

[02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:29.500]
of all, I don't think you go into a department store to buy batteries anyway. You go into

[02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:33.420]
your supermarket or into your drug store, but they got a whole section of batteries. And

[02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:37.400]
you see the little ones there, the triple A's and then there's the quadruple A. Just pick

[02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:40.980]
them off and they're going to pay for them and dummy up. Okay. And stop with these stupid

[02:38:40.980 --> 02:38:45.980]
contrived topics that nobody cares about. Just like I predicted, didn't I tell you this?

[02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:49.880]
Did I come on here and tell you as soon as they got this asshole consultant and we had

[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:53.460]
that stupid meeting up there at that hotel, which got really knows how much that cash

[02:38:53.460 --> 02:39:00.140]
cost up there. Way to help back in October. Yeah, but we got nice notebooks. Yeah. We got

[02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:06.560]
nice notebooks from Walter. And they're talking about this 38 year old schlepper car salesman

[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:11.340]
in Pembroke Pines, who's our average listener out there. If they, huh? Mark. Oh, yeah, he

[02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:15.040]
even had a name. His name was Mark. Oh, maybe that was the mark that was coming down the

[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:18.680]
elevator said, F. Nearoger. That must be it. Not buddy, but son and law. Oh, was the son

[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:24.180]
law. Okay. Like I said, it was buddy, but son and law mark that comes down the elevator

[02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:27.740]
says to that nice lady with their 10 year old little girl standing there in the elevator.

[02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:33.620]
F. Nearoger is not once, not twice, but three times. Okay. So let's say just F you too,

[02:39:33.700 --> 02:39:41.020]
buddy. Please don't say the F word. Why not? Forget it. Here is North Miami Beach. Hello. Yeah,

[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:45.500]
Neil. Yes, sir. Great. I don't know if I was dreaming, but wasn't, uh, still supposed to come in.

[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:50.000]
Yes, sir. Today, but he's a tight up with these depositions. He's the Brian Cox lawsuit thing.

[02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:56.680]
I am. So it's my deepest apologies, but he can't make it. I really need it. He's leaving today.

[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:01.520]
Yeah. Uh, damn it. He likes it so much here that as soon as he gives the last delay, he said the

[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:06.040]
last sentence of the last answer to the questions he's flying on a plane and getting hell out of here.

[02:40:06.540 --> 02:40:10.880]
As soon as possible. I can't blame him. Yeah. Well, he's he's Mark guy, huh? Yes, sir.

[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:15.380]
Any, anywhere that's better than this place. All right, man. That's all I wanted to say. Sorry about

[02:40:15.380 --> 02:40:19.200]
that. Okay. Well, we'll get a hold of him. We'll get him on a phone one of these days when he's

[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:22.700]
awake. Don't be calling him like it eight in the morning. L.A. time again, George. That was

[02:40:22.700 --> 02:40:27.400]
your doing. That's probably why I didn't show up here is picked off. We have two open lines

[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:33.360]
in date six, two, two, nine, four, six, three, six, two, two, W I O D. Here's a lady in Oakland Park. Hello.

[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:40.500]
Hello. Yes. Yes. I am. Happy face off now. This is no lady. No, it's a guy.

[02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:44.580]
Says lady in Oakland Park. George, you wouldn't know a lady from a guy. There was somebody else on

[02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:51.640]
the phone originally. Yes, sir. What? Yeah, he got got a crossoff somewhere. Uh, yeah, you're

[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:59.100]
speaking of a song a few minutes ago and Zeta had a hate song week. Yeah. And the most hated song

[02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:06.760]
was the Macarena. Yeah. So, uh, it's speaking of songs. Guess what WJNO's playing? What is that,

[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:12.400]
sir? Boy's life sex in the morning. Really? Yeah. Okay. W off here by the end of the week. Thank you so

[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:14.580]
much. Thanks for the warning. What do they do?

[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:36.260]
When I tell me call me melanoma, I tend until I'm almost in a coma. How wide my amy and they never

[02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:41.920]
ever use any sunscreen. Sun with me. 10 with me. Hope we don't mind. I'm a little

[02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:46.840]
freckle. I'm not even a cent. Until we get melanoma. We date like a bun. You can sell the aroma.

[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:52.960]
Our lights are all on, but there's nobody more. Hey, no, no, why? I spend all day at work

[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:59.700]
planning that when I get off a go tanning. I get naked and fake baked. How much

[02:41:59.700 --> 02:42:06.060]
lunges my skin gonna take it? My astrologist and numerologist have to help me find a dermatologist.

[02:42:06.260 --> 02:42:11.140]
We lie in the sun till we get melanoma. We date like a bun. You can sell the aroma. Our lights

[02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:17.740]
are all on, but there's nobody. Homa. Hey, melanoma. We lie in the sun till we get melanoma.

[02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:22.400]
We date like a bun. You can smell the aroma. We got lung stars. Skin bigger than the metroidoma.

[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:29.500]
Hey melanoma. We don't care if we get melanoma. We got the best tan from here to Arizona.

[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:33.780]
We're glad we don't have genital congaloma. Hey melanoma.

[02:42:34.340 --> 02:42:41.660]
Hey! 140 at W I O D. Here's West Palm Beach. Hello. Okay nice talking to you too. Thanks Randy.

[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:47.320]
Here's Margate. Hello. Neil, good afternoon. Yes sir. I'm at this hell. I'm going to rip somebody

[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:54.200]
one tomorrow. About? A non-family dental essay. Nothing heavy. A little pass-on. A little

[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:59.380]
on the cup. Yeah. A little 13 year old system at the table. Excuse me, excuse me,

[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:06.380]
with his hands crossed. Says grace. Really? Yeah. Except he's in special ed because he was

[02:43:06.380 --> 02:43:11.640]
down syndrome in a board of education. Yeah. And when I find out which teacher decided to teach

[02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:16.380]
him that instead of how to spell his name. Isn't that nice? Yeah, real nice. Did he mention Jesus

[02:43:16.380 --> 02:43:20.240]
in there a couple of times? No, when he gets to, when he teach him how to talk the right way,

[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:24.820]
I'd understand it. Yeah. But they're teaching him grace. We couldn't eat until he said, you know,

[02:43:24.820 --> 02:43:29.640]
we said some Hebrew words and said, on end, we start dinner. Yeah. But they got me really,

[02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:34.100]
really upset. Good. Go kick some ass. Damn right. Okay. Question? Yeah. Before you go,

[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:39.200]
I get to go to Vegas this summer. A little vacation. Yes. I know you mentioned Rio Nogo.

[02:43:39.940 --> 02:43:44.920]
Don't go there. Valley? Don't go to the Rio sweets. What do you want to go to Bally's for? It's

[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:49.680]
off the beaten path. Go to some place on the strip. Bally's is right next to MGM. I was there two

[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:54.340]
years ago. No, it's not. Bally's is right next to it MGM. You take the Monterey equal right over.

[02:43:54.340 --> 02:43:59.340]
Well, George is nodding his head like George is the expert. If you say it's right next to it,

[02:43:59.420 --> 02:44:04.920]
it's not right next to it. It's down the road, but it's right on the strip. Bally's is not

[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:09.980]
right on the strip. It's like, okay, whatever you guys say, but you said it's like slightly back off

[02:44:09.980 --> 02:44:15.200]
the strip. Okay, don't tell me it's right on the strip. It's behind a flamingo. No, it is not.

[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:20.420]
The balance is right next to MGM. I went there last two years ago. Bally's is not next to

[02:44:20.420 --> 02:44:24.940]
MGM. You're wrong. Oh, you went there. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You went there when?

[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:30.340]
Two years I was in MGM. And Bally's was right next to it. We took the Monterey over right next door.

[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:35.300]
It is not right next door. I'd make you a little wait. I bet you how much you want to bet.

[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:39.760]
It's like three or four hotels down. Whatever you want. I'm going to have to take it. It's all

[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:44.440]
paid for. It's not next door to the MGM grand. Believe me. Trust me. Okay, but if you say,

[02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:48.100]
well, and then let me ask you this, what difference does it make? Well, it doesn't. I'm going to

[02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:52.120]
want to stay at the MGM. I'm not care about that. I just want to know which hotels played a better

[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:57.580]
slot, but she said old hotels. There's nothing left. Who's left? Oh, where the slots are better?

[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:05.680]
Yeah, you mentioned tropical. Tropical. Tropical. Tropical. Tropical. Yes. I know. I know. Not the

[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:18.080]
I never liked. Not the M guy. I never go into Bally. I never went into Bally's. I maybe once. I

[02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:21.640]
never go to the flamingos. I'll redone inside. I haven't been in there. I mean, you can listen.

[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:27.040]
You can only punch so many places. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, but there's things I just

[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:30.340]
didn't do the last time. I want to catch up. Tropical. I can't. I give it a shot. It's a great place.

[02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:33.060]
All right. Okay. Thank you. Punch your brains out. Yeah.

[02:45:35.340 --> 02:45:40.800]
And you're agreeing with him? It is right on the strip. It is not right next door to the MGM grand.

[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:45.540]
It's not right next door to the MGM grand. And it is not on the strips. It is wrong. Bally's used to be

[02:45:45.540 --> 02:45:51.500]
the MGM before it burned down. Okay. It is slightly back. It is set back. They're conveyor belts

[02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:56.600]
to take you right off the strip. But it's not right on the strip. God damn it. Close enough.

[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:01.340]
You better watch yourself.

[02:46:06.420 --> 02:46:11.260]
Do you know what I'm saying? You, you little miserable uncircumcised spick.

[02:46:13.180 --> 02:46:18.960]
We have two open lines today. 6229463. 6222. Pretty soon you're going to have a nose ring if you don't

[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:25.560]
watch it. Or some kind of a ring. What do they call that? A four-skin ring? That's probably what they

[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:30.700]
call those. Prince Helbert. Anyway, when it's time to talk mattresses, when it's time to talk

[02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:34.100]
turkey about where you're laying your putrid body, you know, why don't you walk around with a bad

[02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:38.460]
back? Probably one of the reasons you may have a bad back is because you're sleeping on an old

[02:46:38.460 --> 02:46:43.120]
mattress that is headed. It's lumpy. It's bumpy and a mattress too. Pick up the phone and call

[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:48.640]
1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S because mattress shopping is a cinch. It's a snap. You don't have to leave your

[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:52.700]
house. You don't have to do anything. All you got to do is make one easy phone call. You talk to

[02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:57.560]
people who really know their mattresses inside, outside, upside down. And they sell you the greatest

[02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:01.640]
mattress in the world. Whatever kind you like. You like extra firm. You like extra soft. You like

[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:06.340]
extra hard. Well, why not? And of course, they got every kind of mattress under the sun. Seely

[02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:11.140]
posture. Pedic. Surder. Perfect sleepers. Simmons beauty rest rest on a comfort care. They sold me

[02:47:11.140 --> 02:47:15.360]
a great mattress. You were in a half ago. I sleep like an infant like a child, even working for these

[02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:20.140]
people. I still sleep good. That's a major miracle. So pick up the phone. Save a ton of money on your

[02:47:20.140 --> 02:47:23.640]
cost. Save a lot of grief on your delivery because they deliver what it's convenient for you.

[02:47:24.060 --> 02:47:27.860]
Seven days a week all the way up to 11 o'clock at night all over the state. Just pick up the phone

[02:47:27.860 --> 02:47:33.020]
and make one easy call. You got a great new mattress. It'll be there before you know it. 1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S.

[02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:37.380]
And if you don't like the mattress 30-A exchange policy, they'll take it back. Give you whatever you want.

[02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:43.620]
No extra charge. No problem at all. Call them today. It starts sleeping and comfort. Call 1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S.

[02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:50.480]
Leave off the last S. It stands for something. If you haven't heard Brooke Daniels lately, here's what you missed.

[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:54.860]
Right now in front of my face, I've got the ultimate man of heated ism 2 calendar. And the other

[02:47:54.860 --> 02:48:00.420]
ones is stud muffins of science. By the way, you haven't lived until you've seen a calendar made up of

[02:48:00.420 --> 02:48:05.000]
old men who in their real lives are scientists and one sort of another like these. You guys

[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000]
don't know my nerds. So they just take their tops off and I'm supposed to get psyched on these.

[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:12.280]
Guys when I know they'd rather be playing around with the P2 dish than me anyway.

[02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:16.580]
Brooke Daniels week nights on 610-W-I-O-D.

[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:24.600]
610-W-I-O-D is just real static-y.

[02:48:32.980 --> 02:48:40.020]
I'm very proud of my new nose ring. I think I must be a sassion king.

[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:48.300]
Look in the mirror what do I see? And head from what somehow I don't look like me.

[02:48:48.900 --> 02:48:56.080]
You see, I had surgery, but the plastic surgery. My skin, my nose, and my eyes.

[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:01.280]
What my way is, is even dialocidol.

[02:49:01.900 --> 02:49:06.000]
I can't believe this time. I got the big whip.

[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:10.140]
I got the big whip.

[02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:18.480]
I got the big whip.

[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:19.840]
I got the big whip.

[02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:22.380]
I got the big whip.

[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:28.720]
Oh, look at that.

[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:36.520]
150-W-I-O-D. I wrote it down. What was that comment? Crackhead Nigger Horon.

[02:49:36.620 --> 02:49:40.200]
Ron and Ron this morning. 9.50. Write that down in your diary, baby.

[02:49:41.420 --> 02:49:43.160]
Here's a mobile implantation. Hello.

[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:44.880]
Hey Neil, how you doing, buddy?

[02:49:44.980 --> 02:49:46.680]
Great. That guy is crazy.

[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:50.820]
B M G M is at least a mile from Bally's and the Aladdin's in between.

[02:49:51.340 --> 02:49:54.120]
Oh, the Aladdin is definitely right next door to the M G M grand.

[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:56.700]
And it's like several and the flamingo is in between.

[02:49:56.940 --> 02:49:58.300]
It's down. It's on the corner.

[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:01.380]
I don't know what the name of that screen is in there.

[02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:01.960]
I don't know what the can is.

[02:50:02.300 --> 02:50:02.520]
Huh?

[02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:04.340]
Did they call Tropicana Bolivite?

[02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:05.840]
No, no, that's where the M G M is.

[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:07.140]
Right. I'm talking about...

[02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:11.860]
He's right on the corner there. It's like about 60 R D and they got an escalator now, dragging in.

[02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:12.360]
Right.

[02:50:12.820 --> 02:50:14.360]
Yeah. What he was talking about.

[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:15.820]
He doesn't know any of his George.

[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:18.100]
George has been in Vegas twice in his life.

[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:19.760]
He's been all of us three times in his life.

[02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:21.020]
And he's an expert now.

[02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:23.000]
I've been there three times in the last five minutes.

[02:50:23.380 --> 02:50:24.580]
When's the last time you've been there?

[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:26.080]
Me or George?

[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:26.800]
No, you, no.

[02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:30.760]
January. January 17th.

[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:32.180]
Didn't you all tell them that opened up yet?

[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:32.960]
Or...

[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:36.020]
Yeah, in fact, that was the day that New York, New York was opening that day.

[02:50:36.300 --> 02:50:37.780]
And it was so jam packed in there.

[02:50:37.940 --> 02:50:39.060]
I mean, it was an incredible place.

[02:50:39.340 --> 02:50:41.860]
But we went in and lost a couple of hundred and ran right out.

[02:50:41.980 --> 02:50:42.760]
I mean, it was just...

[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:45.380]
It was hysterical. It was just too jammed in there.

[02:50:45.580 --> 02:50:46.340]
I'm going in June.

[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:47.560]
You'll love it.

[02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:48.780]
All right, Neil, take care, buddy.

[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:49.760]
When it gets over...

[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:50.700]
I'm going in there about 20 times.

[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:51.920]
What's not to like?

[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:53.060]
All right, love it.

[02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:54.260]
I've been there about 20 times.

[02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:56.140]
I got to go back every year.

[02:50:56.340 --> 02:50:56.780]
Okay, pal.

[02:50:56.960 --> 02:50:57.380]
All right, Neil.

[02:50:57.500 --> 02:50:57.780]
Good luck.

[02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:58.320]
Thanks.

[02:50:58.860 --> 02:51:00.320]
Yeah, that guy called me for a good guy,

[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:02.000]
but he's got his geography a little bit wrong.

[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.560]
And you're trying to like squeeze all those places together.

[02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:06.580]
I'll tell you, you know, that Bob Stupac place,

[02:51:06.580 --> 02:51:07.460]
whatever they call it now.

[02:51:07.520 --> 02:51:09.060]
It's changed about for that's in receivership.

[02:51:09.320 --> 02:51:11.220]
That's right next to the MGM Grand II, isn't it?

[02:51:12.320 --> 02:51:14.100]
In fact, Fremont Street, downtown.

[02:51:14.480 --> 02:51:16.420]
That's right next to the MGM Grand II, I think.

[02:51:17.420 --> 02:51:18.960]
The Golden Nugget Downtown.

[02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:20.000]
That's right next to the Grand.

[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:21.540]
And I think, uh,

[02:51:21.740 --> 02:51:23.380]
Lockland, that's right in the La Laughland.

[02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:24.180]
Whatever that town is.

[02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:26.280]
That's right next to the MGM Grand II, I think.

[02:51:27.180 --> 02:51:29.560]
So stay at the MGM because it's close to everything.

[02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:30.060]
I'll ride.

[02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:31.620]
It is a great place.

[02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:33.540]
Boyd Wailer and the food in that joint.

[02:51:34.420 --> 02:51:34.820]
The food.

[02:51:34.920 --> 02:51:35.340]
I'm Tony.

[02:51:35.500 --> 02:51:38.480]
I know it sounds crazy because I've eaten at hotels all over the world.

[02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:42.660]
And most of the hotel food sucks because it's not a restaurant.

[02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:43.300]
It's a hotel.

[02:51:43.460 --> 02:51:44.440]
That's not their primary business.

[02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:45.500]
It's a hotel.

[02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:49.780]
But the food from room service at the MGM Grand

[02:51:49.780 --> 02:51:52.820]
is just as good as any gourmet restaurant

[02:51:52.820 --> 02:51:54.840]
at which you have ever eaten in your life.

[02:51:55.220 --> 02:51:56.260]
And that's no exaggeration.

[02:51:56.300 --> 02:51:56.840]
It's great.

[02:51:58.060 --> 02:51:58.380]
Right?

[02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:01.000]
Right.

[02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:04.360]
In fact, once the restaurant, the Rosewood Grill.

[02:52:04.460 --> 02:52:05.380]
Rosewood Grill is great.

[02:52:05.500 --> 02:52:06.120]
A lot more expensive.

[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:07.220]
Although the food is not cheap.

[02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:07.980]
It's pretty expensive.

[02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:09.060]
But Boyd's good and delivery.

[02:52:09.380 --> 02:52:11.020]
They got 5,000 rooms in that hotel.

[02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:12.580]
20 minutes of your food is there.

[02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:14.020]
We're even at 5.30 in the afternoon.

[02:52:14.100 --> 02:52:14.820]
The middle of dinner hour.

[02:52:15.060 --> 02:52:16.560]
And you're wondering, how the hell do they do this?

[02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:18.220]
Oh, by the way, that guy just fell on the floor.

[02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:19.040]
That you had up on the wall.

[02:52:19.960 --> 02:52:22.360]
That guy with a heavy pecs just fell on the floor, George.

[02:52:23.340 --> 02:52:24.440]
Here's Hyperluxo on a mobile.

[02:52:24.540 --> 02:52:24.780]
Hello.

[02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:26.040]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:26.340]
Great.

[02:52:26.580 --> 02:52:28.860]
Hey, listen, how can you tell George Balley

[02:52:28.860 --> 02:52:29.880]
does not on the strip?

[02:52:30.660 --> 02:52:32.420]
How far off the sidewalk do you have to be?

[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:34.380]
Caesar's Balles is as far off the sidewalk

[02:52:34.380 --> 02:52:35.500]
through its on a strip, right?

[02:52:35.680 --> 02:52:37.280]
But Caesar's face is the strip.

[02:52:37.460 --> 02:52:39.160]
Balley doesn't even face the strip.

[02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:41.100]
It's across from the Babaric coast

[02:52:41.100 --> 02:52:42.360]
with a beautiful hangout.

[02:52:42.700 --> 02:52:43.820]
So how is that place?

[02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:44.560]
They've never been in there.

[02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:46.740]
Christ, now you know from the Italian dinner hour.

[02:52:46.740 --> 02:52:47.300]
Yes, Father.

[02:52:47.300 --> 02:52:49.240]
We're called the hole in the wall.

[02:52:49.420 --> 02:52:50.940]
It's supposed to be really famous years ago.

[02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:51.200]

[02:52:51.700 --> 02:52:52.140]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:54.780]
I call that place, I call that place the Barbaric coast.

[02:52:55.040 --> 02:52:56.780]
Yeah, but Balley's is on a strip.

[02:52:56.940 --> 02:52:57.860]
They got people movers.

[02:52:57.980 --> 02:52:58.680]
It bring you right in.

[02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:01.700]
But it is not, okay, see, it's a technicality, okay?

[02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:02.180]
Yes, it is.

[02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:04.160]
But the point at the point he was trying to make

[02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:06.820]
is this guy's trying to say it's right next to the MGM grand.

[02:53:07.100 --> 02:53:07.740]
It is not.

[02:53:07.880 --> 02:53:08.780]
It's way up the strip.

[02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:09.200]
It's toward.

[02:53:09.260 --> 02:53:10.260]
I'm going to walk by the Aladdin.

[02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:12.320]
I close my eyes when I go by there.

[02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:13.240]
Now you take them on a rail.

[02:53:13.320 --> 02:53:13.920]
Do it some work.

[02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:15.700]
Do not go any Aladdin, by the way, okay?

[02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:16.840]
Oh, it's horrible.

[02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:17.780]
Now listen.

[02:53:17.860 --> 02:53:19.020]
Although they do have a good buffet,

[02:53:19.120 --> 02:53:20.760]
you'll feel like you're right at cemetery village.

[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:22.660]
Hey, listen, let's go down a free monastery,

[02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:23.220]
now for a minute.

[02:53:23.340 --> 02:53:24.360]
You've seen that you've seen that

[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:26.440]
that $80 million light show down there.

[02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:26.700]
Yeah.

[02:53:27.180 --> 02:53:28.020]
That's our right point.

[02:53:28.020 --> 02:53:28.800]
It still sucks.

[02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:29.840]
Downtown still blows.

[02:53:30.860 --> 02:53:32.480]
Downtown still blows, huh?

[02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:33.540]
The four queens.

[02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:34.940]
Yeah, there's four queens.

[02:53:35.260 --> 02:53:37.060]
I think there's a few more than four queens.

[02:53:37.180 --> 02:53:38.680]
The beautiful, love Vegas.

[02:53:39.080 --> 02:53:40.420]
Now I'm going to make a cheap plug here.

[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:41.320]
Yeah, go ahead.

[02:53:41.420 --> 02:53:42.000]
I'd still up.

[02:53:42.300 --> 02:53:42.680]
Go ahead.

[02:53:42.740 --> 02:53:43.720]
I jump into the cabin.

[02:53:43.720 --> 02:53:44.940]
There's a Guido driving.

[02:53:44.940 --> 02:53:45.460]
Yeah.

[02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:46.700]
Where would you go for, you know,

[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:49.040]
a bowl of pasta, that's all off the beaten track.

[02:53:49.380 --> 02:53:52.040]
He took me to a place called Chicago Joe's.

[02:53:52.180 --> 02:53:55.000]
It's a house, old house, renovated, two brothers,

[02:53:55.220 --> 02:53:57.380]
zone of maybe they serve 30 people at the most.

[02:53:57.520 --> 02:53:57.740]
Yeah.

[02:53:57.960 --> 02:53:58.260]
Beautiful.

[02:53:58.480 --> 02:53:58.940]
Where is it?

[02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:01.540]
It's a couple blocks off between,

[02:54:01.860 --> 02:54:02.540]
I'm going to tell you,

[02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:06.080]
it's between the star dust and the ionosphere.

[02:54:06.260 --> 02:54:06.660]
If you know what that's like.

[02:54:06.700 --> 02:54:07.860]
Oh, right next to the MGM grid.

[02:54:09.700 --> 02:54:10.140]
Yeah.

[02:54:10.580 --> 02:54:10.580]

[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:12.180]
I'm a good after there.

[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:13.180]
Okay, thanks.

[02:54:13.620 --> 02:54:15.300]
By the way, oh, you know something.

[02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:17.000]
Well, the guy's still listening.

[02:54:17.100 --> 02:54:18.640]
They got it started all this with his Vegas,

[02:54:18.840 --> 02:54:19.220]
Kakaray.

[02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:21.240]
If you want to place where the slots are great,

[02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:21.820]
go to the start.

[02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:22.580]
This guy just,

[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:24.040]
I always went in the start.

[02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:26.400]
Why do I ever go any place beside the start.

[02:54:27.260 --> 02:54:28.500]
The start is great.

[02:54:29.460 --> 02:54:31.040]
In fact, I got a machine there.

[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:31.860]
A haywire machine.

[02:54:31.980 --> 02:54:33.240]
I'm not going to tell you which one it is.

[02:54:33.540 --> 02:54:34.420]
You can't lose.

[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:35.880]
You cannot lose.

[02:54:36.060 --> 02:54:36.720]
I love that machine.

[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:37.680]
That machine loves me.

[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:39.400]
That machine loves me.

[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:40.240]
I walk in there.

[02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:42.380]
I get a couple of rolls of a dollars.

[02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:43.420]
I go to that machine.

[02:54:43.580 --> 02:54:44.220]
I stick them in there.

[02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:45.660]
But I'll bring them up 200 bucks.

[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:47.600]
Like that.

[02:54:47.860 --> 02:54:48.660]
Just like that.

[02:54:50.900 --> 02:54:51.780]
Here's Coral Springs.

[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:52.160]
Hello.

[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:52.940]
Neil.

[02:54:53.140 --> 02:54:53.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:54.280]
What's happening, brother?

[02:54:54.500 --> 02:54:55.020]
Great stuff.

[02:54:55.400 --> 02:54:56.100]
Great stuff.

[02:54:56.340 --> 02:54:57.700]
I'm having the best day of my life.

[02:54:57.880 --> 02:54:58.080]
Almost.

[02:54:58.320 --> 02:54:58.720]
Sounds like it.

[02:54:58.940 --> 02:54:59.120]
Yeah.

[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:00.260]
What's not to like?

[02:55:01.100 --> 02:55:01.440]
Nothing.

[02:55:01.580 --> 02:55:02.120]
Beautiful day.

[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:03.200]
You're stuck in an office.

[02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:04.820]
Yeah, but it's almost over, man.

[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:07.140]
Yeah, you got 10 minutes until you're out in the sun.

[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:09.440]
I got a nice new Corvette sitting out there waiting to work.

[02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:10.820]
Okay, we have an open line.

[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:12.020]
Open line.

[02:55:12.580 --> 02:55:12.980]
Dayed.

[02:55:14.340 --> 02:55:15.140]
622, WIOD.

[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:16.520]
And one in brown.

[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:17.920]
He's similar to a bunch of bird crap,

[02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:18.980]
but he's probably right.

[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:20.180]
But tomorrow, thank God,

[02:55:20.260 --> 02:55:21.540]
his Wednesdays car wash day.

[02:55:21.860 --> 02:55:22.640]
So don't worry about it.

[02:55:24.300 --> 02:55:25.400]
You know, people like it all

[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:27.640]
talk about people who go out there and shoot pigeons.

[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:28.760]
Let me tell you one thing.

[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:31.200]
Okay, even cats, which I'm not too crazy about.

[02:55:31.780 --> 02:55:33.200]
Cats don't dump on your car.

[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:36.040]
Dogs most certainly do not take a dump on your car.

[02:55:36.900 --> 02:55:37.380]
Birds, however,

[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:38.940]
they dump on your car.

[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:41.900]
So anybody that's out there shooting birds

[02:55:41.900 --> 02:55:43.680]
for fun and profit, be my guest.

[02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:44.060]
Okay.

[02:55:44.420 --> 02:55:46.100]
I mean, they're smart little critters,

[02:55:46.140 --> 02:55:48.000]
but if they're not smart enough to evade that,

[02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:49.980]
exactly too bad.

[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:52.240]
Here's Coral Springs.

[02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:52.600]
Hello.

[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:53.200]
Neil.

[02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:53.760]
Yes, sir.

[02:55:54.340 --> 02:55:56.640]
Quintanently, I'm right next door to the MGM, too.

[02:55:56.860 --> 02:55:57.660]
It sounds like it.

[02:55:57.860 --> 02:56:00.440]
Yeah, I want to do, you're getting that gifilt to fish thing.

[02:56:00.660 --> 02:56:00.840]
Yes.

[02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:03.140]
I wanted to know if you've ever seen the fish

[02:56:03.140 --> 02:56:05.700]
on the back of some cars that has little legs on it

[02:56:05.700 --> 02:56:07.360]
and says Darwin inside it.

[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:08.460]
Yeah, I love that one.

[02:56:08.500 --> 02:56:08.900]
That's great.

[02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:09.580]
Oh, okay.

[02:56:09.660 --> 02:56:11.340]
Isn't that great that intelligent people

[02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:13.480]
are combating all this bull crap now?

[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:16.680]
It's like, hey, you either go, you can't ride,

[02:56:16.860 --> 02:56:18.600]
you know, the Pope is riding both sides of the fence.

[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:20.260]
I mean, you know, pick one or the other.

[02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:21.740]
I hear he's only riding one side,

[02:56:21.780 --> 02:56:22.880]
but I don't want to say which side.

[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:26.480]
Well, that's all I call to say to see if you've seen the Darwin one.

[02:56:26.620 --> 02:56:27.340]
I love it.

[02:56:27.460 --> 02:56:27.780]
Okay.

[02:56:27.940 --> 02:56:28.300]
See you.

[02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:28.520]
Bye.

[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:29.000]
Okay.

[02:56:29.380 --> 02:56:30.900]
Well, I'm going to give me a pull out right now.

[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:34.020]
I'm going to go home and drop it in the bay in the in the creek

[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:36.660]
and fish for something you're filtered fish for pay saw.

[02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:37.420]
How do you like that?

[02:56:38.140 --> 02:56:39.180]
I know how to do it right.

[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:41.640]
I'm getting me a pull and I'm going to either that or do fish.

[02:56:41.980 --> 02:56:43.480]
I'm going to go over to that do fish creek

[02:56:43.480 --> 02:56:45.500]
and fish for something you're filtered fish.

[02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:47.320]
What other kind of fish would you expect to catch

[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:49.700]
in do fish creek besides you're filtered fish?

[02:56:49.780 --> 02:56:50.360]
God damn it.
