A ride.

[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.620]
I like the yield and manage that greedy turd.

[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.160]
Because he wouldn't take a shower with a goldberg.

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.900]
A rascal.

[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.300]
You turd between hyzing a such an asshole.

[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.240]
He's just like Hitler and Abe Abram.

[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.700]
What's that he's pounding on?

[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.280]
I think there is love to say is drop dead right away.

[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.020]
New format.

[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.560]
What are you laughing about?

[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.460]
I think it'll be a get about an 80-shear easy.

[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.400]
It's 10-02 at WIOD. Happy Tuesday.

[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.520]
Very Jackson and Ellie Brecker have just eloped.

[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.740]
They've run off together. Nobody can fight them.

[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.900]
Get a life, guys. Quit making up crap.

[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.240]
I like the way when you don't return her calls.

[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.320]
They just are making up numbers.

[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.740]
They throw all kinds of numbers in there about to...

[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.000]
From your mouth to God's ears, Ellie, about that bonus.

[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.100]
Okay, yeah, I know somebody who I know somebody else at that bank.

[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.300]
Anybody makes up stories like these so close to paysock.

[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.780]
You know, it's going to go to a purgatory forever.

[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.020]
And probably have to buy a lot of expensive months or two.

[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.680]
No, I'm not going to return your calls, Eleanor Brecker,

[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.000]
because last time I talked to you and you wrote that big, long song in advance.

[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.000]
The Miami hero, like, buttured it all up and twisted the story.

[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.160]
And by the way, I just found out that the arrow is spending a lot of money advertising on this station.

[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.660]
And the deal is that none of the spots can go in this show.

[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.160]
Which is a lot more incentive for me to talk to the people.

[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.240]
Yeah, it's true, true story.

[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.280]
There's been $1,000 in advertising that rag on this station.

[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.680]
But very specifically, none of the spots are to run in that show.

[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.260]
In the Near Rogers show, even though our whole paper today is devoted to that fat slug.

[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.760]
I mean, the whole paper must be something going on.

[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.240]
Huh?

[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.480]
That far missing a Jew over there that BB Netanyahu, he was on her yesterday with president day.

[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.780]
All the, yeah, peace.

[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.700]
They're going to have peace.

[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.080]
All right.

[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.540]
A piece of this, a piece of that, a piece of my mind.

[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.160]
They're wailing at the wall, the Arabs, the Jews, they're doing it.

[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.380]
There must be something else going on besides Near Rogers is going to, you know, where?

[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.960]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.260]
There's got to be something else.

[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.720]
See, Eleanor Brecker and the Barry Jackson evidently are bored.

[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.320]
I mean really bored.

[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.860]
Of course, if you listen to the most of the radio in this town, you'd be bored too.

[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.340]
But they're really bored.

[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.900]
And so their thing now is they're going to stir the pot.

[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.800]
Then maybe later on, somebody else will smoke it.

[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.500]
Certainly not them.

[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.560]
But they're going to stir it.

[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.660]
They're going to pick out the seeds, the twigs, etc.

[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.900]
And then they're going to get it all ready for somebody to smoke.

[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.180]
Maybe buddy, but who knows?

[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.000]
So anyway, about that meeting I had, you know, I want to retract something.

[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.820]
I said, yes, they said something really awful.

[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.440]
I said that I've had diarrhea for an hour and a half that was more productive than the hour and a half meeting I had with Bud Paxon.

[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.760]
I want to retract that by, and I want to replace it by saying, I've had diarrhea all day.

[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.500]
That was more enjoyable.

[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:32.780]
In fact, I've had diarrhea for two days at a time in my life that was more enjoyable and much more productive than the hour and a half meeting I had with Bud Paxons three weeks ago.

[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.360]
Do you think that's soft in the blow there, any?

[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.940]
Huh?

[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.980]
It was kind of soft.

[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.060]
But at any rate, sooner or later, just stick with it.

[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.860]
So anyway, all these stories, and then of course, Barry, we got Ellie Brecker calling.

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.480]
Do me a favor.

[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.800]
Would you please, Ellie Brecker?

[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.200]
Just quit calling Harry Penis up there in Orlando.

[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.760]
I don't need any more phone calls from this guy.

[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.540]
It's killing me.

[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.860]
Oh, well, what does he want from me?

[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.540]
What does this man want from me?

[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.920]
I'm sitting there yesterday, minding my own business,

[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.780]
having just watched a gut-wrenching episode of the Guiding Light.

[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.060]
And it's like 405 in the afternoon.

[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.660]
And the stock market is closed.

[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.500]
I'm looking at the market at a good day, but Wayne's stock went in the crap or again for a change down seven eights again.

[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.280]
Nice going, Wayne.

[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.500]
Your stock blows.

[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.400]
Get a haircut and get something going with that stock.

[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.760]
And the phone rings.

[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.720]
I'm Neil Harry.

[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.440]
And it's Harry Penis again from Orlando with that same syrupy sound.

[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.580]
I mean, you know, never stole a freight train, but what do you want at this point?

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.200]
And it seems that Ellie Brecker from the Harold calls him up.

[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.360]
Again, trying to stir the pot, stir up a big controversy here.

[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.760]
Really whip everybody up into a frenzy, which you can see by the phone here.

[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.340]
Nobody cares because nobody in this audience reads the hurled anyway.

[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.660]
But yeah, well, I understand you were talking about me this morning and Ellie, you know, she wanted to get a quote.

[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.160]
She tried like crazy to get me to say something nasty about you, which I wouldn't do.

[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.700]
So this is this is the idea of news at the Harold is call up this one and try to get them to say something nasty about Neil.

[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.520]
Then call up the other station, try to get them to say nasty and try to create some kind of a war going on over here.

[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.820]
Okay.

[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.680]
I mean, I don't really care so long as the paychecks keep coming.

[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.440]
You know, it's it's very immaterial at this point in my life.

[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.640]
But I mean, talk about desperate and talk about fabricating so called news.

[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.380]
And so I finished reading this long thing here in the living section.

[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.220]
The near Rogers talking, taking show to QAM, top rated talker signs, five million dollar, five year deal.

[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.020]
And where these numbers are coming from.

[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.660]
I have no idea, especially about the bonus, sweetened by a signing bonus of nearly $500,000.

[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.160]
There was a nice signing bonus, but it sure wasn't no $500,000.

[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.400]
But I don't confuse Eleanor Brecker and Barry Jackson with the facts because they just make it up.

[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.260]
I think it was more like $5 billion.

[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.860]
I'm buying your newspaper. How do you like that? You're both fired.

[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.740]
I mean, just keep making it up.

[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.580]
So I figure that's astonishing enough that there's nothing else going on.

[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.800]
And yet another article about Neil is leaving some day. We don't know when.

[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.160]
Then I'm looking in the sports section here and here Barry Jackson again.

[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.300]
He just can't, he can't stop. He's out of control.

[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:20.600]
Rogers unlikely to let up on high Zingha at WQAM, which is why we started this morning by my favorite song.

[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.860]
And then I look on the second page on page 90 is the article continues in the here.

[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.080]
Will high Zingha use WQAM out clause is the headline and that part of the article.

[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.080]
And it goes on to say about how they have an easy out with all three of their sports franchises.

[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.160]
And if I dare to criticize them over there, will they Barry Jackson speculating well,

[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.440]
they're going to withdraw the rights, the marlins and the Panthers and whoever else in the dolphins,

[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:52.080]
which is absolutely untrue, which have already said that the the Wayne people are not going to try to interfere.

[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.980]
They didn't remove the dolphins from the station because of me.

[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.520]
It was because of one thing money, baby. That's what it was all about.

[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.420]
That's right. Had absolutely nothing to do with me or anything that I've ever said.

[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.640]
But don't tell Barry Jackson that because Barry and Ellie, they're going to create.

[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:15.100]
They are going to concoct some kind of a crisis here. They're going to concoct some kind of a battle of the radio wars.

[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.200]
That's what we called it years ago. The radio wars. They're going to bring that back again because it's boring time here, man.

[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.900]
They have 3000 people at high ali yesterday. I see 3000 people.

[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.200]
They're just ain't nothing going on here. The season is over with.

[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.900]
There's charging too much from MOTSA all over town. I mean, you know that this is a really dead time when the big stories are like for the 80.

[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:44.360]
I mean, it would be a big story. I guess haven't been here all these years that I'm going elsewhere in a few months, but the story is old.

[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.600]
It's going back in the last Friday. It was already confirmed here. It's Tuesday and they're hyperventilating and making up numbers.

[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.000]
And the other big story surge in MOTSA price triggers an inquiry by the attorney general.

[00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:01.280]
That's the big story. That's what we ought to sink our teeth into. You can see this audience is all worked up into a frenzy by the arrow.

[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:08.140]
Man, have you created a controversy here? Nothing. There is a one line even blinking, winking, blinking or not. Yes.

[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:08.940]

[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.700]
One pommat each yawts to really for that one, one journal. Exactly.

[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.840]
That's right. They're charging too much for MOTSA and the old Jews are getting really pissed off about that.

[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:30.060]
When is a pace off by the way? Do we know? Let me take a look at the do we know George when Passover starts?

[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.280]
Let's take a look.

[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.220]
Oh, this is still on March. Let's get with it over here. Huh? 21st, 21st of April.

[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:48.040]
And today is the 8th. So less than two weeks and a pace off starts, which for all you go out there, Passover, which is where they had the last supper.

[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:54.080]
Isn't that where Yoschke was having his last supper? That's right. Pace off. I wonder if he was eating MOTSA. Do you think so?

[00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.300]
And if so, was it buttered and salted? That's the question that we we that we weed to know.

[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:13.960]
Anyway, the same five pound box of MOTSA that sells for 495 in pricey Manhattan goes for as much as 1295 in South Florida supermarkets according to Abe Asofsky of coconut creak.

[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:25.100]
Unbelievable. How do you like that? With two weeks before pace off beginning, state officials have decided to find out whether more goes into Florida MOTSA prices than just flour and water.

[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:32.780]
There's a big inquiry now. Okay. This is what's going on. We don't have any crime. Everything is a hunky dory. Wayne stock is in the toilet.

[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:39.820]
This company is terrorizing people all over the radio dial and what what are they worried about? They're worried whether the MOTSA prices are too high.

[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:50.260]
Maurice Ribstein of coconut creak, whose daughter recently brought him a five pound box. She bought it in New Jersey for just $6 says I just want to make sure they don't take advantage of us.

[00:10:50.260 --> 00:11:08.040]
Oh God forbid they should do that. And it goes on and on when Dixie currently charges 1198 for a five pound box of striped his MOTSA but supermarket officials say they may discount the product as the holiday draws near using it as a lost leader to attract old to attract customers.

[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:28.340]
But that's what it says here to attract. Yeah. I got a solution for you Abe and Maurice. I got a solution for it. Don't eat MOTSA. Okay. Who needs bread? Who needs bread anyway? So what else are you going to eat? I don't know. What do you need and MOTSA? You're filled to fish and don't eat the gel stuff in the jar. Please. And what else do we get the past?

[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:39.160]
Do you have a drink some wine? Some Manushevets wine. That calendar has instructions detailed. I'm not interested in any of that barbaric ancient crap. Okay. And all these bubble I see.

[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:55.900]
Next thing will be getting instructions on how to late to fill in which I don't think we can say on the year anymore by the way. But it's tradition that yeah. So is human sacrifice. So I stop now exactly. So anyway, did I tell you about that bad bottle die we have that I had for now and a half.

[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:12.380]
Here is a Miami on a mobile. Hello. Yeah, I have the power 96 by report power 96 by report. Yes. Yes. Both Griffith took the time this morning to announce the terms of your contract. Yeah. And how does she know the terms of my contract other than of course.

[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:41.040]
She's about to handle that guy. But she went ahead and announced it to welcome you and then she proceeded to say that her contract up in July. And that she was hoping to get something sort of like what you got right making a reference about it. And Mark mostly was on doing some voice. Yeah. And he kept referring to you as the fat man. Also then she said that all the employees of fact made or something like that. Greg read. Yeah.

[00:12:42.380 --> 00:13:03.200]
Greg reads employees were all looking at your terms. And she compared the looks on their faces to that of a blow up doll in a porn omega. That was funny. So anyway, I just thought you like to know that outstanding. All right. Thanks for the good news pal. See a lonely $50 million.

[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:12.660]
We have no, I mean, you can believe those numbers that are in there or not. And especially the thing about the bonus part, which again, you know, that's way off. But don't confuse these people with the facts.

[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:25.920]
They heard in fact somewhere in the one article, it says it's been it's been written. You know, it's been written like it says in the in the Old Testament. So it's been written. Yeah. Right. By whom? Well, we don't know. But it's been written.

[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:36.640]
Where the hell does that say it's been reported in the media that his salary was in the, you know, here it is, published reports in the past have estimated a salary to be the mid six figures.

[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:48.280]
Published reports. What does that mean? Published by whom? Where did they get it from? Did they get it from me? No, did they get from anybody? I know no, but the published reports. Therefore, it must be true. I read it in the freaking newspaper.

[00:13:50.180 --> 00:14:01.560]
So if you wonder if you think that there's any degree of journalism, especially at the Miami Herald, forget it. They don't care. They just make it up. And if you don't talk to them, they'll even make more stuff up. And then they'll start calling around to try to create a verbal fist fight.

[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:17.220]
Can't, can't I get you to say, you know, something to regulatory any we said all these terrible things about you, Mr. penis. He probably told her, quit calling Mr. penis. First of all, God almighty that. Ellie, I wonder, they ought to charge her 30 bucks for a box of mods. How do you like that?

[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:30.280]
I mean, Ellie, who's obsessed with this New York, jappy thing. Exactly. And by the way, Randy's busy, Ellie, 1015 and W. I.O.D.

[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.220]
610 W.I.O.D.

[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.060]
I'd have flared, King, and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:53.560]
If I was but pecsum, the other day, the other day, the other day, the other day, the other day.

[00:14:54.540 --> 00:15:08.800]
Old day long guide, Buddha Buddha bum. If I was defecsum, going, I'd buy up all the stations, like the life of love and zeta, I can see an I.O.D.

[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:24.980]
I'd have lots of money in the bank, annoying lots of going like Roy. I'd have a radio network that nobody carries, but everyone has to run the spots.

[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:40.720]
TV cable, real estate, I would own. I'd have a half a dozen big FM stations and 607 AM stations too.

[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:47.920]
Lommy 50 dollars. And that's just in hell and there lolll, Roy!

[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:57.620]
If I was but pecsum, the other day, the other day, the other day, the other day, the other day.

[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:13.520]
Old day long guide, fiddle with my knob, if I was my pecsum's boy, I'd be rearranged a format, the other day, the other day, the other day, the other day, the other day, the other day, the other day, the other day.

[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:29.060]
I've have shackles, you know what I mean. I'd be richer than the African Queen. When high zenga would be burning cream, if I was that pecsum, going, Roy!

[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:36.840]
Hey, happy pay soft, but 1020 at WIOD, happy Tuesday to all. Very, very quiet day in town. We're going to investigate the price of MOTSY.

[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:51.940]
I think in fact, that would be make a great pay phone challenge, I think, for Rick and Spud. Send Adam, who naturally is Jewish, send him out to all the stores and secretly find out the prices of MOTSY, and then start like carrying on a hyperventilating and whip up all the old Jews into a frenzy in every supermarket in town.

[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.420]
You're getting ripped off. Here's a lady mobile in Hellendale. Hello.

[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:01.200]
Hello. Yes ma'am. Yes, are you really leaving? I've been out on my house in the morning.

[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:07.180]
Am I, I can't hear you. You're not, you got to speak up. Okay, are you really leaving? Am I really leaving? What?

[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.140]
Are you going to QAM? Yes.

[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:19.020]
I haven't heard anything. I haven't been in town and I just heard you briefly this morning and I just wondered. Yes, I am.

[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.140]
I went to second take place. I know when they changed. I don't know in a few months.

[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:31.800]
Okay. TBA, will you be listening? Yes. Oh, thank God. I'll follow you. Thank you, sweetheart.

[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.220]
Okay. Have a great day. Bye-bye.

[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:42.460]
We have an open line at day at 622-29463. We have two open lines in Broward, 767. We have one on the purple line at Pound IOD on the mobile one line.

[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:47.720]
We have one on the out of town line, the worldwide, the wicked web line, 1,884, 749, 463.

[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.860]
Here's what's going on with that Ron and Ron business, by the way. This big meeting is going on with that deal and even as we speak.

[00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:03.180]
Even as we speak, there's big meetings, Alan Mason, who's another one of the corporate to Han shows. He's in a building. Tommy Kramer's in a building trying to find the other three pounds of that white here.

[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.680]
And boy, oh boy, just amazing. It's astonishing what's going on here.

[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:17.200]
Who could have ever predicted that in just a handful of months this dissimation would have taken place so quickly and so painfully?

[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:24.020]
Here's the homestead. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Who are we going to get to replace you?

[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.520]
You're asking me like I know, like they're going to tell me or like I would have any idea. How do I know?

[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:40.260]
I just wonder, I mean, there's the stations going to help. Yeah. And first, we'll have to know you. Yeah. What about the dolphins? What about the dolphins in Jim Maddich and Jeff DeForest and Kimba Bo camper?

[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.840]
Who knows nothing about hockey, by the way, quit trying to talk about hockey. Can't buy her to your last night. I'm embarrassed for you. What about all those people?

[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:54.120]
What's left? Do you realize that the only on the air people left after I leave here from last September, Ricken says nobody else. Nobody else.

[00:18:54.120 --> 00:19:00.120]
That maybe you know, Steven J. Gay on the weekend and other than that, nobody nobody. Hopefully Ricken said, it's all you down there.

[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:07.280]
I mean, it's like nice to be able to turn on one station in the morning. Yeah, it's kind of difficult to twist that dial all the way down the 50 kilo cycles.

[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.200]
That's pretty tough move. Yeah. Okay, pal. Thanks. Yeah, these people. Oh, you know, it's kind of nice. Leave it on one spot.

[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.000]
How about your TV? Let me ask you this. How many of you turn on your TV and leave it on one spot all day?

[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.000]
Yeah, but who's got to remote control for their radio? Well, you better get it.

[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:35.080]
Asshole. God dang. Yeah, I know the first two words I'm going to say when I go on a year over there. Okay. God is the first one and dang.

[00:19:38.840 --> 00:20:05.060]
Okay. I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to

[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:35.040]
say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say the simplest way I'm going to say it. But if you try to do that

[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.060]
instruction or something yeah because Eastern

[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:37.300]
what?

[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.760]
Eastern Miramar has been touched in about ten years now and they've been saying

[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.960]
that they're going to do something.

[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.400]
Eastern Miramar hasn't been touched with what?

[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.540]
With an ugly stick?

[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.660]
I wouldn't touch it with your thing.

[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.980]
Well anyway, with your fingers.

[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.700]
Anyway, I've been trying to get a job as a volunteer.

[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.020]
Well, what do you mean trying to get a job as a volunteer?

[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.060]
What does that mean?

[00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.260]
What kind of a job is that?

[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.860]
Well, a volunteer to do what?

[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.860]
And construction or a backing hope with it, it's impossible.

[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:06.820]
Yeah.

[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.080]
So what do you sound so bummed out about?

[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.700]
In other words, you want you want to be the guy that's going to put Miramar back together again?

[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.480]
Even after all the King's horses and all the Queen's men couldn't do it?

[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.420]
I guess so far.

[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.380]
OK, George, give this guy Humpty Dumpty's number.

[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:21.700]
OK?

[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.880]
We have two open lines in Broward, 7679, 4658.

[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.320]
Talk about depressed.

[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.240]
This guy sound like he's going to blow his brains out because he can't get a volunteer job.

[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.380]
There's people out there that want to get a paid job.

[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.600]
They would like some money, OK?

[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.720]
There's people like to get a real job, like getting a few bucks or they can put food on a table.

[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:44.620]
This guy's like suicidal because he can't get a volunteer job to put Eastern Miramar back together again.

[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.960]
I'm going to tell you something, friends.

[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.120]
Everybody all over the state is sitting on pins and needles waiting to find out if Eastern

[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.760]
freaking Miramar is going to get put back together again or not.

[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.400]
Forget about the Mata.

[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.120]
Forget about Neil Rogers and all the money.

[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.220]
Forget about Ellie Brecker.

[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.240]
Forget about Harry's penis.

[00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.420]
Forget about all this stuff.

[00:21:59.480 --> 00:21:59.740]
OK?

[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.600]
The big thing is his Eastern Miramar will it ever be the same again he asked.

[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.760]
And look where this box is this morning by the way.

[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:06.160]
No.

[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.260]
Oh God.

[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.180]
Just come in here and potsky around.

[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.520]
Let me ask you something.

[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.300]
What goes on here at night now?

[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.560]
Why is it necessary?

[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.040]
I mean, I realized that it's a very ugly question for me to ask.

[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.740]
But why is it necessary now that Ron and Ron got their own studio back?

[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.220]
They're assuming they're still going to be here, which they're having a big meeting right now.

[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:25.760]
Maybe they won't.

[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.720]
But at any rate, why does anybody need to move this stuff out of the way here?

[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.020]
Even if they don't use the DCS, is this like bothering somebody over here that we have to keep

[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.320]
potsking around and pushing stuff back and forth and pushing this box over here?

[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.980]
I think that's the problem, man.

[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.400]
We got too many people potsking around with stuff here at night.

[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.380]
Somebody's going to get their box pushed pretty soon.

[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.980]
Sorry, well, we have an open line in day at 622.

[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.520]
She's weak.

[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.240]
Nice person.

[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.140]
But God is she weak.

[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:56.760]
622.

[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:57.920]
9463.

[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.800]
Two open line.

[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.420]
You know what it is?

[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.060]
Those topics.

[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.020]
Oh, God.

[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.160]
Now, if Neil Rogers went out and bought a Brazil that was too big, that would be a big story.

[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.040]
It'd be on the front page of the paper again tomorrow.

[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.260]
LA Brecker and Barry Jackson would be at Bird Eye and investigating.

[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.180]
Neil's bra was too big.

[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.220]
I'm telling you, that would be a story.

[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.480]
But because she went out and bought a bra, that was too big.

[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.400]
I mean, is that a topic for a talk show?

[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.620]
What is with these topics?

[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.520]
I'm telling you.

[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.700]
Call up Harry P. Ness right now.

[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.400]
It's time to take those topics and drop him in Lake Okeechobee on a way down.

[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.860]
Get rid of those boring, terminal, co-inducing topics.

[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.440]
You want to get the audience on fire.

[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.400]
You want to get those peaks of 20 shares.

[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.320]
You just watch what we're doing here this morning.

[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.320]
We got a couple of calls on there.

[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:40.800]
Not too many.

[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.600]
We got a couple.

[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.380]
We're working on rehabilitating Eastern Miramar.

[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.480]
We're going to put that piece of crap back together again.

[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.120]
It's the last damn thing we do.

[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.140]
What's the last thing we do?

[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:53.800]
Malcy.

[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.840]
But not like the scene of the gun.

[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.220]
Remember, this is what they were playing, Tarantella, in a scene at the wedding.

[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.260]
Much, much Malcy went to Godfather, like everything else.

[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.380]
What movies he was talking about?

[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:05.880]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.340]
Is that still in that movie theater or what?

[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.440]
That probably not.

[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:09.860]
Who knows?

[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.600]
The same old Farts that saw it before went out and saw it again.

[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.060]
And the bazillions of people out there that wouldn't know the Godfather if he stuck a

[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.020]
canole up their ass.

[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.220]
They didn't bother going to see it because it didn't have the hype.

[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.740]
And you know America, man, unless you got the hype, they don't respond.

[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.200]
Sorry.

[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.440]
1028 at WIOD.

[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.220]
WIOD is not your radio.

[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.220]
It's just real static.

[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.640]
The work talk radio I've heard my life in the WIOD.

[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:43.180]
And now, language lab, the show that teaches you a foreign language in less than 60 seconds.

[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.980]
Today's lesson, Greek.

[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.740]
Listen one.

[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.480]
Strawberry pie.

[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.360]
Strawberry pie.

[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.240]
Lesson two.

[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.460]
Apple pie.

[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.160]
Apple pie.

[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.060]
Lesson three.

[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.640]
Pumpkin pie.

[00:24:59.140 --> 00:24:59.740]
Bunky pie.

[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:01.360]
Customer.

[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.000]
What kind of pie do you have?

[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.220]
Answer.

[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.880]
Apple pie, strawberry and funky.

[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.480]
Language lab is a public service and we not be copied or authorized for resale.

[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:11.840]
Thank you.

[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.180]
You're welcome.

[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.140]
1033 at WIOD on a very marginal Tuesday morning.

[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.780]
We have an open line at day 622.

[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.540]
We have a pair of browners 767.

[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.860]
We have two only out of townlines.

[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.300]
So you see Eleanor Brecker and Barry Jackson.

[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.160]
Nobody cares.

[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.100]
It's old news already.

[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.260]
It's old news and the numbers are all wrong anyway.

[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.760]
But hey, don't worry about the facts.

[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.080]
Just continue making stuff up.

[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.680]
Call Harry Penis and Orlando by the way and get him all whipped up into a frenzy if that's

[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.600]
possible, which I doubt.

[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.200]
Here's Miami.

[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:35.620]
Hello?

[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:37.420]
Miami.

[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.280]
Neil.

[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:38.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:39.700]
First time caller.

[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.200]
Okay.

[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.680]
I wanted to give you some more information on that spy report on the boat riffing.

[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.200]
Yes.

[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:45.940]
Call 96 call.

[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:53.820]
It happened at 654 in which she stated that not only is the salary you're getting disgusting,

[00:25:53.820 --> 00:26:01.200]
but the fact that she said that because power 96 I guess is also owned by WQA.

[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:01.880]
Easily, yeah.

[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.720]
Okay, they say that now they're going to have to put on spots to pay for your salary

[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:11.260]
and to tell all the listeners that since they're going to be playing sponsor, how they're

[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.280]
going to be able to play music.

[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:17.440]
So if they have any complaints about that SOB AKS Neil, they give him a call and complain

[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.020]
on the show.

[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.360]
She didn't say that SOB.

[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.300]
She said it.

[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:20.980]
It was at 64.

[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:21.700]
64.

[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.300]
64.

[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.660]
Bo Grim was in that SOB.

[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:24.860]
SOB.

[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:25.320]

[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.300]
Okay.

[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.380]
And then by 735, she was already saying that she's changing her thing a bit.

[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.320]
I'm like, you were supposed to say profiting so that way she can make the money.

[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.340]
Okay.

[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.120]
Okay.

[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:35.620]
Great clever.

[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.440]
Very brilliant, Bo.

[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:36.900]
Very good.

[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.080]
That was the worst we're going to be working next week.

[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:45.360]
And if I could call someone to do back, Mario and Carrie Herrera, you're both douspecs.

[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.200]
Okay, but very can't play hockey like Mario.

[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.780]
Thank you so much for more spy reports from power 96.

[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.820]
Thank God they got some listeners.

[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.000]
Anywhere over there that miserable bull griffin bitch.

[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:53.800]
That's fucking bitch.

[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.400]
See, even the audience wants to start stuff up now.

[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:56.680]
Okay.

[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.000]
Everybody wants to start a big simmiss here.

[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.600]
I don't give a crap about that.

[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.440]
I'm going to do it there and doing my show period.

[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:04.460]
Period.

[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.360]
And Barry Jackson, he's all worried about this door rose care and what does man just think

[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.600]
about who cares what anybody thinks.

[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.220]
We're all in business.

[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.740]
This is a radio show.

[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.200]
Barry, I hate to break the news to you.

[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.640]
It's called making a living.

[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.900]
And in this case, a fairly decent one.

[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:20.420]
Thank God.

[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.740]
And it's also called for me getting out of here, which I'm counting the minutes.

[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.800]
I'm counting the seconds.

[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.160]
And then I'll write my encyclopedia about the Paxon people, about a corporation that

[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.400]
is just destined to destroy everything in its path.

[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:42.240]
Open line at date, 622, 2 at Broward, 767, 2 on the out of townlines, 1, 48474, 9463.

[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.440]
Here's Miami on a mobile.

[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:43.760]
Hello.

[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.540]
All right.

[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.620]
Jim Anwich.

[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.380]
You know who the happiest man in Miami is right now?

[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.580]
The happiest man in Miami is next to me is whom?

[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:53.440]
Fat Hank.

[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:54.120]
Is he?

[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:54.700]
Yeah.

[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.460]
How do you know that?

[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.760]
Some people will actually be listening when he gets on the air.

[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.580]
Yeah, that would be good.

[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.200]
Yeah.

[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.120]
But what do you think?

[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.620]
I got a question for you.

[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:03.900]
Yeah.

[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.420]
That wasn't a knock in Chris Moore, was it?

[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:06.880]
No.

[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:07.460]
Why not?

[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:13.720]
He thought, uh, I have a request in the honor of you leaving IOD.

[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.300]
Yes.

[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:14.760]
I haven't heard it all.

[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.000]
Let me just say something.

[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:16.200]
Yeah.

[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:22.340]
According to plan, my plan, uh, through September 30th, I'm going to be here.

[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.480]
This is the 8th of April.

[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.240]
I know.

[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.240]
Now if we're going to be saying goodbye for the next six months, it's going to be the

[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.780]
longest, not that I'm leaving town like Phil Henry had to do for four months, but it's

[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.540]
going to be a long, ponderous and monotonous.

[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.340]
But what do you want?

[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.460]
Uh, hang your ball spot.

[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.460]
I never heard it a long time.

[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.880]
Oh, what the whole bit.

[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.800]
I played it every day the last week.

[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.420]
Get out of here.

[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:41.940]
Get a life.

[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.340]
And what does that have to do with anything?

[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.040]
Anyway, what does that have to do with anything about QAM or IOD or anything except, uh,

[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.900]
we're not doing Larry King tributes today.

[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:50.180]
Okay.

[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.100]
He's not the one that just did the thing.

[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:52.860]
The O Rogers got.

[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:53.440]
That's right.

[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.780]
I don't read nothing about Larry King and Ellie Brecker and Barry Jackson's columns today.

[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.400]
The 85 columns they got, which spill up about two thirds of the hero, which don't run

[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.660]
around no response on this show.

[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.580]
Isn't that amazing?

[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.920]
Talk about holding a grudge.

[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.200]
Okay.

[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.800]
The fact that we got more audience on this show than their whole rest of the town put together.

[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.600]
Forget about that.

[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.120]
We don't care.

[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.220]
We'll spend the hero's money.

[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.360]
We just don't want nothing to do with that.

[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:14.720]
Faggot.

[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.060]
Okay.

[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.700]
Two open lives in Broward.

[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.640]
So I mean, it couldn't be no money out of my pocket.

[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.080]
I'll still be able to pay that electric bill whether the hero subsidizes me or not.

[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:23.920]
How do you like that?

[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:32.240]
How have I managed to reach this apex of my career of my life of my fading life without the help of the hero without their assistance?

[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:32.580]
Huh?

[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.400]
And I see that's a nightrider stock.

[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.620]
By the way, it's being downgraded.

[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.540]
Oh, that's a bad break.

[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.380]
Two open lines in Broward.

[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.820]
7679 because they bought a couple losing companies.

[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.440]
7679 463 767 W I O D.

[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.000]
Kines must macho Wayne or the people at night.

[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:49.340]
Ritter.

[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.480]
How about Tony Ritter?

[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.580]
Let's use him specifically.

[00:29:52.580 --> 00:30:01.540]
Kines must macho Wayne, I penga Mickey, Erison, Tony, Ritter, Buddy Bud Paxon or Tommy Kramer.

[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.520]
There's a poll for you.

[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.120]
Here's a Coral Springs.

[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.460]
Hello.

[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.160]
Hi, Neil.

[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:07.660]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.320]
How you doing?

[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:08.600]
Great.

[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:09.440]
Great.

[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.940]
Listen, I wasn't able to listen to your show yesterday.

[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:12.420]
Why not?

[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.120]
Well, I was working.

[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.220]
Pretty weak excuse.

[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.020]
No, I couldn't.

[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.440]
They don't let me listen to you.

[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:18.880]
Why not?

[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.220]
Antisemites?

[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:20.900]
They're assholes.

[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.220]
They're probably the ones that are charging Jews 15 bucks for a box of $6 bucks of MOTSA.

[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:25.960]
I think you're right.

[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.940]
And by the way, my mother's going bananas about that kind of money for that MOTSA.

[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.760]
I know something banana, slice bananas on MOTSA sounds pretty good.

[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.620]
Now that you mentioned it, would maybe some strawberry jam, some nice old-fashioned Jewish

[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.220]
preserves.

[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:37.940]
There you go.

[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:38.740]
Cocher for Paisov.

[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.020]
Yes.

[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.900]
From the Cork, from the Circle, you ranch.

[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:41.780]
That's delicious.

[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.060]
But listen, you know, um, the day show.

[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.020]
Well, that does sound good, no, no?

[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:45.720]
Yeah.

[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.120]
Hmm.

[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:46.940]
Anyway.

[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:51.360]
The today show, I was, I was watching my dish yesterday, the delayed telecast.

[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.160]
And they were in our favorite city.

[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:54.740]
They were in Vegas.

[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.300]
Yeah.

[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:55.980]
Yesterday.

[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.120]
That's our favorite city?

[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.060]
Well, I mean, in the U.S.

[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.180]
In your favorite city, okay.

[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:00.780]
In the U.S.

[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.060]
Okay.

[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:01.660]
Yeah.

[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.560]
Well, anyway, I just wanted to tell you that.

[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.400]
And what does that mean?

[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.040]
And there's got to be more to the story than that.

[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.040]
Well, I mean, the fact that we've, that you've told me about Vegas and I've been out there

[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.020]
and I've experienced great things out there.

[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.380]
Yeah.

[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.080]
I was just, uh, wanting to call out the show.

[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.040]
No, I did not.

[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:18.480]
You did.

[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.440]
I don't watch that show.

[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:20.880]
I'm depending on your death.

[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:22.940]
Yeah.

[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:23.640]
Yeah.

[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:24.520]
Okay.

[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.460]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.640]
And the smoke one for us.

[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.480]
We have all the brow lines wide open now.

[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.280]
767-9463-767-W-I-O-D.

[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.020]
God Almighty.

[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.000]
It's a great day for the Irish and the Jewish and the Chinese.

[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.540]
La, la, la, la, chinesi.

[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.740]
The chinesi, the Japanesei and all of those other strange people.

[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.320]
Which there are an awful lot of them too, by the way you notice.

[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.700]
Here's a cutlerage.

[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:48.920]
Hello.

[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.160]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:50.500]
Great.

[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.160]
First of all, congratulations.

[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.300]
Thank you, I guess.

[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.560]
Let me tell you, if another station wouldn't think you weren't worth it,

[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.520]
they wouldn't have offer you the job and give you the extra cash.

[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.040]
Uh-huh.

[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.620]
So, you know, screw me they can't take so long.

[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.280]
What's not to like?

[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:03.960]
Huh?

[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:04.920]
What's not to like?

[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.620]
Well, I'm saying, if it is true that you're getting an increase in your salary,

[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.560]
you have more power to it, you know what I mean?

[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.400]
Yeah, I'll tell you one thing.

[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.360]
If they were giving me even a small decrease in the salary,

[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.440]
say I can say it now, I wish they would have known this before.

[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.440]
They wouldn't give me all the money.

[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.400]
If they were even giving me a small decrease and said,

[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.320]
hey, we'll let you work over here.

[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.200]
I'd still go.

[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.780]
Let me just get out of here.

[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.020]
Just to get away from here.

[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.260]
I mean, this place is like a major cancer on our lives.

[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.800]
Well, you know, paint the world's pink for now until you leave.

[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.540]
I mean, make you relax a little bit.

[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:32.920]
Yeah.

[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.920]
You know, now about this mobs us.

[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.620]
I wonder if I just wear a pink shirt every day.

[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:37.460]
No.

[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.500]
I have several, yes?

[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.540]
Well, that's your point.

[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:41.820]
The mobs us.

[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.940]
Why are they too expensive?

[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.400]
You mean to tell me that the Jews now are exploding Jews with mobs of balls?

[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.960]
No, goyem are exploiting Jews.

[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.040]
The manufacturer, the Managed Shevitz people,

[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.280]
if you read the herald article, the Managed Shevitz people said that they have one whole sale price

[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.480]
that they sell it to everybody.

[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.360]
And after that, the distributors and the retailers, they make up their own retail price.

[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.000]
That's right.

[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.820]
So it's not the Managed Shevitz people.

[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.820]
It's not the Yiddlaugh letter ripping off the other Jews.

[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.040]
In this case, it's goyem ripping off Jews.

[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.140]
Yeah, that's what it is.

[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.280]
Because I don't think that the people that own Wendixi are Jewish.

[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.360]
I think they should complain to the rabbi.

[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:12.860]
Yeah.

[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.260]
They should complain to the rabbi.

[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.020]
They should complain to Mimi Netanyahu.

[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.200]
Forget about all this peacestock.

[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.360]
There ain't going to be no peacestock.

[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.540]
Everybody with a brain knows that.

[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.940]
Let's get the price of mobsa down in time for peacestock.

[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.480]
At least do something that's possible.

[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.720]
Yeah, probably, probably Managed Shevitz people had to increase the price because instead of shortening,

[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.720]
now they have to put pork fat, you know what I mean?

[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:30.700]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.400]
That's what I'm talking about.

[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:31.900]
Okay, pal.

[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.160]
Listen, good luck to you.

[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.200]
Oh, man, have a great life.

[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:34.420]
Bye bye.

[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.220]
Don't eat too many beans.

[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.840]
We have an open line in date, 6229463, 6222WOD,

[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.780]
and we have two open lines in Broward.

[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.680]
767 and two in Palm Beach on the out of townlines.

[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.240]
Our topic today is, have you bought a bra that's too big, guys,

[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.700]
and are you going to take it back?

[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.160]
That's our topic today.

[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.700]
Come on, let's come up with a good topic today.

[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.160]
Let's do topics from now on.

[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.580]
These next six long, excruciating months.

[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.500]
Let's come up with a topic of the day.

[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.020]
In fact, let's call Roger Crotch.

[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.540]
Maybe he can come up with a quote of the day and a topic of the day.

[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.660]
What do you think?

[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.640]
Let's just pick up any section of the newspaper.

[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:10.380]
Here you go.

[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.560]
State to Travelers is bullet train worth building.

[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.580]
Our topic today.

[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.880]
What do you think is the bullet train worth building?

[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.460]
How about a bullet for whoever wrote this article, Angela?

[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.100]
That's right.

[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.960]
Don't be alarmed if you open your mailbox and find a letter informing you

[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.900]
that your license tag was recently photographed on I-95.

[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.080]
It's just an inquiry from the Florida Department of Transportation,

[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.680]
which is researching the travel habits of those who fly and drive between Miami,

[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.680]
Orlando and Tampa.

[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.860]
Officials want to know if any of those travelers would climb on a proposed bullet train instead.

[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.700]
Of course, what do you do when you get there?

[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:44.880]
That's the obvious question.

[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:49.360]
What would you do when you get there since there's such great mass transportation in Tampa,

[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.000]
in Orlando, in Miami, not?

[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.120]
See, one thing that's a little bit difficult about building like underground subways in Florida.

[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.560]
I mean, I don't know if you've noticed that, but when you're like one foot above sea level,

[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:04.280]
it's a little difficult to build those underground subways unless they're all going to be gigantic tunnels,

[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.700]
like the, whatever it is, Callahan Tunnel, is that what it is in Boston?

[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.940]
What do you know? You've never been there?

[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.140]
No, they have two tunnels, but they have different names, which I find very interesting.

[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.600]
In Boston, the one tunnel is like the Sumner Tunnel going north, I think,

[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:24.100]
and then coming back into the city from like north of the city from the airport is the Callahan Tunnel,

[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.580]
which why is that?

[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.160]
Why isn't it just like the one one name and it happens to be going both ways?

[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.420]
Sorry, that's too easy.

[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.120]
1043 at WIOD.

[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.960]
610 WIOD.

[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:45.480]
George, or me, or whoever it is, you can tell you're a big fat fucking atheist.

[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:53.180]
He has no right to talk religion because he is a baguette and he is not representative of our thinking.

[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.580]
Tonight, get ready for a show that will have the critics talking.

[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.180]
Oh God, check out that speedo.

[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.740]
He does fill it out nicely.

[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.640]
Oh God, just think it.

[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.600]
Oh God, if he started it around, I'd like to give him out some out.

[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.680]
Oh God, I'd like to save him and look at his blood.

[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.560]
Oh God, look at the torso.

[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.020]
He's home.

[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.300]
Give you watch tonight.

[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:29.620]
I turned my radio on the other day and got Uncle Nibb's program, whatever it was.

[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.020]
It is the filthiest thing I've ever heard in my life.

[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.940]
It's a children were around, it's horrifying, I'm surprised.

[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.100]
It's a producer, you let that go on the air.

[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.900]
I've heard other complaints about it even from the help there.

[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.620]
I wish to rectify that and do something about it.

[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.640]
I'm taking God's name in vain and it's classified women.

[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.820]
Well, I wouldn't even mention that.

[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.740]
Thank you very much.

[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.280]
I like it.

[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.900]
I like it.

[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.460]
1049 at WYOD.

[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.080]
We have an open line at day 6229463.

[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.320]
A lot of uptight old parts here.

[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.660]
Now they're really going to be pissed off because the moths is like, uh,

[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.520]
how it's just insane.

[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.800]
It's just ridiculous.

[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.080]
How can you afford to go eat at the Emerald Coast and go hopping all that

[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.360]
for those third and fourth and fifth and sixth,

[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.780]
helping's off the buffet?

[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.080]
If you, uh, how can you afford that if you got to pay 1295 for a stinking five pound box of

[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.640]
moths, uh, huh?

[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.460]
And like I said before, who the hell needs moths?

[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.320]
It tastes like cardboard.

[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.260]
Unless, of course, you slather it with butter and a lot of salt to get your blood pressure

[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:26.740]
way up.

[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.340]
And maybe some strawberry preserve sounds really good.

[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.520]
Here's Miami.

[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:30.880]
Hello.

[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:32.560]
Miami.

[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:33.600]
Neil.

[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:34.820]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.360]
Okay.

[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.900]
You know, I hope this doesn't draw an out till September.

[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:42.140]
This, uh, these long abides because I think that killed the last four months of

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.640]
the show.

[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.120]
Yeah, but Phil was leaving the market.

[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.000]
I know that's what I'm saying.

[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:45.340]
You're not.

[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:45.980]
That's right.

[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:46.500]
You're just moving.

[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.340]
So there's nothing to say.

[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.360]
There's nothing to say.

[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.020]
And he's people like he's writing these articles day after day after day.

[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.680]
Filling up the Miami Herald as if there's nothing else in the world going on and trying to stir

[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.020]
up a bunch of controversy where there isn't really any that exists.

[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.140]
It's pathetic and embarrassing, but it sure kills some good time.

[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:01.540]
That's right.

[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.300]
Uh, you're gonna, uh, you're gonna talk about the bullet train.

[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.240]
You're gonna speak when I tell you this, but I finally saw the gunfather.

[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:07.720]
Yeah.

[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:14.600]
And, uh, the reason being is that I grew up in a highly religious home where the movies were a no-no.

[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:20.780]
And, but however, now this church has this, uh, thinking that, well, the movies were bad,

[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.420]
but you can see videos at home.

[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:23.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.520]
Yeah, it's a beautiful double standard, but I, whatever.

[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.500]
I mean, I, uh, I walked away from that insanity many, many years ago.

[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.840]
But it was great.

[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:31.720]
I mean, it was incredible.

[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.640]
I could, you know, and the thing is that I had, I, I hear you all the time.

[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.480]
So I hear all the parts that you were playing.

[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:36.960]
Right.

[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:43.620]
And I would, I would see like, um, that guy, um, the producer, when he said he, he can't be made to look ridiculous.

[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.720]
Jack Waltz, yes.

[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.520]
I never knew what I was from when I heard it.

[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.680]
I knew exactly where it was from.

[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.140]
It was great.

[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.360]
I mean, um, and a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.

[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.560]
Oh, it was great.

[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:53.840]
Right.

[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.540]
But, uh, they told me that part two is really good too.

[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.020]
It is.

[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.540]
Uh, that something we would say that it's better than part one.

[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.080]
I would not say that, but it's great.

[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.500]
Does it go farther back?

[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:03.500]
Yes.

[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:10.720]
Yeah, it's well, wouldn't it see part, the best way to do it is to get the video where it's all in chronological order with parts one, two, and three in a row.

[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.500]
Right, the trilogy.

[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:18.800]
So on a day when you're like really bored and you got about 15 hours when it's pouring down right outside, you just sit down and they get about a 25 pack and then enjoy it.

[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.680]
I can't do that.

[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.780]
I can't sit for that long.

[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:21.780]
No way.

[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.000]
Hey, you knew I just wanted to mention something.

[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.380]
It was funny.

[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:30.920]
You were just mentioning that, you know, you're trying to make a living and, uh, and you know, you're making good money.

[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.080]
And then you say the word thank God.

[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:38.900]
And it's really funny how you just plugged that in and, uh, you really don't believe it, God, but yet you thank him.

[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.720]
It's a matter of speech.

[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.600]
I'm not thanking anybody.

[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.420]
It's an expression.

[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.200]
What do you mean it's an expression?

[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.240]
Just like when you say God dang it, it's just an expression.

[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.580]
There's nothing you do with any God.

[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.500]
Just an expression of a sentiment.

[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.100]
That's all.

[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.500]
It's like if you say, Acha, Peaky, it doesn't have anything to do with Acha or Peaky.

[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.320]
It's just an expression.

[00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:57.980]
Okay.

[00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.380]
You feel good about that?

[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.600]
About what?

[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.520]
About saying that?

[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.360]
Do I feel good about it?

[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:03.620]
Yeah.

[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.840]
It's just part of speech.

[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:05.440]
What does that mean?

[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.480]
Do I feel good about it?

[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.320]
Do you feel good about whatever you just said?

[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.080]
Yeah.

[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.640]
What, what, based on what?

[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.240]
What is there to feel good or bad about?

[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.260]
Or having a conversation?

[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.940]
I know we are.

[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:15.360]
Yeah.

[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:21.900]
But I just, so you're trying to inject a guy, see, one minute you're telling me that you've, that you've gotten away from this brainwashing and his God bullcrap.

[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.320]
And now you're giving me a lecture on the use of the word God.

[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.540]
No, I'm not giving you a lecture.

[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.800]
I just think it's comical.

[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.080]
Why?

[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.620]
Everybody says that.

[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.780]
It's just a manner of speech.

[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.220]
It doesn't have anything to do with anything.

[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.020]
Thank God.

[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:35.920]
I would have gone for a lot of time.

[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.280]
I'll say thank the Lord.

[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.720]
It's just being sarcastic.

[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.400]
That's all.

[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.200]
Okay.

[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.100]
Well, hey, you know, by the way, I didn't say I've got away from the God concept.

[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:44.900]
I just got a little...

[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.120]
Oh, please.

[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.060]
Get, you know, I mean, you've made a first good step.

[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.440]
Now take another little step.

[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.620]
You know, pretty soon you'll be walking.

[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.220]
Have a great day, pal.

[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.340]
And God bless you.

[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.660]
God bless you, my child.

[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.760]
Oh, thank God.

[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.160]
That that, I mean, that...

[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.700]
But that that calls over.

[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.020]
But how does he know which God you're talking about?

[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.680]
Well, that's the point.

[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:05.640]
That's the whole point.

[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.700]
It's just it's a word.

[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.000]
All these God people, I can't even begin to tell you what it is or he is or she is.

[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:15.060]
And with this God stuff, enough with the God bull crap already.

[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:15.420]
Will you?

[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.880]
What an insult to the whole concept of there being a God that there could be a God responsible for this?

[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.700]
Even for this place, just look what we went through here the last six months.

[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.780]
There could be a God and we could go through this.

[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.900]
Oh, my goodness.

[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:38.080]
Open line of day at 622-9463, 622-2W-1 in Broward, 767-9463.

[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.440]
Here is Miami on a mobile.

[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:40.760]
Hello.

[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.280]
Nailed the real deal.

[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:42.800]
How you doing?

[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.420]
Okay, sir.

[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.140]
I'm trying to put it on a...

[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:45.620]
I'm trying to put it on a...

[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.280]
Who's it? You?

[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.860]
I'm wondering where that guy was headed.

[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.720]
He was being all nice to you.

[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:50.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:51.560]
The Godfather there.

[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.700]
And then, then, then he comes up with this...

[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:54.400]
How are you saying Godfather?

[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.340]
Yeah, does it make you feel good to say that?

[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.340]
What does that mean?

[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.160]
Does it make me feel good to say it?

[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.420]
No, it does not.

[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.780]
I didn't understand what...

[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.120]
I mean, if I want to feel good instantly, I'll just take a pill now.

[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.960]
I mean, who needs to say thank God?

[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.020]
Maybe that's a good God.

[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.900]
And then, if you take the pill, then you say, a good God, that's good.

[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.540]
Maybe that's a good topic for the day.

[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:12.880]
God.

[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.380]
Now, let's stay away from that.

[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:15.480]
Anyways, what I really thought...

[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.820]
Or Bud Pax and one or the other.

[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:18.980]
What I really thought...

[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:19.140]
What I really thought...

[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:19.980]
What I really thought...

[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:23.360]
What I really thought about Neo was...

[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.160]
The heat.

[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.200]
Indutory against...

[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:26.640]
Inking them.

[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.620]
And the pistons also.

[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.860]
You know, they got a W last night.

[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:32.880]
Yeah.

[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:33.760]
So, who cares?

[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:34.460]
Whoa!

[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:35.540]
I'm just kidding.

[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:40.060]
I mean, don't feel bad, but nobody cares.

[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.360]
I mean, I'm happy to hear that.

[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:41.880]
That's wonderful.

[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.520]
Did everybody wait for the playoffs to get excited?

[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.040]
What's going on?

[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.180]
They're not going to get excited.

[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:46.880]
Don't you get it?

[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.480]
I mean, you're a little slow on the uptake.

[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.100]
They don't care.

[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:49.840]
I don't know.

[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:50.360]
I don't...

[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:50.840]
I don't get it.

[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.300]
It's not a sports town.

[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:52.840]
They don't care.

[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.900]
And everybody's all worked up because we played six games with the Marlins.

[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.100]
And we've had great crowds.

[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.940]
And everybody is pretending to be real enthused.

[00:42:59.160 --> 00:42:59.800]
We'll see.

[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.600]
I'm reserving judgment because we're obviously not going to win five out of every six.

[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.260]
We're going to have some rough spots there ahead.

[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.160]
And who knows what's going to happen with this team.

[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.420]
Well, the football drafts coming up.

[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:08.760]
Anyway.

[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:09.320]
There you go.

[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:09.980]
Football draft.

[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:10.720]
Now we're talking.

[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.080]
Now there's something that Kimba can sick his teeth into.

[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:13.740]
There we go.

[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.260]
You're really a focus.

[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.160]
One more thing, Neo.

[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.140]
Neo.

[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:16.880]
Yes, I'm here.

[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:17.940]
Okay, I just want to...

[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:18.900]
I hope you weren't going to hang up.

[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.300]
No, you're supposed to say...

[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.160]
Neo, you are God.

[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:22.500]
Yes.

[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:24.780]
But do you feel good when you say that?

[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:25.860]
I feel real good.

[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.200]
Okay.

[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.040]
What about you, God?

[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.180]
I feel anything I can, yes?

[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:36.020]
Speaking of Pittsburgh hockey team, when you have these lines of Francis Lemieux and

[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.920]
Younger, that is the most potent line in the NHL.

[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:39.340]
Is that correct?

[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.460]
They're pretty potent to me.

[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.760]
Does that mean Tom Cruise can't play with them?

[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.360]
That's right.

[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.120]
I have a request.

[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:45.700]
I don't know if Tom wants to play with them.

[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.120]
What is it?

[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.340]
It may not be his type.

[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.400]
Can I request something, please?

[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:49.660]
What?

[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.620]
Macho man.

[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.200]
Okay.

I think you're very much kneel.

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.380]
You have a great take.

[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.760]
Good luck over there down to the aisle.

[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.360]
Thanks a lot.

[00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.720]
God bless you.

They're here.

[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.840]

[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.300]
His place got him in open here.

[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:06.540]

He knows it all.

[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.680]
Don't believe a word of it when he says,

[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.500]
you're going to burn in purgatory.

[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:08.500]

[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.320]
Miramar.

[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.980]
Maybe this guy had a contact them and they get him a job fixing up East Miramar.

[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:23.600]
Are they in West?

[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.040]
They're on, I don't know where they are.

[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:25.780]
They're in Miramar.

[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.340]
Thanks guys.

[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:26.740]

Nice thing with it.

[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.060]
It says goodbye, bud.

[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:30.260]
Here's a great fact.

[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:34.320]
It's the top 10 Jeff Rimmer cliches who are during any Panthers game.

[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.380]
Should I read these now?

[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.200]
Should I wait till Friday?

[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.700]
Otherwise, he might not show up Thursday getting very sensitive and emotional as old age.

[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.340]
I'll tell you that boy, very thin skinned.

[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.260]
Very too much working with that Denise.

[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.320]
I think it's rubbing off very thin skinned.

[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.020]
Number 10, Dave Lowry in full flight.

[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.440]
And by the way, it wasn't Dave Lowry.

[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.180]
It scored that picture poster.

[00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.480]
A goal that was Billy Lindsay against the Bruins, Kimba.

[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.280]
I just mentioned that for the 10th time.

[00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.200]
Stop talking about hockey, Kimba.

[00:48:59.200 --> 00:48:59.960]
I'm embarrassed for you.

[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:00.420]
You know, nothing.

[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.440]
You wouldn't know a hockey puck from 45 pounds of Mata.

[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:06.880]
Number nine, Murphy can't keep it in his own.

[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.560]
Number eight, blank to blank.

[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.680]
The pass fails to click.

[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.260]
Use any players name to fill into blanks.

[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:13.680]
Number seven, Gustavson sends it off the dasher.

[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:15.380]
And here comes Prancer, too.

[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.520]
I hate that word, dasher.

[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:18.420]
Oh, do I hate that?

[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.300]
The dasher.

[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.420]
Oh, God, River.

[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:23.420]
Number six, Melonby is ridden off the play.

[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.580]
Number five, all my, even to Kenberg's embarrassed.

[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.600]
Number four, young Robbie Nita, my around a two game scoring streak.

[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.960]
Number three, Lindsay dances across the line.

[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.580]
Oh, by the way, speaking of dancing, the greatest spot.

[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.000]
Pepsi always has the best spots.

[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.760]
Have you seen the one with the dancing beers?

[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.580]
Were they doing the village people?

[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.440]
You haven't seen that?

[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:47.380]
And the old guy looks through this and this old town in the middle of nowhere.

[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.800]
And the guy, the old fart, looks through the window.

[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.880]
He pulls the blinds either.

[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.700]
Oh, it's going to really be hell if they ever learn the Macarena.

[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.260]
It's, oh, God, it's great.

[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.120]
Nice go at Pepsi.

[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.640]
I'm buying that Pepsi stock.

[00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.760]
I'm dumping that Wayne that ball headed geek.

[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.880]
Number two, Chris Wells, improving every game.

[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.800]
And the top, Jeff Rumor-Cleashay heard during any Panther game.

[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.320]
Number one, Chris Wells, a healthy scratch.

[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:09.680]
Oh!

[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.020]
First time I mentioned that B word over here in my house.

[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.000]
You're putting a toilet.

[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:35.440]
Yeah.

[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:36.800]
But I just wanted to call.

[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.100]
What is your gutting that station?

[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:39.520]
I have to admit that, maybe.

[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.580]
Well, I doubt gutted out.

[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.820]
Yeah, the last Phil Henry, he was one of the best talents I've heard.

[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.220]
I've gone from Wisconsin myself.

[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:49.960]
I've been down here for about 10 years now, and I've been listening to you guys faithfully.

[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:50.460]
Yeah.

[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:54.260]
What's the call numbers or what's the dial number going to be where you're moving?

[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.460]
Yeah, I can't say 560WQA.

[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.340]
I mean, is that for going to be for months now?

[00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.420]
They're going to get pissed off here.

[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.100]
I'm a slow learner.

[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.160]
I'm still on the payroll here at 610W.

[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:04.600]
What is IOD?

[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:09.340]
I got a retrain my dial here because it's locked on to you right now.

[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.860]
But we're going to have to remove that lock because...

[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.000]
Yeah, get that lock off of there.

[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.140]
Just like a chest any belt.

[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.040]
Get that lock off.

[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:15.920]
Yeah, you've got it.

[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.960]
I just heard you mentioned that we lost Phil for four months.

[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:19.600]
Is there any possibility?

[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.800]
Maybe he's coming back in the area.

[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:21.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.880]
I'm sure he's coming back to this outfit.

[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.020]
Yeah, he wants to work here.

[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.540]
Well, I'll let that out for maybe you guys to get together and get back on to other places you can't met.

[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:31.080]
I don't think Phil Henry's coming back to this horse in Buggy Town.

[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.120]
I couldn't be wrong about that.

[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.080]
But if he's smart, he's making a big time.

[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.580]
Boy, they lost a good talent when they lost.

[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.920]
Yeah, you can say that again.

[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.740]
Yeah, they just kind of slipped through the crack.

[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.580]
You know how that goes.

[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.460]
Now they're going to lose another one when they lose you.

[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.960]
Yeah, well, this guy here, he was just like the other paper, I guess.

[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:46.100]
Evidently.

[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.520]
Well, you have a good one Neal and I'll be listening to him.

[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.480]
Okay, thanks, Pally.

[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:50.440]
See you.

[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.000]
Open line and Broward at what is that number in Broward?

[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.020]
7679-463-767-WID.

[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.540]
Don't be playing those jingles either way.

[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.880]
Don't be young.

[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.440]
See that don't even have no calendars on it.

[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.240]
Thank you so much.

[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:04.980]
Oh, thank God.

[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:05.520]
Thank you.

[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.220]
There he said it again.

[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.380]
Does it make you feel better when you say that?

[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.340]
I don't think so.

[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:11.340]
Don't make me feel no better.

[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:11.760]
No worse.

[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:12.600]
It's just like words.

[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.460]
Okay, sticks and stones will break.

[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.820]
But don't tell the FCC that.

[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.720]
Don't tell buddy but that sticks and stones.

[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.720]
But those words because we got to cover our ass.

[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.460]
You know how that goes?

[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.140]
We got to cover our ass to make it look good.

[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.260]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:24.660]
Hello.

[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:25.620]
Hey, Neil.

[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:26.100]
Congratulations.

[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.360]
I'm a 20-year listener.

[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:30.120]
And I think it's great what's going on there.

[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.260]
I think it's sensational.

[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:35.400]
I think the only thing I want to say is that people know what a tremendous talk host you are

[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.760]
when it comes to issues, although I don't really miss that very much.

[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:38.400]
Yes, through that.

[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:38.740]
Yeah.

[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.360]
Now the next thing we need to do is move Mandage up into the hammer spot.

[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.720]
And I think that'll really ever happen.

[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.100]
That's it.

[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.340]
It just starts to run to pots.

[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.400]
It starts to start in trouble now.

[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.640]
I think I get the ear mandage anymore.

[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:48.880]
Yeah.

[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:53.540]
Now the only thing that really intrigues me about buddy-paction is how come there an advertisement

[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.160]
that churches are in topology on your station?

[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.060]
Long me 50 dollars.

[00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.940]
Because they're paying big bucks for it.

[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:00.720]
Uh, okay.

[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:01.440]
They'll take anything.

[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:02.580]
Interesting, isn't it?

[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.440]
Thanks, Dale.

[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:03.840]
Okay.

[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:04.760]
See ya.

[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.560]
What's wrong with Elrond Hubov anyway?

[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:11.060]
We have an open line at day at 62294636222YOD.

[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.360]
Here's a mobile in Miami at a Broward line.

[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:14.660]
Hello.

[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:15.580]
Good morning.

[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:16.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.000]
Did you see the hockey game last night?

[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.100]
I saw some of the Flyer game.

[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.820]
I saw some of the Hartford game.

[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:22.860]
Wow, wow, wow.

[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:24.120]
Was that a game Hartford and Buffalo?

[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.260]
As Jeff Sanderson scores two goals in the third period to Hartford wins?

[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.620]
And that was really something.

[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.300]
I was watching the Ranger game.

[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:31.380]
Which game are you talking about?

[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.240]
The Ranger game.

[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.680]
They had a commercial drawing yet.

[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.960]
Couldn't you just smell in that game though?

[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.700]
And the Rangers just got on fire and they scored those, uh, they scored like three goals

[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:40.660]
in about five seconds.

[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:41.680]
There was just unbelievable.

[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.880]
Yeah, I was rooting for Philly, but.

[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:45.860]
Well, anybody-

[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:49.160]
But you had to like the cheap shot that Lindross took its olfie there at the end of the game.

[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:49.560]
That was good.

[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.800]
And when the game was over and he like whacked them right in the head and old Samuelsen just

[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.580]
lay there on the ice.

[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.880]
I was given a standing salute.

[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:55.980]
I loved it.

[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:56.840]
I love it too.

[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.720]
But they had a commercial that they were throwing.

[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:04.280]
I feel like the commercial was about except that they were throwing Canadians on the ice.

[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.480]
Like we were throwing rats.

[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:07.400]
Yeah.

[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.840]
And they just started throwing Canadians as flopping around on the ice.

[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:12.180]
Yeah.

[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:13.980]
I love it.

[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.080]
I also saw a part of that game too.

[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.600]
Much Yabby Tionators 2-1.

[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.900]
Boy, you get down to this part of the season and all these teams, especially in the Eastern

[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:25.120]
Conference, right on pins and needles like all within a point or two going for that last

[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:25.880]
response there.

[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:26.400]
It's great.

[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:27.400]
It's dynamite.

[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.560]
Well, we got to put something in the panthers' water.

[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.800]
We got to catch them on fire.

[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:31.480]
Yeah, right.

[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.340]
Let's go.

[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.000]
Okay, you bring the matches, pal.

[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:34.980]
See you.

[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:35.380]
See you.

[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:39.460]
We have an open line in Broward, 7679-463-766.

[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:42.240]
How many matches does it take to ignite the panthers?

[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.440]
That's our question today.

[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.360]
How much of a fire do we have to light deep underneath there?

[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.240]
ired🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂

[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.740]
We got a tough assignment here, man.

[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:55.240]
We got New Jersey, and we got Pittsburgh Wednesday and Friday this week.

[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:59.740]
The last 2 Home games, the last 2 games of the regular season, and 2 really on fire teams

[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.220]
at the moment.

[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:01.460]
And I'll tell you one thing.

[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.720]
We better damn well win one of them.

[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.360]
We got the Rangers hovering right on our spectrum.

[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.400]
Only one point behind.

[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.560]

[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.720]
trying to come up with new rules now to make sure they don't suffer well

[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:48.340]
oh yeah we have to kill him lightly don't you remember my deep high thought they

[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.320]

[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.720]
top of the building i had an argument with the bloodhead who's actually some kind

[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.440]

[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.400]
person he was like doing or something and stabbing in the head right that's

[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.940]

[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.720]
topic going here about uh... the death penalty that's original

[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.600]
see that's what happened i hate to break the news to walters say but with all

[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.040]
these other experts who think they know something about this business the problem

[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.640]
with topic radio is that there's only like ten topics and they've all been butchered

[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:46.380]
capital punishment all portion the faggot's the uh... you know they're all done they're

[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:52.160]
all done maybe they've been twisted and yanked and turned and pulled and chewed and spit out

[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.200]
the liberals against the conservatives and the contrived controversy give me a break already

[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:01.020]

They got a funny looking guy who carries a mop

[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:57.280]
And as long as you got cash you're always on top

[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.920]
A lot of things at five breaks and girl at magazines

[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.260]
I'm the master of disaster when it comes to my domain

[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.340]
I choke it, I stroke it, it gets a sore I soak it

[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.260]
I try and eat hard, I can't rise a vomit

[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:17.160]
Or case what it is every time it's fifty cents

[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.240]
But I like it, I love it

[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.620]
I want some more of it

[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.020]
Oh yeah

[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.260]
I wanted it

[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.800]
I wanted it

[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.380]
Are you sure?

[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.200]
I wanted it

[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.760]

It's a great Tuesday, man

[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.140]
It is one of the best days of my life, I'll tell you that right now

[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.520]
I can feel it, I can smell it, I can hear it

[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.440]
Thank God, it's Tuesday

[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.120]
Did that make me feel better saying that?

[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.380]
Yes, as a matter of fact

[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.800]
God didn't have nothing to do with it, but maybe

[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.020]
No, God

[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:51.420]
Did

[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.640]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:54.840]
Neo, how you doing?

[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:59.440]
Great, hey on Sunday night I went over to Bob Rubino's on the Beast Pull of Art

[01:00:59.440 --> 01:00:59.740]
See?

[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.920]
The average age in that show was 150

[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.800]
On, oh on Hellneil Beach Bullock

[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.360]
Man, I'm so proud of you, man

[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.620]
I guess these were the people that didn't have their teeth in a glass

[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.560]
Kind of hard to chew those ribs with your gums

[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.380]
Man, I have a lot of blue hair and that joint

[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.820]
Hey, the other day

[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.860]
Or are you expecting a bunch of teenagers in the hell andale?

[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:17.720]
Man, okay

[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.480]
The other night you're the under-humpershaw

[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.000]
You got underneath-potman

[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.120]
Now why won't I get up on your show?

[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:24.720]
Who?

[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:25.800]
The knees-potman

[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.000]
I don't want them on this show

[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.640]
We have rimmer on this show

[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.460]
Who the hell wants the knees?

[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.540]
Well, I can have the rimman

[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.080]
That's a good reason

[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.100]
I will tell you really, really happy

[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.300]
What is it?

[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.960]
I was actually going to QEM but I guess now I know, huh?

[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.200]
And when's your first day over there?

[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.460]
I have no idea

[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.400]
Yes, nice idea

[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.320]
You're probably either October 1st or January 1st, one or the other

[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.160]
Either way, I'll tell you your first-

[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:45.560]
Whichever comes first

[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.520]
Either way, I follow you from here to eternity

[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.040]
Okay, pal

[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.140]
One more thing

[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:50.660]
Jess?

[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.180]
I want to thank my friend Victor for picking up my pillow yesterday

[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.260]
And I want to call him a douchebag

[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.600]
Okay, I'll stick K as me this

[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.480]
Kari Neal?

[01:01:59.680 --> 01:01:59.900]
Yes

[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:02.280]
I'll be going to have a whole-mice advantage or what?

[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.560]
Don't look good

[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.320]
Doesn't look good

[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.260]
Don't look good, man

[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.160]
We better pray for our miracle

[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.120]
Hey, is George going with you over or what?

[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:09.860]
Jess he is

[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.940]
Yeah, so are we working for Baldi now?

[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.100]
Huh?

[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.180]
Are you working for Baldi?

[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.360]
Baldi don't own that station

[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360]
Oh, thank God for that

[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.040]
Baldi's got nothing to do with what I inspired

[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.380]
Don't get influenced by this very Jackson guy

[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.880]
Baldi ain't going to try to control what I say, okay?

[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:24.220]
Oh, that's very good then

[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.180]
I'll be listening to you over there

[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:25.800]
Okay, pal

[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.900]
I'll be going to you over there

[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:28.980]
Wow, emotional

[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.800]
They're emotional, man

[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.580]
They're all worked up

[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.500]
They're going wherever I'm going

[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.100]
That's their follow me like the Pied Piper

[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:37.380]
We have an open line at day 6229463 like the Pied Viper

[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.560]
And speaking of that, by the way

[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:44.400]
Here's some real shmals for Paisa, in Italian

[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:54.600]
Hey, come on, come on, come on

[01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:01.420]
Come on, come on, come on

[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:26.100]
And they were all singing this

[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:29.560]
These derga

[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.580]
And it was the last one, but boy it went down smooth

[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.420]
Two open lines in Broward, so kind of like the altar boys

[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.200]
7679463

[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.640]
7672 IOD

[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.660]
Here's a mobile in a four-letter deal, hello

[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:41.620]
Hey, good morning, Neil

[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:42.380]
When is Diaz?

[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.860]
Got a quick pork report for you

[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:44.760]
For the Latina, see?

[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.620]
Self-bound turnpike between commercial and sunrise

[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.080]
And the bushes with his radar gun

[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:49.680]
All right

[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.080]
Hey, I got you the phone, I got a quick stew barn report for you

[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:53.500]
Yes, sir?

[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.440]
My wife had our baby at West Bokeh Medical Center company

[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.700]
Your wife had stew barns, baby?

[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.780]
No, don't know ours

[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:01.960]
But the lady taking the nurse taking care of her since stew barns

[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.860]
Substained in the same room when his wife gave birth

[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:04.860]
How do you like that?

[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:05.800]
And she said again

[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.000]
And may your first child be a masculine child

[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]
And I slept in the same cottage in there

[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:10.480]
All right

[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.100]
How about that?

[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.160]
I hope it rubs off

[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.020]
I definitely did

[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:13.800]
I'll see you in Pittsburgh

[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.180]
Thanks

[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:17.240]
Okay pal, there's a guy on his way to be out, he's on a way to be a penguin

[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.140]
Beware the penguins

[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.460]
I love that Pepsi spot with the Dancing Bear as man, that is the best

[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.880]
The best, they're doing a while there at the YMCA, they're doing the village people thing

[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:31.200]
And the guy says, God help us, you know what he said? He didn't say God help us, did he?

[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.740]
I think he said heaven help us, they don't want to say God in those spots

[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.880]
Even though, oh no, it wasn't Pepsi, it was who was it with the spots with the religion

[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.160]
What was that?

[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:42.700]
Snickers?

[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.720]
Wasn't it with the Snickers Bar that they were eating in there because they had all the time

[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:50.680]
For all the Getskis that were coming in there doing the prayers in the locker room with Snickers

[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:55.220]
Love those Snickers Bar as man, they'll kill you, those Snickers ice cream cones man, those are great too

[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:59.340]
They'll kill you, but go buy a bunch because we love their spots, we love those heathen spots

[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:04.280]
That have the balls to come on there and just thumb their nose at all this bull crap

[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:10.220]
Two open lines in Broward, 767 where they don't have the balls to thumb their nose at anything in Broward

[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:14.400]
They're thumbing it, here's Miramar in a mobile hello

[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.120]
Neil, yes sir, when is Diaz?

[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.180]
Father of talk radio

[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.820]
Yes I am, the great grandfather

[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.220]
Father of talk radio

[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:26.680]
You were talking about the Godfather Trilogy, Neil, that's a great experience to stay home and watch all the crew

[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:32.720]
That's right, and I would do it again, I just rented Mission Impossible and I've heard so much about it with Tom

[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.220]
The crews remain cool

[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:34.720]
Oh no

[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.600]
And it blew

[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.660]
Of course, how can you get sucked into that?

[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.600]
I don't know Neil, it was terrible, what a waste

[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.000]
Yeah, what a waste

[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.920]
Tom Cruise hasn't made a good movie since Jack Nicholson was a child

[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.920]
Neil, I'd like to say one thing and then get a request

[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.400]
Yes

[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:54.840]
Learning to spell with Darnel, the man of the father of Ebonix, here's some of him

[01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:01.340]
And in regards to putty but tracks to putty buttaxion, go praise the Lord, unbelievable

[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.600]
Okay, God bless you

[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.900]
Oh he just sneezed, we have an open line on the mobile on purple line, pound out

[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.600]
He wouldn't have to be something if he could say God bless you to somebody, then they would sneeze

[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.480]
Now then you'd accomplish something

[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:22.960]
This is learning to spell with Darnel, I'll be Darnel Jackson and today we're going to spell the word broken

[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.800]
Spellig with me now, broken, BR-O-K-E-N

[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.520]
Now, let's use it in a sentence

[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:36.360]
So I says to the coach, I say it's man, that broken show throw a football

[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:41.460]
This is learning to spell with Darnel, I'll be Darnel Jackson

[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:49.040]
Yeah, leave a total of two people out there in Oakland, California to finally wise America up and make us realize that there happened to be a few illiterate black people out there

[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.180]
Took us a long time to figure that out but there just might be

[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.660]
Here's Walton, Massachusetts, hello

[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.840]
Neil, how you doing?

[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:56.960]
Great, here's Boston

[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.900]
Yeah, yeah, now I'm off the radio and I'm just going to school here

[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.920]
And what made your university of higher learning?

[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.120]
Bentley College

[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.680]
Bentley College, all right

[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:10.980]
Yeah, now you're talking one of the 50,000 institutions there in the Boston area

[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:15.920]
Yeah, we need a couple of institutions, especially for the Cardinal up there

[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.960]
I noticed David closed down the last strip, joined up there in Boston, everything's getting closed down

[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.940]
Well, everything's closed, that's far over

[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:26.660]
That's right, I mean everything, so they're trying to reform the city, good luck

[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:27.780]
Yeah, good luck to them

[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:31.700]
Anyway, they only knew what was going on at MIT and Cambridge, they're all doing each other

[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.720]
So, Nutty, please

[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:38.120]
Anyway, I was at the Panther game this weekend up here in Boston

[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.240]
Sorry to hear that

[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:43.180]
I agree with you, can't cheer when there's nothing to cheer for

[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.420]
Oh, that was pathetic, that was one of the all-time worst, that performance Saturday

[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:51.720]
And then Chris Wells get that bonehead spearing penalty and a game is conduct

[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.860]
Which takes that one slot on the, which he shouldn't have been in line up anyway

[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.220]
But it takes that slot on a lineup and just vacates it and now what do we got?

[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.300]
We got Kirk Muller, a dead man out there

[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:07.720]
What is the story? I mean, was this team going out there just looking for fights or what was the story?

[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.700]
Two minutes into the game, we had a five minute major

[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.460]
Well, if you're not playing good, at least to beat the crap out of them

[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:17.020]
Just like Eric at the end of that game last night, they lost the game

[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.800]
So he figures at least I'll get Old Samuelson and give him a cheap shot and put his ass on the guys

[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.860]
And nice going, Eric

[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.480]
Jovenaske killed the, I forgot who it was that he was fighting

[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.300]
Ajay's was it?

[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.660]
I think it was Millett maybe

[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:29.160]
Oh yeah, right

[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.680]
He killed the guys, got him off the ice, it was

[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.540]
What's about time, Eddie, want to fight with somebody?

[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:34.080]
Hey

[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.680]
Eddie Cain, we'll win a fight with his girlfriend lately

[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.560]
At least they got on the plane and Logan having accomplished the win at something

[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.220]
That's right

[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:44.200]
So anyway, we're hanging on by our thumbnails, man

[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.320]
It's not looking good

[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:50.120]
I think we're borrowing Stu Barnes from Pittsburgh for tomorrow night's game just for the hell of it

[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:54.140]
And Nilo, just getting you saw those stupid flags on the cars down in Florida

[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:54.740]
Yeah

[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.940]
Don't have to worry about too many of those right now, man

[01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.920]
There's about three of them left

[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.180]
They told that guy, they should sell it with the monster, real discount

[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:03.720]
Okay

[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.300]
Alright

[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.440]
Don Swinney is God

[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.380]
You got it

[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:06.860]
See you pal

[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:07.580]
Bye-bye

[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.400]
Here's a call from Waltham Mass

[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.020]
What a great place that is Boston, huh?

[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.760]
They can't screw that city up no matter how hard they try, that's a place

[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:15.740]
Quincy Market

[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:17.700]
And what else?

[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:20.580]
Quincy Market and Quincy Market, I guess that's basically all that's left

[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.200]
They did it, everything else is gone

[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.120]
Adventure car hop, that's gone, Arnie Ginsburg is gone

[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.520]
Jerry Williams, they relegated to the weekends at RKO

[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.500]
No more Dick Siong with that stupid dating show

[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.020]
No more nothing

[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.820]
Boston used to be so great, used to have schmals

[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:39.600]
Now it's like basically, that's it

[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:40.780]
Quincy Market

[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:44.320]
And you know something, the food, they got good fried clam strips

[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.340]
You like fried clams?

[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:48.340]
Oh boy, they got good ones up there, they got good chowda

[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.740]
But you have to say chowda

[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.440]
Chowda

[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:52.480]
Chowda

[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:53.860]
No, not good

[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:56.920]
That was the spit version of it, okay?

[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.240]
And don't believe it when George says he knows nothing, okay?

[01:09:59.400 --> 01:09:59.880]
It's lying to you

[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.160]
We have an open line at date, 6, 2, 3, 9, 4, 6, 3

[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.340]
I want to tell you right now, we haven't had so much good times in a long time

[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.680]
We haven't had this much of a good time in the years and ages

[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.960]
Because the last year after they sold this joint last May, that was the worst year of my life

[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.960]
And everybody else in Phil Henry almost blew his brains out

[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.700]
That was a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, several months

[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.520]
And then it got really worse, because then the sale took place

[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.580]
And we had the honeymoon period, which lasted about five minutes

[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.280]
And we thought, oh boy isn't this going to be great now?

[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.440]
Refuse to listen to what everybody else told me and guess what they were all right

[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.820]

[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:18.340]
Two open lines and dated six, two, two, two, nine, four, six, three, six, two, two, W I O D Don't play that

[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:20.940]
Rip it off, pay phone challenge and calling it telephone booth challenge or something like that. And then having some guy like in Jacksonville, South Carolina.

[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:29.120]
I love all these syndicated shows. They're on these big markets. They all seem to gravitate to Jacksonville, South Carolina. There must be something there that I don't know about.

[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:40.220]
It must be really good. Like red necks. Here's West Palm Beach. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Great. I guess that means everybody in Detroit must live in a trailer.

I'm talking about all these great schmaltz lines, all these great schmaltz characters. You don't know more green from Uranus unless you see the Godfather. And if you don't know more green, you don't know squat. I mean, what the hell is that all about?

[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:27.460]
People that think that they know something about life and they haven't seen the Godfather. My favorite line in the whole movies when Mo Green said for Christ's sake, I only had one eye.

[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.520]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:36.480]
Hi, it's Bill. I just moved to Florida and I love it here. I just want to tell you I'm early enjoying your show. Thank you so much, Bill.

[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:43.420]
I moved here from the West Coast and there's only two things that kind of bothered me. I have more NASCAR news and I've ever had my life.

[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:54.580]
Oh God. What's the Yahoo factor, man? You got a factor that in. And I'm getting a little freaked out about the prospect of Monday night football starting at 9 o'clock at night on the East Coast.

[01:18:55.700 --> 01:19:11.420]
Yeah, not much productivity going on Tuesday mornings in the East Coast. That's for damn sure. And of course the fact that it starts 9 o'clock on East Coast, it gives them a good, solid three hours to tailgate and get plastered out of their mind so that if you do have it, go to a game on Monday night for a get it, you'll never get out of their alive. That's right.

[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:15.700]
Well, I just enjoy your show and keep up the good. Thanks a lot, Bill. God bless you and God bless you, man.

[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:24.020]
Make this tiny Tim said what a tiny Tim say anyway in Christmas Carol. What the hell did tiny Tim say that was such a big deal?

[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:33.140]
Oh, but I don't think you've got to be saying it no more. Come on one more time, tiny Tim.

[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:49.280]
Oh, too late. Open line and Broward 7679 463 767 W I O D Ebenezer Scrooge. I think he had the right idea. Forget the monster. That's what he said.

[01:19:49.780 --> 01:20:01.020]
He said, let's eat something. Goish, you're like a Christmas goose. You know what I always said. Don't ever pass up a Christmas goose. In fact, last Christmas, we had somebody in here, but I didn't get it.

[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:14.760]
Here's Carl Springs. Hello. That's a Christmas goose. I was on the internet last night. Yes. And I found something here. I have it on tape right now. I think you may be able to hear it. I think you'll enjoy it. Okay, Phil Henry, I bet. No better than that.

[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:28.880]
Her boss, Miranda, son. Absolutely. W ABC. ABC. It's time time, baby. W ABC. Hello again. Here's my best to you. Now there was a guy who was like the Carl the Suze of New York.

[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:49.820]
41 seconds of him singing Hello again. Oh my God. That just makes my sphincter twitch. They also have on there a thing when Robi Young was fired. Yeah, he was on the air. Spritzing the thing about the Beatles being dead. Yeah. And then they came in and they said to him, you're off the air. He was gone like that. All right. I'm waiting for that. I mean.

[01:20:52.420 --> 01:21:04.600]
So you can collect a big fat check. A big fat one, right? I'll never get that lucky, man. I'll never get paid for five minutes for not working. I just never get that lucky. I've never had any of you. You'll give you two weeks notice and you're gone. Right. Make me work to the last.

[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:15.620]
To the last miserable second. He squeezed the last ounce of energy. The last blood out of the rock. Absolutely. And you said you and you try to be productive. And no matter how productive you are, the bastards will always say he didn't vote it.

[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:21.780]
That's right. That's right. He fudged his way through. So to speak. Well, you're going to have to change you from what it said in the paper.

[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:39.600]
Tell you can have to change your Larry King thing to say low me $500. There you go. Have a great day. Come on. See ya. We have an open line in date. 6229463. We have one in power at 7679463. Thanks to Ellie Brecker and what's his name there? That puts very Jackson for all the free publicity.

[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:46.420]
Even if most of the info was inaccurate, but who cares? It's the herald or they run in spots on our station. Like I said, we love the herald not.

[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:54.340]
Not run no spots on this show. Not that they're petty or that they hold a grudge, but they don't run no spots on the neal Roger show. And I'm proud of that.

[01:21:54.460 --> 01:22:01.580]
We may have dionetics. We may have L Ron hubbub, but we sure don't have the freaking Miami herald on this show. Thank the Lord for that. Thank God.

[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:09.540]
Thank Dick Kapan for that. Remember Dick Kapan. There's a guy. Dick Kapan used to be the publisher of the Miami the editor, whatever the hell he was.

[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:23.080]
Another far missing a guy. Dick Kapan. He was one of the crusaders against casino gambling like that whole family out there who happened to be in bed with Mickey Harrison and his cruise ships were gambling is okay. It's kosher on the cruise ships. It's a sin if it's in town. Just keep that in mind.

[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:32.160]
Because the cruise ships, of course, happened to be over there by the port of Miami, which is right by the herald building one herald plans are going to make a lot of money when they clean up that whole area.

[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:38.540]
Their property value is going to go skyrocketing, which will not offset the downgrading of night, but too bad they'll squeak their way through.

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:50.200]
I was alpha champion doing dead. We have an open line at Broward 7679 463 767. I've been in this town 21 years. I've seen him come and go. I've seen the mediocrity. I've seen the cesspool of politics.

[01:22:50.200 --> 01:23:01.000]
I've seen the corruption, the bull crap. I've seen the old people running this town. I seen that just destroying everything that might have been good like spring break, for example, chasing everybody out under the age of 100 out of this town.

[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:09.200]
I've seen it. I've seen all those crazy old Cubans out there in the domino park playing with the dominoes in singing La Bamba.

[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:17.280]
And then when they hear the wrong music on the radio, drop it La Bamba every now and then here and there. And by the way, I can smell that stinky cigar all the way through in here. You know who that's going to upset.

[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:28.100]
We don't want to leave on a bad note with him. Do we? It's not stinky. This is a great cigar. It does smell very good by the way. It's coming right through the vents. What a Ohio. I think it's this cigar. Maybe it's fat boy again.

[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:39.160]
1145 at W.I.O.D. Boy talk about Yanta. He was in here this morning. Bapapapapa. Wow. He is just wound up like a damn tighter than a snare drum.

[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:51.720]
And he's going to die. I'm talking. He's going to die unless he stops eating any minute now. Any minute now. We're going to have report that fat boy just croaked unless you stop eating. Stop shoveling all that stuff down your gullet. Will you?

[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:57.920]
Down your gulliver. By the way, let's just play the let's play the soundtrack from a clockwork orange on here now.

[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:11.400]
Speaking of me gulliver. I wonder how he's snake is coming. Anyway, it's 11. What? Basil. Right. Basil like Beethoven. Anything with a B as in beat somebody up 1145 at W.I.O.D.

[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:19.460]
610 W.I.O.D. A. You've done worse. Holy cow. Aaron's coming.

[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.780]
There's always Dan Berzagan.

[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.500]
Oh, Ellen. What's this?

[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:47.180]
They said that you're coming out. I said Ellen. Critics just shut your mouth. There's no need to be offended. Ellen.

[01:24:47.180 --> 01:25:02.160]
There's no need for suspense. I said Ellen. You are really intense about women in the biblical sense and the whole white world will know it.

[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.180]
Just lick them.

[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:12.880]
All right.

[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:45.220]
Because you'll still get more chicks than me. Katie. Please, I'll sing in the blues. I said Katie. Did you hear the good news? I said Ellen. Oh my god.

[01:25:45.220 --> 01:26:03.340]
Where in comfortable shoes but you got to know this one thing. Ellen. Never by yourself. I hear Sandra. Burn hearts come off the shelves. You do anything. Together all to herself. Even fight.

[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:45.240]
Ellen. Ellen. When you're out on the air. Ellen. Ellen. Don't spit out. You be care. How to see. Congratulations. Get a light.

[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:15.200]
I'm proud to be gay.

[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:45.180]

[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.200]
I said W-I-O-D, we have two O-I run my own board.

[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:17.940]
Well, don't tell them.

[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.380]
Two open lines in the out of town lines.

[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.900]
One triple eight, four seven four nine, four six three,

[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.920]
one triple eight, four seven four, W-I-O-D,

[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:26.880]
get the call at his right.

[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.560]
Six, ten, W-I-O-D, let's say it.

[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.420]
Six, ten, W-I-O-D.

[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:34.960]
Oops, just dropped my copy, sorry.

[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:37.020]
Dropped it on the floor, one moment please.

[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:38.680]
Oh, God.

[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:38.740]
God.

[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:48.680]
It's I-New in the sunshine state.

I'm William Robert Milford, the third with yous from six, ten,

W-I-O-D brought to you by Dianetics.

[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.460]
The hot lead flew through the streets and the blood flowed

[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:58.080]
in the gutters this morning in Key West.

[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:00.820]
A fired bartender started shooting up rum runners.

[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:04.360]
One man dead, one critical, two other customers walking wounded.

[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.480]
Cops have the shooter.

[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:07.800]
A helicopter crashed first thing this morning

[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.320]
in Palm Beach International Airport.

[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.520]
South Florida Water Management Districts,

[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.460]
a copter crashed at the airfield.

[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.180]
Pilot was talking to the tower when something went wampus.

[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.120]
The helo was an arrow special.

[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:20.820]
I used to be able to say it, arrow special, A300.

[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:21.360]
Good bird.

[01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:24.340]
They got five injured all series at St. Mary's in West Palm.

[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:25.780]
Are you a nail tech?

[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.200]
Do you know someone who is?

[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:29.880]
Did they go to the artistic nail academy in Pembroke Pines?

[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:30.560]
Well, guess what?

[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.840]
They might not be a real nail tech.

[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.140]
In fact, the state may have suspended their license

[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:37.660]
in about 1,500 others for not meeting state standards.

[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:38.420]
Like that, I don't know.

[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.200]
Like a course requirement.

[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.100]
So they got a bogus diploma in other words.

[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.880]
County Commission really serious about fighting graffiti in

[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:45.380]
Dade County.

[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:47.300]
They want to ban the sale of spray paint

[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:48.600]
and broad tip markers.

[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.440]
One commissioner, this is somebody you voted for, mind you.

[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:54.380]
He says that graffiti causes crime.

[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:55.680]
Yeah.

[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:57.820]
And once with the state highway to part,

[01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:58.940]
what a bunch of bozos.

[01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:01.660]
They got crews out cutting grass on the Palmetto Expressway

[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.400]
today, all the nooks and crannies, right?

[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.880]
And these idiots don't even bother picking up trash

[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.800]
before they start mowing and weed whacking.

[01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:10.100]
So instead of big pieces of trash, what do they got?

[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.160]
Lots of little pieces flying everywhere.

[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.620]
How stupid can you get?

[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:14.880]
Mix the clouds and sunshine.

[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.140]
They're starting to run up to 82,

[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.160]
partly cloudy nights 71 for a low.

[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.160]
Right now it is 78 degrees.

[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.340]
When life becomes a battleground,

[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:23.740]
your mind is your best weapon.

610-W-I-O-D.

[01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:58.200]
Miami.

[01:32:58.640 --> 01:32:59.240]
Fort Lauderdale.

[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.800]
Nobody repulses you more.

[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.740]
He's like Wayne with more hair.

[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:36.540]
Do you not think that it's a bummer?

[01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:37.240]
Oi!

[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.380]
When the hell Henry's gone?

[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:40.000]
Okay.

[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:42.460]
Say goodbye to Aaron.

[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:43.620]
Summers.

[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.840]
Say hi to Ron and Ron.

[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:47.680]
They're gone on work from Texas.

[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.300]
Are you?

[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.000]
That's a matter of facts.

[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:54.140]
They're gone on work from Texas.

[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:57.460]
But he'll ain't changing his act.

[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.220]
Texas, upon again Christian Roy.

[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.340]
Registration is he can't be.

[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.360]
He wants to change the stations.

[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:09.740]
Letters.

[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.760]
W-G-O-T.

[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.620]
Now we'll work from Texas.

[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:14.420]
Texas.

[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.020]
Texas, he's the plan.

[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:16.820]
New cars.

[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:17.640]
Texas.

[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:20.120]
Texas, we've gone on work from Texas.

[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:21.260]

[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.300]
Texas, make the sign of the cross.

[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:30.380]
Eli's coming.

[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:31.420]
That's the first.

[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.240]
1204 W-I-O-D.

[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:34.160]
Happy Tuesday to you.

[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:34.980]
We have an open line in day.

[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.580]
Boy, the hallways are just a blaze

[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.700]
with rumor and innuendo and bap bap bap bap.

[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.080]
In fact, that's going to be the new.

[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.360]
We're just going to have 24 hours.

[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:45.580]
Get a 90-share easy.

[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.360]
Just get a cassette recorder going in a hallway.

[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.800]
Man, you'll have enough material for another 5,000 shows.

[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:53.080]
Bap bap bap bap bap.

[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.580]
They're all guessing and speculating.

[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:55.780]
And this one's coming back.

[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:56.640]
And this one's going here.

[01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:58.620]
And I think the bottom line is Jim Realey.

[01:34:58.620 --> 01:34:59.440]
He's going to be doing his show.

[01:34:59.720 --> 01:34:59.860]
Really?

[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.000]
Open line in day 6222 W-I-O-D.

[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:04.000]
220 out of townlines.

[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.340]
1,884-749-463.

[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:09.660]
1,888-474-W-I-O-D.

[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.040]
Here's Carl Gebel's.

[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:11.220]
Hello.

[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:12.080]
Hey, Neil.

[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:12.520]
How you be?

[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:12.940]
Great.

[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.140]
Neil, just wanted to say I enjoy your show.

[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.540]
And I'm going to follow you down to the dial.

[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.100]
And also have a shameless request for a prison bitch.

[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.240]
OK, I'll see if we can get a hold of her.

[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:25.260]
Two open lines in day 6222-9463.

[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:28.020]
2622W-I-O-D on no request Tuesday.

[01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:29.700]
Here's Dayland.

[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:30.040]
Hello.

[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.040]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:31.320]
Great.

[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:32.360]
I heard the news.

[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.160]
You're moving up.

[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:34.440]
Yeah, no.

[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:37.100]
It's amazing how time has changed.

[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:38.360]
Yeah, I'm like the Jefferson's, man.

[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.100]
We're moving on up.

[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:39.900]
Here you go.

[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:42.600]
I heard that when I called in, I called it the office.

[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:44.040]
Yeah, I called in the office.

[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:45.580]
I was trying to get the new number because I knew you guys

[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:46.300]
had changed the number.

[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.840]
And I heard that Glenn Hill was trying

[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:50.760]
to apply for the new position there at the IOD.

[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:52.700]
Man, that's a good idea.

[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:53.140]
There you go.

[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.880]
Yeah, bring back the bird.

[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:55.940]
I'd like to leave more of the bird.

[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:56.820]
That sounds good to me.

[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:57.280]
That's it.

[01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:00.260]
And all we need is staying with is Don Johnson and Neil.

[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.740]
Can you do one thing for me before you go?

[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.500]
Can't do it, Pellie.

[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:04.720]
Can't do it.

[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.440]
Can't do it, Don.

[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:06.280]
There you go.

[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.000]
Have a good one.

[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:07.460]
Good luck.

[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:08.740]
And I hope you make many millions.

[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:09.540]
OK, thanks.

[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:09.880]
All right.

[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:10.980]
So yeah, me too.

[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.100]
Dayd County is open 6229-463622W-I-O-D

[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:16.640]
is in all three lines in date, which

[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.440]
is quite a predicament for those of us who are here.

[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:19.960]
It is.

[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:20.860]
Here's Miramar.

[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:21.220]
Hello.

[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:23.200]
Miramar.

[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:23.980]
Hello.

[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:24.560]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:25.600]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:25.880]
OK.

[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:27.880]
Yeah, I just wanted to say that you have a great show.

[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:30.160]
And I'll follow you wherever you go.

[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:33.880]
And Aaron Summers sucked in a Brook Daniel suck.

[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:35.100]
And Ron and Ron.

[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:35.860]
I'm gonna put a suck in.

[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:36.080]
Yeah.

[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:37.740]
Ron and Ron suck.

[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.060]
A lot of sucking going on, man.

[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.420]
Everybody put up for you in a Phil Henry.

[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:42.940]
OK.

[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.480]
You're gonna put a Henry with number one.

[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.880]
I'm sure that we're coming back.

[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:46.340]
Huh?

[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:47.000]
Not, yes.

[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.000]
Ron also have a shameless request.

[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:49.480]
OK.

[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:52.360]
Donald Duck getting his balls.

[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.100]
You know, Donald Duck.

[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:55.820]
I know, I know request Tuesday.

[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:56.820]
Come on.

[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:57.760]
Oh my god.

[01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:58.940]
Are you serious about that?

[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.680]
Yeah, the Donald Duck getting his, you know,

[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:02.840]
Donald Duck's all.

[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.120]
I don't think I can find it.

[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:05.260]
Oh my god.

[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:06.600]
I feel so good.

[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:07.300]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:08.780]
I was so down.

[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:09.840]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:10.800]

[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:11.240]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:11.420]

[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:12.520]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:12.860]

[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.000]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:15.120]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:15.120]

[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:15.480]

[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.620]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:17.900]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.440]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:21.640]
I feel so good.

[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.900]
I just rolled them around.

[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:25.020]
I'm so good.

[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.420]
Oh, man.

[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:27.000]
What?

[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.240]
I love it, we do.

[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:30.340]
Uh-oh, son of a bitch.

[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.340]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:36.060]
Don't move.

[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.180]
I'm gonna get to a towel.

[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:39.400]
We have two open lines in date.

[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:40.780]
6229463.

[01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:43.040]
We have one in power at 7679463.

[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.320]
We got the out of town lines going.

[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:46.720]
We got everything just sitting here waiting for you.

[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:47.920]
And we're the women today.

[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:49.460]
Where are the women today?

[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:53.960]
We had one, I believe, in two hours in the six minutes and 59 seconds, but who's counting.

[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:54.800]
One woman.

[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.640]
Is that Neil on there again, Billy, it can about the fact that the women will not pick

[01:37:58.640 --> 01:37:59.220]
up that instrument.

[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.200]
They're picking it up, but I'm afraid they're doing something with it and they're too busy

[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:02.680]
for us.

[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:07.500]
They won't pick that thing up and give us a call on this momentous day when Ellie Brecker.

[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.640]
I guess she's the only woman in town.

[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.900]
I really just all worked up about this.

[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:13.720]
Ellie Brecker, if she only had a life, she'd find something else to write about.

[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:14.820]
Here's plantation.

[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:15.300]
Hello.

[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:16.200]
Hey, Neil.

[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:16.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.520]
I don't know if you're tired of hearing this, but I'm going to follow you too when you go

[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:21.500]
to this other station.

[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:22.020]
Yes.

[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.340]
To this other station?

[01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:23.640]
Yeah.

[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:24.020]
Right.

[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.020]
And also I'm tired of talking.

[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:26.320]
Yeah.

[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:32.280]
I'm tired of these bleeding hearts calling about the electric chair and what a fire it

[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:32.580]
was.

[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:36.840]
I hope that they take the next line, turn them upside down and let the flames come out

[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:37.560]
of his other head.

[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.340]
Right, that's all I want to say.

[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:39.780]
Okay.

[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:40.820]
Thank you so much.

[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:41.920]
Okay.

[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:43.520]
There's a gentleman who has the opinions.

[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:47.640]
We have two open lines in power at 767-463-767-WID.

[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:52.040]
We have one at day at 622-9463-622-WID.

[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:57.040]
I sure hope the audience on that other joint is a lot less recalcitrant and a lot more active

[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.620]
in the hyper and then moving and doing it.

[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.400]
I sure have a feeling that it'll be the same people and they'll still be acting the same.

[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.300]
Your favorite sport. Yes, every time I try I try to watch it

[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.020]
They're always dropping the gloves and and going at it

[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.340]
When are they gonna when are they gonna cut the cut the crap?

[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:15.180]
Meaning what oh

[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:17.080]
Bed phone

[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:19.100]
Bed phone

[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:22.940]
Oh well, oh well

[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:24.920]
Guess what here's my suggestion for you pal. Don't watch it

[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:28.800]
We have an open line on the purple line pound ID real pussy. We do many fights in there

[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:34.000]
Too many fun. Yeah, I got news for it compared to like baseball where they stand there scratching her crotch for an hour and a half in between every bitch

[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:41.120]
These baseball games the seasons only like six or seven games into it and already the average time of the game is like three and four three and three quarters hours

[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:43.620]
How long can you sit there before you go into a coma?

[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:51.500]
I mean talk about ponderous man freaking ponderous on and on and on and all these discussions like that white socks game

[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:55.900]
I was talking about the the tagger white sock game on Saturday must have lasted 98 hours

[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:57.820]
Just went on for an eternity

[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:00.740]
Here's Miami hello

[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:06.020]
Neil yes, sir, I know you're fed up with talking about your changing radius. I'll talk about whatever you want pal

[01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:13.120]
It's your life. It's a little here. I know you don't believe in the Bible and I've always been kind of skeptical myself. Yes, but

[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:15.260]
Here we go. It's the Lord's work

[01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:20.520]
Yes, you know, you would expect a book two thousand years old to have a lot of

[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:26.820]
Missions. I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers. Yeah, and but you know back when I think about the fact that every time

[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:29.160]
Every time there was a stormer was an act of God

[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:34.140]
You think that to be written by primitive people who didn't understand what I was going on back then when they thought the earth was

[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:38.140]
Written on the back of a turtle. Yeah, sitting on two elephants. Yeah in Job

[01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:43.520]
It says God is hanging the earth upon nothing. Yeah, you know, just kind of interesting and also

[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.520]
Two thousand years before what is what does that mean in other words?

[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:51.100]
You're twisting that and manipulating that to mean whatever had you wanted to mean? Oh, look at that look how bright they were

[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:55.960]
You know, I've got brilliant. They were it's just interesting that you know, these things are said

[01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:01.480]
You know, you would hear Mike who said that the best thing about you moved to QAM is the fact that none of your listeners

[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:05.040]
We'll ever have to hear that obnoxious newsreader again. That's what Mike faxes. Yes, sir

[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:10.300]
What are you trying to say are you giving me another one of these religious pitches now? No?

[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:14.800]
No, I'm because you're really wasting the energy pad your pitching around God answer here. You know, I'm

[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:19.080]
Answered to you and answer to what and answer to what well?

[01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:22.300]
Just try to figure out why the Bible is so consistent

[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:27.660]
You know, I always just only follow crap about stoning or disobedient kids to death is that sound consistent with a loving God

[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:33.380]
Well, loving God that kept on the juice to go back and finish the job and kill off the men and women and children that they didn't kill in every town

[01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:35.740]
Where the herbs work is that 11 God that you're talking about?

[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:40.120]
I disagree with that but you know two thousand years before they discovered the earth was round

[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:41.760]
No, but what will you talk in the same?

[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.440]
Brav just blah blah blah. Pay your balls, but okay get out of here

[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:49.920]
We have an open line at day at 6 2 2 9 4 6 3 6 2 2 like a stuck record

[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:54.100]
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop. Hey listen, just hang your head on it. Okay, and the Bible too

[01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:56.860]
Oh my God

[01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:02.720]
How can I say that? So I shouldn't have said that that other guy'll be calling back now all the religionists are calling it a man

[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:10.920]
What happened to the is that on a card the Bible says what is that called the book of Brian thing?

[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:17.760]
Right right what it's called right the Bible says yeah, and that's in there under that. Yeah, it is not

[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:23.460]
We have two open lines any other timelines one triple eight four seven four nine four six three one

[01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:28.420]
Triple eight four seven four W I O damn just tell me it's not in there. Okay, it ain't in there

[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:31.140]
Here's having sure a hello

[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:33.300]
Welcome to Bible talk yes, sir

[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:41.240]
Let's go to a Pemberk Pines. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yes, I am that guy just wanted to know the meaning of life

[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:44.780]
Uh-huh as an get one. Yeah, I'm to talk to a muddy Python really

[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:51.980]
Too much Eric idle time for that guy you were you were talking about the Pepsi commercial those are great. Yeah, the dancing bears

[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:58.180]
Is it the Toyota commercial with the Jap Nissan? What but what are those spots? What are they?

[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:01.340]
I don't know that the one where it have you seen the one where the dogs?

[01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:07.660]
The guy takes the dog for a ride. Yeah, and they kick us out. Uh-huh great commercial

[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:12.240]
Anyway, but that's the new thing in TV commercials now is that the commercial has nothing to do with the product

[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:15.560]
Exactly and you finish watching 30 or 60 seconds and you think boy

[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:16.800]
That was pretty entertaining and amusing

[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:20.560]
But what does it have to do with as a matter of fact what was the product, you know?

[01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:22.840]
Have you seen the Troy Ackman commercial?

[01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:27.620]
Which route no the clone no, I have no great commercial

[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:31.740]

Like animals if you see no one with Adam Oats where he's sitting in the bar with a hot broad that any chill spot

[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:41.660]
Yeah, yeah, right. You're really fooling us Adam

[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:47.800]
The Ackman spot he's playing like a game of pickup football. Yeah, no pads. It's just a bunch of people playing

[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:49.380]
I'm he's picking it up and

[01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:55.620]
This this really hot-looking chick tackle from yeah, she she's sacked him

The Raiders gate

They say Troy loves the big brown eye

[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:49.500]
Ackman

[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:54.500]
He goes down on his knees ackman

[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:59.100]

[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:06.480]
He loves to snap cowboys on there behind I have no force in

[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:12.260]
He's got a spotless reputation

[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:17.340]
America's team is world renowned

[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.360]
But is Troy gate I've heard some people say

[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:30.140]
In the heart will he goes down ackman

[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:34.860]
He goes down on his knees ackman

[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:39.600]
I can't some balls to squeeze ackman

[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:47.580]
Don't clip him cause he likes it from behind

[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:55.160]

[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:05.220]
Who gets arrested?

[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:08.640]
The social drinker who doesn't realize he's impaired

[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:11.240]
The person with an alcohol problem

Suspension of your driver's license

[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:26.600]

You

[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:10.020]
Every good Christian knows it came to mind

[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:12.480]
It's not so very hard to do

[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:16.540]
To the god the name of the game is the Bible

[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:21.760]
There's if you have put it to where we do tell people you know the way

[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:22.620]
The battle

[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:24.720]
If I dip to your house

[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:26.720]
I will say

[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:28.380]
Take their possessions away

[01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:29.560]
The battle

[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:31.960]
And then you burn it down

[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:37.480]
You can get somebody to believe in

[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:40.660]
I think if you make the Bible say it's true

[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:41.800]
Follow follow

[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:44.440]
But no matter what you do you can be good

[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:47.420]
Because the Lord will always forgive you

[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:49.500]
Pick up the poison and snake

[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:52.880]
The Lord knows the way that all the ride

[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:56.140]
The Bible says find the portioned clinic

[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:58.040]
The Bible says

[01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:59.880]
And you the doctor down

[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:02.920]

Beat the crap out of your kids

[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:21.180]
The Bible says you're due to rot of the battle

[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:24.440]
The Bible says you're gonna care from this

[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:27.880]
The Bible says has to lead the route

[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:30.380]
The Bible says I'd offer chicken

[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:34.300]
The Bible says you make a sacrifice

[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:38.980]

Here's Miami hello

[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.940]
Neil yes sir how are you great sounds like it

[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:55.320]
Uh I'm just wondering did you get uh G C

[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:57.120]
We're written into the contract at Q AM

[01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:59.040]
Oh yeah now I got better than that

[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:02.900]
Did you uh Greg Reed is the general manager over there is uh he lives in Bay

[01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:05.520]
Bay Harbor is it uh or Bay Point

[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:06.820]
Bay Point

[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:11.300]
Possible in uh in what in Rikey Eglace he's he bought his house

[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:11.780]
Oh

[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:15.060]
So it's in the deal that with the day I start there and Rikey moves in with me

[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:16.040]
I wanted it yeah

[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:21.680]
Sounds good that's right um I'm also just curious who do you think we match up better against the uh ranges or the penguins

[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:25.440]
A lot of people are asking that question and right now I don't think it makes any difference

[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:27.880]
Especially if you watch the Rangers beat flyers last night

[01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:30.940]
Yeah, uh, I don't think it makes any difference if we're playing like we are right now

[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:34.640]
It'll gonna be four and out and goodbye and uh good luck to us. I mean uh we're

[01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:39.120]
You know, I just I don't see anything happening and I know last year we were we went into the tank

[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:44.140]
But I got news for you. I you know, I watched that team play and I saw the dynamics that were involved there

[01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:49.440]
I watched this team play up until about uh the end of November and uh this is not the same team anymore

[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:53.140]
Confidently poor performance is that that's right. I mean every game in and game out

[01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:58.480]
Um, even as matter of fact there was one point a couple of months ago when we I think we won four in a row

[01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:04.360]
And those were four of the most mediocre wins this franchise has ever had we just got very lucky at that point

[02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:10.020]
We were starting to play poorly then and then it went downhill from there. Yeah, I think our last great game

[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:13.840]
Was that was it the Buffalo game? No, the the devils game up in New Jersey. That was a great game

[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:16.060]
We beat him four to one we played well in the Buffalo game

[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:21.420]
But those two games in the last two two and a half months. I mean how many other games can you say we really played great?

[02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:21.700]
Right

[02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:25.140]
Can I call a couple of you'll do you back? Yes, sir

[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:30.020]
Bruce and Colby your great big douchebag. Okay pal. Thank you. See you tomorrow nights the big night

[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:32.580]
We got New Jersey here baby. We better kick some ass

[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:36.880]
Of course, you don't have to worry about scoring a lot of goals against them because they got a new deal

[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.680]
Now they just don't give up any they just give up the same number every game. Oh, that's right

[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:49.280]
But uh maybe tomorrow will wake up maybe somebody will light a fire a gigantic forest fire under the rectum of the players on our Panther team

[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:54.280]
And they'll do it again. They'll shock the hell out of us and maybe Chris Wells will have his ass sitting on the bench again tomorrow

[02:00:54.280 --> 02:01:01.140]
We hope we have an open line at Broward 7679 463 767 w i o d

[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:04.900]

[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:15.680]

And I was giving them a hard time and I forgot about that and I'm thinking of myself

[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:47.160]
I was driving the last night home from dinner and I'm thinking boy

[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:51.860]
Kim is gonna hate me like poison now because I was giving him a bunch of crap because the food didn't show up as early as we wanted

[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:54.040]

[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:26.660]
Okay, uh, you played a bit a long time ago. I only heard it once if it was called ass wipes

[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:28.280]
Yeah

[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:30.940]
You saw what is it?

For all of you who loved our pop-up wipes for babies here's a new pop-up wipe just for adults. Yeah, with it

Hey, ass wipe you talking to me? Yeah, I'm talking to you. What do you want?

An ass wipe you got one sure here you go. Hey, thanks when you're on the go

[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:56.620]
You don't always have time to wipe thoroughly with toilet paper if at all

[02:04:56.620 --> 02:05:01.340]
That's when you use new ass wipes the moist towel and in the convenient pop-up container honey

[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:05.980]
You're squirming in your chair. You didn't wipe properly. Did you? Well, I was so darn busy today

[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:09.400]
I just didn't have the time here. You need an ass wipe. Why ever?

[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:15.520]
Ass wipes are specially formulated to handle even the most stubborn feco fiasco's and they're sent it to give you that fresh

[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:20.240]
Just wiped feeling say bell that ass wipe you let me today was a real lifesaver. I don't want it that pop

[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:24.840]
Understood. Yeah, I was pitching that new client and I just couldn't stop digging and scratching

[02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:29.320]
In there for that ass wipe left me clean as a whistle and at minty fresh feeling gave me the confidence

[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:34.340]
I needed to land the account ass wipes available in your grocers things to wipe your butt with section

[02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:38.080]
Okay, there you go. It's no request to is there but in that case I made an exception because it's a great bit

[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:39.640]
And we haven't heard in a long time so there you go

[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:47.040]

1295 for five pounds of mots uh

[02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:56.060]

[02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:56.600]
Exactly

[02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:59.840]
We have an open line in date 629-463

[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:03.220]
We have one in Broward 767-W-I-O-D

[02:08:03.220 --> 02:08:04.820]
Here's Kendall hello

[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:05.980]

[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:06.600]
Yes sir

[02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:09.780]
Yes, congratulations on your move I think it's going to really work out great

[02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:11.820]
Thank you so much sir I'm counting the milliseconds

[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:15.120]
I'm counting the moments and the crap in this joint is getting deeper

[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:16.540]
It's almost up to the ceiling now

[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:17.520]
I can hear that

[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:19.840]
Man, oh man you can smell it a hundred miles away

[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:21.600]
Now I have an important question for you

[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:22.380]
And what is that sir?

[02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:26.380]
I used to be able to listen to you in Fort Myers, Fort Pierce, and down in Key West

[02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:26.680]
Yes

[02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:29.880]
So is the signal going to perform on the new station

[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:31.000]
I don't know

[02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:34.840]
We had called Fort Myers I guess it comes in the fine in the day time

[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.700]
Is that right, man? That's what I heard

[02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:39.520]
As far as at night does a single drop as it does on IOD?

[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:39.840]
Sure

[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:40.340]
Yeah

[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:42.160]
Okay uh

[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:43.140]
Hey, I'm radio man

[02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:47.760]
Well, I've got the uh the GE super uh super three radio

[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:48.600]
You're you're in

[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:52.140]
And it seems to work fine but I just didn't know as far as the transmitting power

[02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:53.660]
If you were going to take a drop in the power

[02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:54.940]
I'm not taking no drop in

[02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:55.640]
No drop at all

[02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:55.980]
Oh drop

[02:08:55.980 --> 02:08:57.140]
Okay Neil, love you

[02:08:57.140 --> 02:08:58.440]
We're going to talk louder and hell

[02:08:58.440 --> 02:08:58.840]
Okay

[02:08:58.840 --> 02:08:59.640]
Have a great day

[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:00.100]
Thank you

[02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:00.520]
See ya

[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:04.440]
Two open lines in date 622-29-463-622

[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:06.820]
W-I-O-D

[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:09.980]
As they continue spreading terror and propaganda and BS

[02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:11.220]
Everywhere they go

[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:13.280]
It's just unbelievable what goes on here

[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:14.280]
In this joint

[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:16.840]
Speaking of joint house Pete Bulgey doing

[02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:18.320]
Haven't seen his ugly pus here today

[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:20.320]
Haven't seen Heidner here or him

[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:23.540]
Didn't see Alan Mason come by here to shake our hand and say hey

[02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:24.480]
Best of luck to you

[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:27.420]
I guess he's busy appiddling propaganda

[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:29.700]
And hawking a china with that run and Ron show

[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:32.720]
Which I know they're very fond of and very supportive of too by the way

[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:35.520]
Here's Miami hello

[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:36.080]
Neil

[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:36.760]
Yes sir

[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:37.560]
Uh

[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:41.340]
I got a thank you turn me on to hockey and also on the Atkins diet

[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:41.900]
Yes

[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:45.560]
I bought the Atkins book but my girlfriend uh she kind of stole it from me

[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:47.200]
Yeah and I bought a question about it

[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:51.140]
I know you're supposed to keep your carbs low

[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:52.380]
And you're protein high

[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:53.400]
But how about the fatter

[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:54.360]
You're supposed to watch that

[02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:54.960]
No

[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:57.220]
You're not supposed to watch it eat as much as you want

[02:09:57.220 --> 02:09:58.440]
Well not as much as you want

[02:09:58.440 --> 02:09:59.540]
But you can eat plenty of fat

[02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:00.360]
Don't worry about fat

[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:01.460]
This is a myth in America

[02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:04.480]
Dietary fats got nothing to do with fat on your pupix

[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:04.660]
See

[02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:06.160]
That's the bottom line

[02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:08.620]
Forget about all the mythology about dietary fat

[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:10.540]
And high cholesterol on another bullcrap

[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:11.780]
Eat all ladle yourself

[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:14.820]
Have the butter have the uh whatever you like

[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:16.920]
All right that's all I want to eat

[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:18.820]
Eat the steak with the fat on it

[02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:20.780]
Isn't that the best part always in an ice steak

[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:23.160]
And the fat is like nice and crisp on the outside

[02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:42.420]

[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:43.280]
I know her name

[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:44.500]
Not that I care about it

[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:45.180]

[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:47.040]

[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:47.800]

Well I was like a substitute for a show in those days

[02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:55.220]
We were going through a lot of trauma then okay

[02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:58.020]
Who the hell needs a show when you're going through all that trauma

[02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:00.500]
But it's great radio right Ron

[02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:02.320]
And that's right sweetheart it's great radio

[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.920]
It's almost as great radio as when you're open

[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:07.280]
We just come to the side of the door there

[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:09.260]
Like during the right in the middle of the show

[02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:10.900]

[02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:12.580]

It's a Goiishia belt

[02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:47.880]

Eat a nice steak

[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:57.140]
Oh I don't like I like fish

[02:13:57.140 --> 02:13:59.020]

That's okay nobody's perfect

[02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:15.560]
No that's right

[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:16.520]
Especially me

[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:17.760]
And um

[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:19.800]
Anyway it wasn't really a nice article

[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:21.080]
I was so excited

[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:21.520]

And I have one one more

[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:30.320]
I like I say I'm always thinking you're in a hurry

[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:31.080]
I am

[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:33.640]
Okay one other thing I want to tell you that

[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:35.980]
I think that I don't know if you know maybe do

[02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:39.200]
Do you know that family bank is being bought by Barnett

[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:40.380]
They are

[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:42.680]
That's what I heard from Goodsaurus

[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:43.740]
From a Goodsaurus

[02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:44.260]
Yes

[02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:45.500]
From Goodsaurus

[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:46.720]
Notsaurus

[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:47.540]
Sores

[02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:49.960]
They're being bought by Barnett bank

[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:50.300]
Yes

[02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:52.420]
Along I got to find out if that's true or not

[02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:53.780]
If they are I'm going to blow my brains out

[02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:55.720]
Well that's why I'm telling you because

[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:58.140]
of you I wanted to go to family bank

[02:14:58.140 --> 02:14:59.360]
And I spoke to someone

[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:01.520]
And in fact I was afraid to say it over the phone

[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:03.300]
I don't know for telling me listening to me

[02:15:03.300 --> 02:15:05.360]
I don't know and maybe I shouldn't tell

[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:07.520]
But somebody from a bank

[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:08.180]
Do you know me

[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:09.300]
Okay

[02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:11.320]
But it wasn't somebody from family bank

[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:11.840]
No

[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:14.340]

Okay

[02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:27.880]
But of course that's the way the business world goes

[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:28.200]
You know

[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:29.700]
That's just a rumor at the moment

[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:31.660]
Which hopefully we'll be able to eliminate that rumor

[02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:32.240]
And it's not true

[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:33.000]
I pray I hope

[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:34.620]
Just like the radio business

[02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:35.720]
They're all getting gobbled up

[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:36.760]
By the same bunch of

[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:37.900]
Know-nuffins

[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:39.760]
Just gobbling stuff up

[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:40.700]
And destroying lives

[02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:41.720]
And destroying stations

[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:43.200]
Destroying people's entertainment

[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:44.320]
Destroying properties

[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:45.100]
Destroying everything

[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:45.840]
In their path

[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:46.940]
Like a gigantic big

[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:48.440]
Like a like big foot

[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:50.120]
Just tromp

[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:52.460]
Just plodding on everything in front of it man

[02:15:52.460 --> 02:15:55.240]
Just stopping down with those big ugly grotesque steps

[02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:57.040]
And squishing everything in his path

[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:02.140]
Just extending their tentacles and testicles as far as they can

[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:05.440]
And squishing and squeezing everything that they get their glans on

[02:16:06.100 --> 02:16:07.920]
That's what's going on in this business now

[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:10.440]
And like I told you a year or two ago when I started this grab

[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:12.060]
This is the end as we know it

[02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:13.140]
This was a disaster

[02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:15.060]
This was an in a move of insanity

[02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:17.880]
By the FCC and those bastards up in congress

[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:20.100]
Who are supposed to be concerned about the airwaves

[02:16:20.100 --> 02:16:22.000]
And about the public's right in the uh

[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:22.820]
Me on my right

[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:24.020]
Give me a break

[02:16:24.020 --> 02:16:25.880]
They couldn't give a crap less about anything now

[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:27.120]
It's like trading cards

[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:27.620]
That's all

[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:29.620]
Like a deck of baseball cards

[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:31.840]
Here I'll give you an FM over here and I'll give you two stand

[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:33.740]

Oh, a bay actually

[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:54.480]
Because they had that before a long time ago

[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:57.100]

[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:08.860]
Under the aircraft carrier the way

[02:21:08.860 --> 02:21:09.840]
That would be perfect for him

[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:11.600]
How much he moves his arms around

[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:12.060]
Mm-hmm

[02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:13.920]
Maybe he likes to have sunshine

[02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:14.860]
That's it

[02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:16.340]

[02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:18.460]
Are you turning your back on the other town people

[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:20.180]
You're not going to be on the other town

[02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:21.880]
We're not

[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:23.420]

They're on it

[02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:26.040]
The other station is on the other town

[02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:26.280]
Yeah

[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:29.920]
But they don't have a toll free number throughout the country do they

[02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:33.180]
Well I'm sure that if we if I jump up and down and scream

[02:21:33.180 --> 02:21:34.980]
We'll have a damn toll free number around the country

[02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:35.720]

[02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:36.940]

You know something so if I have to leave like an hour earlier someday

[02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:50.980]

[02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:12.320]
And you know they're going to be fostered in it in Pittsburgh

[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:15.000]
You just know they're going to beat us not out of the abruans

[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.340]

Oh great thanks thanks for the good news

[02:22:28.660 --> 02:22:29.820]
It's a weird little stat now

[02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:31.840]
Yeah we got a lot of weird little stats

[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:34.260]
I think maybe we need to start throwing a cold round

[02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:36.280]
Well it's now or never man tomorrow nights tonight

[02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:38.280]
Let's see if these guys have still got it

[02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:40.620]
Because in the past in the past one thing about this team

[02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:43.520]
I always said up until like uh that trade which I don't want to mention who

[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:46.800]
But up till that point these guys no matter how far they were behind in the game

[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:50.040]
No matter what was going on you always had the feeling they could come back

[02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:52.200]
They never gave up they struggled they fought they

[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:54.420]
But uh that chemistry just hasn't been there

[02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:56.520]
That's where he'd been blowing it's been just the opposite

[02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:59.400]
We've been blowing so many leads like the one of Washington on Sunday

[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:02.180]
It's just in the last minute last two minutes you can't do that

[02:23:02.180 --> 02:23:04.180]
19 ties is a disaster

[02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:08.160]
It feel like Mario's leaving I know his back but uh

[02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:11.000]
Is because the way the style plays where he just gets beat up

[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:14.100]
Yeah he doesn't like that and I can't blame him and like I said he's had

[02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:17.900]
You know he had the Hodgkins and he's got a bad back and the recurrent injury and the pain

[02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:20.040]
Who the hell needs it he's already a multi-millionaire

[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:21.640]
And uh he'll be just fine

[02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:23.280]
I mean you know I'd like to see him play forever

[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:25.560]
But you got to have some common sense which he does

[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:27.100]
Yeah kind of like you right

[02:23:27.100 --> 02:23:29.420]
So keep in mind Friday it'll be our last uh

[02:23:29.420 --> 02:23:30.440]
Unless we play him into playoffs

[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:32.440]
Be our last chance to see Mario here

[02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:33.220]
That's right

[02:23:33.220 --> 02:23:35.080]
They should be lined up 5,000 deep

[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:37.860]
One thing would you like to see the game opened up a bit

[02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:39.680]
Yes and I think the

[02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:41.060]
Dict needs they need to

[02:23:41.740 --> 02:23:47.760]
Cut back on the stickwork as far as I know what they need to do is go back to the or the last years offside rule and get rid of this

[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:49.520]
A new offside deal which is a pain in the ass

[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:54.200]
One of the things that frustrates the hell out of me is a guy you know the team is it look good

[02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:59.940]
It's gonna be a delayed offside and the guy goes into the zone like about two inches over the blue line and brings the puck out

[02:23:59.940 --> 02:24:04.460]
Okay, he's bringing it out but because he touched it inside the line they blow the whistle and oh

[02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:08.480]
I just scream. I see that every game. I see that and I see every time I see it

[02:24:08.480 --> 02:24:13.180]
I sit there and scream and yell at carry on because it's so ponderous the guy is bringing it out already

[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:18.880]
Okay, what difference does it make and it's just another excuse to slow it down and I just think the stickwork as far as

[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:22.740]
Hooking and cross checking in corners and increase yeah to cut back it

[02:24:22.740 --> 02:24:27.600]
You know the guys are able to reach out and you know hook arms and and bodies with the stick and slows the game down

[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:31.840]
Yeah, you're right. I see public bird in these guys you know just have a little more open ice

[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:35.840]
And then that's another reason why you get all these knee injuries and guys like burray by the way

[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:39.760]
They're injured like 80% of the time. Yeah, but you didn't see those knees that many years ago did you?

[02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:42.800]
No, he didn't that's right. Hey, I see it Friday. Okay

[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:50.120]
We have an open line in Broward 7679 463 also didn't see all these concussions back then and they weren't they had no helmets

[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:54.880]
They were playing without a helmet and didn't see anywhere near as many concussions because there's too much crap going on

[02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:59.300]
Two open lines and he out of townlines one triple eight 4749 463

[02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:05.480]
1 8 8 8 8 474 W I O D in Palm Beach on the audio net and anybody else that wants it we pay for it

[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:08.300]
Here's Hollywood. Hello

[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:14.320]
Hello, yes, sir. Yeah, I just want to let you know that old bag that was calling about Barnett banks by a family bank

[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:19.700]
Yeah, I like works there. They're merged with a little company and West Palm Beach or not being sold

[02:25:19.700 --> 02:25:23.100]
Barnett ain't buying them. They used to be on Barnett bank

[02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:24.900]
You bought um

[02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:30.600]
Family bank a long time good and the original owner went out and started a new bank a family bank. Oh, thank God

[02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:34.220]
Yeah, thank the Lord. I didn't know what she's talking about. Thank you so much

[02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:38.120]
All right, all right. Oh, thank the Lord for that. Sorry, Matt

[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:42.840]
Sorry, we had the aunt on there spreading while she said that she was a pretty sure wasn't true

[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:47.020]
But why the hell not spread a rumor and get everybody worried. That's called Jewish uh, you know, psychosis

[02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:49.960]
Why not something to worry about my mother will all like that

[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:57.560]
We have two open lines in Broward 7679 463 two on a Palm Beach and out of townlines one triple eight 4749 463

[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:01.600]
So have no fear family bank is still here. Oh, thank the Lord. Thank God

[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:07.660]
I can't take the Lord's name. Oh, why the hell not? Who's it? Where is that written? Who said that? Who made that up?

[02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:14.160]
Moshe Moishi who poopic or a Lou and God is in his name. This is title anyway. That's why they call started calling him God. How about Yeshua?

[02:26:16.700 --> 02:26:23.120]
Because in tight by the way Yeshua and Yosuke just don't know me for the first time in my life the connection there between Yeshua and Yosuke

[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:25.200]
Oh, I'm getting it

[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:26.980]
Here's a Hollywood. Hello

[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:31.680]
Deal we will follow you all the way to the queue

[02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:39.740]
Did you see Hartford and Buffalo last night those pre-mode two open lines in Broward 7679 463 767 WIOD

[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:43.180]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir

[02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:47.240]
I'm the guy that is used to listen to you way back. I used to live across you from

[02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:54.320]
KAT KAT right on the road. Hey man. I'm happy for you. You know, I get the highlight of that station

[02:26:54.320 --> 02:27:00.480]
Get out of this joint everybody will be following you. Yeah, my question is what's up with Paxton? I mean this guy going crazy

[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:07.120]
He's I mean he's ruining this another another radio station. Yeah, look what they did to she look what they did to the planet

[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:11.500]
Look at that piece of crap. What's up with this guy? Is he one of these weirdos is waiting for the ship to come and pick him up?

[02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:18.440]
Could be I mean it's I'm not so sure he's serious though. Yeah, did I'm saying I'm believe anyway, Neil

[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:24.300]
I believe you know putting pops I think I've been listening for long this time and we will all continue to listen

[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:27.320]
No matter where you go. Thanks pal. Take care. I'll read it there to you

[02:27:28.260 --> 02:27:32.180]
Oh, now we're done with pressures three. We got 48 minutes and 10 seconds to go. Not that I'm counting

[02:27:32.180 --> 02:27:36.660]
But all of a sudden I'm staring a little bit nervous because they've been smoking here today. They've been smoking. They've been forming it the mouth

[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:46.880]
Dave County 622 W. I. D. We got an open line there. Broward County. We got a pair of 767 9463 Palm Beach, why even bother?

[02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:52.420]
Yeah, I have to laugh about that thing about the 800 line for Palm Beach and the uh the all I mean what what differences

[02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:54.040]
I make we never get any calls on there anyway

[02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:58.600]
Like maybe three a day on a your audio net the worldwide like that's a big deal forget it

[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:02.000]
We had a call from Tokyo once upon a time like 85 years ago

[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:07.940]
And we had calls from New York and from Tampa and uh then a bunch of boring places

[02:28:07.940 --> 02:28:09.700]
And then we had wall fam mass today

[02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:13.320]
Which was fine, but uh that was it. It's not a big deal

[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:17.320]
I mean how the hell does it how first of all most people don't even know how to download this stuff on there

[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:21.680]
They don't know from the audio net. They don't know how to get to live audio. They really don't I was read about that yesterday

[02:28:23.460 --> 02:28:30.500]
But it's easy even I know it's easy, but but that's beside the point whether it's easier not most people don't even know that it's there number one

[02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:37.440]
Much less how to do it number two if they knew that it was there and they knew there was something there that they might want to hear or check out

[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:42.580]
That would be like another thing, but not everybody is like Rick Riley sitting around doodle with their computer 20 hours a day

[02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:44.780]
Complaining that they got no time to do everything else

[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:48.920]
I'm sure he's not I'm sure he's not doodling with it now that he's a grandpa

[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:51.580]
We have two open lines in Broward 7

Anyways, they had a spokesman for the Marlins on on W.I.N. Z who are you sure? Yeah

[02:34:44.780 --> 02:34:51.740]

But can they be that dumb?

[02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:33.900]

[02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:40.500]
That the Paxon people are frantically attempting to contact my replacement

[02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:44.540]

[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:49.560]
Yes

[02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:52.680]
Okay, let's go to a Hollywood hello

[02:43:53.220 --> 02:43:56.860]
Was that the real Stan major that was the real Stan major how do you like that?

[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:01.900]
Yeal, do you watch any of the flyer Ranger game? Who's got my real two grand. What is it? Yes, I did

[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:07.740]
I saw quite a bit of it. That was pretty good very entertaining very amazing the way the Rangers came back there and kept pounding in the and

[02:44:07.740 --> 02:44:13.880]
Hextal was just losing it. You see the way he lost it. Oh man. He lost it. He's out of control. Yeah, you can't stay in the crease for anything

[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:18.760]
He lost it. Hey, I just got you know going back to hockey a little bit. We're

[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:23.480]
We're I think we say we're foreign out if we got I mean look at the Ranger. They were clicking last. Yeah

[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:25.720]
I mean they got on fire man all of a sudden

[02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:30.300]
It's like a light bulb if I can say they went off over their head. They suddenly said oh, we better get with it

[02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:35.660]
Times running out and but I'm being they just went nuts and where they were smoking what what is that gonna happen to us

[02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:38.940]
When is somebody gonna light a fire out of these guys as and say hey times running out

[02:44:38.940 --> 02:44:42.060]
We only got two games left here. We better damn well win at least one of them

[02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:46.860]
And you better get with it. You better turn it up a few notches here and stop going through this coma thing you yours

[02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:47.640]
Yeah, I failed math

[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:53.360]
So what's the story with if we lose the next two games? Okay, what what would and let's say let me just say this to you

[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:58.080]
The penguins have four games left so after the penguins beat Boston tonight, which they will there'll be one point behind us

[02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:00.020]
New York will be only one point behind us

[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:05.860]
Ha we could drop to six if we lose both games and then we play them a three then we play a three

[02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:07.980]
That's right, which would be let's see it would be

[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:09.940]
Phil and Alphia probably

[02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:14.460]
Wouldn't that be ugly? How about that cheap shot lenders did after I loved it

[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:18.600]
You like going Eric. Yes, because it was all Samuel's and I always love it no matter who was

[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:23.400]
Yeah, but I think retaliation is gonna be Thursday night. I don't think so. I don't think so they're not gonna mess with Eric

[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:28.060]
I don't like that guy. I mean I do you do you know you wouldn't take it but you wouldn't take him on our team

[02:45:28.060 --> 02:45:33.260]
You wouldn't take Eric when I mean I know he's no Chris Wells. Oh, well, no, of course you know Chris Wells come on

[02:45:33.260 --> 02:45:36.980]
Hey, nobody what I'm saying is he's too good of a player to read to read

[02:45:36.980 --> 02:45:44.580]
Resort let me say it again pal the great players the overwhelming majority Gordie. How I'm a research art the great players were dirty players

[02:45:44.580 --> 02:45:50.360]
Don't ever forget it. I mean right there. I mean the game was over you need to do that. I mean a granite was all I loved it

[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:54.460]
Nice going to listen for a guy that's taking more cheap shots at people and anybody else

[02:45:54.460 --> 02:46:02.100]
Who wears a visor by the way who wears a visor Ulfey there nobody deserves it more than he did nice going Eric like I said

[02:46:02.100 --> 02:46:06.500]
One thing we need we need a Brian leech that guy is awesome. Yeah, you got to admit that

[02:46:06.500 --> 02:46:08.500]
Where we getting that where we're getting Brian leech?

[02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:12.500]
He is why would you want Brian leech when he got any any?

[02:46:13.180 --> 02:46:20.140]
There's no there are 180 degrees apart exactly. I mean he is he is just watching that guy skate and step up and how about that goal?

[02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:20.920]
I mean, oh

[02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:23.480]
Anyway, Brian leech god, okay

[02:46:24.460 --> 02:46:32.260]
I hope you have a great life together. We have two open all the brown lines opens in stand called they ran like a bad old hell just a joke stand

[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:35.180]
Yeah, where's where is that five where's all our stuff

[02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:41.440]
Now I'm beginning to realize just exactly what Roy did to us here man. He killed us. He butchered us with this cart business

[02:46:42.180 --> 02:46:46.480]
Right from the beginning we we our asses weren't even warming a seat in this building yet

[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:52.300]
Which thank to George and Wayne we finally got the stuff over here because nobody else was getting involved in it

[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:57.840]
Either the past program director or the president interim one or the future one nobody was involved in it

[02:46:57.840 --> 02:47:04.180]
So we finally got this pay place put back together Roy's given all these ultimatums because everybody here's a big shot everybody's a big shot

[02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:04.920]
That's right

[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:07.760]
Thought the eye in the shot and

[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:15.640]
And so about like 90% of our carts are families. They will never see him again. I'm rather stick hot burning needles in my eyes

[02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:18.080]
And the listen to the joe. We read all shows

[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:24.920]
With the enters and the crutches and the worthless calls man. His show really blows

[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:33.340]
He's about as young as I am dumb. He's about as smart as the two day old far

[02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:41.900]
I rather take a hot battery acid animal than the listen to the joe. We ran the show. I really mean it

[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:45.840]
Listen to the joe. We ran the show forget the bagels

[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:16.580]
What did I think of it? Yeah, uh, it was a

[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:21.120]
Once in a lifetime experience and I loved what Darren McCarty did to Claude Lemieux

This is not a spot just to mention for one of our fine sponsors

[02:50:42.280 --> 02:50:45.280]
And then when Kevin Wallace leaves us in a couple of weeks and goes back to Detroit

[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:50.580]
You'll at least be able to plunge your brains out all summer long on Kevin because we'll be cymbal casting Hazel Park every night. All right

[02:50:51.800 --> 02:50:56.340]
Kevin Wallace and Brad Kramer God that's all I can see up there in Michigan. They're doing it

[02:50:56.980 --> 02:51:00.400]

Although if you can't work out with us you can work in the build packs and compound

[02:51:03.560 --> 02:51:07.180]
Oh with the compound. Yeah, the compound. It's just like the Kennedy compound

[02:51:07.180 --> 02:51:10.540]
A lot of people dropping their pants and plain touch football on the ground

[02:51:10.540 --> 02:51:14.000]
All right, you don't think there's any panstroping going on at the

Hasen godbath. No, I know there is just panstroping going on in this building. What are you talking about?

[02:51:31.160 --> 02:51:31.920]
God

[02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:35.620]
He has nowhere where he is. You can tell your sick fat

You're like say time is the quietest you got no problem with me

Happy Tuesday, Neil

[02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:27.080]
Back to you

[02:53:27.080 --> 02:53:29.160]
I just wanted to let you know up until a few minutes ago

[02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:32.880]
I was flipping back and forth just checking the signal and I was getting you pretty clear

[02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:36.880]
But 2 a.m. was just a hair better so you'll have something to look forward to

[02:53:36.880 --> 02:53:39.560]
Just a hair better. How was it a curly one or a straight one?

[02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:40.800]
It was a red curly one

[02:53:40.800 --> 02:53:42.960]
Oh look out probably move Shamby

[02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:45.760]

[02:53:46.400 --> 02:53:49.980]
I'm an Italian boy from Arkansas and a Riva D'Oche you all

[02:53:49.980 --> 02:53:52.320]
All right, Ciao. Ciao. We'd be seeing you

[02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:55.380]
We got two open lines on the out of town lines. You will not get on the air

[02:53:55.380 --> 02:53:57.960]
I make no mistake about that but God would it be nice to write in your diary?

[02:53:57.960 --> 02:54:00.460]
Of course it's not very intimidating knowing that you won't get on

[02:54:00.460 --> 02:54:02.220]
But at least you can say I held on. I held it

[02:54:02.920 --> 02:54:04.360]
Let's go to Hollywood. Hello

[02:54:05.060 --> 02:54:07.140]

Good pass on Paisal. I couldn't pay so I can no longer how can I try to go to the Yiddish

[02:54:11.660 --> 02:54:13.260]
I'm not how can I try to fly? I'm spy

[02:54:13.260 --> 02:54:15.560]
I hear you need to know in Yiddish how to say two

[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:16.400]
Adin Dva

[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:17.920]
You need in Yiddish or in Hebrew

[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:20.020]
In Hebrew I know how to say it in Yiddish

[02:54:20.020 --> 02:54:20.920]
I would hope so

[02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:22.640]
How do you count in in Hebrew?

[02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:24.020]
In Hebrew you just is number two

[02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:25.480]
Adin is one

[02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:25.660]
Stein

[02:54:25.660 --> 02:54:26.680]
How is two?

[02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:27.360]
Stein

[02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:28.560]
Stein

[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:30.040]
And Akkad is one

[02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:33.880]
What's Adin? Oh that's I'm doing Russian now. I'm sorry that's Russian

[02:54:33.880 --> 02:54:34.420]
We're in the wrong

[02:54:34.420 --> 02:54:37.500]
I got so many languages now that's right. I'm sorry about that

[02:54:37.500 --> 02:54:39.520]
Yours was right you were right George there was a

[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:40.920]
In there how do you like that?

[02:54:41.020 --> 02:54:41.560]
There always is a

[02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:42.280]
Yeah

[02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:43.080]
There's got to be

[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:44.440]
If it's really Jewish there's a

[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:46.000]
In there because of all the dairy

[02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:46.700]
That's true

[02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:50.280]
That's why the Jews pronounce like that because they eat too much dairy too many blinces

[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:51.500]
That's true with the with the cream

[02:54:51.500 --> 02:54:52.100]
Right

[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:52.980]
Anyway

[02:54:52.980 --> 02:54:53.340]
Please

[02:54:53.340 --> 02:54:55.440]
You need me to go further or only up to two

[02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:56.340]
What was two?

[02:54:56.860 --> 02:54:57.040]
Stein

Stein

[02:54:58.200 --> 02:54:58.760]
