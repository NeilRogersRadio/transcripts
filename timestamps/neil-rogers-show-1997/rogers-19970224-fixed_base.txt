this morning do we start the week with that I don't know what it'll not it's

[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.880]
better than talking about all the other stuff that's going on yeah let's leave

[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.660]

[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.760]
Rogers quote for the day what you're kind of syrpy a little bit convoluted my

[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.360]
quote for the day is going to be very simple don't be a freaking Yentha okay

[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.120]

[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.360]
there everywhere you look pop pop pop pop that's all they're doing like a

[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.120]
Hakanah China just find a life okay that would be a real good idea find a

[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.280]
life get a search party out there and as far as any of the people in the W.I.O.D.

[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.020]
sales department are concerned not to mention Brian Barbara specifically how

[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.720]
about servicing the account number one don't worry about bankwits about

[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.260]
plaques thanks by the way to the people at Poppano Park I couldn't possibly be

[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.840]
there last night in my debilitated mental state which I currently find myself

[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.400]
there was no way but thanks to Carol howke and the people at Poppano Park give me

[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.580]
a nice plaque last night the L.N.J. Finkelson Award for the media and Poppano

[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.700]
Park and Harness Racing for which I think them profusely but be that as it may

[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.660]
that's really not what it's all about Brian but it's all about is like getting

[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.960]
us some copy and servicing the account and getting some some even minor little

[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.840]
miniscule notion of what that account is all about what it is that they do up

[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.100]
there you know the little horses with the carts that keep going around and

[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.480]
around and around that's what it's all about it's called Harness Racing maybe

[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.280]
it's great so getting back to that thing that game on Saturday good game good

[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.540]
game but as usual I'm perplexed and kind of founded by the fans they

[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.760]
continue astonishing me and he scored two goals now came his first game back

[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.640]
after the injury right but I said to JD remember to do some of the John Davidson

[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.760]
was doing the game with my camera for Fox nationwide Saturday with the

[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.940]
national game in between the second and third period I said to JD I said you

[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.260]
know this game is kind of like a microcosm of Eddie Jovenaski's career with

[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.760]
the Panthers and that is the good the bad and the ugly I mean it's all in there a

[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.480]
horrendous giveaway early in the game right at his own blue line nearly resulting in

[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.220]
a goal some of the dumbest penalties you'd ever want to see one fight of course

[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.400]
in which you got the snot kicked out of them and then of course two goals so it

[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.380]
like all kinds of good stuff and Dave Hyde yesterday was yesterday I guess it

[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.460]
must have been in the sunset and I'll head the balls nice go and David had the

[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.780]
balls to actually tell it like it was about the Eddie's performance as in

[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.120]
honestly as opposed to Eddie I mean Eddie's out there getting a fight getting

[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.520]
the crafty out of him and the crowds going Eddie Eddie I you guys I don't

[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.600]
understand yet I don't know what it's all about I don't get it neither my

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.780]
played great struck a plate great these are played okay we lost the game

[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.660]
it over time see we don't want to be going and all these over time is because we

[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.540]
just over time is deadly for the Panthers it's the kiss it at we blow leads late

[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.080]
and then although in this case we tied it up actually in the third period very

[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.020]
early on it was Eddie Eddie I guess now we got two players on the team that the

[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.180]
crowd knows we got we only had one for a long time when Eddie was out injured

[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.720]
there by the way also the Sun sent a lot should mention to you that you ought

[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.000]
to get your crap right which you rarely do here next to the article about Scott

[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.160]
Melon being the rats which quite frankly the timing of the center what they'll

[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.000]
answer all about since we don't do the rats anymore and everybody should know

[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]
about that right next to it fatigue suspended Philadelphia defenseman Michelle

[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.460]
Pate has been suspended pending an NHL hearing for kneeing Panthers forward Johan

[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.540]
Garper Law on Saturday but now here's the best part fatigue who received the

[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.620]
major penalty in a game of conduct on the play miss Sundays game against the

[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.800]
Rangers well obviously he didn't receive a game of conduct because it was

[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.040]
Melon being his pictures right next to this little inset article who came out

[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.640]
there to retaliate later and beat this not out of Michelle Pate for doing the

[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.620]
knee job and shouldn't gotten the game of conduct but he didn't that's the whole

[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.380]
point but the Sun sent a don't confuse them with the facts because it's a local

[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.260]
newspaper they just put any crap in there that they can come up with by the

[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.680]
way what are we going to do with those aroma therapy people in here today

[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.960]
ever have come back we got to do something because there's something in here

[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.680]
like the other joint now see we've been in here five months we've been in here

[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.380]
long enough now that there's a funuous among you with which I got to by the

[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.660]
way before I get back in that game stuff tip my hat to my tag and doctor doctor

[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.220]
mark this guy is a freaking genius how long have I told you if you find a doctor

[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.220]
that has any idea what he's doing don't ever let him go and that's the truth

[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.520]
you find a good doctor man that's better than money it's better than liquid

[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.820]
gold it's better than sex it's better than anything because without a good

[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.800]
doctor man you got you got source you got serious problems and so here I was

[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.860]
sitting on Friday listening to all you witch doctors out there oh yeah you got

[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.720]
to do this and you got to do that and stick your head and drain oh okay

[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.480]
fact if I would have stuck my head and drain over the weekend it would probably

[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.060]
been an improvement but at any rate so I go to my doctor on Friday and of course

[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.140]
I've had the thing with a real dry lips since coming back from Vegas I'm

[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.000]
beginning to think that this whole thing the doctor may be wrong about part of

[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.800]
the reason he said that it's like a real low grade virus kind of a thing it'll

[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.460]
go away which it is but you know what I think I think it's an allergic reaction

[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.800]
and you know what I think it's an allergic reaction to remember when I did

[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.940]
that Mark Jacobson show and they loaded me up with enough makeup for 70

[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.400]
prayer the the entire cast of West Side Story now somebody mentioned to me that a

[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.520]
lot of people have allergic reactions in fact the next day even though I tried

[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.540]
washing it off pretty good like the left side of my nose there was a big and

[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.000]
reek a kind of growth and like it went away but you know I'm saying like an

[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]
allergic thing a skin thing and so I think that this whole thing is a reaction

[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.240]
I think lawsuit sounds good to me that make up bitch that put on about 40 how

[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.560]
much makeup do you need again I guess you know somebody pointed out to me at the

[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.440]
game the other day he tapes that show with me okay now he meaning Mark Jacobs

[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.180]
and he sits behind that desk right so you're basically only see him and he has

[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.460]
lost a lot of weight he looks pretty good for him but you but even if he had

[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.700]
you'd never know he puts me out on the edge so to speak out on the edge of the

[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.480]
desk I'm at high cheer like a little infant and my puppet hanging out if I was

[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.960]
behind the desk like he was you'd see me like from about mid chest level up and you

[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.740]
wouldn't know if I wait like a hundred and fifty or five hundred and fifty and

[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.660]
would make any difference so the idea I guess that I chose to make him look as

[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.580]
good as possible which ain't easy because this is America and to make the guest

[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.420]
look is on flattering as possible especially if it's me never done on me

[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.840]
before nice go and mark you maniac I'm still pissed off about the thing that

[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.440]
they've leaped out that that deal about Wayne and by the way speaking of Wayne

[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.060]
more bad information here oh so when we're getting back to Dr. Mark I got so

[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.360]
much crap here man but my mind is a little bit scattered this morning and

[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.940]
any rates of the doctor says to me don't use that Vaseline lip therapy good

[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.020]
good information for you George since you're the one that was peddling that with

[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.820]
the best of its time to give it to me to yeah so I passed the norm we just keep

[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.240]
passing it down the line because it doesn't work and it no car mag and the reason

[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.360]
that what about carmax does that have alcohol in that one I don't think so

[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:37.140]
it's just wax yeah they're more so anyway you don't want to put most of this

[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.360]
stuff on your lips when you have real dry lips because it has in it alcohol and

[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.720]
guess what alcohol does your skin when in doubt it dries it out so you're

[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.600]
trying to put this stuff on there I guess if you got a cut or something it

[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.080]
might be okay but if you have like real chat dry lips don't be putting that

[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.700]
Vaseline lip therapy on it it'll kill you so the doctor says just go and get a

[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.740]
regular jar of Vaseline and I thought to myself I don't live in a trailer park

[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.620]
I ain't getting no Vaseline on apologies to my Italian ill-profissority by the

[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.740]
way couldn't possibly be their Saturday morning I've been a psychotic all

[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.980]
weekend no way but at any rate so I get the regular Vaseline put it on my lips

[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.980]
right and I wake up Saturday morning it's like 70% improved put it on again

[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.720]
now over the weekend and this morning it's like 90% better and even my tongue is

[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.540]
like a 90% better how do you like that which may or may not have to do with

[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.300]
the irritation there but I think it's that makeup I think it's the allergic

[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:40.940]
reaction to about 175 422 pounds of makeup speaking of makeup how did

[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.860]
Ricks-Wife do it at Mrs. America page and out there we don't know yet well

[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.940]
I'm sure we'll hear about it at two o'clock yeah I thought there was some

[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.840]
emergency or something because I know Rick and Suts are taking off on vacation

[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.660]
next week the same week that I am which I thought was kind of a Zara in the

[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.380]
first place but you know you get your dates locked in and your flights and

[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.540]
he's got another one of these skiing deals great more power to them but Friday

[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.420]
Rick and Suts aren't here and I'm asking everybody what the hell's going on is

[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.220]
did somebody one of the weasels get a bad case of diarrhea what's going on

[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:15.040]
over there in a family and it seemed to be kind of mysterious and by the way

[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.060]
Brooke did a damn good job too nice call at Brooke I like Brooke she's okay in my

[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.660]
book okay little too small to you sometime but she's she's great nice call at

[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.900]
sweetheart and actually there's nothing wrong with Brooke at all it's just

[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.580]
that because she reminds me so much of Randy that that part of it you know

[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.520]
we can just clear that out of our brains and we'll be okay we'll get along fine

[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.220]
you know what I'm saying and she can't help that that's a sure she's not

[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.800]
imitating Randy because quite frankly who would want to but she's just being

[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.700]
herself but there's just that Randy issue thing that if we once get over that

[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.480]
she's great but at any rate there was kind of this mystery like how come

[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.400]
Rick ain't here today and through the rumor mill today it's starting to up put

[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:02.000]
the pieces together well yeah you know the W.I.D rumor mill which is very very

[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.980]
I mean it yeah that one so that's gonna get a lot of use both of Brian strikes

[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:16.360]
again got to get a lot of use Brian yeah so anyway she was Mrs. Rick Riley was

[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.040]
in another one of these Mrs. Beauty pageants in where was it Kansas City

[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.580]
I believe some horrendous place like that man oh man I sure hope she did better

[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:32.820]
than little girl out in Denver you know the one from the beauty pageant oh and

[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.880]
speak of that if we think we've had enough of art for him in this week you

[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.780]
know what kills me about these television assholes is that on the one hand you

[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.660]
notice every show that he's on now with the exceptional Larry King I'm

[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.500]
surprised Larry didn't do it uh Al Jolson thing and put on black face to do

[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.040]
the interview because everybody who interviews Mark Furman now who's busy

[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.760]
peddling his book as revolting as we find him but we're just on our hands and

[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.040]
ease to see who can get him first because he's out there peddling his book

[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.860]
Oprah Hadamon you see that and she said they're basically kissed his ass and

[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.420]
this morning CBS which I really watched that show because I still can't I

[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.780]
can't figure out which pictures that Jose Diaz Valar whatever his name is

[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.580]
is that is that him or is that his brother which one is he is he Jose oh that's

[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.660]
right Lincoln Diaz Valar and Jose Diaz and Abraham Lincoln Diaz whatever his

[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.560]
name is he's got this man's got to have naked pictures he's on a national TV show

[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:33.180]
on CBS he's got no personality he was bad on local TV here Jose Diaz Julio I

[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:43.600]
mean he is terminal he's as boring as spit so at any rate guess who's interviewing

[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:51.700]
Mark McEwan interviewing Mark Furman Mark McEwan fat bald and black well you do live

[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.360]
up there in Idaho just a matter of 50 minutes from the compound of all the skin

[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.380]
heads the area they pop pop pop pop yeah there was again how do you like that turn on

[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.680]
TVS news this morning I'm here it all over you no matter where you turn you

[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.620]
can't get away from it and the interesting part is they act very in

[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.120]
sense and very outrage but they just can't wait to get them on because you know

[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.440]
because it's the ratings they're interested in not because they like them

[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.200]
because they want to make sure that you understand we all understand that they

[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.420]
detest and they find him deplorable and subhuman but can we help you sell that

[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.540]
bookmark how long will you come on for how much time will you give us 10

[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.520]
14 to W I O D if you're tired of being treated like crap by your bank if

[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.660]
you're tired of all the problems and the screw ups and the fact that they don't

[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.900]
even care about it which is the part that infuriated me a few months ago do

[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.860]
what I did switch over to family bank man it's a much higher family bank is the

[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.780]
place where you're a valued customer not just a number in a puter somewhere

[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.200]
family bank is locally owned locally operated they do business to

[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.740]
traditionally old-fashioned way if you want to talk to a loan officer you don't

[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.440]
have to wait for some stranger some Yahoo in Atlanta or Charlotte North Carolina

[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.680]
to prove your loan you'll talk to people right here who will approve your loan

[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.800]
or not as the case may be and they've also got the lowest service fee anywhere in

[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.620]
Broward County family bank offers all the features of any other bank like ATMs

[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:11.180]
at every location honoring press their honor and service networks and you'll find

[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.640]
them all over the place in Broward there are seven family bank locations

[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.580]
including one out there in the sawgrass by me great go and mad and one right up

[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.920]
the street here on Sterling Road in Hollywood family bank do a business the

[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.340]
traditional way locally because customer satisfaction is what they're all

[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.840]
built so if you're pissed off if you're unhappy if you're sick and tired of all

[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.880]
the scrubs with your bank make the smart switch to family bank member of the IC

[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:30.020]

electronics when I want many in that he said his lesson what old you

[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:41.120]

[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:47.920]

this weekend was watching Saturday night live yes I think somebody up there is listed you because

[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.020]
they were doing a bit it's beginning of the show where they showed this Italian family that hand

[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.780]
paints the cue cards it takes an hour per cue card and the first cue card they held up said wow

[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:02.000]
all right have a good day bonjournal bye bye yes skip to tag in class Saturday morning I was just

[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.940]
ready to blow my brains out in fact I still am but you know the show must go on it's just show

[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.900]
business folks it's just a radio show it's just entertainment it's not the beginning and end of

[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.340]
the world that's obvious judging from these phones it's not really often important

[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.560]
made a lot of really great people at the Gandalf the other night Saturday a lot of people

[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.000]
over there at best buy in uh over by the sub-rest yesterday went in there to pick up a couple of

[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.860]
things like some fact paper for my facts machine and a couple of other minor little things and

[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.480]
demand everybody in there they were genuinely reflecting everywhere you go everybody listens to

[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.940]
this show okay everybody in the world listens to this show it's amazing nobody calls it but they

[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:42.420]
all listen to it that's all accounts we don't mind don't bother calling me because you got important

[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.140]
things that when you don't need these stupid tickets anyway and I will demean you and degrade you

[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.480]
won't probably not give me anyway but hey it's worth a shot the price is right what does it cost

[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.520]
cheaper than a lottery ticket why how do you like to have won a lottery this week

[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:02.720]
seven million dollars a putrid seven million and three winners so that's like two and uh two and a

[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:10.340]
third million right pretty weak pretty weak 20 years not but they still do it that way that they

[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:15.160]
do that in newty business which is a real rip off which makes it even a bigger uh sucker bet

[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.420]
than anything else in the world that lottery but I think they still do the annuity so they pay

[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.760]
you like over 20 years and uh what's two and a half minutes that's like what about a hundred little

[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.280]
over a hundred grand a year after some of your slumpers out there that would be oh my god there you

[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:36.420]
go i'm gonna retire like you you could retire in a hundred grand a year easy right sure i'll take it

[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:42.980]
no seriously couldn't you for the rest of your life okay

[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.540]
who puts a small town low cost of living sure what do you mean by that

[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.960]
can't cost you a hundred grand a year to live now unless you're deeply in the minus column

[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.720]
oh that's right i forgot you are making the big bucks now you got that title i forgot about

[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.460]
this right here's a mobile in the hollywood hello

[00:22:59.460 --> 00:22:59.520]
oh

[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.520]
brilliant and the best part of the whole thing is that they wouldn't go off of there

[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.280]
broward county opens seven eight seven seven six seven give the right number that might help

[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.360]

[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.280]
eight eight eight eight the crowd and a friend you there is Saturday afternoon

[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:27.600]
eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight

[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:34.920]
he caught it up he got the crafty out of a net fight they got their favorites baby don't confuse

[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.680]
them with the facts i still say let's make that deal malin by the way talking about making deal with

[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.580]
Montreal they're desperate that deal they got to make a deal pretty soon pretty fast

[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.520]
because they stink that you on out they made the leaves look like a real team Saturday night

[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:54.600]
leaves five Montreal one oh baby we want a game i'll get too excited about if a boy those kind

[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.500]
of games they are pathetic they need a good defenseman okay which i guess leaves Eddie out

[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.900]
haven't i told you that Eddie ought to be a center that he's got great scoring instincts he

[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.280]
ain't no defenseman never gonna be he ought to be a center put the four act back on the wing put

[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.320]
Eddie as a center out there in that line and i guarantee you this team will start sticking it in the net

[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.260]
guarantee can't miss but they won't listen to me

[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.900]
and Chris Wells the healthy scratch again Saturday eight now that Brian was back again Brian

[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.720]
screw it up he was out a little trouble after each if he was going over there puking his guts out he

[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.820]
said on the bench after each shift and losing every face off in fact they're what we do lose about

[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.320]
90% of the important face offs 98% in that game yes we did including the one there at the end when

[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.540]
they scored and learned rustifted and over time but hey it's just a game and they won again last night

[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.180]
they beat the Rangers and kind of a i don't know that was kind of a marginal game to be honest with it

[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.780]
here we throw and try to make it into something that it wasn't but thanks to guards no all of a

[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.660]
sudden found a life and don't ever lose anymore hextall sitting on a bench and snow is

[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.220]
winning for the flyers night after night after night after night after day after day after day but

[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.180]
i'm gonna tell you something forget about them let me give you a little tip right now there's

[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:04.200]
three teams in league right now there's the Buffalo Sabers who win every day not just most of the

[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.080]
time they win every day and there's the Dallas stars the Colorado Avalanche who both win every

[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.660]
single stinking day those are the three teams right now boys and girls for all you age people

[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.900]
1028 at W I O D

[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.600]
6 times W I O D about his functional as Al Bundy back at oh 1031 W S O was Tommy Kramer that got

[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.800]
everybody crazy this morning and cooked up that really a half baked stupid thing about

[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.880]
Dustin Hoffman being dead which he's not by the way I just I was sitting back there in our

[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.900]
little locubicle back there and I heard some I thought it sounded like Tommy Kramer saying about

[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:45.280]
they just saw the they reran the graduate on TV over the weekend and he just saw Dustin Hoffman

[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.220]
again then he found out he was dead and I you know my ears picked up a little bit at that point

[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:56.840]
and I thought to myself he's dead and then I heard the rest of it and I realized he's not dead

[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.100]
and Pornginel down at the tax and main building doesn't need all these goofballs calling up

[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.300]
wondering uh what you know yeah wouldn't you have thought it might be in the newspaper like

[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.440]
on the news or somewhere if he really were dead was dead might be dead but he's not

[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:15.240]
Dustin Hoffman still alive they hit him with five shots and he stood five I said not six and he

[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:20.240]
still alive I mean what kind of crap is that plus he wasn't at the Empire State Building over the weekend

[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.220]
see there you go folks America one more time but I'm not going to go into it because you don't

[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.880]
care you accepted I mean dead babies and dead tourists and all of a you accepted it's a big joke

[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.900]
it's very funny and I you know that's fine and if that's the way you think that life ought to be

[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.640]
I'm very happy for it I'm very unhappy for you I'm very unhappy for me because I'm surrounded by

[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.400]
people who believe that this is the way things ought to be but hey that's what Howard Biel said too

[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:48.260]
and look what it got him here's the mobile in Miami hello hey Neil how old when was Diaz oh

[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:54.880]
everything's great listen I you know you know you know Athena you turned me on to hockey yeah and I was

[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:02.880]
watching the games uh yeah the the pants is a little bit of a horn is when uh Garvin love got

[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:09.560]
uh me yeah the least thing thought of retaliation yeah oh it's good we still lost the game though I

[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.980]
know it was just a point it was a heartbreak Melody came out there and kicked the crap out of

[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.560]
fatigue although the Sun Sentinel says fatigue got a game of conduct in which case he wouldn't have

[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.200]
been out there so I guess Melody thought he kicked crap out of fatigue but he was not I mean the

[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.680]
Sun Sentinel man what a bunch of embarrassing fools over there what a bunch of retards he got a

[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:30.680]
game of conduct I live oh there's not a sports rider in Miami that are south Florida that knows

[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.320]
what the hell is going to want about any it's sad it's very it's pathetic it is although I give David

[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.800]
Hyde again credit the give him high marks for having a guts to tell the truth about Eddie in the real

[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.280]
story about his performance on Saturday this has been Eddie's problem all along he could score six

[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.600]
goals in the game but he might give up six other ones and you know because they scored on two

[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.540]
power play goals while he was in the penalty box exactly and I don't think he got three penalties I

[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.600]
think he got four if my memory is right pretty sure he got four I think you're right too and you

[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.800]
can't have a defenseman out that you depending on especially on a power play sitting on the

[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.440]
penalty yeah and you also I can't have a defenseman who keeps coughing it up and doesn't play

[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.520]
defense like I said make him into a center let him do what he's does best he's got a great shot

[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.140]
he's got offensive instincts make him into a center like Keith Pimo he's spashed he's he can

[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.580]
stick it in there he's not a defenseman okay guys but they won't listen to me because they're the

[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.920]
experts well you know I even though we haven't won a game in five games they're the experts I'm just

[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.640]
to dummy with a big mouth on the radio I know nothing why tell you what if they have a

[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:34.220]
poll I'll vote for you to be the next coach okay release the assistant anyway okay pal have a

[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:55.520]
say everybody's in their seats they're all a Eddie Eddie Eddie it's getting louder and louder and

[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:03.100]
louder and louder it's like a oh man in fact when they introduced the starters and he came out there

[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:08.460]
you would have thought that Mary Olamu Wayne Ratsky Gordy-Hom or East the rocket reshard Bobby or

[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.460]
all wrapped up in the end of one and just stepped on the edge Eddie Eddie I'm taking it all hey okay

[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.360]
okay let's not get too carried away let's see what the kid does out there and sure enough first

[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.940]
couple of minutes oops there it goes and poor Billy Lindsay I don't want even single amount because

[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:29.320]
Billy's a great player and usually you know game after game and on-song hero but he had himself a

[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.200]
rough night you know a rough afternoon whatever what may I hope he had a good night but at any rate

[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.080]
he had a rough afternoon coughed it up once coughed it up twice really once resulting in that

[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.840]
breakaway goal by Bryn DeBor but hey he's he's entitled okay how often does anybody said Lindsay

[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:48.160]
had a crappy game very I can't remember last time so he's entitled it happens to the worst of us

[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:58.020]
we have two open lines in date 62229463622 wiod here's Evan Chura hello hello hello yes sir

[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:05.480]
I met you yesterday at the MRCost yes sir I'm calling you finally I took the day off just to call

[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:10.660]
you a lot of my people in there yesterday at the MRCost buffet yeah the food was unbilly food is

[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.920]
outstanding yeah I mean I probably gained 15 pounds there not I got on the scale this morning in

[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.140]
spite of some bad eating over the weekend and I'm still holding my own so to speak great I'm

[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:26.980]
hanging right on it okay yeah I just wanted to tell you also there's a lot of you listener that

[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:32.560]
can call you during the day because they're working yeah and you know we just can get to well it's

[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.600]
usually on Monday see the rest of the week people screw off but on Monday they have to like you

[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.640]
know get their act together again after the weekend and so people on Monday it's like

[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.460]
five hundred times as difficult on it's impossible so if I were smart I would I would not come in on

[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.400]
Monday the only problem being they decided to pay me on Monday so they realized that there's

[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.980]
that incentive to stay home and call and sick on Monday but if your paycheck is there you're a

[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:59.360]
little more inclined to show up so Paxco Paxco get smart right right well I wouldn't go that far okay great

[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:05.340]
great Neil I love you show yet I'll call you soon okay pal thanks good to see you yeah there's a

[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:10.620]
guy who just kind of hanging out there at the MRCost with his wife waiting to get in there

[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.020]
and have some of that great that's a great place great place man I'm telling you

[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.400]
and they don't use MSG and they don't use the crap they use canola oil they use the best

[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.060]
ingredients not a sponsor anything in fact they probably don't need to because that place is jam

[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:28.140]
in most of the time and yes there are some old parts in there I can oh speaking of old parts

[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:36.020]
I got two things here which are both related to that topic Florida's drivers licenses can be renewed

[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:44.800]
by telephone now are you ready for this oh your drivers license expires in the next two or

[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.400]
three days but it seems the only time you remember you need to renew it is late at night or on

[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:53.340]
the weekend sound familiar fortunately if you're eligible for mail-in renewal all you have to do

[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:59.080]
is pick up a phone or renew your license or change your address the Florida Department of Highway

[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.240]
Safety and Motor Vehicles Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles My Ass

[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:11.100]
is offering renewal via a one nine hundred call available seven days a week 24 hours a day

[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.180]
mail-in renewal notice is explained the new touch-tone phone option

[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.560]
so let's say that you've had your drivers license for the last six years and maybe you like

[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:26.220]
had a debilitating stroke but you keep driving anyway then your head is like out the left side

[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:33.800]
like that but you keep driving anyway they don't know let's say you're 96 years old but you don't

[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.120]
get any tickets because you only drive like five blocks you cause everybody else to have an accident

[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.640]
but you're never involved in one you certainly never go fast enough to get a speeding ticket

[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.860]
so you have no violations and they give you a mail-in renewal for another six years

[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.680]
that means you'll be a hundred and two a lot of other people will be dead they won't make it to

[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:57.400]
twenty five if they get in your way but you'll be a hundred and two before it expires again

[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:03.500]
and before they send you another mail-in renewal or just do it by phone and of course if you're

[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.320]
smart and you're hundred and twenty five years old the thing to do is have somebody who's like maybe

[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.560]
your great great great great great great great great granddaughters sit there and make the call say oh yes

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:15.820]
this is Mrs. Schwartz and I want to renew my buy oh you sound pretty good for 149 Mrs. Schwartz

[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.700]
oh yes I'm in very good health please send me okay here you go it's in the mail

[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:25.920]
and you wonder talk about ineptitude and incompetence in this state and you wonder why we have so many

[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:31.180]
geeks and so many old parts who have no business whatsoever being out there in a highway you wonder

[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.340]
why the driving here is so bad it's like taking your gland in your hand just to go out there in a highway

[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:43.480]
it's unacceptable is what it is but they're doing it now not just by mail-in but by phone

[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:50.620]
oh no problem Mr. Epstein here you go you're 187 today happy birthday to you here's your license

[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:55.140]
it'll be in the mail tomorrow and don't go too fast watch it now

[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.860]
and in line with that here's a letter to the editor which I read these every day in the

[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.920]
scum sentinel because usually there is source of humor and comedy and today is no exception

[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.640]
from Irving in Del Rey Beach

[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:13.480]
hey in fact I might just do something special on a reverving in a moment here

[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.800]
the headline over the letter to the editor says Florida benefits greatly from seniors

[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:26.740]
your editorial cartoon by Chan Lowe on February 4th regarding the state song and its new lyrics

[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:34.140]
was not funny although we do play golf tennis and bowl and we do frequent the twilight dinners

[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:42.720]
local restaurant the twilight dinner we seniors also volunteer at hospitals nursing homes and

[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:48.540]
serving we care programs and open our neighbor's mail oh I'm sorry I thought in there some of us

[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.340]
drive cops cars patrolling our condos

[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:01.300]
that's right being professional yenthas our seniors have brought their retirement money down here

[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:06.080]
and made the restaurants departments doors and flea markets happy right you should live so long

[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.560]
Irving you put most of the restaurants like pumper next out of business by stealing the silverware

[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:15.020]
by taking in those big sacks and putting all the pickles and the rolls and all the other stuff

[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:20.760]
in there fifty dollars worth of freebies with every three dollar meal and most of all Irving says

[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:26.120]
Florida benefits benefits from the taxes seniors pay so tell the funny cartoons to the Marines

[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.160]
sign Irving and Delray Beach nice going Irving

[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.380]

[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.720]
out there watching them at the pre-scape I can't believe how fast he is so much faster than the other

[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.840]
guys yeah he makes things happen Marty and he waited that one one that goal he got the first goal he

[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:48.100]
went right around everybody went right to the net slid it off the skate I mean just haven't

[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:51.560]
it escaped but nevertheless he went all the way to the net and made a great play and he played a

[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.880]
damn good game and he did my play to tremendous game too for a change yeah he was hit in the few folks

[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:02.580]
there um I mean that's my first year of the fan and I got one is with those fans though what is

[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.240]
the any what what is it they like the way he looks do they like the number they like the fact

[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.660]
he gets it a lot of stupid fights what is it now come I keep hearing my echo back on your phone

[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:19.080]
I don't know why I like it though I like the sound but it's great like reverb is a big guy I don't

[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:24.380]
know that's what they like they like it big the fans are fans they like it big I got a question

[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:32.100]
Neil yes sir why do the fans sometimes start with one like I said I'm a new fan this year you're

[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:38.260]
asking me yeah they start whistling like when they're playing for a while I guess what I'm thinking

[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:42.280]
maybe they want a goal or something I heard a lot during the range whistling usually means if the

[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.120]
referee makes a crappy colleague start whistling or else they start yelling of senators Adam which is

[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:53.280]
more appropriate or you know I don't know who knows it's a job thing that only the what is it okay
