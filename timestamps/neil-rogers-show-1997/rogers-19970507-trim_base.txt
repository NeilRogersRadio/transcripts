[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780]
Right.

[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.920]
610 WIOD, Neil Rogers, while you're goofing off, it works.

[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.160]
So what kind of a non-sequitur was that as an excuse to take a shot?

[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.300]
What the hell was that?

[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.360]
610 WIOD.

[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.940]
You call that a born-again penis?

[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.500]
It doesn't lick them.

[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.580]
610 WIOD.

[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.000]
Same pack, Clinton, done with it all.

[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.380]
Shored ball and Jones, his trousers, trouts.

[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.360]
He said, honey, will you partake?

[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.420]
Come on and kiss my one-eye snake.

[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.260]
He says, no, she says yes.

[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.600]
And she could prove it if he'll untrust.

[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.020]
We'll find out who's right or wrong.

[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.940]
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's get shot.

[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.960]
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's get shot.

[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.240]
Just lick up.

[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.600]
Just lick up.

[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.120]
I like it.

[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.260]
Let's see, let's see, let's get shot.

[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.300]
What's it gonna take?

[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.040]
Two shepherds right way more on this Jones.

[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.260]
I asked you up here to thank you for the knob job you've been doing

[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.380]
in my re-election campaign for the State of Arkansas.

[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.260]
Excuse me, Governor?

[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.040]
What I mean is, don't blow job security by going down

[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.160]
to the private sector.

[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.680]
I'm afraid I don't follow you, sir.

[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.260]
I don't care, I'm gonna slap with JFK.

[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.380]
Org, have a damn, if Cooper was gay.

[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.460]
This lack of dignity gives me fits.

[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.660]
What the hell now?

[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.800]
Hey, Hillary, show us your sex.

[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.760]
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's get shot.

[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.120]
Thank you, April.

[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.700]
I'm just gonna miss your best commandant.

[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.900]
Let's see, let's see, let's get shot.

[00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.960]
What were you gonna take?

[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.740]
Two shepherds right way more on this Jones.

[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.220]
Let's go out of line.

[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.600]
And if we won't be gone, boy, we'll be gone.

[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.820]
I had a nickname day, one day she flew away.

[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.380]
Oi, to Tijuana where the moon is blue.

[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.220]
The moon is blue.

[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.620]
But with our right wing censorship, there are words that mustn't slip.

[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.640]
To truly tell you how I feel for gay.

[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.900]
That's gay for gay.

[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.540]
So, is this K&G?

[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.340]
I'll see you with Tijuana too.

[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.940]
Now if you see K, tell her I'm a Surrey State.

[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.980]
And the FCC won't let me sing this.

[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.320]
So, I'll roll to the day now if you see K, take her hand, gently say.

[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.440]
That after this transmission, I'll be out in 90 days.

[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.160]
Oh, is you see K&G?

[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.040]
Then I'll see you with Tijuana.

[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.960]
Go, but gotta see you with Tijuana too.

[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.860]
Oh!

[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.260]
10-04, W-I-O-D, happy Wednesday to all and to all a great day.

[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.900]
Man, is this a day or is this a day?

[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.180]
Hansen, other day as we continue counting them down.

[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.760]
A Dindva, et cetera.

[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.900]
Chitiri, Piaach.

[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.480]
Don't start with that Russian crab, man.

[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.880]
Fidel's gonna know what it's all about.

[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.040]
Don't tell me Miri's making more changes to that log again.

[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.460]
God, we wouldn't want to be doing that.

[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.380]
Home Depot's fault.

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.040]
Yeah, well don't be having all that stuff fall down, please.

[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.320]
So, at any rate, I'm gonna, I lied.

[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.120]
I said I was never gonna mention it.

[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.840]
Well, I don't have to mention her name on here, do I?

[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.780]
Ms. Antichrist, Walter Sabo's other quarter, whatever the hell she is.

[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.340]
By the way, she is very cute.

[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.760]
Just ask her, she'll tell you on the ear.

[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.400]
She's cute.

[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.020]
Do you think she's cute?

[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.440]
I think she's like a nondescript.

[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.500]
I think it would be the best compliment I could pay with being nondescript.

[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.320]
That's a high compliment.

[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.720]
Exactly.

[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.180]
But at any rate, so last night was the definitive, I mean, I just, I'm bursting at the seams.

[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.160]
I could sit here and ramble on for four hours and I just might.

[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.460]
I just might do it because I'm like really just bursting like I said at the, at the thing today.

[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.400]
I heard last night the definitive, the, the, I mean, it was the Walter Sabo Harry Penis format to a T

[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.260]
and it was enough to make you either scream, laugh, cry or all of them.

[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.980]
So yesterday, of course, Rick was off for his birthday.

[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.260]
Don't do it again soon, Rick.

[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.360]
Now while I'm still here and Rick was on a course and Brooke, we love, we like Brooke, don't we?

[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.000]
Yeah, we like Brooke.

[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:53.740]
But at any rate, so they moved everybody up on a schedule and we had the unmentionedable one from six to nine and ski for M ski, whatever his name is for nine of midnight.

[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:02.380]
So Karen, what's her name is on her last night and she's, she's doing this Sabo formula where she takes one little article from the book.

[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.960]
And then she's going to get the news paper.

[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.440]
Remember the one about the engagement ring.

[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.380]
Of course, did that guy ever get the nine grand back or the ring or boat?

[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.880]
We don't know.

[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.840]
In Kansas, let's find out.

[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.900]
Let's talk about that today.

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.480]
What do you think?

[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.180]
W-I-O-D.

[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.580]
Hello.

[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.300]
You think you ought to get the money back or what?

[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.060]
Yeah.

[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.040]
Okay. Thank you.

[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:26.760]
So at any rate, she goes on, she's got this story about these two dicks that want to adopt a kid who's like retarded that nobody else wants.

[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.300]
He's in a foster home and she's reading this little blurb out of the newspaper.

[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.300]
I mean, this formula, it's unbelievable.

[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:47.440]
You take a little kind of like sidebar story that nobody really gives all that much of a crap about and you make a show out of it and you insist and you keep reading it and reading it and reading it and reading it and banging it and pounding it and clanging it and just insisting.

[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.260]
You're going to talk about this even if you're all gone, even if everybody turned it off, you're still going to talk about it.

[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.600]
God damn it.

[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.960]
Oh, by the way, Roger Crotch is quoted the week.

[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.940]
Did you see this?

[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.220]
George, you see this this week?

[00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.580]
Yes.

[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.280]
I love it.

[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.820]
By the way, I like it a lot though.

[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.740]
I think it fits into a tea like a glove, like a rubber glove.

[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.380]
Roger's quoted the week is the best way to get back at your enemies is with tremendous success.

[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.800]
End of quote.

[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.160]
We plan on it, Roger.

[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.220]
So at any rate, there's like no calls.

[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.480]
So I'm like mesmerized.

[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.060]
I'm in the car, but it's one of those deals where you don't want to get out of the car.

[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.800]
Not because it's entertaining, not because it's interesting, not because it's fascinating, but because it is so embarrassing.

[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.420]
I'm just asking myself, how can this be?

[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.140]
And she's like training these other underlings, these other people who don't belong on here.

[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.140]
She's training them in the formatics of this.

[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.120]
It's like talk radio in a box.

[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.440]
It's like, you know how you have like instant tea and instant coffee and you put them in a cup and you just add hot, hot boiling water.

[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:50.560]
Just take any one of these goofballs off the street, especially if they happen to be the girlfriend of the consultant and put them on here and put hot boiling water and all of a sudden,

[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.700]
pull if they're a talk host or host this as the case may be.

[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.580]
And she's going on and on and so I think this is just, this is just ridiculous.

[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.040]
I mean, if they are loving family, if they want to adopt this, okay, 6222 WIOD, 767.

[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:13.060]
And on and on and I would just with this dribble with this dribble and I'm thinking of myself in my wildest nightmares I could never have believed.

[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.880]
And I'm also that little part of my mind is thinking how close I came to sticking around this joint.

[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.880]
I mean, this is like something out of an insane asylum.

[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:39.480]
I mean, is this really their idea of something that's going to work in this market where we've had all the kind of talk that we've had for the last 20 some years, 30 some years going back to Alan Courtney rest in pieces and the dean and all these other everything that's going down to pike and they think that they can pedal this half baked bunch of bull crap.

[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:47.920]
That somebody is fooling somebody that you take something out of the paper and just keep reading it over and over and over and over again and insisting.

[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:54.300]
So finally, just before I was going to get out of the car finally, some anal retentive Julio calls in named Javier.

[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.580]
I sure hope you're listening Javier, but I'm sure you're not.

[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.620]
Javier. I'll never forget this guy's long as I live and he's going on.

[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.920]
Of course, he's obviously the expert on facts and he's going on about well, this is unnatural and it's against God's law.

[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:22.980]
And it's there's no love involved there. It's just lust. It's only lust and she gave him kind of a half baked very weak answer because first of all as soon as you hear that it's the voice of a Julio and his name was Javier, you know that he's a victim of brainwashing from the time he was born about those evil facts,

[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.320]
even though he's probably been rubbing up against trees and guys and whatever he can when his wife ain't looking.

[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.880]
Oh, he has a wife, you know, but at any rate.

[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:38.500]
And so then when it gets to the end after we finally get rid of Javier, it's like, Oh, am I the only one? Am I the radical one to down here?

[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.360]
Yeah, your radical caraners, nobody else down here to the left of a till of the hunt.

[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.580]
This is the first time that anybody has dared to express such an opinion in the history of talk radio in this town.

[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.340]
It's all new. It's all revolutionary. We're a guest. We just can't believe it.

[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:59.460]
We're sitting here almost speechless. Now, are they doing like real? You can tell me this. Are they doing extensive like heavy duty screening on those shows?

[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.760]
Is this also part of the formula of the calls? Yes.

[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.240]
Because I knowing this audience the way I do and I know I'm like the palm of my foot.

[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.060]
I cannot believe that there is nobody out there calling her or some of these people and saying,

[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.780]
will you get off this already? Don't you understand? You've been banging it for 40 minutes and nobody cares.

[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:26.200]
Don't you get it? Who are you kidding, man? With this phony instant talk formula of yours, man. Nobody cares. Nobody gives a crap.

[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:35.560]
And I'm thinking to myself, are these people really that dumb that they don't understand that if you take one narrow little tiny thing and you keep and you say,

[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.940]
this is all we're going to keep banging this. We don't want to hear nothing else. This is all we're going to talk about that it's like the great.

[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.760]
It's like sending an engraved invitation to everybody who might be in the audience saying, hey, goodbye because we got nothing here.

[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.280]
You're going to want to hear about. It is unfreaking believable. What am I so exercised about here today?

[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.000]
I don't know. I'm just I'm just almost in disbelief that anybody could be this dumb as this crowd.

[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:06.360]
It's just amazing when you think of all the people that we've had in the Phil Henry's and you know,

[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.700]
some of the other and even Uga Buga, the people that worked and sweated their brains and their balls off in this place.

[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:18.860]
And now it's come to this to this Kassimmi, Florida formula with the boy at the hot boiling water.

[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.300]
And by the way, guess who the latest rumors are that it's going to be doing midday if they were finally say goodbye to me.

[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.180]
Just tell me what your problem is. I don't think I can handle that.

[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:43.080]
So what do you think about this? What's the guy's name Chuck Humphrey that off himself, the heavens gate guys who are like they waited.

[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:50.600]
They had to leave their what do they call it? Their vehicles. They had to destroy their vehicle so they could move into Uranus and do their thing.

[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.500]
Okay. Unbelievable. CNN's having a field. They were there by the way. They've had these video tape things that they left behind.

[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:09.160]
They've had them on like morning noon and night over and over again. More of these good, religious man who are waiting to leave their vehicles and move there into outer space to other thing out of your vehicle and into your in Uranus.

[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.900]
In fact, remember that out of the closet into the streets. Ellen should be screaming out of your vehicle into Uranus.

[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:20.280]
That's the new deal with the heavens gate heavens, call whatever another one of these stupid religions just like all the other ones.

[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.720]
Hey, Javier, how you doing? If Javier calls by the way, we'll put him on immediately, but he don't have the balls to do it.

[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.980]
He's listening. We know you're listening, Javier. You're probably a closet queen too.

[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.800]
Someone called to say that they're filming a Wendy's commercial in the Grove and Dave from Wendy's is listening to us right now.

[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:47.020]
Dave Thomas from Wendy's is listening right now. Yes. Well, guess what Dave Thomas? I love your food. You got great food of all the fast food joints. You got the best, but, but how about hiring some like people with an IQ bigger than their shoe size?

[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:56.600]
Okay. I realize we have a lot of this EEO E whatever the hell they call it these days. A lot of pressures to hire like certain minorities in your joints, but it would be very nice.

[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:04.900]
It's just one time, just one time to drive away from one of your establishments and find about a mile down the road when you open up the sack that the stuff is in there that you ordered.

[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:11.340]
I mean, it's even in the same family. Okay. We'll be very nice Dave. So we love your product, but we hate your help. How do you like that?

[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:17.880]
Including the one out there by the sawgrass by me and the one over here on Hollywood, and the one on Hollywood Boulevard where they really boned us big time that first time.

[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.100]
Sure did. And then we're going to make up for it with free food, which they never did. Not that we would snore for free food, but we will, especially those chicken clubs.

[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:32.640]
Right. Spice. Especially those atkins. And we do also appreciate the fact that Wendy's is the one place where they'll give you the stuff like Atkins style without the bun.

[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:41.460]
So we appreciate that Dave. We love Wendy's, but all your help really blows. Okay. If you actually had some help in there that knew what they were doing, you'd probably triple your business Dave.

[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.820]
And by the way, lose some weight, will you?

[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:52.080]
Hey, it's kind of like Brooke. You know, he's a nice, but could afford to lose a few pounds 10 14 at W. I. D. Just like me could afford to lose 50 pounds.

[00:12:52.300 --> 00:13:02.140]
Hey, listen, speaking of losing something, if you're losing your hair guys, you know, a lot of young guys lose their hair. And it's like embarrassing, you know, you're like 25 years old. And you got this gigantic ball spot.

[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:08.540]
Maybe you know, you got Wayne's money, right? Sure, likely story, but you don't want to look like Wayne, even if you had his money, you don't want the Zits.

[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:15.660]
You don't want that gigantic ball spot. It's out when telly. Sevalas died. They put the rest of the ball. Look. So if you want to look great at a price that you can afford,

[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:23.340]
headed Charles Alphiery for just 800 bucks. He can make your hair look like it's growing right out of your scalp with the best, most natural looking system anywhere in the universe.

[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:22.780]
We've replaced the tire of old morning show with a tired new morning show. My account said to me, do you have any receipts? Like, what do you think?

[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:33.180]
I go, let's make some up now, but don't think that I'm collecting things when I'm driving places. Yes, I spend $12 for gas. You don't say that? I don't say anything.

[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.540]
I have a little bag that I just dropped the receipt. I get a little bag too, but I'm taking stuff out of it.

[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:50.260]
Ron and Ron, 610 W I O D. The opinions expressed on W I O D are those of Neil Rogers. How can people believe this crap? You know what? There are other opinions.

[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:55.460]
Not for long. 610 W I O D.

[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:05.840]
There's day all around. There's day all around. On W I O D. Go ahead.

[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:18.600]
1018 W I O D were reinventing talk radio or reinventing a boredom or reinventing stuff that is so hackneyed and so tried and so unbelievable that there are no words to describe it. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.380]
W Diento Vardes, Cacti Pogevae, Shivordna. Great.

[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:34.520]
Yes. Why are we even getting upset over? I didn't say I was upset. I'm just worked up. Not upset. There's a difference. I'm not upset. I'm just amazed and astonished and shocked and almost speechless.

[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:46.000]
Well, Neil, from now on I'm going to switch to dial over to 1400 and listen to Craig. Great. Because it's just it's ponderous and terminal. Have you ever heard anything like it in your life?

[00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:02.680]
I mean, it's so it's so obvious even a child can hear what this attempt is to this formula. Take take a little article. Get it on a year. This is your topic and just keep reading it over and over and over and beating it and pounding it and clanging it and and just championing it and screaming about it.

[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:08.840]
And even if nobody in the world gives a crap, it's just that's it. Man, that's it. I don't know when they find that no one's listening.

[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:23.340]
Believe me, trust me when I tell you they will. They will this place is going to old points before long and but it won't matter because you'll be long gone and someone listeners. Hopefully Rick and Fletzel end up someplace.

[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:31.860]
Yeah, that well actually though, I don't think Rick and Fletz can stay on this station. I'll just turn the dial at night.

[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:50.820]
Okay. Have a great day and thanks for calling 610 W I O D. Yes. Yes. May I call for a two. We have an open line at day at 622 all three. Broward lines are open 767 9463. We had every line on the air lift for a couple of seconds. This is the deal this week. I guess they must be real busy.

[00:16:51.320 --> 00:17:02.380]
They must be really, really busy. Not landing tonight 9 to 11 also Friday 9 to 11 part 2 only. It's a two part return for the time being big piece in the paper by Deborah Wilker.

[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:08.840]
No less in the scum central this morning about the return of not landing briefly for four hours this week. Two hours tonight 9 to 11.

[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:16.520]
Two hours on Friday 9 to 11. Not landing returns. Boy, what a great show. Huh. Could be one of the greatest shows in the history of television. And if you didn't like it, you got no taste.

[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:32.560]
And what about that Annie on guiding light? What are we going to do about Annie and Riva? Riva is going to jail. And Ross, of course, is going to be prosecuting the case because he's the new district attorney just in time to prosecute Riva for murder and attempted murder and everything else is if we can't see through all of that grab.

[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:41.820]
On freaking believable and Annie's on her way to the morgue to get that fetus to make sure that nobody can find it. She in fact, I think she's going to stuff it back in.

[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:55.480]
That would be a good place to hide it. I was asking you that the other day, how long can a woman walk around with a dead fetus and a boarded fetus inside her body without getting serious infection and like going into toxic shock and the croaking.

[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:08.560]
There have been historic cases of that where the fetus actually became petrified and petrified just thinking about there forever. Yeah, pretty disgusting. Yeah, like it gets home. I'm a fine. That's why we call it a soap opera. Okay. It's only make believe. Thank you, Conway.

[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:14.300]
Here's a moment was it come a 20 said that or was it Roger Crotch? Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:23.980]
Mobile in Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil. I got a one D story. Yeah, listen, I went through the drive through. Okay, Dave Thomas. I'll piss off.

[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:31.020]
This game. I'm going to Sony. I street foods always excellent. Yeah, what do you want? I think I always take the baked potato instead of the fries.

[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:39.160]
Okay, what kind of potato? I said a baked potato. What kind of potato? I said, we already told us this story eight million times. Okay.

[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:46.920]
We have an open line and date six to two. Can you believe this guy? We already heard the same story that this guy's making up six to two W I O D and date.

[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:53.440]
We have two open lines in Broward seven six seven nine four six three. He's like the guy that called a Rick and Suds with the same. Remember that guy yesterday.

[00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:00.300]
Same story over and over again. And he wants to use the show as a vehicle because he knows Dave Thomas is listening. Okay.

[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:10.980]
I'm sure Dave in impressed. Okay. By the way, what kind of potato was it? Here's Kendall. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Are you going to watch the heat game tonight? No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I got a fiery port. Yeah.

[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:19.040]
Pack Cooper is on the Howard Stern show right now. Yeah. Okay. And who cares? How come you're listening to this show? Yeah, exactly.

[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:26.880]
Okay. Two open lines and date six to two nine four six three to and Broward seven six seven nine four six three seven six seven W I O D.

[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:36.640]
Pack Cooper. He's pretty exciting. When's Alan King coming on? Here's Miami on a mobile. Hello. Neil. Good morning. Yes, sir.

[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.920]
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.

[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.620]
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.

[00:19:46.800 --> 00:20:06.620]
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.

[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.900]
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.

[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.200]
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.

[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.600]
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.

[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:36.600]
I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought. I'm not going to be a little bit more than I thought.

[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:43.420]
They're shooting something and it's like they're foot. I mean, that rule, that rule is a disaster. But you got to understand at least for the season they're calling that rule.

[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.520]
In fact, Anaheim last night, they had a goal. Their first one just allowed. Then they got a two nothing leading the first.

[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:55.680]
And then there was two to one. They want to blues in five three. But if that first goal would have counted, they would have had a three nothing leading the way they would have been totally different game. They probably would have won which they did not.

[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.040]
But I mean, that's just the way they're calling it. And these guys are being careless. And while Bill Gehran is skating right through the crease for no reason at all, while Gilmore is sticking the time.

[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.460]
So the Rangers got lucky. But you got to, you know, Richter's playing great. But they're consistent. You know, at least they're consistent with the call.

[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.620]
Yeah, but it sucks. It's the worst rule in the history of sports. Got to stop.

[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:19.060]
Especially if you're on the opposite side of the goal. I mean, if you're in front of the goalie, that's a different story. And they shoot from the, you know, from the pointer.

[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.960]
Exactly. But if you're on the back side of the goal.

[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:33.440]
Unless there's interference with a goal tender, the goal should be allowed. And this is, this is a farce. And you got a bunch of hard headed jackasses who insist that this is a great rule to protect the goalie and it's bull crap. And it's destroying. It's destroying the games.

[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:39.080]
Maybe when we move down the diet, we can make some contact and see if we could petition almost every playoff game.

[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.320]
There's at least one of these goals this allowed because of this stupid and the crease deal.

[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.160]
Yes, sir. Anyways, are you a little more excited about this series now? Or are you still about what series?

[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:55.400]
Well, about the New York, New Jersey. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm not at all excited. I mean, the devil's to me are boring team.

[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:03.460]
Philly and Buffalo. That's exciting hockey. And even Edmonton, Colorado as much as one side of this is. Those are exciting teams to watch.

[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:15.620]
But I mean, watching New Jersey, man, they're just the coma inducing. Well, I'm not. Again, I'm not a New York friend. I wish New York the best. I'd like to see him beat New Jersey because I know Miami's going to beat the next in New York needs something to cheer about.

[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:23.020]
And by the way, I see the Panthers resigned Kirk Mueller for three more years. Wow. I'm sure excited about that. Can't you tell?

[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:33.500]
Neil, I love you. Can I can I get a request? Yeah. One of your favorites anything you want to play. Okay, have a great day. Okay enough of the sucking. Have a great day to open lines in day.

[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:42.940]
622 to W I O D to enbroward 767 one on the mobile one purple line pound I O D. We want to talk today to people who've tried to call some of these other shows.

[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:49.140]
The formula shows and aren't being put on a year like this last guy who've been told we can't put you on a year because you don't want to play the game.

[00:22:49.940 --> 00:23:01.880]
In fact, that goes back to the heavy, heavy, heavy screening that we were told about months ago, even when nickel was still here when water say, well, first put this plague upon his radio station when he first like stuck his nose into our business.

[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:12.080]
And then lied about it said, Oh, I never said any of that right. Steve nickel was the liar because he's not here to defend himself anymore. He was the one that was making it all up just like the thing about the wonderful island dreams.

[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:20.300]
He just made, oh, he didn't just make that up. Mobile one purple line is open pound I O D. It's 1026 at W I O D.

[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:33.300]
610 W I O D. The countdown continues. Countdown. 5 4 3 2 610 W I O D. I had one in my mouth once.

[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:41.120]
From the makers of the amazing wonder bra, it's the amazing new wonder jock. The jock that makes you really stand out and a cry.

[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:47.640]
Hi, great party. So listen, I saw you from across the room and I couldn't help noticing your huge penis.

[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:56.300]
Actually, it's not that huge. Really? It just looks huge. Thanks to my amazing new wonder jock. The amazing new wonder jock's patented construction lifts your penis and separates your testicles.

[00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:03.000]
For a look that says my penis is being lifted and my testicles are being separated just as the wonder bra gives girls cleavage.

[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.260]
The wonder jock gives men pee vids. How what are you doing? Looking down your pan. You've got great pee vids. Thanks.

[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:14.580]
Want to have sex now? Okay. The amazing new wonder jock. Yes, the grappling hooks hurt like hell, but it's worth it.

[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:20.680]
1031 at W I O D. Here's a facts from Pascuali who's ordinarily very chronic and continues to be however it fits right in.

[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:27.780]
It's a and of course obviously must be a masochist because he can't turn that bitch off. It says you made it big last night on the 6 to 9 Karen K show.

[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:34.680]
One of your loyal fans called an asterisk. She was the nameless one. Neal talks about and she got so pissed off and made him and I mean insistent.

[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:40.260]
He repeat what he just said after he repeated it. She told him I wish you would die. Get in a car accident. Have AIDS.

[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:46.800]
Blood get into your veins and die you bastard. Neal. Does this mean she likes you? She has a big problem. Signed Pascuali.

[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:53.780]
Okay, we're off to another raging start today just like we were yesterday. It's going to be the same thing all over again. You think it's just ask you during the break. What?

[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:11.200]
Okay, there you go. No, forget it. Norm, I'm not going to some stupid baseball game. The guy who called yesterday was right just because the tickets are free. I mean, it's boring. I'm not interested. Okay.

We have an open line in the purple line pound I OD the mobile one line, which we pay for two and day two and brown. Come on. What do you think? Okay?

[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:25.600]
Should these lesbian mothers be allowed to adopt that kid? He's in a foster home. He's retarded. Nobody else wants him. These two dicks want to adopt him.

[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:37.360]

I then she get on. You know, then she got to get more mad and then she said, okay, thanks for the spy report. Have a great day. Okay. Down to two calls now. Two open lines and day six, two, two, all a brow at seven six, seven W I O D. It's going to be the whole week like this. Huh? Okay. Except for Monday. We had a magnificent Monday. And now it's like their on vacation.

[00:26:53.540 --> 00:27:04.040]
Open line in a mobile one purple line at pound I O D years homestead. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I didn't know that you're talking about Karen K when I first started listening to show, but I kind of cut the.

[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:17.060]
Sir, I'm not just talking about Karen K. I am talking about a devastating destruction that is going on in this place. A so called instant hot formula that's going on here. Just add hot water that is so astonishing and so amazing.

[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:31.080]
And the phones on this show right now should be blazing off the hook from people who are fat who are just astonished at what's going on in this place. I listen to maybe I'm wrong. Maybe maybe you know something. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is where it's at.

[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:43.620]
Uh, maybe I'd have a full board of calls. If I said here, it took some half bake article out of the newspaper this morning and just read it on the year and kept reading it over and over and over again and said, what do you think? What do you think? It kept pumping the numbers out.

[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.680]
I listen to her show yesterday. I mean, I listened to it probably from a six until.

[00:27:50.160 --> 00:28:00.680]
602. Yeah, for a little while. She's talking about the three steps. This was that breast implants. Whatever. And I'm listening to colors. I mean, when when you're in that position, I've never heard a caller rip you apart.

[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:06.900]
Rip, rip, break and suds apart. I've never heard them rip apart. Person apart like they rip Karen K apart. They ripped her a new ass. Yeah.

[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:21.760]
I was just astonished. And she just kept like opening yourself up for us. I call my excellent. Okay. We have two open line. Thanks, Walter. Two open lines in Broward 767 9463 767 1 and day 622 mobile 1.

[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:30.400]
Purple lines open pound I OD to one of your townlines. I guess we're not going to be doing calls on a station anymore because when I listen like at night, I never hear any like maybe one an hour.

[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:40.460]
So I guess it's kind of like spreading. It's like a disease. It's spreading to the entire radio station. We'll just see her and vent for four hours every day. That's okay with me. That's fine.

[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:55.820]
That's what you want. Little Italian music, a little bit of venting. Here's the mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Are you aware of any market where in the evening people are able to get good numbers on talk radio because I think they just give up at night.

[00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:12.780]
Oh, do they really I know that I used to have 10 and 11 shares at night here back in the old days and W snooze. I know that Larry King used to have good numbers at night here. I know Alan Courtney used to have like double digit numbers at night. Okay. Well, because I'm a sort of creative. I know that KMO X always has had big numbers at night with whoever they had on the air.

[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:42.760]
Well, it seems like in this market they've given up. They just know they haven't given up. This is what they really believe is this is it. They really believe in this. Well, they're never honest to God believing this formula. It's not like they really thrown a thrown in the towel. They believe that this Orlando formula, this real radio formula is what talk radio is all about, which proves beyond a shadow of it out when they bought this station. They didn't have any idea what W. I. D. was about or why was successful or why people listen to it. I don't care how many how much research. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't

[00:29:42.760 --> 00:30:12.380]

[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.640]
uh... driving away down from the route to uh... mental zoo

[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.900]
about uh... thirty minutes yes sir it was not one

[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.760]
phone call we don't take phone calls on the station anymore we've driven a phone

[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.660]
calls all the way

[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:22.080]
there are no more phone calls well

[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.960]
all we have are people rambling on incessantly about things that nobody cares

[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.440]
about

[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:31.680]
over his topic was it was astounding yes he was pining away about uh...

[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.060]
fantasies about uh... women that he wanted to bed and that

[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:38.520]
i guess he did were all ex-girlfriends

[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.760]
i guess they dumped them

[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.200]
uh... i don't know that that's what it sounded like yeah

[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.440]
it was it was going all over and uh...

[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.100]
and he was asking for phone calls but they didn't come in yeah

[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.300]
and that's that seems to be the new format i guess in the course i can relate

[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.860]
to it because i do that every day but i have a different way of solving and i

[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.820]
probably the audience into calling and uh... eventually wind up getting usually

[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.600]
some response

[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.960]
but the idea that you're going to take one little narrow thing and just keep

[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.640]
just keep hammering away at it and banging and twisting and shoving it down

[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.980]
the audience is through and force people to listen and talk about something that

[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.960]
they couldn't obviously give a crap less about it that it's not gonna happen

[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.520]
it ain't gonna happen guys

[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.940]

a wedding dress and god thank the lord she finally fit in

[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.680]
course i guess the body after well it's kind of grotesque isn't a little grotesque

[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.340]
to think of how the body kind of like shrivels a little bit

[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.000]
after you lose all the fluids you know after they drain the fluids out she fits

[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.360]
very nicely in that wedding dress so what are they complaining about god damn it

[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.500]
she went on the diet so she can fit in her wedding dress and she does fit in her

[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.800]
wedding dress so she's in a box what's the big deal that they never promised

[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.620]
a rating about that

[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.100]
they said we'll get you to fit in that white wedding dress

[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.780]
and she's beautiful now

[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.900]
she looks better than linda's energy

[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:00.900]

controversy which we've already had more than enough contrived controversy in

[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.960]
this market to last a lifetime

[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.560]

the real adam uh... throw upon a couple of times over the years they brought

[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.160]

[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:59.740]

[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:03.180]
here right now but that's that's not what you expect like on a big league radio show on a minor

[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:07.500]
league radio station even the mobile one purple line is sitting there dead at pound i would be

[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:12.300]
this town is just i think it died i think once that paysock came and went and everybody left town

[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.720]
i think this town we shouldn't we should be sitting shivvy right now maybe that's what they're doing

[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.180]
even the glee are my sitting shivvy for this town you know what that is when you say yes

[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:27.300]
good alve yes good ash smuck robo every now smuck robo yeah he was my reby here is a boca hello

[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:33.660]
hey new yes sir how you okay watch that rangers game last time yes i did didn't you know that that rule

[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:37.220]
was gonna end up screwing somebody somebody somewhere on the line it doesn't every game every single

[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:42.080]
game that rule just it's got a stop man it's why didn't they change it before the playoffs i don't

[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.180]
know why doesn't Gary beckman and they had Gary beckman on air by the way that twerp they interviewed

[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:50.980]
him for about five seconds and he's got nothing to say he's a smuck even a look on frasier

[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:55.140]
face i mean he looked pain to even go on here he never called it to lines man man was the right

[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.080]
call based on the way they're calling the rule but what what was bill garen thinking about why

[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.080]
is he doing like skating right through the other side of the crease when doggie gillmore is sticking

[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.520]
the time goal in there amazing well you talk about uh but it happens to everybody i'm not going

[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.540]
to knock the rangers for that because it happens there with everybody they didn't have any defense

[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:16.640]
the last couple minutes there and then steve tomas uh steve tomas had one taken back in game two

[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.900]
the other night again the same thing crazy did you see that one no i did yes steve tomas had a

[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.320]
goal called back because again somebody was in a crease together i think he was a one in a crease

[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:31.480]
yes he was uh in closing yes your uh newsman john em yes let him know that those games with the

[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.660]
marlin yeah in florida not Pittsburgh last two days he's been saying those he's been saying they've

the caffeine-free diet coke no seriously is that true is that people who are like recovering

[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:00.100]
alcoholics drink a lot of diet coke is that what he told did he tell you that or somebody else

[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:04.800]

[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.060]

then we'll lighten up on those bulldox feminists again see the thing that i have a problem with lesbians

[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:20.480]
about and i've told you this before is that for years they pretend to be real uh... uh... uh... uh...

[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.460]
gutsy but in the meantime balsy i guess it'd be the word i'm looking for but the bottom line is

[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.040]
their cowards they've been masquerading as feminists

[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.400]
which is why so many people are turned off to the national organization for women of women on women

[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.980]
and by the whole feminist movement is largely been uh... like a hundred years behind the times

[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:41.660]
because it's been largely a bunch of bull dikes masquerading as feminists why can't they just say

[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:44.880]
were a bunch of angry bull dikes and we're not going to take it anymore what's wrong with that

maybe that was their game plan maybe because they have all these other stations they bought this

[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.560]
place and maybe they were out to destroy it from the beginning because they're sure doing a great

[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:48.760]
job would you know it tell adam don't give that much credence to bar thing because you know that's

205 at w i o d on a great wednesday here at the home of hysteria man where everybody's running

[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:40.020]
around in circles going little bit like that we got lots of open lines now again at noon yesterday

[01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:44.140]
too we actually built up a little momentum just before noon like maybe a call and then noon came

[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:48.820]
and all of a sudden okay we don't care no more you can't do that to us man you can't do this to us

[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:54.040]
we're dying over here two open lines in date six two two nine four six three two and

[01:33:54.040 --> 01:34:01.480]
broard seven six seven nine four six three here's poppano hello time caller all right all right

[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:07.100]
hey i got a question a comment and a request yes okay forget about the request we're not doing a

[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.440]
request we want verbal intercourse today forget this request stuff well it kind of go hand in hand

[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:17.160]
with the uh the fat or the with the fact stuff yeah well think about it okay okay anyways uh

[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:24.240]
question i never really got an answer or found out an answer about what happened to run and run

[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:30.040]
why they left uh zeta four can you answer that they didn't leave zeta four the paxon people panic

[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:34.200]
because howard came on the year and they panicked and realized that howard was going to blow them out

[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:38.760]
of the water and so they blew that show off and then in their infinite wisdom they bought the

[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.880]
network a couple of years later and put them on the year here and they're doing like fractions man

[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.440]
their numbers are so small you need a magnifying glass to see them well that's that's weird because

[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.860]
in the typical way that only paxon can do yes i was hearing all kinds of rumors that uh

[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:57.900]
there's sexual allegation no there were not uh nothing like that i had nothing to do with that

[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:03.200]
nothing nothing that good uh okay uh comment to do with desperate ratings as in none

[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:10.160]
yeah comment yes i was in the army i have had basic and a it over at fort dix new jersey yes

[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:17.720]
um it's kind of surprising that uh hearing about this this drill sergeant and the sergeant

[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:23.160]
major of the army and everything like that um now all this is suddenly coming out of the closet

[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:28.140]
yeah at least he was living up to his name anyway yeah right girl sergeant yeah well anyways um

[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:33.580]
when i when i was an a it we would have the guys in the first floor girls would be on the second

[01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:38.900]
yeah i would see the girls in formation the next day a couple of them coming down in

[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.140]
here's because a couple the drill sergeants what they're and put some kind of you know

[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:49.940]
i got you down yeah yeah so it's it's kind of surprising for me to hear that all of a sudden

[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:54.700]
all this stuff is coming out this stuff should have been out a long time ago yeah and

[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:59.580]
just like that Graham James with the hockey players man all this all this stuff has been swept

[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:03.320]
out of the carpet for years like the thing with all the priest to child molesting priest they just

[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.980]
sweep it out of the carpet as long as nobody knows about it just keep it a secret well they don't

[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:11.400]
want to hear it right you know anyways because one thing we know in a military man there ain't no

[01:47:52.900 --> 01:48:00.280]
Halloween and that started in with the druids and a lot of people don't understand well let me

[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:05.380]
ask you a question okay what difference does it make how it got started don't we know what it

[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:10.880]
means today don't we know how it that it's a fun thing for people to go out and pester their

[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:15.260]
neighbors and get their kids a bunch of candy and get them sick and for perverts to put like razor blades

[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:19.720]
and apples and that's what it's all about that's the purpose well could i take it has nothing to do

[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:23.460]
with religion it has nothing to do with the devil it has nothing to do with the druids it has nothing

[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:28.020]
to do with Lucifer it has nothing to do with jews or goyam or anybody else it's just a night of

[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:31.980]
fun for the people in their little pat monkey kids that's all okay well i remember that's all very

[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:37.880]
simple okay well i respect your opinion can you let's not in opinion it's a fact what can't can

[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:43.700]
you listen what i have to say i'll be delighted all right listen all right uh and and the early

[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:51.060]
uh twelve hundred okay the druids they started uh why do you keep going back to this again well

[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:54.680]
listen to me because you don't understand it's correct that way that's correct they were probably

[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:58.860]
good that he's totally wrong all right well listen they would they would have child sacrifices

[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:05.000]
and the cackel and they'd like the candle with human fat and and and first of all let me ask you

[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.240]
this were you there to see this well do you do you believe that Napoleon and Hitler existed

[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:14.560]

[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:20.320]
we're Napoleon and Hitler back in the uh twelveth century well listen that was history and i'm

[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:25.620]
trying to say is and how about Shakespeare did he exist of course he did yeah was that his real name

[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:29.740]
do we know how about there there's all kinds of historical people that we didn't even know

[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:33.140]
of for sure if that was the real name if they were some of them if they we leave it existed

[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:37.540]
well i guess in five hundred years but what does that have to do with anything why you giving me a

[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:42.540]

[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.920]
have to do with the way that holo ween is celebrated now well it started out as an occult

[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:02.520]

right you got to scare you got to scare the hell out of the people okay if anybody really believes

[02:06:56.530 --> 02:07:00.550]
that if there was a god he would for you would cause you to burn in hell forever what kind of a god

[02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:06.310]
is that kind of a sick twisted god is that that's right supposed to be a loving god and yada yada yada

impressed you would know a new story if it's lit inside your anus here's bokeh hello i kneel how

[02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:11.970]
you great i've actually i've listened to you back in the w n w s days yeah you know sometimes i

[02:08:11.970 --> 02:08:15.510]
agree with you and sometimes i don't and i guess this is one of the times i don't agree with you

[02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:20.110]
about what well i know you i know your show is satire and quite frankly no one does a better

[02:08:20.110 --> 02:08:25.410]
than you in terms of satire and that's right but there's one thing that i needed to mention and

[02:08:25.410 --> 02:08:31.850]
that has to do with some not all but but a part of the the jewish humor you use for example

[02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:37.170]
a lot of the jewish humor i think is fantastic like the the song be true to your shul and

[02:08:37.170 --> 02:08:41.730]
yeah well i'm not here about the good stuff let you have the bad stuff that here's the bad stuff

[02:08:41.730 --> 02:08:48.270]
here's the stuff that bothers me bad stuff according to you okay uh you know a lot of people don't

[02:08:48.270 --> 02:08:52.570]
know that you're jewish and sometimes how could they not how could there be somebody on the

[02:08:52.570 --> 02:08:56.970]
you're using yetish words who could up wouldn't be jewish well okay what i'm ridiculous okay but

[02:08:56.970 --> 02:09:00.610]
what i'm really saying it's that sometimes you don't be like me saying to molly goalberg don't say

[02:09:00.610 --> 02:09:04.290]
oye vey because a lot of people don't know your jewish okay i guess what i'm really saying is

[02:09:04.290 --> 02:09:10.430]
sometimes you'll say things like ju-bitch or ju-canoo and what i think it does at least in my opinion

[02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:16.270]
is that i think it fuels some of the you know the anti-semites again i'll get out of here give me a

[02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:21.570]
break i mean now you talk about ridiculous well no i i i you know i'm gonna tell you any people who

[02:09:21.570 --> 02:09:25.290]
don't have a sense of humor that's one thing about the jews look at all the great jewish comedians

[02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:29.110]
the one reason the jews have survived all these years is because they've always had a great sense of

[02:09:29.110 --> 02:09:33.850]
humor even in the middle of the worst adversity they got a sense of humor i'm just saying that

[02:09:33.850 --> 02:09:39.190]
there are times where you'll get an anti-semitic call or two uh you know on the air and i think some

[02:09:39.190 --> 02:09:43.630]
of them feel that if they talk show host makes these kind of comments on the air it adds more

[02:09:43.630 --> 02:09:48.890]
we know how long do i put up with anti-semite calls well you don't how long do i put up with anti-cuban

[02:09:48.890 --> 02:09:53.050]
calls even though i use words like spick and hulio and stuff like that people with a sense of humor

[02:09:53.050 --> 02:09:56.930]
listen to this show and the other people don't have a sense of humor they're listening in the closet

[02:09:56.930 --> 02:10:02.030]
and i feel sorry for them i just i just you know that's just my opinion and i know that for example

[02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:06.990]
when you know like the term ju-bitch or whatever if someone other than a jewish person said that

[02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:11.710]
it would be highly offensive there are many things you say on the air why don't you go back to

[02:10:11.710 --> 02:10:16.110]
Canada you you bastard see i didn't even say it i know but that's one of the things but the bottom

[02:10:16.110 --> 02:10:19.870]
well wait a minute that's another one of the things well not that you said but the the recording

[02:10:19.870 --> 02:10:23.370]
that you just play yeah that's also offensive you know but when i say there's a lot of Jewish

[02:10:23.370 --> 02:10:27.890]

audience to call in here give me instructions as to how to do the show we have plenty of people

[02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:53.410]
on a station who could use some instruction believe me desperately but i'm not one of them

[02:10:53.410 --> 02:10:59.550]

[02:10:59.550 --> 02:11:04.790]
kike exactly six two two nine four six three two open lines in date and we have an open line

[02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:08.710]
of browards seven six seven let's get back to the halloween stuff okay i think the guy had an excellent

[02:11:08.710 --> 02:11:15.030]
point halloween is a disgusting grotesque satanic holiday and all those evil cats and bats and

[02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:20.670]
spirits uh there you can smell it in the air can't you at halloween time you can go out there or

[02:11:20.670 --> 02:11:26.910]
is that just all that rotting candy in the fruit too much rotten fruit here's tamarack hello

[02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:33.230]
me yeah that's you you're not prejudiced you pick on everybody equally yes there is a sign that

[02:11:33.230 --> 02:11:37.810]
there is a god though i'll by the way there's a jew in tamarack yeah did you read last week or the

[02:11:37.810 --> 02:11:41.690]
week before i need a brian declared bankruptcy yes i did i've mentioned that several times and thank

[02:11:41.690 --> 02:11:45.650]
you so much for mentioning again all right last but not least because i missed the morning you did

[02:11:45.650 --> 02:11:51.090]
mention fenn fenn the big article yes i did and then again we were we were we had it yesterday we

[02:11:51.090 --> 02:11:55.590]
were on it yesterday the woman buried in her wedding dress you got it and in closing you've heard the

[02:11:55.590 --> 02:12:01.610]
term serial killer yeah it's a serial killer a guy who goes kuku for koko puffs no frosted flakes thank

[02:12:01.610 --> 02:12:06.130]
you have a great day too much frosted flakes and you want to know why because it's loaded with azucada

[02:12:06.130 --> 02:12:12.930]
baby it's loaded with sugar sugar sugar sugar sugar is making more people hysterical and more people

[02:12:12.930 --> 02:12:17.810]
hyper and jumping off the walls and your little kids are crazy why because you're loading them

[02:12:17.810 --> 02:12:22.230]
with sugar even all the baby foods as if you look at the label most of it's loaded with sugar

[02:12:22.890 --> 02:12:28.170]
it's the american way of killing the population with a great taste and talk about addictive

[02:12:29.530 --> 02:12:33.350]
anybody else out there i'm i'm sure there are plenty of other people who even have a worse addiction than

[02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:38.290]
i do although i have no idea how that's possible i am telling you man if i eat something with sugar in

[02:12:38.290 --> 02:12:43.870]
it there is no such thing as eating only one if there is a box of a hundred i could eat one or two

[02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:48.190]
with the best of intentions and within a matter of twenty thirty minutes they're all gone i don't

[02:12:48.190 --> 02:12:51.970]
care whether it's candy i don't care whether it's cookies i don't care whether it's like a half

[02:12:51.970 --> 02:12:57.210]
gallon of ice cream if i start eating something with sugar in it it stimulates my appetite to the point

[02:12:57.210 --> 02:13:02.850]
where i just practically am killing myself with sugar and you don't hear the government talking about

[02:13:02.850 --> 02:13:08.950]
that because it's big business i don't hear anybody i don't hear one person out there all these

[02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:14.190]
people that want the network shows all those tv shows to be rated everything's got to have a rating

[02:13:14.190 --> 02:13:18.650]
so we know we're not sending for presenting anything harmful to our kids like god forbid naked boobies

[02:13:18.650 --> 02:13:23.030]
oh my god we don't want to see our kids see a naked woman or a penis god forbid

[02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:31.030]
but every show on Saturday morning is sponsored by candy bars and cereal all loaded with sugar

[02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:36.110]
every single one of those products that advertises on those cartoon shows and every other kids show

[02:13:36.110 --> 02:13:42.730]
on Saturday morning every single one of those sponsors is killer crap killer crap for your kids

[02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:46.330]
and i don't see anybody getting all bent out of shape about that

[02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:51.850]
so it goes to show you man you can't complain about the american priorities because there aren't any

[02:13:52.630 --> 02:13:56.330]
we have an open line and brow at seven six seven we have one on the mobile per one purple line

phasier as a referee you think he's a good ref they all suck now come on it's gotta be one

[02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:04.710]
that better than the other he's not he's fair he has his good days in his bad days

[02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:09.990]
one of the fair of them all right man he's okay you would like to see some i've seen some real crappy

[02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:15.650]
games that he's called more i've seen games when he was more worried about getting his hair out of

[02:27:15.650 --> 02:27:19.710]
joint he's to you know that that's all he cares about is having enough hair spray that head is not

[02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:23.570]
move that's why he doesn't move the head too much and a lot of stuff is going on the sides and behind

[02:27:23.570 --> 02:27:27.030]
him you don't want to look because his hair might get out of joint i give him more fair than poor

[02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:32.230]
games i think he's you know more on the better side more fair than than well he's fair i think

[02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:35.730]
we i like him sucks was watching the game the ranger uh

[02:27:36.730 --> 02:27:40.990]
jersey game was that was that also watching paint drawing your opinion no it was it was better

[02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:44.930]
it was better than the previous game i thought the third period was pretty exciting that's good

[02:27:44.930 --> 02:27:49.030]
new jersey was all over them they were hanging on like life and death oh my god

[02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:52.150]
rick your rick your kept him in the game then of course the disallowed gold didn't hurt any

[02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:56.770]
because because bill garen decided to go through for a skate in the crease uh i still can't

[02:27:56.770 --> 02:27:59.730]
figure out where the hell he was going he was probably trying to get out of the crease

[02:27:59.730 --> 02:28:04.650]
he was he skated right through it though he had no there no reason being over there he skated

[02:28:04.650 --> 02:28:09.310]
right through the crease yeah put all that happens in like a hundred percent yeah you're right i

[02:28:09.310 --> 02:28:12.670]
know but these guys are going to be much more conscious of it because they know what's going on

[02:28:12.670 --> 02:28:18.750]
he he cost them uh wow all right i'm not going to argue with that in closing Neil uh is your

[02:28:18.750 --> 02:28:23.090]
prediction changed on the ranger part i mean on the uh i don't know i know my prediction is not

[02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:29.630]
changed on the rangers going anywhere they're not going anywhere they're like uh you know well the

[02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:33.990]
look like it to me i mean they played one uh uh pretty damn good third period there but they

[02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:38.210]
just can't score they don't score any goals how to how can you win games when you can't score any

[02:28:38.210 --> 02:28:42.890]
goals they remind me of the panthers if it has caught enough to win they're no they are

[02:28:43.570 --> 02:28:46.690]
looks looks to me like they're down two games to one last time i checked

[02:28:46.690 --> 02:28:50.890]
i'm sorry i'm sorry i thought you meant the rangers but all right no i'm talking about the devils

[02:28:50.890 --> 02:28:56.570]
they're not score any goals but the peppering rick the was shot well they got to stick it in

[02:28:57.330 --> 02:29:02.670]
you can't win unless you stick it right in there and the puck too right exactly good luck pal finally

[02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:07.810]
finally in closing yes okay i don't know even though you say barna be in the butching up of the

[02:29:07.810 --> 02:29:13.750]
buff flows is costing them the game with the flyers no i i i i i said that i said that mouthing off

[02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:18.730]
in the game on saturday and getting into that big brawl woke the flyers up out of a deep coma

[02:29:18.730 --> 02:29:23.170]
and that was the turn to me that was the turning point of the series if buffalo with a one-net game

[02:29:23.170 --> 02:29:27.550]
they'd be in pretty good shape right now but they're not how about the last game with the barna

[02:29:27.550 --> 02:29:31.750]
he was great in the last game he's one of my favorite players i won't knock Matthew Barnaby he's

[02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:40.170]
great huh now i can see why you like him he's he's he's dynamite i'm most of them ray also they

[02:29:40.170 --> 02:29:45.670]
they got a hell of a team and they got uh uh mike peca and he got uh holes in her and he got uh

[02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:51.870]
michael uh growshik and he got uh jason daugh none of them are superstars but each and every one of

[02:29:51.870 --> 02:29:56.410]

with that the stokey in my purse and George and i just continue with amazement shaking

[02:37:30.390 --> 02:37:33.590]
our heads and wondering when the holiday is going to come that we can finally get there a lot of

[02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:38.070]
but in the meantime we show up every day and yeah i could just put a bunch of crap music on

[02:37:38.070 --> 02:37:42.410]
there especially you know this it's interesting this guy calls because like i've said this before

[02:37:43.050 --> 02:37:47.390]
as bad as the paxon people are and the consultant and all the other crap that's going on here

[02:37:47.390 --> 02:37:51.410]
if the audience which they're not but if the audience in his town and they're never going to change

[02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:56.370]
up in your 21 years they will never ever change these people are dead heads but if the audience

[02:37:56.370 --> 02:38:00.570]
was responsive it could be okay i mean uh we're you know basically in the driver's seat here

[02:38:00.570 --> 02:38:05.990]
we could be having a good time every day but it's the same old crap no matter how many different

[02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:09.190]
things you talk about it well that's not they're not interested they got nothing to say they

[02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:13.150]
got nothing to offer they're too damn lazy to pick up the phone oh hey no i listen every day but

[02:38:13.150 --> 02:38:18.050]
i never call i'm so sick of meeting people like that if i had a a hundred dollar bill for every

[02:38:18.050 --> 02:38:22.610]
person i met like that i could buy the day and join and turn it into a parking lot oh they're

[02:38:33.050 --> 02:38:37.670]

[02:39:07.210 --> 02:39:11.070]
how much how much confidence can you have in a bull crap that you've been brainwashed and do

[02:39:11.070 --> 02:39:14.690]
that you won't even pick up the phone and dispute what i'm saying because you know you can't defend it

[02:39:14.690 --> 02:39:19.190]
you know it's a bunch of crap and you're still over the years man they finally just kind of

exact replica of what they're trying to reproduce down here with you can try thing with the topics

these old ponderous jingles these rejoins they're doubling up on them now we have one going into the

[02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:44.450]
spots which is a great way for the advertisers to make sure that nobody hears their recorded messages

[02:54:44.450 --> 02:54:48.210]
because everybody's diving for the dial to tune it off and then when we come back at the end of

[02:54:48.210 --> 02:54:52.570]
the break we have another one of these corny old uh crap things so to the like driving them down to

[02:54:52.570 --> 02:54:56.750]
people's throats which is a lot more clutter just takes up a lot more time and just to aggravate

[02:54:56.750 --> 02:55:01.510]
the audience i mean i'm in the talent it seems like in their news broadcast i'm talking about
