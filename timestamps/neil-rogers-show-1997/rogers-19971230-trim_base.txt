[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]
Man, I'll tell you one thing. I don't want to start immediately like a technical thing

[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.660]
I couldn't hear you if you paid me a million dollars a second. Let's give it a shot. You surprised by that

[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.160]
By what the fact that you never had any

[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.420]
Technical glitches man and all I want to tell you is George Corso is God

[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.460]
But wasn't for him the whole place would be up in flames

[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.780]
Hey, Neil what in the hell have you been doing the last seven months?

[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.960]
None of your business

[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.580]
Can you share a little bit of what you've been doing going to the bank and right a masturbation went on

[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.580]
Neil's the main mystery in Elbach

[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.580]
I've been out and about I've been out of this place. I've been living in breathing countries

[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.860]
Have you missed Italy and Holland and Canada and places?

[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.820]
Neil have you missed this this radio stuff if you had a tumor the size of a watermelon on your ass would you miss it?

[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.440]
Have I missed it? Why is it that all these bozos? It's the first thing that oh aren't you dying to get back on here?

[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.680]
I'm going and pick it up a check every Monday for doing nothing for traveling around the world having a time in my life

[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.800]
Oh, don't you aren't you just dying to get back on here? Don't you have some kind of compulsive need to what the hell is there to say?

[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.580]
I've been on here for 500 years already. What the hell else am I gonna say? Hey, do you like blow it out your nose?

[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.880]
You know, hey Neil can't say yes on your show, can I know? Yeah, you can say ask but we've been told not to say

[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.280]
Ask and then finish it with the whole stuff. Oh, we can't say recommend can't say that though. Well Joe's got caught some heat from some of the

[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.020]
Collars you were driving on was I heard that clear channel bought a lot of stations and then they recommend

[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.340]
How do you like that new stupid talk format huh? Oh, God isn't it nice to have no competition? Oh my gosh

[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.580]
Hey, one last question you get tired and I'm really tired

[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.380]
It's a question I get about you all the time is is he really making a million dollars a year you must get that all the time too I

[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.520]
Do

[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.280]
Listen make it make it three million

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.120]
I have no idea Ellie Brecker who I think's been doing a lot of acid lately at the Harold

[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.820]
She makes these things up like like the thing this morning in a paper about the foot massager that's in my contract

[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.020]
Where the hell does she come up with crap like this? I was gonna ask you that if you read it in the hero

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.100]
You know must be BS

[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.540]
In fact the front of on the mast head they should just have a big pile say hey, it's the hero baby. That's it

[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.660]
If you read it in the hero, you know, it's a pile

[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.800]
Now how's that studio over there? It's better than what you got sweet. Oh, that's not saying

[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.080]
Well listen, they brought a lot of balloons in here that are loaded with helium now

[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.300]
Do I have to suck helium before I go on here so I can sound like guilty?

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.820]
You can suck whatever you want. Well stay over there Goldie. Hey, no, by the way nothing we can do about his voice

[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.940]

Devo's on big hand too bad about DFO, huh? What do you mean? Yeah, he's had some problems here

[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.720]
I heard he went for the operation. I heard in fact

[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.440]
They told me it is in my contract that after six months. I have to go and have have him snipped so we can all sound like guilty

[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.840]
It's all sports radio folks

[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.340]
Why is 60 oh now you're on the bed. Everybody tells me you're a hell of a good guy. He's not a bad guy

[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.180]
I'm not a good guy. You know I'm not a hell of a boy and he's not a boy and River got a man

[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.260]
You lost in this joint. Thank God for Goldie. I forgot he was Jewish

[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.920]
When River comes on and tells me I'm a man. I know I'm doing okay. Yeah, listen

[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.420]
He's just an ass sucker anyway, forget about oh

Do you hear the day that he filled in for Hank and he was he did four hours of ass sucking on all everybody connected with a

[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.300]
Panthers past present and future and he's got you know what the thing about it is know that I understand what Rimm

[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.000]
And I don't want to get started on he's got the most one an ass sucker man

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.320]
He's got the most secure job in South Florida. He is sucked more

[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.280]

[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.840]
I want to ask you questions. Yeah, seriously because we do have a little format change here

[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.520]
What time is Chris moron?

[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.400]
I'm not exactly sure because nobody's really said I think he took over the

[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.320]
Joe oh god

[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.380]
That's the rumor

[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.860]
Can we can we do a test?

[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.340]
Can we have somebody go to the arena tonight? We do have the San Jose game tonight. I will be there

[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.180]
Right we have somebody holding oozzy to Chris's head and see if someone can force him to describe what's going on doing again

[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.260]
You think that we work is that what it's gonna take just describe 30 seconds of action

[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.240]
So I don't have to hear the puck in the the skates and the stuff on the boards. I'm hearing in the background

You're right about that now we finally got an honest answer out of the worst team absolutely correct

[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.060]
They had no intention of building anything, you know, and the thing about it is and by the way and I'll leave you with this that

[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.060]
Program director that we have don't trust him

[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.320]

[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.400]

Tom to lighten up a little bit y'all do y'all you guys ought to be sending me a contribution if I were making so day

[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.220]
Much money I would request that would demand it and we give a little variety here

[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.340]
Are we gonna end up moving over to your studios or somebody got through town?

[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.420]
Somebody told me that you didn't want anybody in your studio

[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.860]
You wanted just to be the new Roger studio and nobody else was allowed over there

[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.480]
No, no, that's what they told me they said that even when we move up on the third floor

[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.780]
Which we will February they start even when that happens is they're gonna build us around studio

[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.600]
I didn't ask for that did I ask for my own studio at IOD? No, did I ask for my own studio?

[00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.140]
Okay, how do all these rumors get out that I mention it? You're not allowed in okay rimmers rumors

[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.680]
Mandage is allowed in oh, yeah you and mandage boy

[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:10.560]
Mandage is great. How is that really wants me to sing God bless America and paste decent a G-string?

[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.660]
I'll do it. He's pulling it right

[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.380]
What is it he's pulling in some coin manage? When is he on the air?

[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.080]
I think Saturday actually there's a scam almost as good as mine

[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.280]
He also gets paid for doing nothing. He he's a little bit better to take a page out of our songbook man

[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.660]
Getting paid for sitting on your ass and traveling around pick up a check once a week. That's the way to go

[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.960]
You have done it my friend you have it all figured out. He's up too loud, but I can't hear these guys

[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.260]
The you know it's gonna be a little what happens when I do this I hear you

[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:48.320]
I'll look at when you do what when you crank them up. Oh Jesus you know even over the air weights the studio just sounds nicer over there

[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.720]
It is wait till you see it you'll cry or cry like a baby

[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.160]
Why do you think D.F.O. is in rehab? He was over here Thursday saw the studio had a complete relapse

[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.780]
He was he was here Thursday looked real puffy by the way

[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:06.160]
Man got that big contract over here now. He must be eating and drinking up or just eating up a storm anyway

[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.740]
Well, of course we we're gonna let you go for a couple minutes and get ready

[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.640]
It's a vacation and we'll see no he's not on vacation

[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.380]
He's having some personal problems getting some help by this Phil Henry Jr

[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:24.880]
Routine he's getting the hell is on vacation. He did have the under in the dolphins game though his last bet like I said

[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.420]
Rehab

[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.420]
You

[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.500]
You've been enjoying watching Chris Wells play

[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.960]
You know something I'm glad you mentioned that not you know

[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:43.260]
Chris Wells actually on this new line is playing a lot better like that. I can't believe you said that

[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.220]
I know that I figured I'd give you one shocker for the morning

[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.920]
I like actually like the way he's playing with Fitzgerald and Lindsay. He's playing almost like a real player

[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.020]
But let me ask you this and on our team that's saying a lot do you have to play by play though of the Barnes 3

[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.640]
Yes, yesterday will you be playing them all morning? I'm sure you'll not

Sayonet on the hockey night in Canada the Saturday night

Ray Whitney is the best point man in the world today according to me and Don Sherry in the world

[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:16.440]
Not not to mention he looks pretty good too, but Ray Whitney is God don't ever forget that a milf you cross Ray Whitney

[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.000]
And you'll have to deal with me. Let me ask about me and 10 big Italians better off

[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.520]
Would you do anything you could to get the guy here better off?

[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:29.920]
So he's up pussy forget about him. Okay. He's another one of these overpaid Europeans that the Premadana divisive

[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.760]
We don't need him. Yes, you're not a big man of it

[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.000]
You know, we're more we're more was on the other day a guy calls in to show you what a stuits sports listeners

[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:14.640]

[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:14.640]

[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.220]
the

[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.840]
The NEL Rogers Show

[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.460]
To talk to NEL called 5667-0560 toll free for date and

[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.300]
Bradford or pound 560 on your cell phone.

[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.840]
The opinions of NEL, his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily

[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.740]
reflect those of WQAM, Beasley Read Acquisitions or the Beasley Broadcast Group.

[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.940]
Now, NEL Rogers on Sports Radio 5667, God created the heaven's

[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.560]
MBR and it was good.

[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.420]
Then, God created man and it wasn't bad.

[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.440]
But the masses were ashes.

[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:53.640]
They were lost.

[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.080]
They had no guidance.

[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.540]
So God sat and thought about it.

[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.500]
And he created the NEL Rogers Show.

[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.620]
And God set forth NEL to entertain the people of Israel.

[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:13.240]
But canonites, the Palestinians and the douchebags and NEL led his plot through the dark

[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.260]
cold rugged terrain of Miami Radio.

[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.900]
He conquered the mountains.

[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.080]
He cast down the algorithm and vanished the foul bird and it was good.

[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:28.320]
NEL Rogers Show is not just a show, it's a religious experience.

[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.780]
Well, I hate what to do with NEL.

[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.800]
Who's that bag and bag on again?

[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.720]
I want what they had before.

[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.440]
These are my kind of guys.

[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.480]
What the hell are they doing anyway?

[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.420]
They're from analy-sounding guys really gay.

[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.880]
I want four at Christmas for Ghosts' Voice and Three High.

[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.740]
When I listen to the sports,

[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.440]
a manly voice won't get my attention.

[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.180]
But we'll really get to be stood for the shorts.

[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.860]
A squeaky high voice will give me an erection.

[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.920]
Well, I hate what to do with our QAL.

[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.400]
But that bag and bag on again.

[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.020]
I'm going to miss here at Straight Man with voices this high.

[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.420]
Now I'll have to get deeper in that closet and end.

[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.160]
So I can address all the macho friends.

[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.420]
And check out Chris More at night to help him pay the sign.

[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.860]
Yeah, there ain't nothing like having macho sports guys as voices as in cracks.

[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.560]
And they were 12 years old.

[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.280]
Yeah, I can't feel like that.

[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.120]
Yeah, stand up real close to the radio and press the sound.

[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.700]
Get their voices on up there really makes my balls take over here.

[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.400]
And that crow, man, he's smarter than my infrared brother.

[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:46.920]
Yeah.

[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.260]
So, let me ask you the first question.

[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.320]
What the hell time is, Chris?

[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:52.940]
More on.

[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.320]
Anyway, it's 1003 on 560 QAM.

[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.100]
And we got a Coxies Army in here to like you never say anything like this.

[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.340]
You think there was something going on here today, which they're just might be.

[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.620]
And it's a major miracle.

[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.080]
Let me say it again.

[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.000]
George Corso is God.

[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.980]
Now, would we be here today if it weren't for this one poor guy?

[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.440]
That's right.

[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.840]
Even our George is like got the clap in there for him.

[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.900]
He's clapping and yacking.

[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.300]
And this man did five people's work nine o'clock last night.

[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.480]
We finally got the last, well not the last, but close to the last piece of equipment in here.

[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.720]
And it's a major miracle.

[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.460]
One man.

[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.600]
So powerful.

[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.380]
So amazing.

[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.160]
So miraculous.

[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.740]
Any words in earring too.

[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.460]
How do you like that?

[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.720]
So we've got the seven months worth of material to cover here.

[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.840]
And you know, Ellie Brecker.

[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.440]
I had all the other stuff I want to talk about.

[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.680]
And then of course we got the Harold.

[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.440]
And we know how much we love the Harold.

[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.100]
There are favorites.

[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.140]
And she comes up with Ellie.

[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.740]
I mean, seriously, could you ever get anything right?

[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.340]
I love you.

[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.360]
You're a sweet person, but stay the hell away.

[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:50.840]
You know what I mean?

[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.720]
This is just unbelievable.

[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.520]
She has an article in here this morning, a little bit late, but better late than ever.

[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.380]
But Ellie Brecker.

[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.300]
That fucking bitch.

[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.920]
Has got a thing in here that says, I'm talking about the fact that, you know, there was a few delays here over these past.

[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.600]
They only had seven months to get this done.

[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.460]
Not a long time.

[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.780]
Not a long time for a project that should take about three weeks.

[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.900]
But they only had seven months to do it.

[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.080]
And they kept giving us one date.

[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.540]
It's going to be done December 1st.

[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.860]
It's going to be done December 8th.

[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.580]
It's going to be done December 15th.

[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.860]
Positively December 16th.

[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.020]
Nine o'clock last night, the 29th of freaking December.

[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.960]
We get the last piece of equipment in here so we can do the show.

[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:33.780]
See, their idea of doing a show is you walk into a dilapidated old flea bag, like Hank keeps telling you it is over there at QAM.

[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.440]
You sit down with a mic and a board that Mark Coney would be embarrassed by.

[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.160]
And you flip the stuff open and the cloud worked out.

[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.840]
That's being on the radio, okay?

[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:49.740]
We are here to drag the beastly read people out of the stone age of broadcasting into at least the 19th century anyway.

[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.340]
20th would be a little bit too much.

[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.700]
But how about the 19th?

[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.860]
How about those big old final tubes that glow real bright?

[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.600]
You know, the ones that we used to see in the transmitter or KAT, artsmith, rest in peace?

[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.140]
By the way, you'll be excited to know.

[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.040]
I was a little bit down because we, you know, I'll tell you this John Duceback from Channel 4.

[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.980]
This man is obsessed.

[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.300]
Obsessed.

[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.840]
We even came in here the other day and let him press our buttons.

[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:16.220]
And all over the TV, all you got to do is let these TV people come and press your button.

[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.540]
And man, you get all the free time you want.

[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.180]
4 was all over at Hank Testicle at Channel 6.

[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.280]
He was all over this thing.

[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.400]
One min de yeta from Channel 7.

[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:25.980]
He was here on Sunday.

[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:26.040]

[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.280]
He called by the way. He's supposed to call back.

[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:27.680]
Who did?

[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:28.260]
Ricky.

[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:28.880]
Sanchez.

[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.380]
Or Ricky Tickey.

[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.360]
Yeah.

[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.100]
That's another. It's not even worth it.

[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.900]
But at any rate, so all these other, and Channel 10, know where to be found.

[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.780]
Come to find out and left it in her will.

[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.740]
You know, and that fucking bitch.

[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:49.120]
She's another one left it in her will that anybody at Channel 10 gives neo-rodgers that fat, fat, and look who's talking sweet art.

[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.160]
Any publicity is out.

[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.540]
Is out.

[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.740]
How do you like that?

[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.340]
So from her grave, but I noticed that there's a pretty cheap mic, too, by the way.

[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.380]
Channel 10 finally made it here today. They're all here.

[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.480]
The TV people are here. You'd think that something was actually going on.

[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.960]
Then, Ellie, Brecker comes to a, if there's nothing else going on, just keep in mind.

[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.520]
We might even have to subscribe to the Harold.

[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.900]
You can always get a copy of the Harold and go for four hours nonstop on the crap that's in this paper.

[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.180]
Nonstop crap.

[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.200]
She says, says a resigned.

[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.140]
Greg, oh, he resigned.

[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.580]
No wonder he's not here this week.

[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.060]
A resigned, Greg, read QAM's Vice President General Manager.

[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.900]
He's going to carve me up. It's been a lot of discussion about stuff he thought was major that we thought was minor.

[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.200]
Everything to him is life and death. He had a lot of time on his hands.

[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.640]
Yeah, I got something on my hands. All right, Greg and eight times.

[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:36.940]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.600]
A lot of masturbation when I'm...

[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.000]
But I mean, you have minor things.

[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.460]
Minor things like, are we going to have a studio to work in that you promised?

[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.780]
You know what I mean? When somebody comes to you and makes all kinds of representations.

[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.720]
You know, come to work for me. I'm going to build your studio.

[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.520]
We're going to do this. We're going to give you all this money.

[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.840]
And then, you have to go stand on your head to get them to live up to the promises.

[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.180]
Then I guess it's only minor things.

[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.060]
You know, like nine o'clock last night we're in here frantically.

[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.500]
Are we going to go on...

[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.740]
When when douchebag from Channel 4 was here yesterday morning and I said to him,

[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.340]
I said, you know, if we go on tomorrow, it would be a miracle.

[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.360]
And it is a miracle. It's a freaking miracle, ladies and gentlemen, that were on the year here today.

[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.420]
It's one of the most astonishing things.

[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.640]
The pyramids was a piece of cake compared to this.

[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.860]
Because basically what they did was they had one guy do the job of five people.

[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.140]
And then they gave him like half the equipment, which of course wasn't bought brand new.

[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.100]
I mean, some of the real cheap stuff, yeah brand new.

[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:37.480]
But the expensive stuff came from the other Beasley stations in places like Norfolk, Virginia and Canada,

[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.680]
and Deguah, New York. Some of the big Beasley markets.

[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:44.260]
And so they shipped down to us a little bit here, a little bit there, and that was basically it.

[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.060]
So poor George Corso had to work a one-man engineering department.

[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.760]
We're going to build a statue to him.

[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.820]
Of course, the main problem is we might not be on the air long enough to finish it all depending on it damn.

[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.260]
And then we'll see what the new debt competition.

[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:04.440]
I mean, the stupid talk network, this thing, I thought seriously after Paxton, I thought I could never see any more incompetent stupid people in my life.

[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.120]
Guess what? Surprise! First I came over here.

[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.820]
And then we see what Clear Channel is doing.

[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.520]
Don't let me forget that I would do you thing. That's got to be on immediately if not sooner.

[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:21.040]
Here is the death of one of America's most unique, amazing radio stations in history.

[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:31.720]
In fact, today, in honor of WIO Dead, they came Paxton butchered it, slaughtered it, ripped it, raped it, tortured it.

[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.880]
Harry Valentine, Harry penis, Walter Sebowl, Peter Bulger, nice ass socket by the way.

[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:45.200]
You notice how Peter Bulger started with the INZ. He was with that other come, whatever the hell the name was, with the Guy Gannett.

[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:53.200]
Then he moved on to Paxton and now thank God he's still with Clear Channel as he continues sucking his way up the corporate ladder, destroying everything in his wake.

[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.780]
Pete, you're not full on anybody's sweetheart. Unfreaking believable.

[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:06.140]
So Clear Channel comes in and their infinite wisdom. They take a station that's been talked and entertainment for like the last 4,000 years and they're going to make it the news station.

[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.700]
Did you see Mike Wolf? By the way, Mike is a good guy. He's got a great voice. Good news man, Mary to the boss.

[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:18.640]
The good guy. He is, he's married to the boss. He's married to Ron a wolf. Okay, you think a Jew like her, change your name to wolf just for the hell of it?

[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:29.780]
God, get with it. But anyway, he's on the news last night explaining the new format and why they made the big swish between the IOD and INZ and about how the signal and Bapapah and then moon up your ass.

[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:35.220]
I mean, can me a break already? Well, yeah, this is the dumbest damn thing. And of course, we're not complaining.

[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:51.400]
And that stupid talk network lineup, I feel sorry for suds. I almost said Rick and suds. I don't feel sorry for Rick. Oh, sorry Rick. No, I actually to show you what a decent guy am and what a good mood. I'm in from the great time I had for several months. I even feel sorry for Rick, which is saying the hell of a lot.

[00:21:51.880 --> 00:22:03.400]
Yeah, exactly. Oh, man, is he going to be pissed? Rick, we just stole this is payback. He stole all my stuff for the last of the seven years. Why not steal one thing from his show? He's going to say we stole that too. You can have it back.

[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:33.040]
Okay, but I feel sorry for those guys following. Let's see. Four six nine hours of dead air. How'd you like to come on following nine hours of dead air? Mr. Ego doing his old tired light bulb stick. And then of course they have to explain. They have to take like a half an hour to explain. Well, if you're driving on the coast between a one a in this street, you like a twin of 1400. If you're like two blocks south to nine 40. I mean, what the hell are these people talking about? Only clear channel. They have put packs in the shame. Even though that packs a stock.

[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:52.320]
So they have put them to shame. But Paxson is a moron and he's a genius compared to the people at Clear Channel. So thank you, God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Whatever the hell is out there for getting me the hell out of there just in time. And for all those wonderful times the last seven months. You know what I'm talking about? A lot of masturbation. Why not exactly?

[00:22:52.800 --> 00:23:00.560]
Eleven after ten on five sixty QA and my first sponsor and this is great because we're always talking about food and I've got a sponsor that you're going to go nuts about.

[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.280]
Mama Mary's gourmet pizza crust. Now you can go to Italy and go all over the world and you know, at least got some pretty damn good pizza. I'm not going to lie about that.

[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:14.720]
But if you want some great tasting pizza right there at home. Now there's another another company begins with a B. I don't want to say who's with a B. Well, let Mickey Dain do that.

[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:23.740]
But you know the one I'm talking about where they make those airs on pizza crust that pretty weak. But Mama Mary's that when I first came into the studio about a month ago.

[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:32.260]
And I met with these people and they said, well, you know, they showed me the pizza crust. They have a 12 inch big one. They have got a seven inch small one. I said, I got a smaller one than that.

[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:42.340]
And they're amazing. I took them home and actually tried them. Mama Mary's pizza crusts have a no spill edge. So you put the sauce on there. You put your mozzarella and then whatever you like.

[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:49.880]
You put your pepperoni and anchovies, whatever toppings you like. Ten minutes you're ready to eat on the best pizza you've ever had right in your house, even better than delivery.

[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:57.740]
Much, much better a million times better than frozen. You will be amazed. They're faster. They're easier. They're better for you because they're made with honey and the pure ingredients instead of sugar.

[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:05.800]
And much less expensive than the competition. Like I said, you'll find two sizes to choose from the 12 inch party pizza or the seven inch personal size pizza.

[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:15.660]
And if you want to find it and believe me, you're going to love it. All you have to do is look in the deli section of your local supermarket or ask for it by name. Mama Mary's gourmet pizza crusts.

[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:32.260]
Good by I O D the memories all that's left of a station that once had been and for a and that was quite a clean or a

[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:45.040]
wet pack and were insane. To blow it all and when they build those condos and block that tower off. You'll be lowered down into your

[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:59.140]
grave and you were great at one time, but now you sound more like a signal drifting in the wind and you'll never seen

[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.040]
numbers you can sell again

[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.020]
you've heard yet clear-cattle knows what they're doing

[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.880]
so they think

[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.540]
but no one's listening anymore

[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.840]
because they really stink

[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.120]
are you sure?

[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.440]
good bye I-O-D

[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.620]

[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:30.580]
skip the pooper and the rest of that retardity

[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.980]
that remains a tax in soul regime

[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.380]
clear-cattle has a scheme

[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.940]
but it's clear to see that despite all their corporate indignits

[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:50.300]
they can't hide the facts without knew they got a crappy deal

[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.740]
and you've a great at one time

[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.700]
but now you sound more like a signal drifting in the wind

[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:08.140]
and you'll never see numbers you can sell again

[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.260]
yet clear-cattle knows what they're doing

[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.300]
so they think

[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.760]
but no one's listening anymore

[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.860]
because they really stink

[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.180]
oh thank god for clear-channel baby now you're saying take line six hello

[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.900]

[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.100]

bad thing on my part to have to be up to the way one on the air

[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.340]
but I had a call and check it out great

[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.440]

[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.860]
they're threatening us with a huge storm

[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.040]
but it's just turned out to be wind

[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.340]

[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.020]

[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.180]
here working with the salespeople for the last seven months so you're wondering

[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.220]

that said when George was saying nothing is equal said nothing is the same

[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.480]

[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:11.380]
guess what it worked it worked oh you know what I'm saying well it definitely went

[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.580]
down and the story was that I was on the way to the airport and they thought

[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.420]

[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:22.160]

[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.340]
wait till you go on but in fact I told George on the air we got a little clip

[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:29.020]
which will play eventually and you're right Tanner I am popping the piece but

[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:34.120]
it's this is you know it's the way it is who cares but at any rate I knew that

[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:38.780]
week that we were out so I boxed up all of our carts all of my CDs all my

[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:43.220]

[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.880]

[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.220]
something we just were playing that thing yesterday now I want sometime this

[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.200]
week I want somebody to call in on a show and tell me the big deal with this

[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.420]
princess Diana okay can somebody explain to me I'm in Rome it's a Sunday

[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:43.280]
morning I wake up turn on CNN international on my little uh... 13 inch TV and

[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.040]
here's this car sitting on the highway is banged up squeezed up car and I'm

[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.160]
thinking this must be an awful important car because they're like focusing on

[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.460]
this for an eternity what did you know they have accidents every day we're

[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:59.200]
like here and uh... all of a sudden the story starts unfolding it was Diana

[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.200]
but a beep but a boop and she's dead and all this other stuff what followed

[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:09.640]
for the next weeks months for an eternity for a lifetime may JFK pale into

[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.700]
insignificance in my life I have never seen such a simmiss over nothing who I

[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.480]
don't want to sound disrespectful because I would never do that right but I mean

[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.580]
what is the big deal with her what was the big story with princess Diana that

[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.420]
fucking bitch I mean did anybody really care about her before she got killed in

[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.100]
fact I think that was the best thing never happened or was the fact that she got

[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.220]
killed now all of a sudden they're having this big ceremony in the royal family

[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.280]
are making a big simmiss and a queen is there she's not in her head and saying thank

[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.600]
God you're dead you know under her breath she's muttering because they hate each other

[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:47.400]
like poison which they did and the media people you people are crazy oh that's

[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.240]
right channel tenies the right not don't take it personal but the people in the

[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.260]
media are crazy and they're spreading their sickness all over the world because

[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.980]
they got the NBC stupid channel and not affiliated with the stupid talk network

[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:02.040]
by the way and they got CNN internationally got the C NBC is all over the

[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.780]
so the sputum that they spread here in America they spread all over the world

[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:10.260]
simultaneously so they're telling the public basically what is important and

[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:14.200]
what you should be excited about and what is not and they decided for whatever

[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.440]
reason because those silly brits who still think that that brought the old

[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.880]
pair what the hell is an old pair huh I got an old pair I'm sitting on them right

[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:26.220]
now what what is an old pair is there anybody be honest with me is there anybody

[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:29.900]
in this audience who ever heard about God damn old pair before this brought up

[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.420]
there in the wingland off that little kid is there anybody nobody you did yeah

[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.240]
because you got a little bratty kid okay no you have a nice kid but you got a

[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.100]
little kid so you heard of an old pair nobody heard of no pair anymore than we

[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.380]
ever heard of Johnny Versace okay and by the way it's Gianni it's not Johnny it's

[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:50.240]
not Johnny it was a day go talk with Gianni never heard of the man in my life but

[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.500]
what was the big simmiss with Diana somebody sometime of course I'm sure

[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.720]
the landmine victims what the landmine told me the bags with the age of

[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.720]
actually touched an AIDS guy well with gloves and so on oh she a bear

[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:06.060]
handed she did a bear handed and touched them too but she kind of reminded me a

[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:11.000]
little bit of Jackie Kennedy without quite so much money you think you think she

[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.320]
had as well we'll find out they're both dead anyway what the other

[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.500]
differences are made but that's kind of what she reminded me a gold digger the

[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.780]

making any money while you were in writing okay because when you do in business with these

[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.420]

understatement that place is a turlid i mean it's it's unbelievable you can't imagine there

[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:14.720]

[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:21.460]
conditions the place is a sewer it is a festering toilet and paxon in his infinite wisdom they

[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:26.000]

[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.340]
it we'll stick it in there and they spent a fortune on all these grandiose studios and then of

[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:34.480]

have been saying that all season long they bring a guy who never coach before in his life they make

[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.580]

of work and the toil of people put in there and then of course the FCC comes along with this phrase

[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.140]

[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.880]
all gone huh yeah won't see them no mole destroyed it fast so let me see are you continuing to be a

[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:34.000]
big Wayne fan at this point or what no i think he uh-huh he has absolutely turned off virtually

[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.480]
everybody with iq larger than their penis in this town and uh it's it's scary i mean what he said

[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.020]
years ago when i turned on him and rightfully so what he said he didn't get into the uh- base ball

[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:49.360]
because he he cares about the fans he got into it for the money and he's showing us now exactly what

[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.580]
it's all about and you know what's gonna happen this mile this mildly business is the biggest

[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:58.500]
scan the biggest bunch of crap there is no group put together to buy this team why would a bunch of

[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:03.120]
people who've got you know a marginal amount of money relatively speaking buy into a thing that

[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.900]
a billionaire was losing his ass on you know what i'm saying absolutely were you were there huh were

[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:11.980]
you at the final game no i'm not a bandwagon jumper i have no interest in the marlins and i what

[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:15.900]
you know i had free tickets thank goodness from this joint but i'm not you know i gave them away

[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:19.740]
i'm not gonna go and pretend that i'm a fan because i don't really care but not because they

[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:24.160]
they became big winners and went to the theory well that's why a lot of people were there that's

[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.220]
what you're i want to remind you of something i don't know how good your memory is but you remember

[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:31.760]
when they got when the season started they got Alex Fernandez and they were singing the media oh all

[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.420]
the Cubans are gonna come out now you know on the days when Alex pitches they're gonna have 40,000

[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:40.060]
people in the stand because you know it's a Cuban it's an ethnic thing there wasn't one extra

[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:44.660]
person in the stand he had a big year till he got hurt there wasn't one extra person in the stands

[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:49.020]
Cuban or otherwise on the days when Alex Fernandez pitched it had nothing to do with that and then

[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:53.440]
all of a sudden because of this hyped up bad wagon jumping fever they get in the world series they

[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.460]
beat you know the braves and the playoffs to get in the series and now all of a sudden a leave on

[01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:01.900]
Hernandez and they're playing dominoes in dominoe park and the Cubans are hyper ventilating and they're

[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:06.660]
they're rolling back their foreskin you know i mean uh who gives a crap it's a whole theme the

[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:11.540]
whole theme of bony they were all bought i mean you talked about that a million time he bought a world

[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:16.880]
series and then he sold the town out that's why i'm predominantly not playing us way in okay you

[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.200]

[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:57.580]
and a referee and off goes the arm here's the penalty hey ref you suck it's great to have that

[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:01.680]
knowledgeable crowd out there at the arena but at least we show up we may not stay as long as we

[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:06.360]
used to which really pissed off Wayne but in fact how did it take me an hour and a half to mention

[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:11.200]
about my friend Doug McLean and in the beginning i thought well you know i was out of the country i

[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:15.180]
read it in the papers i was shocked that it happened so soon but i did predict to everyone who would

[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:20.000]
listen that he would never last the season because duggy was like crumbling from the pressure he was

[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.660]
getting psychotic with the officials the referees wouldn't even talk to him anymore and it just

[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:27.620]
seemed that the team wouldn't play for him anymore for whatever the reason that's what i thought

[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:32.120]
but then his time is going on after the initial Brian Murray game you know they'd be Boston 10 to 5

[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:37.100]
which i couldn't believe and after that and things have been really a rocky road until he's last

[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:41.860]
two road games they still can't win at home so the verdict is still out but to me dog McLean was

[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:46.820]
the scapegoat and part of this whole Wayne business as a matter of fact is that in here by the way

[01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:52.340]
oh please don't tell me it's not in here yet oh jeez it's not in there yet so like i said we'll

a uh Davey caller hello hey what's up Neil how you doing sir hey welcome back thank you um well I've

[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:15.500]
been waiting for like seven months to hear what you have to say about all the stuff that's gone down

[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:20.480]
the Kathy Lee thing and the princess die thing and finally I guess this morning I got my chance

[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:24.800]
well let me ask you am I wrong about princess diamond you know it's a tragedy when anybody dies

[01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:30.040]
but they carried on I mean if she's the most important person in the world does that explain

[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:35.120]
you why the world is as screwed up as it is oh I agree wholeheartedly they carried on I mean like

[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:39.540]
it was that with the end of any and I got swept out you couldn't help but get swept up in every

[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:47.020]
time you turn on the TV CNN every network I mean MSNBC CNBC Diana there's the car and the

[01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:52.160]
paparazzi and the stalker rotsie and the Nazi rotsie I mean what is all that what is that crap

[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:56.900]
well I guess you got a figure the only reason to keep putting it on is because people keep watching it so

[01:59:56.900 --> 02:00:01.400]
well I that's like that's like the chicken and the egg thing you know I I don't believe that I think

[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:05.520]
that you know if you force feed people enough they're gonna start eating it even if it's dog

[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:09.220]
droppings if you know put a little ketchup and mustard on it and keep sticking in front of their

[02:00:09.220 --> 02:00:14.200]
poison or start for something they might start tasting yeah I also want to agree with that guy

[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:20.480]

boy am i glad the folks from the herald are there that's why i'm calling i just cannot understand

[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:36.680]
why the uh... herald moved the editorial pages a few pages in instead of the last couple of pages

[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:42.280]
of section a that happened while you were off the air and i just don't know why they did it i couldn't

[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:46.400]
figure it out that is that something new with the herald yet what they did was the

[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:51.260]
the they they used to be not the back page of section a but what they did was they took the editorial

[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:57.580]
pages which used to be on the second to last page in the third to last page but let me let me just

[02:09:57.580 --> 02:10:02.000]
say that to me no let me say this it's one more good reason not to buy the herald let me tell you

[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.860]

[02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:57.820]
Who am I finger now?

[02:24:58.320 --> 02:24:59.580]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:03.040]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:04.800]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:06.500]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:08.260]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:10.020]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:10.660 --> 02:25:13.000]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:14.340]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:15.660]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:17.820]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:19.140]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:19.380 --> 02:25:20.520]
Who am I finger now?

[02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:21.240]
Who?

[02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:25.620]
256 and 560, QAM.

[02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:26.840]
Let's go to Miami.

[02:25:27.140 --> 02:25:27.420]
Hello.

[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:30.500]
Jesus, Neil Christ.

[02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:32.780]
You're back.

[02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:33.680]
That's right.

[02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:34.420]
Oh man.

[02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:36.480]
It is so great to end.

[02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:37.540]
It was worth the hold.

[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:41.540]
I got to say from one Julio to your great.

[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:44.240]
You're great to have back.

[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:46.640]
One thing about me, I'm going to give up on Edmoticity.

[02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:49.080]
But I'm so God damn good that it scares the hell out of me.

[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:51.240]
And it scared me when I saw you on Channel 7 with men.

[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:52.000]
It is scary, yeah.

[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:53.720]
Mantechia, Mendelletta.

[02:25:53.900 --> 02:25:54.080]
See?

[02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:59.480]
It was great to see you again, puffing on a cigar and alive.

[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:01.160]
Always got something around in my purse.

[02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:01.820]
Alive.

[02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:05.580]
I'm sad to hear that you're walking around in pain on your vacation.

[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:07.000]
But man, don't let them have you back.

[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.960]
Don't buy any magnetic bracelets and he wouldn't nickels.

[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:12.140]
Just stay away from your proctologist.

[02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:13.160]
You know what's another scam?

[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:15.740]
Now that you mentioned magnets, that court.

[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:20.440]
You know that they were pushing that courts around, that metal, that bracelet that you wore with court.

[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:21.180]
Oh yeah.

[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:24.940]
Well thank God that the old Cuban women don't fall for that scam.

[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:29.680]
My grandmother had, you know, she's religious on all that stuff and she had one and she threw it away six months later.

[02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:30.140]
It didn't work.

[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:30.700]
All right.

[02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:32.180]
Let's hear it for grandma.

[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:33.320]
She's the best.

[02:26:33.420 --> 02:26:34.040]
And you are too.

[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:35.960]
So Neil, I'm glad to have you back.

[02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:37.680]
And Neil Crystal.

[02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:38.420]
All right.

[02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:40.180]
How do you like that boy?

[02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:41.340]
The Julio's are out of control.

[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:42.780]
The Neil Roger's show.

[02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:46.500]
Now on Sports Radio 560 WQAM.

[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:47.980]
Miami for Flutterdale.

[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:49.000]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:50.380]
Neil.

[02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:51.000]
Yes sir.

[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:52.580]
Oh God man.

[02:26:52.820 --> 02:26:55.580]
I've been trying to talk to you for a long time.

[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:56.500]
Well here we go.

[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:57.140]
Okay, I'm sorry.

[02:26:57.140 --> 02:26:57.980]
Let's make it real long.

[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:00.800]
I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Radius.

[02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:02.740]
He's my brother.

[02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:03.480]
He's in Colorado.

[02:27:03.620 --> 02:27:05.400]
He looked with his boyfriend, is that it?

[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:06.860]
No, his wife and three kids.

[02:27:06.860 --> 02:27:08.300]
His wife, three kids and his boyfriend.

[02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:09.200]
He's not okay at all, you know.

[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:09.560]
Yeah.

[02:27:09.900 --> 02:27:11.020]
You made him wear...

[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:11.800]
He was for Carbell.

[02:27:11.980 --> 02:27:13.500]
He brought you a cake and you guys brought it.

[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:14.360]
Boy, yeah, absolutely.

[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:15.500]
I know all about it.

[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:15.960]
I know all about it.

[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:19.480]
I'm telling you show today because he begged me on his knees to...

[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:20.160]
He'll record it.

[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:21.520]
But he was on his knees when he begged you.

[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:21.840]
Yeah, he did.

[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:22.560]
I hope you said no.

[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:24.400]
I hope you said no man.

[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:24.600]

[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:26.040]
You know, the things that he's going around these days.

[02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:28.040]
Yeah, I tried to stay away from him even though.

[02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:28.580]
Yeah.

[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:31.920]
Man, I'm glad to have you back.

[02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:33.720]
I'm glad you back.

[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:35.400]
You're not the wife and kids but you kind of wonder.

[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:39.000]
One big surprise if he calls you from Colorado.

[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:40.380]
He's skiing over there.

[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:41.920]
Uh-huh, he's skiing over there.

[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:43.380]
I don't doubt that.

[02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:44.460]
Okay, amigo.

[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:45.940]
Hey, listen, Neil.

[02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:48.360]
I just want to say something about the dolphin.

[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:50.580]
There's nothing wrong with Marino.

[02:27:51.180 --> 02:27:53.120]
We just need a good distance.

[02:27:53.340 --> 02:27:54.140]
I mean, a good oce.

[02:27:54.420 --> 02:27:54.680]
Yeah.

[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:56.240]
Get rid of Gary Stevens.

[02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:56.720]
Right.

[02:27:57.120 --> 02:27:57.760]
Now you're talking.

[02:27:57.900 --> 02:27:59.320]
Now you're talking my language, pal.

[02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:01.040]
Get downstruck back in here.

[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:01.900]
He's the man.

[02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:02.860]
All right.

[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:03.660]
Downstruck.

[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:06.060]
I hope Jimmy's listening to his show.

[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:07.220]
Well, he's the man.

[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:07.720]
Okay.

[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:08.480]
That's what you need.

[02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:09.780]
Jimmy is listening right now.

[02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:10.560]
Hey, Neil.

[02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:12.060]
Many, many shows.

[02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:12.820]
I wish you, man.

[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:13.480]
Hasta luego.

[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:14.540]
Oh, that was Suarez.

[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:14.920]
Okay.

[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:16.340]
He can't keep it together.

[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:19.120]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 5, 6, 7.

[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:23.680]
And like I said, only Xavier Suarez could make Joe Carrroyo look good in retrospect.

[02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:28.820]
The only man on the face of the earth who could make us appreciate the dearly departed Joe Carrroyo.

[02:28:30.020 --> 02:28:31.660]
Here's a lady in Del Rey Beach.

[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:31.980]
Hello.

[02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:32.900]
Yeah.

[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:34.160]
This is Nettie and Ron.

[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:36.440]
You're a senior citizen fan of Del Rey Beach.

[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:36.940]
All right.

[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:38.460]
We're so happy you're back.

[02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:40.560]
The best of everything, too, you.

[02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:41.460]
Thank you, sweetheart.

[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:41.980]
Okay.

[02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:42.440]
Goodbye.

[02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:43.300]
Have a happy.

[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:44.400]
Bye-bye.

[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:45.280]
I do like that.

[02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:46.840]
All the old parts are out there listening.

[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.040]
Of course, they won't write it down, but there's nothing we can do about that.

[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:50.200]
Plus those 80 plus demos.

[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:51.520]
Don't mean too much anyway.

[02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:52.680]
But we appreciate it very much.

[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:53.340]
You have no idea.

[02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:54.420]
I threw a L.

[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:54.960]
What's your name?

[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:56.920]
Ellie, a Brecher's tongue in a waist basket.

[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:00.060]
So if anybody wonders why she ain't speaking too much,

[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:04.080]
she actually brought me a little public sack with a tongue in it.

[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:09.180]
There's nothing wrong with little tongue, but I sure don't want it from Ellie.

[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:10.380]
I'll guarantee you that right now.

[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:12.920]
Here's Chris the cop.

[02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:14.120]
Boy, all the cops are out there.

[02:29:14.220 --> 02:29:14.740]
How you doing, Chris?

[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:15.280]
Cut Neil.

[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:16.080]
Welcome back.

[02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:16.540]
Thank you.

[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:20.540]
From all of your friendly highway pigs, a horny welcome back.

[02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:23.160]
Well, I bet you the porkers have really been Jones in for seven months, huh?

[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:24.800]
We got nothing to do with Dr. Carr Coffee.

[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:25.400]
Need our donuts.

[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:26.440]
Now we got no back.

[02:29:26.460 --> 02:29:26.460]

[02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:28.940]
But the public is pissed because now you got back in those seven months,

[02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:30.220]
you had a lot more time to write those tickets.

[02:29:30.220 --> 02:29:30.900]
He better be careful.

[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:32.260]
It's the end of the month and you know what that means.

[02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:32.500]
Right.

[02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:34.780]
But the house fat rich doing stainless roll,

[02:29:34.900 --> 02:29:35.420]
I ain't seen them.

[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:36.020]
We'll go to a reasonable one.

[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:37.820]
He just left with a stool.

[02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:40.480]
One of our gold stains, 20 pound boxes of special case.

[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:43.180]
So I have a feeling if you feel the earth move, it won't be an earthquake.

[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:43.900]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:44.640]
I'll find out.

[02:29:44.860 --> 02:29:45.460]
He has great time.

[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:45.780]
You back.

[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:47.000]
The midday guys.

[02:29:47.140 --> 02:29:48.260]
I got two words.

[02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:49.220]
They suck.

[02:29:49.740 --> 02:29:50.380]
Welcome back.

[02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:51.140]
Thanks, Pat.

[02:29:51.380 --> 02:29:51.960]
See you, Chris.

[02:29:52.660 --> 02:29:53.560]
I wonder what he meant by that.

[02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:56.700]
He's 60 and pound five, 60.

[02:29:56.820 --> 02:29:57.800]
Bokeh brands walking around.

[02:29:57.860 --> 02:29:59.520]
He hasn't got a steep press yet, but he's working on it.

[02:29:59.940 --> 02:30:00.120]
Okay.

[02:30:00.200 --> 02:30:03.780]
I got to play the, you told me, but I don't know what's, what is it called?

[02:30:04.620 --> 02:30:05.120]
Harry's lament.

[02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:06.040]
Harry's penis.

[02:30:06.200 --> 02:30:07.040]
Your channel collective.

[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:09.680]
What does that mean?

[02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:11.640]
That's the one that I have in my country.

[02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:12.480]
I'm Harry Valentine.

[02:30:12.940 --> 02:30:15.620]
Your new program director for WIOD.

[02:30:15.980 --> 02:30:19.440]
And I'm here to tell you that with the new packed in management in place,

[02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:23.460]
we feel we no longer need a talent such as Neil Rogers.

[02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:28.780]
But we do have some very exciting changes in store for you here at WIOD

[02:30:28.780 --> 02:30:33.400]
that we believe will emulate the enormous success of our Orlando stations.

[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:34.860]
And John.

[02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:35.460]

[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:36.060]
John.

[02:30:36.740 --> 02:30:36.920]
Yeah.

[02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:39.100]
You can stop rubbing my legs now.

[02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:39.580]
Okay.

[02:30:40.060 --> 02:30:40.320]
Yes.

[02:30:40.940 --> 02:30:42.660]
You did a fine job down there.

[02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:44.580]
Oh, there's no doubt about it in my mind.

[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:46.320]
In fact, you know what I think I'll do?

[02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:46.660]
What?

[02:30:46.820 --> 02:30:50.580]
Oh, I think I'll make you the creative services director.

[02:30:50.700 --> 02:30:51.520]
How's that sound?

[02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:51.880]
Wow.

[02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:52.360]
Great.

[02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:54.500]
Hey, how about those old jingles?

[02:30:54.660 --> 02:30:56.180]
Pretty funny stuff, huh?

[02:30:56.320 --> 02:30:56.520]
Yes.

[02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:56.980]
Yes.

[02:30:57.140 --> 02:30:57.860]
Very funny.

[02:31:00.060 --> 02:31:01.160]
You know what, John?

[02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:01.460]
Yeah.

[02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:04.460]
In a couple of hours, you'll have a year's worth of production done.

[02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:04.740]
Yeah.

[02:31:04.980 --> 02:31:07.860]
Oh, well, looks like I'm going to hit the garage for another smoke.

[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:10.120]
Nice call, man.

[02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:11.700]
They don't make them anymore like that.

[02:31:11.700 --> 02:31:12.220]
Harry's penis.

[02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:12.880]
I'll tell you that.

[02:31:12.940 --> 02:31:14.020]
I wonder where the hell he wound up.

[02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:17.060]
I wonder what AA meeting he's at this week, huh?

[02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:18.140]
Boy, oh boy.

[02:31:18.220 --> 02:31:20.720]
Do they know how to pick him at Paxton at the John M?

[02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:26.980]
And Walter Sabo and Harry Valentine all cut out of the same cookie cutter.

[02:31:28.060 --> 02:31:28.600]
Wow.

[02:31:29.100 --> 02:31:29.720]
Another winner.

[02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:32.420]
What is that?

[02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:38.520]
I think the second and third decks are tying away before our ears.

[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:38.980]
Okay.

[02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:40.300]
Thank you, Beasley folks.

[02:31:40.500 --> 02:31:41.100]
George Beasley.

[02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:44.460]
The only guy could send you like a $4 cart machine for $600 bucks.

[02:31:45.780 --> 02:31:46.320]
Dead.

[02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:47.660]
Dead isn't a door-neil.

[02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:49.620]
No, be young.

[02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:51.700]
Well, I didn't take it personally, Roby.

[02:31:51.800 --> 02:31:53.260]
Well, I guess it won't make any difference now.

[02:31:54.140 --> 02:31:56.120]
Why are we sure following a bucket of crap there?

[02:31:56.200 --> 02:31:56.400]
Didn't we?

[02:31:56.780 --> 02:31:57.460]
All right, Roby.

[02:31:57.900 --> 02:31:58.260]
Bring them back.

[02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:00.600]
They're going to put him on the stupid talk network, by the way.

[02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:02.140]
Most of their hosts are dead anyway.

[02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:04.180]
Here's the show, Shurar.

[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:04.860]
Here's Miami.

[02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:05.240]
Hello.

[02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:06.540]
Hello.

[02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:07.180]
Yes, sir.

[02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:08.360]
Welcome back, Neil.

[02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:08.920]
Thank you.

[02:32:09.060 --> 02:32:11.460]
It's been hell without you.

[02:32:11.620 --> 02:32:11.900]
You're right.

[02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:12.680]
Oh, man.

[02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:13.960]
Sure was hell for me, man.

[02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:15.320]
Having had good time for seven months.

[02:32:15.500 --> 02:32:17.580]
Taking a nice big fat paycheck every week.

[02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:18.020]
Oh, yeah.

[02:32:18.020 --> 02:32:18.900]
That's super talk.

[02:32:19.020 --> 02:32:20.500]
Looking like getting a big fat one every week.

[02:32:20.700 --> 02:32:21.660]
That's an oxy moron.

[02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:21.960]
Yep.

[02:32:22.580 --> 02:32:23.480]
Well, just a call.

[02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:24.660]
Welcome back, Neil.

[02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:25.440]
Great show.

[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:26.120]
Thank you.

[02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:28.580]
Okay, Shuritan Sweet.

[02:32:29.020 --> 02:32:30.740]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, like kind of like Ray Whitney.

[02:32:30.980 --> 02:32:31.380]
Shuritan Sweet.

[02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:33.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:35.400]
5, 4, I can't wait for that game tonight, man.

[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.820]
That San Jose game, Mudder Grudge Max.

[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.100]
The Panthers are going to kick their ass or else.

[02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:40.980]
Tonight's the night.

[02:32:41.060 --> 02:32:42.100]
No more excuses, man.

[02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:45.660]
And that Fitsy, who rhymes with something else that starts with an S in an H.

[02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:47.040]
Fitsy, bad attitude.

[02:32:47.140 --> 02:32:48.260]
Looks like he's on a way out.

[02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:49.560]
None too soon.

[02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:51.680]
Here's a mobile in Aventura.

[02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:52.160]
Hello.

[02:32:52.980 --> 02:32:54.880]
Neil, I've been on home for seven months.

[02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:55.980]
So good to hear you.

[02:32:56.260 --> 02:32:58.000]
How about that Latrine Spiewell, by the way?

[02:32:58.040 --> 02:32:59.160]
We forgot to talk about that.

[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:00.180]
What a guy.

[02:33:00.500 --> 02:33:00.640]
Yeah.

[02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:02.160]
I just want to welcome you back.

[02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:03.060]
I can do digs up here.

[02:33:03.060 --> 02:33:04.720]
I'm going to have one of the ones who tried that on Greg Reed

[02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:06.060]
if he ever shows up in town again.

[02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:06.660]
Yes, sir.

[02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:08.620]
And you got a nice place there.

[02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:09.720]
A nice board.

[02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:10.500]
Fine.

[02:33:10.820 --> 02:33:12.020]
All great stuff.

[02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:12.900]
You're right.

[02:33:13.060 --> 02:33:14.700]
Except for the old Beasley discards.

[02:33:14.700 --> 02:33:15.660]
Everything else is great.

[02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:16.300]
There you go.

[02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:17.060]
Well, welcome back.

[02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:18.080]
It's good to hear you, voice.

[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:19.140]
Neil and Whitney.

[02:33:19.480 --> 02:33:19.840]
God.

[02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:20.580]
Thank you.

[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.260]
Excellent company to be in.

[02:33:22.660 --> 02:33:23.780]
By the way, Ray Whitney is engaged.

[02:33:23.980 --> 02:33:25.660]
I was asking Rima about that last night.

[02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:26.720]
Is Ray Whitney married yet?

[02:33:26.780 --> 02:33:28.040]
And he said he's engaged in any minute.

[02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:28.940]
But it's not too late.

[02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:32.000]
Here's Miami Springs.

[02:33:32.300 --> 02:33:32.500]
Hello.

[02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:34.740]
Miami Springs.

[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:36.200]
Going once.

[02:33:36.900 --> 02:33:37.520]
Going twice.

[02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:38.300]
I know they're on there.

[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:40.580]
But we got a little bit of difficulty on the phone thing.

[02:33:40.700 --> 02:33:41.640]
We got one line not working.

[02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:42.300]
They can't hear us.

[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:42.860]
I can't hear them.

[02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:44.220]
But hey, it's only a radio show.

[02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:44.680]
Who cares?

[02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:45.540]
Let's take the money.

[02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:46.720]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:47.080]
Hello.

[02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:48.100]
Hi.

[02:33:48.380 --> 02:33:48.880]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:49.120]
Betty.

[02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:50.140]
And welcome you back.

[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:50.740]
Hi, Betty.

[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:54.280]
I'm on behalf of Roger who's sitting on the beach listening to you.

[02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:55.460]
He couldn't wait for you to get back to you.

[02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:55.840]
Hey, Roger.

[02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:56.740]
How are you doing, Roger?

[02:33:56.980 --> 02:33:57.680]
How are you doing, maybe?

[02:33:57.900 --> 02:33:58.180]
He's nice.

[02:33:58.180 --> 02:34:00.980]
Hello to you all the time at the Panther Games.

[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:02.240]
And go Panthers.

[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:02.880]
Now, wait a minute.

[02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:04.120]
Roger is not...

[02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:04.980]
This is not...

[02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:05.380]
Oh, God.

[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:07.380]
He's not the one that's Brian Scroodlin's former neighbor.

[02:34:07.660 --> 02:34:07.880]
No.

[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:08.720]
Oh, thank God.

[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:10.860]
By the way, that guy is listening.

[02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:12.300]
Brian Scroodlin's former neighbor.

[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:13.760]
I get the same message.

[02:34:13.860 --> 02:34:15.860]
You don't have to come and say hi to me before the game tonight.

[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:18.200]
And tell me the same thing about your wife is sitting over there,

[02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:18.780]
or wait for your wife.

[02:34:19.020 --> 02:34:19.680]
And she's scared of me.

[02:34:19.940 --> 02:34:20.520]
Nice seeing you.

[02:34:20.580 --> 02:34:21.020]
Go away.

[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:22.380]
You know what he said to you.

[02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:27.020]
He came up to you when I said, uh, Neil, there's X amount of days until you're back on the year.

[02:34:27.060 --> 02:34:27.180]
Right.

[02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:29.020]
He was one of the first ones that said it to you.

[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:29.260]
Excellent.

[02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:30.020]
Thank you.

[02:34:30.020 --> 02:34:31.240]
At least you got a boyfriend who can count.

[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:31.700]
That's a good thing.

[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:32.880]
That's a plus.

[02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:33.600]
Okay, sweetheart.

[02:34:33.620 --> 02:34:33.900]
Thanks.

[02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:34.880]
Thank you so much.

[02:34:35.580 --> 02:34:36.080]
There she goes.

[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:37.840]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10.

[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:39.220]
Okay, I forgot to give our facts number out.

[02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:41.260]
Thank God, because that saved us a lot of money on that paper.

[02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:45.740]
But our facts number, we do have our own facts line, which is a major,

[02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:47.160]
major accomplishment here.

[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:49.020]
Thank God the beesleys don't know about that yet.

[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.120]
It's, uh, oh, you know what else I have forgotten about Bill?

[02:34:53.980 --> 02:34:55.880]
We're on in Fort Myers now, right?

[02:34:56.080 --> 02:34:58.580]
On the, um, on that margin, we think so.

[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:04.100]
We're on a station over there that is so marginal that even if we were on the year,

[02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:06.340]
even the beesleys people don't know if we're on the year.

[02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:09.220]
That's how my, it might be that old WWCN member George,

[02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:11.400]
770 that we're on for about five minutes.

[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:14.000]
That was a boy-guarri idea back in the good old days.

[02:35:14.020 --> 02:35:16.620]
I think we got three calls from over there from the people on to the age of a hundred,

[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.300]
who weren't, uh, who weren't parking their account.

[02:35:19.860 --> 02:35:23.240]
But at any rate, we might be on WWCN or some station in Fort Myers,

[02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:26.320]
which I don't think they can call us on these lines, but wouldn't that be an exciting,

[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:27.180]
a momentous thing.

[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:33.720]
But our facts number is 305-Urea code 650-198.

[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:36.680]
305-650-198.

[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:40.420]
So if you want to set us a facts and, uh, yeah, I got one from Brian Andrews.

[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:44.760]
She's floating around over there at Channel 7 and says,

[02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:46.320]
hey, Neil, great to hear you back on here.

[02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:46.920]
Wish you all the best.

[02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:49.100]
You're a friend in theplex, Brian Andrews.

[02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:51.160]
Nice going. Nice hearing from you, Brian. Good guy.

[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:54.140]
Little strange, but aren't we all? Okay, that's why we're in broadcasting.

[02:35:55.460 --> 02:35:57.560]
Here's, uh, Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[02:35:58.560 --> 02:35:59.500]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:01.700]
How you doing? How you doing, buddy?

[02:36:01.700 --> 02:36:02.120]
Great.

[02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:06.060]
Just got to have you back, man. Get, uh, got tired of listening to Zeta.

[02:36:06.860 --> 02:36:07.760]
I don't blame you.

[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:11.980]
Yeah. One more thing. I need to hear a bound move, man.

[02:36:12.180 --> 02:36:15.960]
Otherwise, something else might happen, man. Still a capability.

[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:16.860]
Uh-huh.

[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:19.800]
I might just, I might just do it, you know?

[02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:21.340]
I just want to make it through.

[02:36:21.380 --> 02:36:22.160]
You know what I'm right now.

[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:23.180]
Got no more chairs.

[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:25.920]
Okay. Thanks a million, pal. See ya.

[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:29.760]
Okay, 567-05. So let me ask you, Neil, are you really still, uh, yeah?

[02:36:30.140 --> 02:36:32.780]
Okay, let's go to a lady in Miami. Hello.

[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:34.360]
Hello. Yes, ma'am.

[02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:37.980]
Oh, my goodness. I've been jonesing for you for seven months now.

[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:39.180]
Here you go. Go to Shoei.

[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:41.040]
I'm the best things in life I've worth waiting for.

[02:36:41.180 --> 02:36:42.200]
I'm just having a great time.

[02:36:42.260 --> 02:36:42.600]
Like, great Whitney.

[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:47.000]
I kicked my, uh, little portable radio into the doctors off side.

[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:50.660]
I take my son to the doctor and he always hates that because I sit there and snicker and chuckle

[02:36:50.660 --> 02:36:52.500]
and nobody knows that I'm laughing at. Uh-huh.

[02:36:52.580 --> 02:36:53.660]
It's great. Get him all a radio.

[02:36:53.860 --> 02:36:55.420]
Your doctor's not a proctologist, is he?

[02:36:55.420 --> 02:36:59.360]
No, this is a back specialist, my kid has a ruptured disc. He plays hockey.

[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:01.660]
Really? Yes, he does.

[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:03.140]
Great. Get those kids out there.

[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:08.380]
Hey, listen, last, uh, you keep, by the time he, you know, every time he gets transported to the hospital

[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:10.920]
across from Pine's Isher in, and they know him by name.

[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:14.820]
They're going to put a new wing on that hospital. It's got two blocks from the Isher in.

[02:37:14.820 --> 02:37:17.060]
In fact, we might have to sign them up all depending on how things go.

[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:20.940]
If we don't win a home game pretty soon, the Panthers may have to sign them up.

[02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:23.020]
He's ready. I can have them suited up in an hour.

[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:23.380]
Okay.

[02:37:23.380 --> 02:37:26.680]
I got a number nine. I already got his uniform number nine.

[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:28.700]
What is your seat number at the arena?

[02:37:29.080 --> 02:37:33.780]
I am in section 106 in roll R in the seat seven.

[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:37.060]
I have gone and, you know, we sat there and everybody else is looking at the game.

[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:38.960]
I'm looking in the stands trying to find you.

[02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:39.840]
Well, there I am.

[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:40.800]
I'm so glad you're there.

[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:42.520]
And I'll be there tonight. I'll be there bright and early.

[02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:43.880]
Oh, have a great game.

[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:44.840]
Thank you. We'll see you tonight.

[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:45.660]
Bye-bye. Bye.

[02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:47.720]
Yeah, I'll be there into these potfans.

[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:50.820]
Breathe in a big sigh. We leave having ripped him and ask too much today yet.

[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:55.180]
And of course, some of the other people, I mean, you know, I don't have a personal problem with Denise.

[02:37:55.380 --> 02:38:00.500]
There are other people who do, but, you know, I can't, I can't find other people's battles for them on this show.

[02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:02.460]
There are other people that want to develop a small pair.

[02:38:02.860 --> 02:38:05.160]
Be my guest. Go ahead. Have a great life. Do your thing.

[02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:08.820]
But don't expect me to start coming on a year and talking about Denise, potfan,

[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:11.500]
and talking about the fact that he contributes nothing to the broadcast.

[02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:13.580]
He has nothing to say. It's a dumb frog.

[02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:17.320]
Far be it for me to say those things because Denise is my buddy to my face.

[02:38:17.980 --> 02:38:19.380]
And never the twain shall meet.

[02:38:19.380 --> 02:38:20.940]
What do you want from a frog anyway?

[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:26.240]
It's 109. 109 already? God, it seems like we only been here for what? 15, 20 hours.

[02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:30.980]
You know, I'll tell you, these first shows or anniversary shows, any of these like special events,

[02:38:30.980 --> 02:38:32.700]
which thank God don't happen in this time much.

[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:36.780]
But these things are draining, especially after seven months of a life of luxury.

[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:40.680]
Get up in the morning whenever you feel like it until your dog wants to start peeing on the floor.

[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:43.360]
Then you know it's time to get up. But I mean, this is the way to go.

[02:38:44.220 --> 02:38:45.860]
This is a preview of retirement.

[02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:52.000]
The only thing is lurking in the back of your mind at all times knowing that you have to come back to work at a certain time.

[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:54.180]
There's a little something missing there.

[02:38:54.900 --> 02:38:59.820]
But once you got a few bucks stashed away, these people would say, wow, I don't know about this retirement.

[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:00.980]
I'd be bored to death.

[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:04.160]
Get a life, get a clue man.

[02:39:04.300 --> 02:39:10.740]
They'd be bored to death like Dick Clark and that other Dick Ed McMahon are running around ringing people's goddamn doorbells.

[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:12.960]
What is the story with them already? Get a life.

[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:16.920]
The two of them have got enough money to buy Ed enough booze to last a year, 2500.

[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:19.540]
And Dick Clark to get a facelift.

[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:22.700]
By the way, looking pretty old. Thank God we like you Dick.

[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:24.620]
But thank God he's starting to age rapidly.

[02:39:24.660 --> 02:39:29.220]
He's making up for about those 30 years when he looked the same when Steve Cain's surgery was working good on his push.

[02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:31.160]
Give him a Steve's number, will you?

[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:33.960]
10 after one on 560 QAN.

[02:39:34.220 --> 02:39:37.400]
Are you feeling lucky? Hollywood Seminole Gaming opened in 1979.

[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:43.460]

That's 954961-3220.

[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:40.160]
Are you feeling lucky?

[02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:43.100]
This is 560 QAM.

[02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:46.380]
Get back my bags, Las Vegas.

[02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:48.380]
Elton John has them enables to get out of the studio.

[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:49.940]
He's back there again with his.

[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:51.760]
They're dropping like flies album.

[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.300]
A tribute to John Denver.

[02:40:53.540 --> 02:40:54.600]
You'll hear that classic.

[02:40:54.820 --> 02:40:56.320]
I'm dying in a prop plane.

[02:40:56.760 --> 02:40:58.220]
Goodbye, Rocky Mountain Road.

[02:40:58.220 --> 02:41:04.260]
Hello, this is Elton John, an LBE studio to record other tribute records.

[02:41:04.460 --> 02:41:06.640]
That's right, look for a good buy FDR.

[02:41:07.100 --> 02:41:08.340]
And a candle in the Kremlin.

[02:41:08.820 --> 02:41:10.080]
A tribute to Joseph Stalin.

[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:11.560]
Elton John's tribute album.

[02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:14.280]
They're dropping like flies on sale now.

[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:22.120]
Okay, good time to give lots of credit to the FBI, the Miami Beach Police, for a great job on E. Kunanan and business over there with Gianni Versace Man.

[02:41:22.580 --> 02:41:24.080]
Great job, really alerted the community.

[02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:26.940]
They knew he was in town for like weeks and weeks before the murder.

[02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:31.420]
And well, they were handing out flyers in the bag bar so they said bull crap, baby.

[02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:32.960]
They dropped the ball.

[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:35.740]
How come this guy was one of the 10 most wanted on the FBI list?

[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:42.240]
Why was his picture not on the front page of the Harold, the Diario De las, whatever that fact Spanish paper is?

[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:43.760]
And the Sun Sentinel.

[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:46.700]
Nobody knew he was here except the FBI and the police.

[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:51.700]
And then of course, you notice like three or four days ago they did this thing where they changed the way they on the pawn shops.

[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:54.760]
And they had to change the way they do that and they actually have a computer.

[02:41:54.760 --> 02:42:01.200]
They must, the Miami Beach police must be run by the Beasley people because they just don't believe money in spending money for equipment.

[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:03.600]
Okay, no, we don't want to have no computers in here.

[02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:06.160]
It takes us a few weeks and then of course maybe the guy got out of time.

[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:08.660]
He gives them his, signs his real name.

[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:10.240]
Here's El Pasaporto.

[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:11.280]
Here's the whole thing.

[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:12.240]
This is who I am.

[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:13.240]
Come take me away.

[02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:18.520]
Ah, we haven't got around to it yet because we haven't the Texas days to get to that pile of crap over there.

[02:42:18.820 --> 02:42:19.980]
Besides, he was only killing fags.

[02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:20.720]
That's true.

[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:21.280]
That's a good point.

[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:23.540]
He was only killing fags except that Kylie, Miglin and Chicago.

[02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:24.360]
He was no fag.

[02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:24.900]
We don't think.

[02:42:25.060 --> 02:42:28.060]
And they carried the guy, the undertaker there in the Jersey.

[02:42:28.060 --> 02:42:28.800]
He was no fag.

[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:29.320]
We don't think.

[02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:32.720]
So I mean, you know, we don't think but you never know.

[02:42:32.860 --> 02:42:34.260]
You know what those undertakers do out there.

[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:35.760]
Those dark cemeteries lay at night.

[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:36.340]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:36.720]
Exactly.

[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:38.840]
So watch out for them.

[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:40.440]
Look at what Quasimodo did.

[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:43.820]
Anyway, it's 115 and we'll let's better not look at what Quasimodo did.

[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:46.000]
Welcome back, Neil, from Juliet, Chronic Juliet.

[02:42:46.220 --> 02:42:48.060]
Missed you, can't call him on the swish board at work.

[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:49.000]
Thank you, Juliet.

[02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:49.960]
That's for you.

[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:52.220]
Facts is ought to be pouring in, aren't they pouring in?

[02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:53.940]
Pouring?

[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:54.340]
They are.

[02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:56.000]
They're dribbling.

[02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:56.680]
They're kind of like me.

[02:42:56.840 --> 02:42:59.880]
They're dribbling in 305, 650, 0198.

[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:01.300]
I should have given that up the beginning of the show.

[02:43:01.340 --> 02:43:04.240]
We could have wasted a lot of paper and spent lots and lots of their money,

[02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:05.120]
which I'm going to be doing.

[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:07.320]
Here's one from Barbara Cabrera.

[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:08.540]
Oh, Barbara Cabrera.

[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:12.080]
You know, Barbara, from La Prensa, the yummy.

[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:13.420]
A real Juliet.

[02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:16.040]
Wishing you the best and your newest endeavor at QA.

[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:17.360]
Thank God you are back.

[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:20.560]
Theos Mio, she says, have missed you in Jorge Laquiel.

[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:21.400]
Love you, Boca.

[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:22.180]
Thank you, Barbara.

[02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:23.160]
We love you, sweetheart.

[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:24.440]
God, do we love her.

[02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:25.000]
Here they come.

[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:26.640]
Here come the facts and screw the callers.

[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:28.260]
Here's...

[02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:28.900]
Oh, yeah.

[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:30.900]
Oh, this is from Barbara La Prensa.

[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.580]
She's got the horoscopes.

[02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:33.700]
Let's see.

[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:35.140]
What does it do for...

[02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:37.280]
Oh, Scorpio's not on the list, so I guess I don't count.

[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:38.180]
Thanks a lot, Barbara.

[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:39.220]
Like I said, I take it back.

[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:40.300]
Here's Miami.

[02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:40.660]
Hello.

[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:41.880]
Oh, yeah, Neil.

[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:42.400]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:45.900]
You know, I sell magnets and the problem with the heel.

[02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:47.620]
They gave you the wrong magnets.

[02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:49.660]
Now, I have a set here.

[02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.180]
It's in support of the story.

[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:52.320]
It's reusable.

[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:54.360]
And it's reusable after bowel movements.

[02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:55.280]
Can I take your order?

[02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:56.680]
It's reusable, what?

[02:43:56.920 --> 02:43:58.960]
After it's in suppository form.

[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:00.740]
You use it...

[02:44:00.740 --> 02:44:03.160]
It's reusable after bowel movements.

[02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:04.760]
I'd like to take your order.

[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:06.020]
Okay, how many...

[02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:07.840]
I'll give you my proctologist's address.

[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:08.740]
You send him right over.

[02:44:10.220 --> 02:44:10.740]
56670560.

[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:11.540]
Here's Scorpio.

[02:44:11.540 --> 02:44:15.940]
It says, the worst of the lot, you are shrewd in business and cannot be trusted.

[02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:20.200]
You shall achieve the pinnacle of success because of your total lack of ethics.

[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:21.640]
You are a perfect son of a bitch.

[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:24.260]
Oh, I see this is all a comedy thing from Barbara.

[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:27.240]
I thought this was like a real horrendous like a terminal.

[02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:29.260]
It is kind of terminal, Barbara, but we love you anyway.

[02:44:30.460 --> 02:44:30.820]
Here's...

[02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:32.240]
How come no one is flashing on here?

[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:32.840]
Oh, I see.

[02:44:32.940 --> 02:44:33.840]
It's a lady in Key West.

[02:44:34.240 --> 02:44:34.460]
Hello.

[02:44:35.980 --> 02:44:36.960]
Lady in Key West.

[02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:37.840]
Hi there.

[02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:38.700]
How you be doing?

[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:41.300]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Neil.

[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:41.900]
How's that?

[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:43.480]
Everyone's keeping you so happy.

[02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:44.580]
It's so heavy back.

[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:46.260]
Even with a bag like me at work, sir.

[02:44:46.820 --> 02:44:47.540]
Oh, easy.

[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:47.920]

[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:49.620]
All that holiday food, you know.

[02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:50.160]
Yeah.

[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:51.760]
I just can't help it.

[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:54.160]
That was a better way to pardon me.

[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:56.920]
I have a question for you.

[02:44:57.140 --> 02:44:57.280]
Yes?

[02:44:57.540 --> 02:45:00.820]
I heard this nasty rumor that all that money that Elton John made.

[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:03.320]
Did not go where we were supposed to.

[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:04.240]
Absolutely correct.

[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:04.840]
Right.

[02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:06.800]
I mean, I thought the kids had enough money.

[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:09.000]
Well, that's a wrong cut.

[02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:09.860]
Sorry about that, Elton.

[02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:10.960]
Boy, did I blow that?

[02:45:11.060 --> 02:45:11.740]
That's what Elton said.

[02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:12.560]
Yeah, well, you...

[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:14.200]
Oh, well, I really need to go now.

[02:45:16.100 --> 02:45:16.640]
Okay, sweetheart.

[02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:18.340]
Yeah, I really need to go now because I have thought.

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:19.360]
Don't step on Elton.

[02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:21.740]
Good-bye, you little rose.

[02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:25.480]
May you ever grow in our hearts.

[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:28.620]
You were the greatest that lived to settle.

[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:31.180]
Well, lives were torn apart.

[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:33.300]
You call that a penis?

[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:35.780]
You call out to our country.

[02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:41.040]
Roar and you whisper to those in pain.

[02:45:41.340 --> 02:45:43.320]
Now you belong to heaven.

[02:45:43.700 --> 02:45:44.120]
Oh, my God.

[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:47.020]
And the stars fill out your name.

[02:45:47.020 --> 02:45:49.280]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:56.980]
And it seems to me that you live your life like a candle when...

[02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:57.460]
Okay.

[02:45:58.020 --> 02:46:03.060]
Never fade with the sunset when the rain's sitting.

[02:46:04.340 --> 02:46:04.860]
Are you sure?

[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:08.820]
And your footsteps will always fall here.

[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:11.640]
And the long England green is here.

[02:46:12.540 --> 02:46:13.200]
You've turned.

[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:16.600]
You candles burned out long before.

[02:46:19.180 --> 02:46:21.500]
You're legend of real.

[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:27.860]
By the way, do you know what her last words were going on?

[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:28.560]
Her poem with Yanaki.

[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:29.720]
Okay, it's 118.

[02:46:29.980 --> 02:46:31.800]
Yeah, that was all a bunch of baloney.

[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:34.240]
There were no last words that was all made up.

[02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:35.660]
They had...

[02:46:35.660 --> 02:46:36.640]
I guess it was Cyril Wecht.

[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:38.320]
You know, the guy that told us he could talk shows

[02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:39.540]
who was in the Kennedy thing.

[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:42.800]
From Dallas, where it held his from.

[02:46:43.180 --> 02:46:45.700]
But at any rate, he said that as soon as the heart separates

[02:46:45.700 --> 02:46:47.520]
from the chest cavity, you'll be dead.

[02:46:47.660 --> 02:46:48.700]
There are no final words.

[02:46:48.900 --> 02:46:50.780]
There's no emoting and no instructions.

[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:52.020]
He was dead.

[02:46:52.860 --> 02:46:54.600]
Once they had the wreck in her heart was...

[02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:56.420]
But we don't want to spoil it for you because after all,

[02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:58.920]
very princess, very tacos, it all works out together.

[02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:00.600]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:47:01.140 --> 02:47:01.420]
Hello.

[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:02.640]
Neil.

[02:47:02.860 --> 02:47:03.160]
Yes, sir.

[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:05.740]
Hey, it's great to have talk radio back on here.

[02:47:05.740 --> 02:47:09.520]
Thank God for a guy that's alive and not sitting here trying to force feed stupid ass topics.

[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:21.080]
He's a little worried about you when Tunand was on the list about maybe he would be on his list.

[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:21.540]
Who?

[02:47:22.420 --> 02:47:22.560]
Tunand.

[02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:22.900]
Tunand.

[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:23.600]
Now, he was...

[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:24.280]
I'm a small potato.

[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:25.400]
He's after the big guys.

[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.140]
Oh, well, it's good that he didn't hit you.

[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:31.160]
And great to have you back on the air.

[02:47:31.460 --> 02:47:32.460]
It was too old for me anyway.

[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:36.600]
After he left the expenditure was nothing but news, news,

[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:38.660]
I mean, William Roberts.

[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:39.500]
I mean, he was a little worried about you when Tunand was on the list about maybe he would be on his list.

[02:47:39.500 --> 02:47:39.500]

[02:47:39.500 --> 02:47:39.500]

[02:47:39.500 --> 02:47:39.500]

[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:42.960]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:44.100 --> 02:47:45.320]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:45.360]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:45.360]

[02:47:45.380 --> 02:47:45.560]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:45.560]

[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:46.000]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:46.360]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:46.800]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:48.000]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:48.900]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:49.700]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:50.320]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:51.800]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:51.840]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:54.000]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:55.680]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:57.400]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:57.920 --> 02:47:58.500]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:02.840]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:48:03.340 --> 02:48:07.500]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:09.360]
You're a little worried about him.

[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:13.720]
I wanted to know if I could sue Joe Rose for calling me a Mexican idiot.

[02:48:14.540 --> 02:48:16.660]
I wasn't going to do it, but he stuck his...

[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:19.860]
He stuck his...

[02:48:19.860 --> 02:48:20.220]
He stuck his...

[02:48:20.900 --> 02:48:21.340]
His...

[02:48:21.340 --> 02:48:22.360]
Of my dogs...

[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:23.160]
of my dogs...

[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:23.460]
of my dogs...

[02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:23.520]
of my dogs...

[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:23.820]
of my dogs...

[02:48:23.820 --> 02:48:23.820]

[02:48:23.820 --> 02:48:23.820]

[02:48:23.820 --> 02:48:24.040]
of my dogs...

[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:24.040]

[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:24.360]
of my dogs...

[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:25.540]
of my dogs...

[02:48:25.540 --> 02:48:25.580]
of my dogs...

[02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:26.240]
of my dogs...

[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:26.960]
of my dogs...

[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:28.320]
of my dogs...

[02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:30.040]
of my dogs...

[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:38.360]
of my dogs...

[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:39.400]
Here's a Hollywood.

[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:39.920]
Hello.

[02:48:41.140 --> 02:48:41.780]
Uncle Neil.

[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:42.320]
Yes, sir.

[02:48:42.540 --> 02:48:45.340]
Let's see if seven months of being off the air...

[02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:47.840]
if you affected your recognizing voices at all.

[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:49.640]
You know who this is?

[02:48:50.180 --> 02:48:50.900]
Who this is?

[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:52.360]
Yeah, it wouldn't be the same show.

[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:54.380]
It's one of your chronic squal'd end, right?

[02:48:56.100 --> 02:48:57.720]
Yeah, I recognize the voice, but I...

[02:48:57.720 --> 02:48:59.600]
This is Stubby, the Kirby man.

[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:00.620]
The real stubby?

[02:49:00.700 --> 02:49:01.920]
The real life stubby.

[02:49:02.020 --> 02:49:03.360]
Oh my God!

[02:49:03.660 --> 02:49:03.700]
The real life stubby.

[02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:03.700]

[02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:04.460]
How the hell you're blind?

[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:05.420]
Wow.

[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:06.840]
Man, it's so good to have you back.

[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:08.700]
Talk about ponderous radio, man.

[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:10.400]
Well, it's a show I've been off the air for seven months...

[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:11.160]
and I'm in such a good mood.

[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:12.500]
I don't even mind hearing from you, Stubby.

[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:13.120]
I'm going, yeah.

[02:49:13.260 --> 02:49:14.840]
I'm surprised you haven't hung up on me yet.

[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:17.140]
My fingers not even near it and the butt here.

[02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:18.700]
How do you like that?

[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:20.220]
It's so great to hear you, man.

[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:22.700]
It's so good to have the new year coming in...

[02:49:22.700 --> 02:49:24.140]
with Uncle Neil on the radio again.

[02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:25.760]
So I think we can all agree on one thing...

[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:26.480]
that Mark Valverde...

[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:28.320]
I mean, everybody's kinky, everybody's got their thing.

[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:28.860]
And I...

[02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:31.720]
no, not all those guys dress up in panties, even the faggot.

[02:49:32.140 --> 02:49:34.360]
But if you just would not have come on the air...

[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:36.820]
and lied so much...

[02:49:36.820 --> 02:49:38.680]
and you know, Mark, get a new wig...

[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:39.760]
and get out of our face already.

[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:41.800]
Everybody now hates Mark Valverde like poison.

[02:49:42.260 --> 02:49:44.040]
And that kid of is that Kenny Albert...

[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:45.380]
with the moon... with the moon head.

[02:49:45.420 --> 02:49:46.720]
He's got one eye in his forehead...

[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:48.780]
and the other one where his left ear is supposed to be.

[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:50.600]
I mean, get that kid off of there.

[02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:51.960]
Maybe him and OJ can get together.

[02:49:51.960 --> 02:49:53.960]
This guy's in the Chris Moore School of Broadcasting...

[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:55.800]
couldn't call a game if you stuck an oozzy...

[02:49:55.800 --> 02:49:56.440]
deep inside his...

[02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:57.660]
I mean, forget it.

[02:49:58.000 --> 02:49:59.740]
Marvin OJ will get back together...

[02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:00.980]
and I'll be sure to hire him back.

[02:50:01.060 --> 02:50:01.460]
There you go.

[02:50:01.580 --> 02:50:02.360]
Wouldn't surprise me.

[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:03.580]
Get a 90-share easy.

[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:04.640]
All right, Uncle Neil.

[02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:05.120]
I don't care.

[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:07.620]
I just wanted to see if he'd hang up on me...

[02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:08.740]
and I'll see you at the hockey game, buddy.

[02:50:08.740 --> 02:50:09.200]
I'm almost...

[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:10.800]
I'm almost ready to say it's great hearing from you...

[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:12.220]
but I don't want to be a liar in the first day.

[02:50:12.380 --> 02:50:13.560]
Right away. When that piece of crap...

[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:14.780]
Ken Moore knocks out on you...

[02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:15.760]
give me an up call.

[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:16.560]
Where you...

[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:17.400]
Get a real vacuum.

[02:50:18.140 --> 02:50:18.680]
Ken Moore.

[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:19.860]
Yeah, you...

[02:50:19.860 --> 02:50:21.760]
I remember you said you bought a new Ken Moore...

[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:24.140]
for your cleaning lady before you went off the air on IOT.

[02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:25.500]
Yeah, but you want to see what she's doing with it.

[02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:26.200]
See you, Tommy.

[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:27.340]
Okay, see you.

[02:50:27.820 --> 02:50:28.340]
And out of here...

[02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:29.180]
Stop trying to pedal crap.

[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:29.740]
They come on here.

[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:31.280]
It's not bad enough that the chronic's are in.

[02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:31.820]
I don't mind that.

[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:32.680]
They're peddling crap.

[02:50:32.980 --> 02:50:33.660]
They got magnets.

[02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:35.020]
They got the vacuums.

[02:50:35.020 --> 02:50:36.080]
Who knows what they're doing with those...

[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:36.460]
Rackum.

[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:37.240]
Vacuum hoses.

[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:37.960]
God only knows.

[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:39.100]
And even he's afraid to look.

[02:50:39.540 --> 02:50:40.780]
But once in a while does take a peek.

[02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:41.380]
I understand.

[02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:42.640]
Here's homestead.

[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:43.000]
Hello.

[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:44.380]
Hello, Nio.

[02:50:44.500 --> 02:50:44.800]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:46.400]
Yeah, I just wanted to say...

[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:47.440]
now you're back in the radio.

[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:49.840]
Why don't you use it as a public forum...

[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:52.680]
to discuss issues like gun control and abortion.

[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:54.160]
Right. That's what we're going to be doing.

[02:50:54.480 --> 02:50:55.820]
You found out about it.

[02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:56.740]
You found out about it.

[02:50:56.740 --> 02:50:57.940]
That's what we're going to be doing starting tomorrow.

[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:01.080]
It's important because there's so much community involvement...

[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:03.540]
that needs to be reached here throughout the whole county.

[02:51:03.540 --> 02:51:05.520]
Right. We're going to change the whole world here on the radio.

[02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:05.760]
Right.

[02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:06.980]
Okay. Starts tomorrow, pal.

[02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:12.780]
940, 1290, 1417, 25, 195, come three.

[02:51:13.480 --> 02:51:15.200]
I mean, let's get serious, okay?

[02:51:15.540 --> 02:51:18.240]
Crap that went out with knickers, with high-button shoes,

[02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:20.460]
with guys wearing striped tops at the beach.

[02:51:20.580 --> 02:51:20.840]
Okay?

[02:51:21.160 --> 02:51:25.140]
That's how old this stuff is that they're doing on this stupid talk network.

[02:51:25.300 --> 02:51:28.580]
The queer channel people destroying two butchering,

[02:51:28.920 --> 02:51:30.340]
two once great radio stations,

[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:32.180]
with a single wipe of their hand.

[02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:35.140]
On, even Mr. Whipple never wiped like their wipe in it.

[02:51:35.740 --> 02:51:38.180]
Here is a mobile in Miami. Hello?

[02:51:39.380 --> 02:51:43.500]
Steve, do you know what the peanut oil implant doctor's number is?

[02:51:46.180 --> 02:51:47.440]
Neil? Yes, sir.

[02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:49.300]
It's okay. Have a deep back on the day. I call.

[02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:54.900]
Just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just tell me what your problem is.

[02:51:55.260 --> 02:51:57.920]
Oh, I got a lot of problems, but not, not your back, Neil.

[02:51:57.920 --> 02:51:59.600]
You know, at least I got a lot of problems.

[02:51:59.960 --> 02:52:02.640]
I'm telling you, you've been, you've been sorely missed.

[02:52:02.920 --> 02:52:04.360]
I tell you, I called SUDS yesterday.

[02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:08.460]
I said SUDS, I hope you guys have good lawyers at that station.

[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:11.080]
We all normally drove up the road in the coma in the morning program,

[02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:12.280]
and he started cracking up.

[02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:14.800]
Yeah, and I just, I feel so sorry for that guy.

[02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:17.160]
I feel sorry for SUDS. I even feel sorry for Rick.

[02:52:17.280 --> 02:52:18.800]
I mean, I know it's hard for me to say that,

[02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:21.100]
because most of the people that work with Rick hated him like poison.

[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:24.160]
I wasn't what him, George hated him badly, deeply, seriously.

[02:52:24.380 --> 02:52:26.020]
I never worked with him. I never really wasn't.

[02:52:26.020 --> 02:52:27.520]
I haven't been to a feeling about Rick.

[02:52:27.700 --> 02:52:28.920]
No, Rick never seemed like a bad guy.

[02:52:29.060 --> 02:52:30.680]
He's not a bad guy. He's just a redneck.

[02:52:30.860 --> 02:52:32.880]
You know, if he would admit to being a redneck from Orange County,

[02:52:33.420 --> 02:52:35.840]
it would be fine. We'd have no problem, but he's in denial.

[02:52:35.940 --> 02:52:37.700]
We don't know how he's definitely going to kill one of those kids

[02:52:37.700 --> 02:52:40.520]
before too many more years rule by with his, you know,

[02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:43.160]
with all those dirt bikes and all that other redneck crap.

[02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:44.400]
But he means well.

[02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:47.680]
Well, you know, I, I did hold, you know, a buddy for Buchanan against him,

[02:52:47.780 --> 02:52:51.020]
slightly, but you know, everywhere that's had a coolest day or two,

[02:52:51.140 --> 02:52:52.940]
you know, whatever I guess, you know, wasn't, we had a bad guy

[02:52:52.940 --> 02:52:54.440]
when you looked, you know, a little closer, right?

[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:57.420]
By the way, ease up at MLK. So we stole one.

[02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:00.620]
It's the only piece of material that Rick had in like seven years

[02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:02.500]
and we stole it. Okay. They're pissed off.

[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:03.860]
Hey, maybe you can make it over there.

[02:53:03.860 --> 02:53:05.540]
Also, here is good for you and I like Chinese.

[02:53:05.540 --> 02:53:06.160]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:10.440]
Maybe you can have a afternoon trifecta with Rick Suds and Hank.

[02:53:11.320 --> 02:53:12.440]
We love Suds. Yeah.

[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.840]
Hank and Suds. Maybe Suds can just put a cab over there.

[02:53:15.960 --> 02:53:17.280]
Got a good ring to it. Hank and Suds.

[02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:19.220]
I got to talk to you later. Somebody's coming up to my car.

[02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:21.420]
Okay. Watch out. Roll the window up.

[02:53:21.980 --> 02:53:26.300]
Open line at 5.6705.675.6705.6705.670.

[02:53:26.300 --> 02:53:28.520]
Hank and Suds. Got kind of a nice sound to it, huh?

[02:53:29.700 --> 02:53:30.760]
Poor Rick. Rick takes things.

[02:53:30.940 --> 02:53:32.280]
That's a prop. He takes things to heart.

[02:53:32.380 --> 02:53:33.240]
He takes them so seriously.

[02:53:33.700 --> 02:53:36.020]
It's just business. Rick, it's most definitely personal.

[02:53:36.640 --> 02:53:37.960]
Here's a Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:40.020]
I come to hell. Welcome back.

[02:53:40.180 --> 02:53:40.180]

[02:53:40.180 --> 02:53:40.560]
Thank you.

[02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:44.200]
Did you hit the nail on the head with Linda Energy and Dr. Hool?

[02:53:44.820 --> 02:53:47.280]
You must have been laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing.

[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:48.720]
No, it was a physician.

[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:49.520]
A physician.

[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:50.100]
Remember that?

[02:53:50.360 --> 02:53:51.320]
Dr. Hool. Yeah.

[02:53:51.880 --> 02:53:52.640]
Dr. Hool? Yeah.

[02:53:52.640 --> 02:53:53.780]
And then this prop was so weak.

[02:53:53.960 --> 02:53:57.740]
She's sending us clippings of how fan-fan was killing people

[02:53:57.740 --> 02:53:59.760]
and about all the stuff that was going on with the lawsuits

[02:53:59.760 --> 02:54:01.240]
and it was like a big joke to her.

[02:54:01.380 --> 02:54:03.640]
You must be physics. You start before it happens.

[02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:03.960]
Yeah.

[02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:07.340]
Well, I couldn't wait for you to come back to get on your case.

[02:54:07.480 --> 02:54:09.680]
In fact, I think that's what the hero meant when they said no moss.

[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:12.600]
I think it was the fan-fan article and they put in the horror he moss canosa article

[02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:14.480]
by mistake. That's what they were talking about.

[02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:15.560]
That's a typo.

[02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:16.140]
What are you guys?

[02:54:16.140 --> 02:54:18.060]
Yeah, let me, I want you to think about this.

[02:54:18.380 --> 02:54:20.240]
It was the week before Christmas, okay?

[02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:20.700]
Yeah.

[02:54:20.860 --> 02:54:25.320]
Now, let's say you're an advertiser and you put a big multi-thousand dollar ad in

[02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:28.240]
Traffic Magazine to peddle your crab for Christmas, right?

[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:28.660]
Sure.

[02:54:28.780 --> 02:54:34.100]
And the hero cancels the Goddamn magazine because they're so afraid that no moss

[02:54:34.100 --> 02:54:38.280]
is going to offend a few old Cubans playing dominoes in Domino Park who don't buy

[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:40.120]
your stuff anyway who knows bigot English.

[02:54:40.440 --> 02:54:41.920]
You've got to be foaming at them off.

[02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:43.600]
I see a lot of lawsuits to the hero.

[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:46.120]
Another revolution in Miami.

[02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:48.600]
I can see a lot of people canceling that herald immediately.

[02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:49.800]
Welcome back, Uncle Leo.

[02:54:49.820 --> 02:54:50.560]
Okay, thanks.

[02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:50.980]
All right.

[02:54:51.140 --> 02:54:51.520]
See ya.

[02:54:51.740 --> 02:54:54.700]
We don't want to start another campaign with people canceling the herald, do we?

[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:55.080]
We do.

[02:54:55.680 --> 02:54:58.160]
Okay, 127 on 560 QAM.

[02:54:58.660 --> 02:55:02.860]
Are you as confused as I am with all these cellular digital PCS offers out there?

[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:04.980]
You got to be a techno nerd to finger it out.

[02:55:05.260 --> 02:55:07.440]
Well, mobile one wireless network makes it simple.

[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:11.060]
Even us idiots can figure it out whether you own an analog phone or one of those

[02:55:11.060 --> 02:55:12.700]
underwater sounding digital phones.

[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:15.300]
Mobile one's new America's plan works for both.

[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:20.240]
Offering the lowest monthly rate of only $14.95 a month including free unlimited.

[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:23.940]
Let me say it again, unlimited mobile one long distance calling all throughout the USA.

[02:55:24.500 --> 02:55:29.080]
It costs only $25 to $0.35 a minute in your local area, whether you're calling Miami or New

[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:32.180]
Jork and it's good for digital or analog cellular phones.

[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:36.080]
Plus for a limited time when you switch to mobile one you'll get a free beeper with six months of service

[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:36.900]
included as well.

[02:55:36.900 --> 02:55:40.540]
So call mobile one right now at 1-800-FONEM-1.

[02:55:40.660 --> 02:55:41.480]
They are incredible.

[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:47.400]
That's 1-800-FONEM-1 and sign up with their new America's plan for only $14.95 a month including

[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:49.760]
unlimited mobile long distance calling.

[02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:50.940]
You can't beat him with a stick.

[02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:53.860]
The mobile one differences those mighty mighty lower rates.

[02:55:54.020 --> 02:55:56.980]
Call him today 1-800-FONEM-1.

[02:55:57.180 --> 02:55:59.980]
This is 560 QAM.

[02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:01.840]
Well, have one.

[02:56:01.940 --> 02:56:03.680]
Well, have a WQAM.com.

[02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:05.660]
Just go on air and you'll find a bunch of crap.

[02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:07.380]
And also we are on the audio net.

[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:09.560]
We're on the audio net how you get there.

[02:56:09.740 --> 02:56:11.380]
We're not too sure about the audio net.com.

[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:12.780]
Audio net.com.

[02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:13.480]
There you go.

[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:14.220]
Piece of cake.

[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:16.120]
Okay, WWW.

[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:18.780]
That's in Detroit.

[02:56:19.260 --> 02:56:19.920]
Here's Miami.

[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:20.260]
Hello.

[02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:21.840]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:22.340]
Yes, sir.

[02:56:22.460 --> 02:56:23.160]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:23.520]
Great.

[02:56:23.780 --> 02:56:24.300]
Welcome back.

[02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:27.140]
Feels like only 20-30 hours ago we started this show, right?

[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:27.680]
Yeah.

[02:56:27.860 --> 02:56:30.360]
It's been a workout, making up for seven months in one day.

[02:56:30.820 --> 02:56:31.680]
Listen, Adam, question.

[02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:32.820]
I'm a little surprised.

[02:56:32.820 --> 02:56:35.240]
Is the bird's contract still under negotiation or what?

[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:35.840]
Oh, yeah.

[02:56:36.180 --> 02:56:36.500]
Yeah.

[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:39.960]
No, we brought him back, but he's sitting outside eating the food.

[02:56:40.200 --> 02:56:42.120]
What we did this morning, yeah, we didn't put him on here.

[02:56:42.180 --> 02:56:43.340]
We're just letting him eat the food.

[02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:45.360]
Anyway, look, you sound great.

[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:48.040]
Welcome back and I'll be tuning in.

[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:48.640]
Okay.

[02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:49.320]
Later.

[02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:49.800]
See ya.

[02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:50.220]
Thanks.

[02:56:52.260 --> 02:56:52.900]
567-0560.

[02:56:53.020 --> 02:56:54.200]
Actually, this has gone by pretty fast.

[02:56:54.280 --> 02:56:56.580]
We had a lot of pen and he asked people hanging around here earlier today.

[02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:59.220]
Most of them have moved out and it's a piece of cake now.

[02:56:59.360 --> 02:57:00.940]
But man, early in the show, frantic.

[02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:01.660]
Frantic.

[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:02.240]
Socotic.

[02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:03.120]
That's John Dutzman.

[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:05.580]
Man, John Dutzbag needs therapy.

[02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:06.780]
He needs to be locked in a...

[02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:09.300]
Remember in clockwork orange when they locked him in the room and they had the Beethoven

[02:57:09.300 --> 02:57:09.780]
blasting?

[02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:12.380]
That's what they need to do with John Dutzbag from Channel 4.

[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:14.140]
Lock him in a room with Neil Rogers tapes.

[02:57:14.420 --> 02:57:19.120]
Just blaring and blasting if there's any chance to cure him of his Neil hysteria.

[02:57:19.180 --> 02:57:19.900]
Man is obsessed.

[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:21.620]
He's got Neil Rogers disease.

[02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:22.600]
It is terminal.

[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:26.120]
Here's kind of like the shows on the stupid talk network terminal.

[02:57:26.700 --> 02:57:27.360]
Here's Voka.

[02:57:27.620 --> 02:57:27.800]
Hello.

[02:57:28.420 --> 02:57:28.780]
Neil.

[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:29.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:31.060]
Oh, it's great to have you back.

[02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:33.360]
I cannot believe the quality of this call.

[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:34.040]
Why?

[02:57:34.300 --> 02:57:35.300]
Are you looking at a real phone?

[02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:35.920]
Yeah.

[02:57:36.140 --> 02:57:37.800]
You're the first guy I've been able to hear all day.

[02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:41.820]
I'm going to show for three and a half hours fake my way through.

[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:43.000]
I can't hear a goddamn thing.

[02:57:43.300 --> 02:57:45.120]
And you sound like you're right next door and you're in Voka.

[02:57:45.380 --> 02:57:46.720]
Well, I'm the first caller then.

[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:47.400]
There you go.

[02:57:48.320 --> 02:57:49.580]
Right in your diarrhea.

[02:57:50.260 --> 02:57:50.540]
Yeah.

[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:51.900]
I just can't believe...

[02:57:51.900 --> 02:57:55.760]
I wanted to talk to you back when Diana died and I couldn't get it.

[02:57:55.840 --> 02:57:56.440]
You weren't there.

[02:57:57.760 --> 02:57:59.300]
I guess I agree with you.

[02:57:59.300 --> 02:58:00.760]
I mean, what was the big deal?

[02:58:00.860 --> 02:58:02.360]
What is the big simmiss with her?

[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:05.260]
I mean, did anybody give a flying crap about her before she died?

[02:58:05.820 --> 02:58:06.580]
Well, a lot of people...

[02:58:06.580 --> 02:58:09.300]
I mean, the British, we understand because they're so desperate for anybody

[02:58:09.300 --> 02:58:11.880]
who might have the slightest touch of humanity, which I guess she did.

[02:58:12.080 --> 02:58:13.200]
We can understand that.

[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:15.700]
But all around the rest of the world, who can...

[02:58:15.700 --> 02:58:19.140]
And no matter where I was, Amsterdam, Rome, Berlin,

[02:58:19.440 --> 02:58:22.620]
no matter where I was, you turn on the TV and every local channel.

[02:58:22.660 --> 02:58:25.580]
They're hacking a China-kin Dutch and in German and Italian about a beep,

[02:58:48.580 --> 02:58:52.480]
but a beep, but a beep, but a dianna this, dianna the NHK,

[02:58:52.740 --> 02:58:53.900]
the Japanese channel, all those little gooks.

[02:58:53.900 --> 02:58:57.200]
She had a beep that birds landed on, but it...

[02:58:57.200 --> 02:58:57.440]
Right.

[02:58:57.740 --> 02:59:00.140]
But I don't have a hunker like very man-a-low man.

[02:59:00.180 --> 02:59:01.300]
I should play that damn thing.

[02:59:02.440 --> 02:59:05.340]
If you're a billionaire, I'm glad you're giving away some money.

[02:59:05.540 --> 02:59:07.620]
You should give away money to people who are building it.

[02:59:07.620 --> 02:59:07.620]

[02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:11.720]
And not only that, but all of this charity stuff, it was all arranged them in the whole royal family.

[02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:15.300]
Not saying she didn't do some good things, but nevertheless it was all prearranged,

[02:59:15.440 --> 02:59:16.420]
it was all PR stuff.

[02:59:16.720 --> 02:59:19.520]
And in the meantime, she was spending money like it was coming out of a faucet.

[02:59:19.720 --> 02:59:19.860]
Right.

[02:59:20.120 --> 02:59:23.020]
And everybody telling me about it, all don't you feel sorry for the kids?

[02:59:23.020 --> 02:59:24.080]
Wait a minute, they're building it.

[02:59:24.080 --> 02:59:24.640]
Oh, you're there.

[02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:25.100]
Oh, you're there.

[02:59:25.380 --> 02:59:28.480]
Everybody's kids out there should have a rough future like they're going to have, man.

[02:59:28.540 --> 02:59:28.700]
Right.

[02:59:28.820 --> 02:59:30.100]
I think he's 15 years old.

[02:59:30.100 --> 02:59:31.680]
They're already saying, Daddy's got big ears.

[02:59:31.820 --> 02:59:32.440]
We hate his guts.

[02:59:32.680 --> 02:59:35.440]
He ought to run off with what's your name, that bitch, and make him the king.

[02:59:35.860 --> 02:59:36.040]
Right.

[02:59:36.280 --> 02:59:36.860]
I mean...

[02:59:36.860 --> 02:59:37.280]
I'm not too sure.

[02:59:37.400 --> 02:59:38.620]
I think maybe they're going to make him the queen.

[02:59:38.620 --> 02:59:39.720]
I'm not too sure about him.

[02:59:40.300 --> 02:59:41.740]
He's a little too pretty to be the king.

[02:59:41.960 --> 02:59:43.240]
How many kids lose their mother?

[02:59:43.560 --> 02:59:46.000]
How many kids lose their mother and they're not...

[02:59:46.840 --> 02:59:47.200]
Yeah.

[02:59:47.500 --> 02:59:47.660]
Yeah.

[02:59:47.680 --> 02:59:48.780]
I mean, what happened?

[02:59:48.900 --> 02:59:49.960]
I mean, they...

[02:59:49.960 --> 02:59:51.280]
Oh, I'm terrible.

[02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:55.620]
And then, of course, the same thing with this broad in New England, with the babysitter,

[02:59:55.760 --> 02:59:59.060]
the old pair, same thing, the media people decided.

[02:59:59.340 --> 03:00:04.080]
I mean, there are kids getting killed every goddamn day, and the media doesn't care for five minutes.

[03:00:04.420 --> 03:00:08.280]
And this story for whatever reason, they decided this was the big deal,

[03:00:08.560 --> 03:00:11.860]
and then we're going to, of course, then the guy with a big note, very direct, had to get involved,

[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:12.840]
and then he had to stick his nose.

[03:00:13.160 --> 03:00:16.820]
And then we got Johnny Cochrane sticking his nose in Latrine's free well out there in a West Coast.

[03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:18.440]
I mean, it's just unbelievable.

[03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:22.020]
The media has created all these assholes, and we can't get rid of them.

[03:00:22.340 --> 03:00:23.920]
The OJ thing is what, done it.

[03:00:24.120 --> 03:00:24.300]
Yeah.

[03:00:24.640 --> 03:00:26.480]
The OJ thing is what really started this.

[03:00:26.580 --> 03:00:28.080]
It started the whole court TV thing.

[03:00:28.280 --> 03:00:29.480]
All these guys have got jobs.

[03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:31.340]
The guy that's on MSNBC.

[03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:33.020]
John, what is his name?

[03:00:33.420 --> 03:00:33.600]
Right.

[03:00:33.600 --> 03:00:35.580]
The guy with a glasses from the West Coast.

[03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:39.680]
He's on there like constantly, with the carrot color here.

[03:00:39.880 --> 03:00:40.280]
John Gibson.

[03:00:40.660 --> 03:00:41.020]
Yeah, okay.

[03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:41.560]
He's on there.

[03:00:41.700 --> 03:00:42.100]
He's...

[03:00:42.100 --> 03:00:43.600]
Because he was on the OJ thing.

[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:49.580]
These two fakers, the, on 1230 on CNN, they're sitting there doing their point counterpoint.

[03:00:49.600 --> 03:00:51.700]
The two lawyers, Elfride van Nordre.

[03:00:51.740 --> 03:00:52.380]
What are their names?

[03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:53.020]
Eva Brown.

[03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:56.040]
And the other guy, Roger Koss...

[03:00:56.040 --> 03:00:57.220]
Roger Belia.

[03:00:57.700 --> 03:00:58.600]
Roger Kossacker.

[03:00:58.760 --> 03:00:59.680]
Whatever the hell his name is.

[03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:03.040]
They got all of a sudden they're stars because they were on with the OJ thing.

[03:01:03.320 --> 03:01:03.440]
Right.

[03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:05.640]
And everybody's got to have a career because of OJ.

[03:01:05.820 --> 03:01:06.020]
God.

[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:08.500]
He's giving us a break already.

[03:01:09.140 --> 03:01:09.540]
That's right.

[03:01:09.780 --> 03:01:10.020]
Okay.

[03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:10.980]
Okay, Bob.

[03:01:10.980 --> 03:01:11.520]
Okay.

[03:01:11.520 --> 03:01:12.820]
But, this two show pass.

[03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:13.460]
Okay.

[03:01:13.900 --> 03:01:14.320]
All the pass.

[03:01:15.020 --> 03:01:16.520]
You can't decode.

[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:18.500]
You can't decode.

[03:01:19.180 --> 03:01:19.500]
Okay.

[03:01:19.940 --> 03:01:20.420]
Okay.

[03:01:22.040 --> 03:01:22.100]
Okay.

[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:22.560]

[03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:24.280]
You can't decode.

[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:26.680]
You can't decode.

[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:30.140]
How beautiful.

[03:01:32.660 --> 03:01:34.240]
How beautiful.

[03:01:36.260 --> 03:01:38.160]
How beautiful.

[03:02:03.540 --> 03:02:04.420]
How beautiful.

[03:02:04.420 --> 03:02:04.420]

[03:02:04.420 --> 03:02:04.420]

[03:02:04.420 --> 03:02:04.420]

[03:02:04.420 --> 03:02:04.680]
How beautiful.

[03:02:04.860 --> 03:02:05.080]
How beautiful.

[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:06.680]
How beautiful.

[03:02:06.900 --> 03:02:06.940]
How beautiful.

[03:02:06.940 --> 03:02:07.100]
How beautiful.

[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:07.280]

[03:02:07.820 --> 03:02:07.820]

[03:02:07.820 --> 03:02:07.820]

[03:02:07.820 --> 03:02:07.820]

[03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:09.040]
How beautiful.

[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:09.220]
How beautiful.

[03:02:09.220 --> 03:02:10.100]
How beautiful.

[03:02:10.180 --> 03:02:10.600]
How beautiful.

[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:29.920]
How beautiful.

[03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:31.180]
How beautiful.

[03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:31.180]

[03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:31.180]

[03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:31.180]

[03:02:31.180 --> 03:02:31.180]

[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:51.820]
kidneys. Orestra has a strange taste. Orestra. It's so good in greasy snack. Orestra

[03:04:51.820 --> 03:04:57.500]
causes abdominal cramps. Orestra causes loose stool syndrome. Orestra causes anal

[03:04:57.500 --> 03:05:03.240]
leakage. Introducing a new snack with Orestra. Diarrito.

[03:05:05.200 --> 03:05:11.420]
C C. Diarritos. Very good. You can hardly taste the Orestra. I got to go to the

John. Diarritos with real Orestra. You can't just eat one without the

[03:05:17.240 --> 03:05:21.100]

[03:05:21.100 --> 03:05:25.800]
things on his show. Are we sure hope not? Anyway, it's a 144 on 560 QAN.

[03:05:25.920 --> 03:05:29.080]
Hang coming up at two from two to six. And then we got the Panthers tonight.

[03:05:29.080 --> 03:05:31.980]
We got like a real team back. I'm telling you they're going to kick ass. They

[03:05:31.980 --> 03:05:34.820]
got to get rid of Kirk Muller. Get rid of that Garpert Law. Send him back to

[03:05:34.820 --> 03:05:38.600]
where the hell he came from and butch up Carcdor and Murphy and we might have a

[03:05:38.600 --> 03:05:42.700]
team this year. Here's a fax about Larry King. Okay, old news. We don't care.

[03:05:43.560 --> 03:05:46.660]
After what seems like forever, it's great to hear your voice again. Atlanta

[03:05:46.660 --> 03:05:50.060]
radio wasn't big enough. Fought a jail-rated party. David Paul Sherbert. David

[03:05:50.060 --> 03:05:54.920]
Paul is back in Atlanta. How do you like that? A man that couldn't be on on KPX

[03:05:54.920 --> 03:05:58.340]
for two minutes just to give the time in the tent. And he's on here in Atlanta

[03:05:58.340 --> 03:06:02.640]
probably on a cox stage. Oh, sorry. Game was shown on. There's a hockey thing.

[03:06:02.700 --> 03:06:06.140]
Nobody cares about that one. Did you see Yagarin Barnes? Each had three assists

[03:06:06.140 --> 03:06:08.780]
last night. Yes, I did for the Penguins. Is they wonder game five? Do I want to

[03:06:08.780 --> 03:06:12.140]
see that? But we got Ray Whitten who was better than Stu Barnes. Trust me.

[03:06:12.680 --> 03:06:18.080]
Welcome back. Can't get the AM in my office. I'm big, big trouble for taking a

[03:06:18.080 --> 03:06:21.080]
three hour lunch so I can hear your show in the car, et cetera. And so on. This is

[03:06:21.080 --> 03:06:25.260]
from Dennis in Boca. All right, Dennis. Nice going and just take the day off.

[03:06:26.020 --> 03:06:31.700]
Okay, here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yes, what's your problem with

[03:06:31.700 --> 03:06:36.720]
baggage? You're Christ killing you boy. All right. Now we're talking. Okay. Now we're

[03:06:36.720 --> 03:06:39.440]
talking. Forget the fact stuff. Let's get that kite stuff in there. Now we're

[03:06:39.440 --> 03:06:45.840]
an happy Hanukut. By the way, here's a here's a payphone and Hollywood. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir.

[03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:49.800]
Glad to have you back. Thank you so much. Listen, this town was so boring without you.

[03:06:49.860 --> 03:06:53.500]
I moved up to Orlando. Is there any chance of getting you up there on that station?

[03:06:53.500 --> 03:06:57.120]
No, no, no, give me a break. We already tried Tampa. Those those those

[03:06:57.120 --> 03:07:00.000]
nose pickers up there. They wouldn't know a radio show if you stuck it in their ass.

[03:07:00.060 --> 03:07:04.200]
But let me tell you that after the signal, a hundred thousand watt gets gets up to Jackson

[03:07:04.200 --> 03:07:07.260]
though all the way south to Palm Beach. You would be great on that stage. Oh, yeah. I'd be

[03:07:07.260 --> 03:07:11.540]
big in Jacksonville and the land and the Ford Myers. All the all the clansmen at it. Who

[03:07:11.540 --> 03:07:15.020]
now needs that? All the yeah. I need to be on the air where there's a bunch of Jews and

[03:07:15.020 --> 03:07:19.420]
Fags like New York and Frisco and LA and Chicago and Detroit and Rome. You know,

[03:07:19.420 --> 03:07:23.440]
Hey, Neil, I did my homework while you were gone. I watched the Godfather. Yeah.

[03:07:23.660 --> 03:07:27.540]
And network. Man, that's two movies ever made. There you go. All right.

[03:07:27.660 --> 03:07:31.920]
I'll show you right now. Great to have you back. Get that book. Royals by Kitty Kelly.

[03:07:32.160 --> 03:07:35.720]
The Royal. You will you'll need to change underwear every five minutes. I'll do it.

[03:07:35.840 --> 03:07:42.280]
Okay, pal. See you. 5 6 7 0 5 6 the 5 6 7 0 5 6 0. Here is Kendall. Hello.

[03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:46.640]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Going on. I just want to give a shout out to all the dolphin fans.

[03:07:46.640 --> 03:07:51.280]
Love Gary Stevens. Let me tell you, we would have said Stevens back to where he came from to the

[03:07:51.280 --> 03:07:54.640]
hurricane. You know, maybe they would have scored a touchdown or two back to the Huracans for Gary

[03:07:54.640 --> 03:07:58.480]
Stevens. That's what I say. And the seven months you've been off the air. I got a sad story. I

[03:07:58.480 --> 03:08:02.880]
I gained about 22 pounds. Yeah. And the main reason was because I lost the address. The

[03:08:02.880 --> 03:08:07.560]
I can specially store schloimi. That's one if you can give me the address of schloimi. Okay,

[03:08:07.660 --> 03:08:11.360]
just head east on he. Hellendale Beach Boulevard till the water gets up to the steering wheel and

[03:08:11.480 --> 03:08:16.600]
call us back when you get there. 5 6 7 0 5 6 the and that's that was one of the great moments to

[03:08:16.600 --> 03:08:21.480]
show you how stupid these old farts are in his town. Schloimi's which doesn't exist. They were

[03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:25.740]
going for the Atkins cheesecake and I gave them an address that was like seven miles off the

[03:08:25.740 --> 03:08:29.860]
Atlantic coast into the middle of the ocean and they were going there and thank God for me because

[03:08:29.860 --> 03:08:35.220]
they probably wound up there and never came back. Oh, man. I'll tell you if they if they could have

[03:08:35.220 --> 03:08:40.580]
an IQ test for an entire community, this place would be in a minus column. Hey, hey guys,

[03:08:40.580 --> 03:08:44.460]
don't you think this would be a good trade? Brett Hedicke for the bea's are. Yeah. Right. Whatever

[03:08:44.460 --> 03:08:49.700]
you say, man. How about Tim Horton for the bea's are now we're talking. Butch up that defense. At

[03:08:49.700 --> 03:08:54.720]
least he had a good haircut. Here's a mobile in the keys. Hello. And make your first child.

[03:08:55.000 --> 03:09:05.620]
You're manly child. Okay, Rimmer. Thank you, Rimmer. Excellent call. 5 6 7 0 5 6 the 5 6 7. See how I

[03:09:05.620 --> 03:09:10.000]
have these people program? I can't imagine how some of these people survived during the seven months

[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:16.640]
because their entire lives are based around crap that they hear on his show. The Godfather and the

[03:09:16.640 --> 03:09:21.340]
network and this and that and but I beep and every once in a while, a little one of those, you know,

[03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:26.900]
I mean, their entire lives are so thank God for me coming back. You welcome. Here's two bad Greg

[03:09:26.900 --> 03:09:31.780]
Reed's out of town and can be here to enjoy all the excitement. Here's Boca. Hello. Hello. Hello.

[03:09:31.940 --> 03:09:36.260]
Yes, sir. Hey, I'm glad you're back because I was listening to Boog and Chris Moore for the past

[03:09:36.260 --> 03:09:41.480]
couple months. Bad move and talk about I mean, Boog, okay? Who's a good guy? I tell you right now,

[03:09:41.640 --> 03:09:47.560]
Chris Moore is the he thinks he's funnier and he's not funny. Yeah. And his imitation. I ask you,

[03:09:47.680 --> 03:09:55.860]
what time is Chris Moore on? But here's a minute. I didn't turn on the radio more than six times. All

[03:09:55.860 --> 03:10:00.080]
summer and all during the fall. I can assure you he's show was not one of those six times. Oh, okay.

[03:10:00.380 --> 03:10:03.580]
Well, I'm just but I do hear the rumors that you know, the guy's a little bent out of shape and

[03:10:03.580 --> 03:10:07.740]
while Neil's not speaking, I never liked the guy to begin with. He's a no-town. He could broadcast

[03:10:07.740 --> 03:10:12.180]
a hockey game of his life, depended on it. And every time he comes slump it up those stairs at the

[03:10:12.180 --> 03:10:16.740]
arena because I get there early. I'm sitting in my seat and he you know, do this phony to my face.

[03:10:16.840 --> 03:10:21.360]
I don't like people who put on an act to your face and pretend to be your friend and then go on

[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:25.420]
the air and rip you. I mean, if I got something to say to you, I'll say it to your face. I never

[03:10:25.420 --> 03:10:29.860]
took one step out of the way to say hello to Chris Moore and I don't wish him any ill and I wasn't

[03:10:29.860 --> 03:10:35.220]
out to try to destroy his career such as it is whatever it is. But this guy is in La La Land.

[03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:40.440]
He fancies and stuff and like a major talent, which he is not. He's not funny. He should put all his

[03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:47.360]
concentration into learning how to call a hockey game. Exactly. He would just once describe 30

[03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:52.800]
seconds of the game. It would be no seriously. They would put it in a hockey hall of fame. Don Cherry

[03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:59.840]
would stand there proudly and say for 30 seconds, this man actually called a hockey game. Yep. And you

[03:10:59.840 --> 03:11:04.380]
boog at least has something to say and Chris Moore would kind of bring boog down to his level

[03:11:04.380 --> 03:11:08.800]
unfortunately. Yeah. And boog would get sucked into trying to see what I was going to say. He's

[03:11:08.800 --> 03:11:14.380]
been more eyes. Exactly. Yeah. All right, my brother. Have a great day. Yeah, it was funny because

[03:11:14.380 --> 03:11:19.220]
the one before one of the games, and this was all I don't know about a month ago, or a boogster who

[03:11:19.220 --> 03:11:24.180]
I've only seen from a distance. Hi, how you doing? You got orange here. But other than that, he came

[03:11:24.180 --> 03:11:28.440]
up and started a conversation with me and defending Chris Moore and Bapapah. And I'm saying to him,

[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:33.280]
I don't really in the course of the this is practices going on. The loud music in the arena,

[03:11:33.280 --> 03:11:37.100]
and I'm getting a horse. I'm screaming trying to have a conversation while all this is going on.

[03:11:37.260 --> 03:11:42.400]
Like I have to get into a debate with the boogs. Shambi about what are Chris Moore as a broadcaster

[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:49.520]
like this kid knows a hockey broadcaster. Okay. Give me a freaking break. Now, where the hell is the

[03:11:49.520 --> 03:11:53.380]
very important thing that I was just going to oh, I know what it is. I know what it is because I

[03:11:53.380 --> 03:11:57.140]
want to get everybody in the mood for tonight again because it is San Jose, the team from which

[03:11:57.140 --> 03:12:03.380]
our guy came and I have the wrong damn discant thing. How do you like that, George? I'm so disorganized,

[03:12:03.460 --> 03:12:09.060]
it's terrifying. I'll find it. Okay, let's go to a lady in Pemberg Pines. Hello.

[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:31.960]
I've got the picture. You've got to leave me.

[03:12:32.620 --> 03:12:39.480]
I'm going to leave you a lady. I'm about to say my baby. I can do all these things. I want to do.

[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:45.500]
I just want to see you. I'm going to be the same thing. I'll give you that.

[03:12:45.980 --> 03:12:55.780]
I'm a rapture. I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh.

[03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:18.820]
I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh.

I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh.

[03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:18.940]
I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh.

[03:13:18.940 --> 03:13:19.080]
I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh.

[03:13:19.080 --> 03:13:21.580]
I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh.

[03:13:21.580 --> 03:13:24.580]
I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh.

[03:13:24.580 --> 03:13:26.860]
I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh. I'm going to laugh.

[03:13:27.260 --> 03:13:30.380]
That's why I'm a consultant. That's why I'm a consultant. That's why I'm a consultant.

[03:13:30.440 --> 03:13:37.940]
All right. Thank you profusely so much. That was...

[03:13:37.940 --> 03:13:41.220]
Leave it to the audience, man. Leave it to this audience to have the material.

[03:13:41.320 --> 03:13:42.940]
We may not have it, but they got it. Excellent.

[03:13:43.340 --> 03:13:45.040]
Nice job, Walter, by the way. Clean House.

[03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:49.780]
And you noticed the first person in that lineup who vanished off the year,

[03:13:50.020 --> 03:13:52.180]
the moment a queer channel bought it, was...

[03:13:53.180 --> 03:13:57.420]
Exactly. Karen Gay, the one at Walter's alleged girlfriend, which we don't believe for a minute anyway.

[03:13:57.780 --> 03:13:59.540]
Nice try, Walter. Nobody was buying it.

[03:14:01.520 --> 03:14:07.960]
It's 152 on 560 QAM. God, this has been a draining. I feel like, man, I can't even begin to

[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:12.600]
put words to it. Here's a great place. Republic Security Bank and Family Bank have come together.

[03:14:12.800 --> 03:14:16.340]
You know what that's like? Your community bank has grown, but they still understand the importance

[03:14:16.340 --> 03:14:20.740]
of personal attention. I love them. They love me. Greater resources now let them offer you and

[03:14:20.740 --> 03:14:25.800]
expanded array of financial products, services and locations. More choices and greater accessibility.

[03:14:26.020 --> 03:14:28.440]
That's what Republic Security Bank can provide for their customers.

[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:32.100]
Technology helps them enhance and expand the services, but rest assured,

[03:14:32.560 --> 03:14:36.860]
and Republic Security Bank, the advantages of high-tech banking, are always temperate with the

[03:14:36.860 --> 03:14:40.720]
human touch. After all, it's their goal to ensure that all their customers feel like part of the

[03:14:40.720 --> 03:14:45.480]
family. Republic Security Bank has 32 branches all over day, Broward Palm Beach counties.

[03:14:45.860 --> 03:14:49.340]
Republic Security Bank is one of Florida's biggest independent banks and proud to be locally

[03:14:49.340 --> 03:14:59.220]
owned and operated, called toll free 800 409 7556 for the location nearest by you. That's 1 800 409 7556.

[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:04.540]
Republic Security Bank FDIC ensured and Matt at the Asagras branch is still God.

[03:15:04.700 --> 03:15:14.440]
This is 560 QAM. The NFL playoffs are on QAM. Catch all the NFL post-season action and Super Bowl 32

[03:15:14.440 --> 03:15:20.080]
on the home of your Miami Dolphins Sports Radio 560 QAM.

[03:15:22.300 --> 03:15:27.040]
Welcome to the Clear Channel Collective. You have been assimilated,

[03:15:27.380 --> 03:15:33.280]
resistances few tile, and will result in your termination. We know what's best for radio,

[03:15:33.700 --> 03:15:39.120]
and you will be required through a system via simulation of all relevant radio stations.

[03:15:39.760 --> 03:15:46.640]
Irrelevant radio stations will become all news and left to die. Since talent is expensive,

[03:15:47.120 --> 03:15:52.520]
they will be transported to what we believe are relevant radio stations with smaller wattages

[03:15:52.520 --> 03:15:57.820]
and scattered in a network of confusion. And by the time they are rendered helpless,

[03:15:58.280 --> 03:16:06.420]
the collective will have already disposed of them for profit. Now, grab that Ryan van and repeat after us.

[03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:12.020]
We know what we're doing. We know what we're doing. We know what we're doing.

[03:16:13.660 --> 03:16:21.740]
All right, 157th on Good Leapin, by the way, on 560 QAM Hank. Hello. How you doing? Does this work?

[03:16:22.860 --> 03:16:27.120]
It's are we on? Can you hear me? Do you know that they were going to have a billboard campaign

[03:16:27.120 --> 03:16:30.200]
since you moved up to two and were on like back to back? They were going to have a billboard

[03:16:30.200 --> 03:16:33.540]
with you and me standing back to back and they couldn't find billboards, bringing up for the two of us?

[03:16:33.540 --> 03:16:40.680]
They they run a billboard for anybody. Yeah, exactly. I've been here now for, I think about five years,

[03:16:41.060 --> 03:16:48.320]
have not had one promo outside the radio station. Not a club, not a plaque, not a street sign with my name on it.

[03:16:48.860 --> 03:16:52.520]
Not a sandwich board, nothing. Sandwich board, that would be appropriate.

[03:16:53.060 --> 03:16:56.880]
Seriously, you guys are going to thank me in a long run because if you could see, well, I don't want

[03:16:56.880 --> 03:17:00.580]
you to see you'll be in tears, but I mean, this is a pretty good joint over here. I'm just sitting

[03:17:00.580 --> 03:17:05.960]
here squatting flies. That toilet, that festering sewer that you're working in over there, you will be

[03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:09.320]
out of there. Hell of a lot of fun. In fact, you never would have been out of there. They tried to

[03:17:09.320 --> 03:17:14.480]
con me into building a studio in a broom closet over there. I said, I've been out of the closet for 20

[03:17:14.480 --> 03:17:20.100]
years through that. We were going to be out of here two years ago, April. Yeah, how's it coming

[03:17:20.100 --> 03:17:25.500]
over there? We fooled everybody. Things here are coming along. Thank God for George Corso. This man

[03:17:25.500 --> 03:17:30.220]
is the best engineer single-handedly. He did the work of five for the pay of like about one half.

[03:17:30.820 --> 03:17:34.600]
And if it weren't for him, we'd never would have got this thing on. Yeah. How was your first day?

[03:17:35.300 --> 03:17:40.440]
Pretty good. Pretty paneless. Yeah, everything worked. What's everything worked? We got the

[03:17:40.440 --> 03:17:45.180]
painting, yes. Media people out of here. John Duschbag, this guy's out of control. And the things

[03:17:45.180 --> 03:17:52.580]
they're actually work over here. It'll stop working soon. Oh, yeah. Well, I have one question for

[03:17:52.580 --> 03:17:56.240]
you. What can you see the cart deck over here? You'll know that those are words of wisdom. You're right.

[03:17:56.520 --> 03:18:00.360]
What? I have one question for you. How many vacation days did you get?

[03:18:02.920 --> 03:18:06.940]
298 plus Jewish holidays. I know. I know. I know.

[03:18:07.080 --> 03:18:11.360]
Jewish holidays for my army days. You always have no load. You get people are saying, well,

[03:18:11.480 --> 03:18:14.920]
you demanded this. Look, if somebody promises you that they're going to do a bunch of things,

[03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:19.460]
you say, hey, no problem. I'll take it. I'll take the money. I'll take the studio. And then you

[03:18:19.460 --> 03:18:23.100]
hold their feet to the fire, which of course, in this case, we never had to do because the guy is

[03:18:23.100 --> 03:18:27.300]
always out of town. How do you like this great act of courage on a part of our general manager?

[03:18:27.820 --> 03:18:33.920]
Greg Reed, everybody else is in the studio. The boss, he left town. He high-tailed it. Yeah, he's,

[03:18:34.320 --> 03:18:38.440]
he has some things he's supposed to give me this week. He's not around. There you go.

[03:18:38.580 --> 03:18:43.980]
Typical. Couldn't be a coincidence. Could it? No. No. So, so how do you like moving up two to six?

[03:18:45.060 --> 03:18:50.420]
I don't know yet. I haven't tried it. But I, it doesn't. I don't, I think it'll be okay. I missed that,

[03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:56.200]
I missed a crossover with Kermardi. Yeah. There you go. Now you okay.

[03:18:58.360 --> 03:19:03.340]
Yeah. That was funny. I always like it when you used to say to him, hey, stupid. And he said yes.

[03:19:03.900 --> 03:19:07.900]
That was my favorite part of the show. I think that's history. Okay, Hank. We'll, we'll be with you.

[03:19:08.100 --> 03:19:12.580]
This two to six will work. You know, I think since I have a, I have a lead in.

[03:19:13.320 --> 03:19:17.740]
Since you have a lead in and we have no, how does it feel now to have no competition, not weak

[03:19:17.740 --> 03:19:22.600]
competition, no competition. Thank you, queer channel for doing what nobody else could ever do.

[03:19:22.800 --> 03:19:27.840]
Well, actually, that started a few months ago. And not, I'm not blowing smoke at you, but

[03:19:28.280 --> 03:19:32.660]
when you went off the air, that, that was the end of that station. And nobody enjoyed it more

[03:19:32.660 --> 03:19:36.840]
than I did. Stick it at the Paxen and now our good friend, David Ross. Yeah. And by the way,

[03:19:36.840 --> 03:19:42.000]
and I don't feel sorry for Rick Riley either. But I do feel sorry for SUDs. And I want you to either,

[03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:48.380]
be up front. Not if you don't feel sorry for that guy. Not at least. Not at all. See you, Hank.

[03:19:48.660 --> 03:19:53.400]
Hey, Neil, welcome. Thank you. So that just spells all those aromers. But I can,

[03:19:53.480 --> 03:19:57.820]
can I, we'll take a 30 seconds issue. We have no format on the station. I just got to play this

[03:19:57.820 --> 03:20:02.560]
again in honor of tonight's big game with San Jose, the Panthers 730 in the arena. Don Cherry says,

[03:20:02.640 --> 03:20:07.880]
Ray, wait, let's just throw him in 13 goals. The best point now in the world. Given away from Edmonton,

[03:20:07.880 --> 03:20:13.160]
used to be a stick point. He's that high. The best point guy I saw him last night. Unbelievable.

[03:20:13.540 --> 03:20:18.440]
13 goals. He's been, nobody's talking about him. All spare that the two Barnes has gone that Ray

[03:20:18.440 --> 03:20:22.740]
would come in. Now you're unbelievable. Okay, just a little guy worth a mass. I still like a

[03:20:22.740 --> 03:20:27.300]
Duggy Gilmore on the points. Been pretty super too. So Duggy's been good. Duggy, I love you. But you

[03:20:27.300 --> 03:20:36.000]
Ray is better right now. 13 goals. Yeah. The Neil Roger show now on sports radio 560 WQAM, Miami

[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:44.180]
Fort Lauderdale. At three o'clock, I'm Cory's two o'clock. I'm Cory saving with the

[03:20:45.660 --> 03:20:51.520]
I want to talk to Neil for a minute if he's still there. Like you know, like he says, there's no

[03:20:51.520 --> 03:20:57.260]
floor mat here. I thought to them. I got to tell him one story. Are you still there? Sure.

[03:20:57.920 --> 03:21:02.980]
I can't get out of here that fast. I go to the fight that I went to. I think it was the Whitaker,

[03:21:04.560 --> 03:21:11.280]
the Whitaker Delahue fight. And I'm walking through ringside and there's Larry sitting there with his

[03:21:11.280 --> 03:21:19.160]
current wife then his fiancee. By the way, he's not a bad looking woman. And he stops me. Not

[03:21:19.160 --> 03:21:25.140]
hello. How are you? Not so much like that. All he says to me is, so his Neil Roger's really getting

[03:21:25.140 --> 03:21:30.180]
a million dollars from you Ray. I station. First thing out of his mouth. I hadn't seen him in a

[03:21:30.180 --> 03:21:35.280]
couple of years. Don't be 50 dollars. You can do that now. And you should have said to him,

[03:21:35.280 --> 03:21:39.900]
well, when you paying all those people back, do you remember no seriously about two years ago?

[03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:45.380]
That two years, exactly. I know most of them two years ago that his PR people put a big thing

[03:21:45.380 --> 03:21:50.020]
like in the tabloids. All Larry's getting a pangs of guilty conscience. He's making millions and

[03:21:50.020 --> 03:21:53.960]
millions. He's going to go back and make amends and pay back everybody that he owed all that money.

[03:21:54.260 --> 03:21:58.780]
Hold your breath, baby. They're not a Chinaman's chance in hell. Never pay any. And you know over at

[03:21:59.440 --> 03:22:02.740]
Gulfstream, I don't know if you know about the Larry King Memorial drawer they've got with all the

[03:22:02.740 --> 03:22:07.880]
bounds checks. You ask the people over there ask a papi harness in those guys. He's still around.

[03:22:08.140 --> 03:22:11.720]
And our harness is not there anymore. You don't come to the flood to the Thurbridge anymore.

[03:22:11.960 --> 03:22:15.760]
They'll come out there. Another Gulfster is Durkin coming down. Oh yeah. I'll be there.

[03:22:15.920 --> 03:22:20.200]
Yeah. Durkin starts Saturday. Now that I'm making the big bucks, I'll come there and make my

[03:22:20.200 --> 03:22:25.800]
contribution. Got a freedom. He's stoneless in the me. Anyway, it's good to have you here. Okay?

[03:22:25.800 --> 03:22:29.940]
Well, I will talk. I'll see. We're going to kick. We're going to kick some ass. It'll be good to do that.

[03:22:30.640 --> 03:22:37.280]
Okay. The O'Rodgers daily, 10 o'clock. Here on. Don't be 50 dollars. How can we call the sports radio

[03:22:37.640 --> 03:22:44.100]
560 now? It's sports and Neil. But I'm sure our creative people are together now. You have

[03:22:44.100 --> 03:22:49.200]
something you want to do here? I was going to do the update, but wow. Add to a clock. I'm going to

[03:22:49.200 --> 03:22:55.140]
do it. Cory. I appreciate it. The earliest update I've ever seen. Cory saving with the QAM sports

[03:22:55.140 --> 03:22:59.800]
update. Panthers at the ice night with the sharks. They're home at the arena. The first of a few

[03:22:59.800 --> 03:23:03.580]
at home, first of three, as a matter of fact, and John Van B's brook says they've been playing well,

[03:23:03.720 --> 03:23:08.860]
lately. In Gritty efforts, you know, you get goals and it's funny. We've been paying a lot of

[03:23:08.860 --> 03:23:14.020]
attention to our own end and we got five goals last night, six goals. Night Gran, and we got a

[03:23:14.020 --> 03:23:19.600]
couple of fortune to break. But we did. We had to do Victor cause off. I'll go against this

[03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:24.960]
former team while Dave Lowry and Tom with San Jose face off at seven on sports radio 560 QAM.

[03:23:25.320 --> 03:23:29.120]
The heat on the court in Cleveland, and they're in Charlotte before coming back on Saturday against

[03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:34.120]
the spurs. Tip off at seven thirty tonight. The Alamo Bowl number 17 Purdue. Great and three.

[03:23:34.200 --> 03:23:38.340]
They meet number 24 Oklahoma State. They can three kick off at eight. Penn State Junior running

[03:23:38.340 --> 03:23:42.240]
back Curtis. He says he'll leave Penn State early. Make himself available for the NFL draft.

[03:23:42.640 --> 03:23:46.140]
Tomorrow the hurricane's on the court at seat and all tonight. The Pittsburgh Syracuse

[03:23:46.140 --> 03:23:50.880]
game post phone. Cusses snow. Stand top of your game every 20 minutes only on

[03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:52.720]
sports radio 560 QAM.

[03:23:59.420 --> 03:24:02.700]
It's time. Yeah. Yeah baby.

[03:24:04.220 --> 03:24:09.300]
Detox sports with Hank Goldberg. You have some rich ears.

[03:24:09.300 --> 03:24:12.780]
Has an order to find wine. Women,

[03:24:13.040 --> 03:24:17.200]
mortgain, and men want to be on sports radio 560.

[03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:20.360]
Why must I be surrounded by wicked idiots?
