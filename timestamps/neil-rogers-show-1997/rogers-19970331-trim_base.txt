[00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.260]
BORN AN ABSOLUTE ASS FOR YOU ARE

[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.340]
Hey guys, how do you like your steak?

[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.140]
I want something with a little kick, something with some bowl

[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.120]
I want something so spicy it gets me right over here and over here

[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.120]
Yeah, here, here and even here, right in my fucking fresh steak

[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.320]
Yeah, something bowl, the steaks are so bowl that if I put it over my s*** I couldn't fit for a wink

[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.920]
Yeah, bowl, the steaks are so bowl that if I shoved it up my ass I could breathe fire for a month

[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.180]
Hey, that's pretty f***ing bowl

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.720]
H1 Bold Steaks Sauce for guys who like their steak with big flavor

[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.980]
H1 Bold is for you

[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.540]
I want a steak sauce so bowled, so bowlsy that if I eat a whole bottle I'll have a flame coming out of my ass like the freaking space shuttle

[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.580]
Hey, hey, calm down over there, it's just a f***ing steak sauce, H1 Bold Steaks Sauce

[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.360]
Now that's bold

[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.740]
Twenty after a tent at WID pour some on your apple sauce and you're putting by the way before you off yourself

[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.620]
By the way, he didn't have cancer

[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.120]
Oh, sorry, damn it, too late now and they were all castrated too by the way

[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.820]
Because naturally all of them are just most of them

[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.880]
I think all of them, well maybe not the women

[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.540]
They were castrated, they had their things cut off, what do you mean most of them?

[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.380]
I thought they were all castrated

[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.900]
The initial report said that some of the males were castrated, I didn't hear the one on the other

[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.180]
Yeah, but didn't hear what the coroner said

[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.640]
You call that a penis?

[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.600]
Exactly, they were castrated, man

[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.600]
They were ballast and brainless

[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.240]
But they were very nice people

[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.040]
When is the media going to stop with this crap?

[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.240]
Tell us about what they were morons, they were idiots, they were people with no lives

[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.840]
The one guy for crying out loud even went to U of M

[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.960]
Do you know any more than that?

[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.620]
No life, morons, idiots, dummies, buying into a bunch of bull crap

[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.180]
And they're going to get on the comets coming

[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.160]
And they're all of a sudden going to shed these bodies

[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.740]
And they're going to wind up on serious

[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.980]
And they're going to, what are they going to do up there?

[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.020]
Now that they're castrated, they're evidently not going to have too good of a time up there

[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.940]
So what's the point when you come right down to it?

[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.680]
Of course he was a fag

[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.080]
Here's the Miami, hello

[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.100]
Hi Uncle Neil

[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.600]
Yes sir

[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.200]
Actually the castration was based on a coin toss, no lie

[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.960]
No

[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.560]
Yes

[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.580]
Yes

[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.740]
Yeah, because one guy who didn't go...

[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.420]
Tales or head

[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.420]
Well that's the question didn't it?

[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.500]
That's what Marshall Apple what you said, Tales or Head

[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.200]
One of the survivors actually was on the news

[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.400]
Right, two nights ago, one guy didn't go the all the way I guess

[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.740]
And he said he was one of the lucky ones

[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.940]
Because he just had a daughter I guess

[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.040]
So, yeah

[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.920]
Kind of crazy

[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.880]
But I called him actually one of the things I think is funny

[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.880]
You notice how every few years they have these people and statues that have stigmoda

[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.520]
You know and they have blood from their palms etc

[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.260]
Yeah

[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.260]
The stupid thing about that is that Jesus was nailed and is rusted his hands

[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.460]
So he wouldn't be bleeding from the palms of his hands

[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.980]
But how could you have palm Sunday?

[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.800]
What are you going to have rists?

[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.160]
How about Limprist Sunday?

[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.620]
First thing I like hash Wednesday

[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.920]
Limprist Sunday ain't bad that they celebrate that at the Vatican, I guarantee you that

[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.600]
Sure

[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.280]
Uh huh

[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.000]
And they got that right close for it

[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.660]
Yeah huh

[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.520]
Anyway, I can there you have people believe this crap you know what?

[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.400]
How can people I mean the people who lived then 2000 years ago they said

[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.620]
Who the hell are you kidding?

[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.400]
And those were the dumbest most superstitious people of all and they didn't believe it

[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.060]
T.T. Barnum and Ripley were the ones who were in the right line of business

[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.340]
Jesus God and Joseph

[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.820]
They were yanking people's money

[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.240]
Okay, God bless you my son

[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.320]
See ya

[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.240]
Dade County 622 come on let's get some spy reports on that Sintillating Game On Saturday

[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.900]
Let's go

[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.700]
Go out of town for a couple of days for a nice weekend

[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.500]
I don't want to mention I had Laura C. Quart ice cream at the Eaton Center that would be bad

[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.820]
But uh go out of town for a couple of days come back and wait and get filled in

[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.240]
I'm sure I missed a dynamic performance in section 124

[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.820]
Hey ref you suck yeah right

[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.440]
We're gonna lynch that damn rat guy today or what once the next home game uh when is the next week

[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.680]
God we're on the road all week what a pleasure what a Machia we have like a little break now

[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.720]
Next home game where lynch in the rat man up there in 124

[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.040]
I still think it's a good idea instead of having the a mascot instead of having Stanley C. Pantheos slide down that thing before the game

[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.060]
We're just gonna let that we're gonna grease that thing up real good and let the rat man slide down it from about 600 feet above

[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.080]
Hey rat man you suck

[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.660]
What an asshole like I is I mean you know it was great during the playoffs all the enthusiasm

[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.540]
But this guy's out of control doesn't have any idea he fits in like a glove because he has no idea what the game is all about

[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.600]
And these people the loudest ones are the ones that don't know what they're talking about ever notice that like on those talk shows oh sorry

[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.840]
Here's plantation hello

[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.020]
But I will play it in a few minutes

[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.600]
Okay thank you very much

[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.680]

[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.560]
Okay thank you

[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.980]

[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.420]

Okay and don't listen to kid curry he'll kill you

[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.100]
Okay

[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.120]
Wow

[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.220]
So that was the guy

[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.920]
Yeah

[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.320]
Friday

[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.360]
Asmr to where he's out there I'm getting in my car

[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.600]
Right

[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.880]
And he comes right up to the window

[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.660]
He was okay it was a good guy

[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.200]
I heard about the incident after the fact and I was concerned

[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.800]
What incident?

[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.800]
That this guy blocked your car in and accosted you out in the parking lot

[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.700]
Didn't accost me?

[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.380]
Well that's what they mean

[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.820]
He wanted to hear some stupid bit this morning I said

[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.220]
Okay man whatever you want he's an Indian guy

[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.800]
He's an Indian guy

[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.940]
He said can I ask something and I said what's that?

[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.060]
He didn't have no dot

[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.340]
How come only the women have the dot?

[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.940]
What does that mean?

[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.340]
That they're circumcised?

[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.760]
What is that what's the significance?

[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.860]
I'm sure it means something

[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.700]
Is it like putting the ashes on your forehead?

[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.100]
Oh thank God we don't do those ridiculous barbaric stupid idiotic things anymore in the world today

[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.820]
Thank the Lord

[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.860]
Thank God that the Orthodox Jews aren't the

[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.160]
And then that course I haven't even commented on that because it's so typical

[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.080]
Or the Orthodox Jews now or they had a big thing on the CNN over the weekend about that

[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.000]
That's right if you're not real super orthodox you're not like a real Jew

[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]
No matter how close they cut it to the bone

[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.780]
No matter how little you got left like in my case

[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.420]
You're still not no matter how many how many how many how many how many how many how many how many how many touched you eat

[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.500]
You're still out of real Jew

[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.360]
Only they got the answers

[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.700]
And you want to know why?

[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.060]
Because they're just like the right wing Christians man they're crazy

[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.820]
You're in a bed bug

[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.520]
Well we don't like your views on homosexuality and about abortion and all this other crap

[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.320]
Sounds familiar huh?

[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.740]
So when you're talking religious fanatics it don't make any difference whether they're Jews or goyem or Arabs or whatever they are

[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.380]
In fact when you talk in religion in general, why is he starting with this today on Easter Monday?

[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.860]
And how come Ron and Ron were on tape by the way this morning? That's what I would like to know

[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.640]
For Easter in honor of Easter Monday, what the hell is that all about?

[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.320]
And they still played a tape where we had all kinds of technical problems because we didn't want you to feel like you couldn't relate to it

[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.840]
Broward County were waiting on you this morning

[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.980]
It's gonna be one of those days make no mistake about it's gonna be a deadly Monday

[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.000]
I resigned myself to that fact before even walked in the door this morning. I said it's Monday

[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.560]
You just you can kind of feel it you can smell it you can smell it in the air

[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.520]
So let's hear about that great game on Saturday come on

[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:34.540]
Man talk about synthetic and artificial even at poor bastard with the artificial legs in the closet that made the front page of the paper this morning

[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.300]
Even he never saw anything so artificial is this a town

[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.580]
They're really into it man. They're smoldering. They're just really yeah, right tell me another good one

[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:50.280]
1026 at W. I. O. D. I got something in my hand right now that's famous no not that I'm talking about Wolfe's menu

[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.260]
Look at that there it is

[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:58.020]
That's the same red and yellow and white for a hundred and fifty thousand years that wolfies has been famous for and they got the exact same

[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.080]
Great wolfies menu at the brand new wolfies right here in Hollywood and they are

[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.680]
Jammin it there is what I understand they are packing it in there in the food too

[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.060]
You can go to breakfast starting at seven o'clock in the a and wolfies and get a complete breakfast starting at only

[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.760]
$2.22 and they got all the great things like I said that wolfies is famous for

[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:19.300]
pancakes and waffles and french toast and omelettes and every kind of egg dish out of the sun upside down and straight side up

[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.860]
They got lunch specials every day starting from 3.95 during the weekdays

[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:29.140]
And they've got the early bird every afternoon between three and five or just six 95 and a little bit more for a complete dinner

[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.820]
If you mentioned Neil sent you Monday through Thursday

[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.640]

[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.920]
Unshared in street right across from ty park in the park shared in plaza got it

[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.240]
I

[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.780]
My own grandpa

[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.040]
I'm my own grandpa

[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:23.680]
Yes, I am sounds funny. I know but it really is so yes, I'm my own grandpa

[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.600]
Many many years ago when I was 23 I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be

[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.880]
This widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair a red my father fell in love with her and soon they two were wet

[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.760]
This made my dad my son-in-law and changed my very life for my daughter was my mother

[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.740]
Because she was my father's wife to complicate the matter even though it brought me joy

[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:53.980]
I soon became the father of the bouncing baby boy my little baby them became a brother-in-law to dad

[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.200]
And soon became my uncle though it made me very sad

[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.000]
Or if he was my uncle then that also made him brother of the widows grown-up daughter

[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.680]
Who of course was my stepmother

[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.920]
Fathers wife then had a son who kept them on the run and he became my grandchild because he was my daughter son

[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.240]
My wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue because although she is my wife

[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:21.640]
She's my grandmother too if my wife is my grandmother then I'm her grandchild and every time I think of it

[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:28.060]
It nearly drives me wild where now I have become the strangest case you ever saw as husband of my grandmother

[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.840]
I am my own grandpa

[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:30.920]
Oh

[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.300]
My own grandpa

[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.180]
It sounds funny. I know but it really is so yes, I'm my own grandpa

[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.200]
1032 at W.I.O.D. I wonder why that is George. What do you think the reason for that be?

[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.320]
I don't know I have no idea and quite frankly couldn't care less

[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.920]
We have an open line in a mobile one purple line pound I.O.D. Let's hear about that game Saturday not

[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.360]
Oh my god

[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.860]
So and Michael Mayo by the way has a big column into paper. I knew sooner or later he'd come around not

[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.500]
That's right. Guess what he's writing about this morning in a sunsendal

[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.800]
He's writing about and I checked the weekend papers just to make sure okay

[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.960]
What is with this overhead by the way George? This thing sounds like crap

[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.960]
It sounds like direct today. What the hell? I love these weekends. I love coming in on

[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.240]
Monday and over the weekend Friday everything was great

[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.040]
It was sensational and you coming on a Monday no matter where you're working

[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.460]
It's like everything's been reconfigured and rescued around and it sounds bizarre man. It sounds bizarre

[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.780]
So what does Michael Mayo write about a whole big column on the back page?

[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.040]
Of course on the sunsendal sports section today where it belongs so he can wipe his ass with it

[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.480]
musters revenge sweet as apple pie

[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.240]
Tomas mooster muster fooster whatever the hell is name is a bunch of tennis crap

[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.540]
Now we know that once upon a time when he was like a little boy Michael Mayo used to write about tennis

[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.520]
Before he'd like graduated beyond that and wrote about real sports

[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.160]
But now it is you write a whole column look at that the whole damn page long about tennis

[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.440]
Does he mention anything in there? I noticed Tom jicke wrote a big column about David Halberstam

[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.680]
And what a great guy he is and how Eddie Kaplan likes him. He never stole a freight train nice go and Tom

[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.180]
By the way get rid of that picture. You look like an old fart on the chemo therapy

[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.720]
Have you seen that picture a jicke in the paper the one where he looks like he's done 20 years of chemo

[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.380]
I'm serious. I mean, I know we're all getting older Tom good come on

[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.600]
Talk about on flattering

[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:30.540]
So nice job Michael Mayo as you continue not to do what you promised you would do and you just don't have the scrotum to do it

[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.740]
Man, it pisses me off

[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.720]
Is there anybody in this town who's not a bull crap artist? That's what I'd like to know

[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.940]
Just one bull crap artist after another. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna write a retraction

[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.960]
I'm gonna at least write that I wish I wouldn't have written that last thing and I don't want to see the guy fired

[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.260]
Well, he's not getting fired. I realized that but why don't you live up to what you promised? We heard it right here on this show

[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.560]
You jack as you why can't you do it?

[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.000]
I mean if you got that much space why can't you like why we you know they put the little stars near the little ass to risk

[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.320]
Maybe you don't want to risk his ass. Maybe the sun sent a won't let him put it in there. That's what I'm hearing

[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.740]
Are you that much of a pussy that you're letting the newspaper dictate what you're gonna put in your column?

[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:11.280]
I noticed they didn't have any objections to the first column when you ripped David Halberstam and asked and asked for him to be fired

[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.200]
Which I think we ought to get a firing squad for Michael Mayo get him and the guy the rat guy from the hockey games

[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.900]
Get the two of them together and take care of their ass right now

[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.540]
There you go the rat guy and

[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.620]
Speaking of newspapers and bizarre things and how come we haven't had a call about this yet this morning

[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.760]
Of course we haven't had a call about too much. It's Monday. What do you expect?

[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.700]
There's a thing in the living arts section in the herald today

[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.260]
Which I don't read the heraldota was laying around the price was right it was free

[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.760]
And I look in here and it says play ball is the cubs take the pro player field on opening day

[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.840]
We compare the goods and vads of south Florida versus those of the windy city

[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.680]
And it's got a list it doesn't say who wrote this crap. It just says the list

[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.040]
Okay

[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.200]
And if I were whoever responsible for this column

[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.260]
I wouldn't put my name on this piece of crap either

[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.420]
And it goes on about opening day 1997 the cubs visit the marlins at joe robby stadium

[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.900]
Bapapapapah this and it says let's not fall into rampant homoism here

[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.580]
Even though the cubs have about as much chance of reaching the world series this year as Neil Rogers

[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.380]
And the marlins look like fierce fish indeed

[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.060]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.520]
They have about as much chance of reaching the world series this year as Neil Rogers

[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.160]
I got news for you guys. I'm probably going to be going to the world series whether anybody knows it or not

[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.240]
And then it goes on to compare you know what they got in Chicago

[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.200]
What we got here like as if there's some comparison between the two cities other than the weather

[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.260]
Taking the weather out which we can't control

[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.920]
Like it says they have deep dish Chicago style pizza. We got rice and beans. Okay

[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.560]
We got arroz con uh, no that's the chicken. We got rice and beans

[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.060]
They got deep dish pizza the greatest uh, if you like that stuff

[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.040]
Which weighs about 85 pounds of pie and we got rice and beans

[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.260]
As in great

[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.200]
I rest my case they got here e Carter. We got rid of Gary Carter

[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:11.340]
They got holy cow we have in the wind column. Oh geez not yo angel with that contrived excitement again

[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:18.020]
But anyway, it's in that they have Sally fits we had Sally fits as in

[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.800]
So at any rate great column again and what the hell my name

[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.820]
I guess it's just a gratuitous way to drop my name in as if saying we got Neil Rogers and they don't

[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:26.540]
uh

[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.060]
Which is the only thing beside the weather that we got here that's worthwhile because the rest of it

[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:37.480]
Trying to compare this town as Chicago is a joke. I mean Chicago is one of the few big cities in this country where it's like clean

[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.660]
Clean I'm not talking about Cicero now

[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:46.020]
I'm talking about downtown the loop like most of the city you know where the white people are

[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:51.400]
It's clean. It's beautiful. It's great. The food is great. Rostread is great. Everything is great

[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.720]
But uh, hey

[00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:01.360]
But we got nice weather here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I went through the game Saturday. All right. Here we go. Here's the report

[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.100]
I've missed the game in four years. Yes

[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:11.320]
Worst crowd in history of the world. What do you mean size? No yahu's. Oh, I mean they were cheering and you saw

[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.180]
And they were cheering for miss checks. Yeah, I mean it was terrible

[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.100]
I don't I don't think anybody knew anything about hockey. They don't they I mean

[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:22.300]
It's the fourth year almost over now and they still know nothing this crowd

[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.940]
I mean I said here day after day trying to just have even if I take 10 minutes out of the day to have a meaningful

[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.620]
Conversation about the greatest sport in the world and these people here know nothing

[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.580]
They don't know what they're watching out there and half of them left during the third period

[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.180]
I like it with 20 minutes and it was like 15 minutes left to go nice

[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:43.580]
Well, it's a boring game too. By the way, notice another shorthanded goal against us there. Robbie's Amateur

[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.980]
Yeah, hell of a player by the way and did you know that a Robbie Nearmer was a member of heaven's gate cult?

[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.580]
He doesn't have a pair. Yeah, I know that

[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.480]
And he's waiting to get in by the way

[00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:01.060]
Any any couldn't make it in. Yeah, thanks for the good news. Okay. Sorry. I missed that. Sorry. I wasn't here for that game Saturday

[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.140]
And by the way, who was that sitting in your seats? Probably Jeff Rimmer's wife and some friend

[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.180]
I guess since I gave Farrell the seats because I knew I wasn't gonna be here. I don't want no empty seats

[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.220]
I wanted some asses in those seats, okay

[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:21.340]
But evidently I missed a real coma inducing performance and the rumor has it that Eddie Joe is getting benched or got benched for that game

[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:25.120]
Or whatever the deal is and long overdue is all I can say

[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.800]
Oh, and we had a guy get a home from the uh getting the car at the airport last night

[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.880]
And turn on this radio station and there's guess who was on here doing sports talk

[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.440]
It was right in fact it was the post game show it was

[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.800]
The last minute. Yeah

[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.220]
Doing the post game show after the heat caved in and lost to the raptors no less in Toronto

[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:51.060]
To the raptors no less and then they come on at six o'clock with sports talk which I keep waiting every every few days

[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.100]
We keep hearing that this is the last sports talk show on i.o.d

[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:59.660]
The week you're in that they keep threatening. This is the last sports talk show ever ever well maybe

[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.960]
And then you tune in on the weekend and there's another one

[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.820]
So Phil Ladsman is out with some guy and I'm thinking who is this guy that he's got on with him

[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:12.760]
And what are they arguing about again? I shouldn't even mention it about the stew barn straight and about Chris Wells

[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.920]
And I'm thinking Jesus are you still with that

[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.160]
And the guy's name he had on with him you won't are you ready for this was Saul Steinberg

[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.800]
Saul Steinberg don't wait. He have any glam doing sports in this town just one

[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:35.140]
Just one besides Joe Rose in jimang which okay. Can we have one goi in this town doing sports

[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:42.360]
We got Steinberg and Goldberg and uh what's what's the uh and Goldie what's his name Goldstein

[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.100]
And de Forest who's got a goi chaname but he's another one yet and

[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.080]
Ruben and and uh yeah him too another Jew

[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.480]
And he says this is the Jew crew because it's Easter Sunday night

[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.980]
Just one Jew after another doing sports in this town would be like Michael Mayo

[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.060]
There's another one. What he says name was Mosque of it

[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.820]
I agree with that orthodox rabbi he ain't Jewish. I don't care what the hell that what his name was he ain't Jewish

[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.980]
But what a disgrace this guy is rambling on I guess they were trying to stir up some controversy or something and maybe get a call

[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:21.720]
Which didn't happen but this guy had no idea what he's a guy from channel 10 I guess who does isn't on the year

[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.880]
Thank God, but he's like the sports uh what he he is to channel 10

[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.280]
What Bernie Rose news to be to channel four like an impediment just kidding Bernie

[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.680]
Here's Liberty City hello

[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.720]
You know good morning. No. Yes, sir. All I can say about the hockey is a cartner if it's Joel and Beezer

[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:45.700]
Yeah, they did it. They played good. They played good. Yeah, and everybody else stuck to join out and he's yeah

[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:51.500]
They spunk the joint out and the anti-audience. Uh-huh. But I was listening to the radio. Yeah, but the day before that

[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.700]
If you want to really hear some juicy stuff

[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.600]
Mr. Man, which was in a heated uh

[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.080]
What do you call it? He did what do you call it? Yeah?

[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.620]
Concon conversation with depot about the word cune

[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.020]
And man let me tell you this man was a fooling around that day. Yeah later on today

[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.020]
They were into a cool thing. They were into a cool thing. You know how you

[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.900]
You got hands of free. Yeah, but he never mentioned that word cune as far as the

[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.120]
University of Miami is concerned depot said he did in a paper

[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.440]
But lay around today. Maybe some callers may give you some more juice on that

Infocaine him as as using your material. Yeah, and he denied it

[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:54.000]

Yeah, and also he was and he just he said some Jewish name

[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.480]

Retaining to uh, people, but he said a Jewish name. I couldn't uh, oh my god

[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.940]
Like I just didn't and what a coincidence. I just got through saying all the sports guys this down our Jewish

[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.580]

I've asked him to be on his show 65,000 times and unless the price is right and he gets just exactly the right meal

[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.760]
Etc. And so on he just can't be bothered. He's a star now. He's too big for us

[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:52.520]

[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.360]

[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.700]
Our consultant's gonna be critiquing her performance on and off the air. What's wrong with that?

[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.800]
Here's South Miami. Hello

[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.100]
South Miami

[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.440]
Right here. I'm here. How you doing? You're there. I'm here

[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.780]
Uh, it's one to change the subject a bit if there was one there's no subject on this show

[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:09.340]
The show is for anybody that's got balls enough to pick up the phone. What you got? You're supposed to everybody out

[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.340]
Yes, one of them right now. All right. Okay. I just want to commend you on one thing good

[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:20.300]
About the comment you like you made a reference to about the difference between Italians and Italy and Guitos

[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:27.680]
Yes, for so long I've been trying to explain to people the difference and finally someone finally made it clear to everyone and then as you

[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.500]
Yeah, and I just you know

[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:36.220]
I heard it that day. It just put about everything come together. I mean you're good in Italy

[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.920]
You don't find anybody who's even remotely like the Guitos you find in New York

[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:45.420]
I mean, that's that's not what being Italian is all about an addition to which they bastardized the language and

[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.240]
this

[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.600]
mozzarella and

[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.600]
Cup of ghoul and that there are just like all New Yorkers. They're very arrogant and they insisted

[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.160]
That's the way that real Italians

[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.820]
Pronounced those words and it is not exactly they know nothing about being a titan

[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:02.140]
In fact, most of them probably never been to Italy in their lives and probably wouldn't even get a visa or a mastercard there

[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.920]
Exactly and the other thing I want to talk about two Godfather questions. Yeah

[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:12.340]
Now I bought this book in the bookstore. It's about the Godfather legacy and it said there's a a whole thing together

[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.760]
It's called the Godfather trilogy which scenes that were cut out. Yeah

[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.060]
Do you know anything about this? What do you mean do I know anything about it? I got it got it

[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.460]
Yeah, you go to a real video store and you're buying it. That's what you do

[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.920]
It's a worth getting. I mean of course

[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.480]
Of course if you got 40 50 hours someday when it's a real boring day when it's raining like hell

[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.600]
Which any day in the summer here like on a weekend and you sit there and your pop it in night in the morning and you're

[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:41.520]
All set till about 340 afternoon. It goes on forever. It's great. Okay, and the other question I had and like it says

[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.820]
They've done it in chronological order so it makes sense right

[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.320]
Uh the other question I had that when the senator in the second

[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.140]
Movie is in the hotel my offer to you senator is this nothing

[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:54.460]
Yes

[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:01.080]
When when the girls you know word in the bed someone had told me now I disregard this that he killed her

[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.120]
My whole thing the whole time was that they sent him up that who killed her that uh

[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.540]
He did he was he was in a rage and he killed her in the center. What the hell is that all about of course not there

[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.680]
They were what is that?

[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:19.200]
They made him an offer they couldn't refuse the devotee right well. I don't know what this person was they were on

[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.140]
They were on heavy drugs tell him to take some of tapioca pudding some apple sauce fino barbertole will be okay

[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.300]
There you go. Well, okay, can I call someone a douchebag? Go ahead

[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:34.340]
Andy and Paul your sour wet douchebag. Okay. All right. I'll read it. Are you okay? Reve it action. Ciao

[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.800]
Deadlines wide open here this morning. It's a typical Monday

[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.560]
We've had no women call this morning in the first hour. We're gonna get a woman on during this first hour and not he asked no

[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:50.460]
What oh, yes, we are here's a lady in Hollywood. Hello. I want to know why you're like constantly ripping the fans at the Panther games

[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:55.340]
I mean at least they're the fans that show up consistently and keep selling out that arena

[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.480]
I most of because they don't know what hell is going on

[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.240]
Just showing up just showing up there and putting your ass in the seat doesn't mean you have any idea what's going on

[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:08.780]
Yeah, that's great that it's great that we're I was want to answer do you want an answer? Do you just want to scream?

[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.740]
I'm just learning the game, but at least I show up and I try to get a better knowledge all I ever had here was football

[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:22.020]
Yeah, like I have to educate myself how many years does how many years does it take before people start understanding what's going on in front of them

[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:29.240]
How many years I couldn't afford tickets for a while and I haven't been able to go to the hockey seminars at the Panthers present and another thing is a

[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.940]
Chris Wells has been improving

[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.120]
Chris Wells sucks

[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.500]
Chris Wells blows I mean without Chris Wells there were some games

[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:42.320]
We would have lost because he put up the scoring opportunities. Oh my god. Are you dreaming? Are you on heavy medication?

[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:47.360]
No, not at all. Are you sleeping with Bill Cosby? Are you eating jello pudding by the graceful?

[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.700]
No, but you're never saying anything positive

[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.120]
Chris Wells blows

[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.620]
Chris Wells blows, okay when somebody plays good out there. I'll tell you oh god, but be very objective

[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.080]
You're trying to make a case for a kid that can't play the game. Now he's talking kaka

[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:07.120]
You've been rimerized hard work against the board. It's game. Yeah, me a break is first you admit that you don't know

[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.660]
I think about the game and I want to sudden because you like the way he looks or you like his mustache or whatever it is

[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:16.740]
You're like your clueless Chris Wells is not a player sweetheart. He's not a player. He blows

[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.060]
But don't you remember they said he's a project player? We don't need no project

[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.800]
So okay, we can't we were in the Stanley Cup finals last year

[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.600]
You don't trade away establish good players that score a lot of goals

[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.640]
Especially when you got a team that can't score

[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:35.080]
Well, I admit that that we can't score any goals. We don't score. How many goals did we score? How many do we score on on Saturday?

[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:40.020]
Getting rid of one was a mistake, okay? Because it threw all the players off

[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.620]
But still we've got destroyed the chemistry of the team destroyed the chemistry of the team

[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.720]
There's no point of rehashing it. It's it was a bad deal

[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:53.000]
And these people out there who just professional askissers no matter what Brian Marie does no matter what they're saying

[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.280]
Oh, yes or yes or yeah, and you want to know why because they don't know anything

[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:02.080]
I was not pleased in the beginning, but I'm happy now. Well, I'm glad you're happy. Thank you. Okay, go Panthers

[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.460]
Get out of here

[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:10.120]
Okay, we have Broward lines open 7-6 how you constantly? I'm the one that got everybody to go out there in the first place

[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.520]
Which he forgets conveniently

[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.500]
I'm the one that tried to say hey football is boring for crying out loud

[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:20.560]
In fact, I was reading an article yesterday, which by the way too bad about Michigan losing the championship game

[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.280]
In fact, they didn't even get in the championship game. They got beat by Boston by BU

[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.960]
In a semi-final in the college thing

[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.720]
But at any rate there was a big piece in one of the papers over the weekend about all the kids at Michigan now

[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.520]
You can't get a ticket to a university of Michigan hockey game

[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.360]
Whereas of course football used to be the only thing on campus and yesterday still jam

[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.980]
107,000 people in an and our Bernest Ateam

[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.640]
But nevertheless hockey is next to footballs the hottest thing going on at campus

[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.560]
Because a lot of the students have discovered this is where the action is

[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.060]
This is the greatest sport in the world and I'm the one that turned everybody on to a penile of a sudden

[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.880]
They're the experts and because I just won't go along with the pogrom all of a sudden. I'm a bad guy

[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.500]
Okay, Chris Wells god. Yeah, there you go. Oh god. I love him

[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.020]
He's the best

[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.320]
1057 hey ref you suck

[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.720]
1057 a W I O D

[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.220]
Don't get weird on us. It's only radio

[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.980]
16 W I O D Miami Fort Lauderdale

[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.200]
In the 50s Robert Young made people laugh and father knows best now

[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:31.620]
This great series is back starring a few Catholic priests who like it young in the return of father knows best

[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:37.540]
Step into the confessional Billy. I don't know father. This makes the 47th time. I've been in there this way

[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.880]
Oh Billy you want to be a good Catholic don't you? Yeah, but does everybody get a spanking?

[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:49.280]
Father knows best. It's the Vatican's best kept secret and you've got a private seat for all the fun

[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.500]
Just enter the rectory from the rear all right Billy boy. It's time for your flute lesson

[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:59.980]
But father your flute has only one hole and it doesn't make you deno. Oh, it will Billy. It will

[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:07.420]
Father knows best once you've seen this new sitcom you'll wonder why you've never heard about it

[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.100]
Let me introduce you to Saint Peter

[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:17.600]
Father knows best going to church may not seem very entertaining, but there really is something funny going on here

[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.320]
Today's the day

[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.640]
El Prasio

[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:44.460]
It's fallen now we stand by his window calling come and jump with me

[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:53.840]
My stocks are fading even though I don't some heavy trading

[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:59.420]
To hit the pavement I'm in there sub-pating come and jump with me

[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.420]
oh

[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.700]
Mark it's crashing my life is flashing before my very eye

[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.260]
I'm

[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.160]
Never call things

[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.600]
Now I'm standing

[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:27.020]
50 floors above where I'll be landing oh, I'm family I will be stranded

[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.600]
Come and jump with me

[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.860]
Okay, oh the economy

[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.380]
Wow

[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:40.860]
100 me that thing that you're always dropping so fast that even leaping Lee is getting hemorrhoids

[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:48.080]
Okay, it's down 136 you can't even you can't even follow the bouncing arrow on CNBC and the NASDAQ's down 22

[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.580]
This could be the day baby by the end of the day. We're all wiped out

[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.540]
Okay, look at those phones man speaking of wiped out

[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.320]
We got all the day lines are open 62 to W.I.O.D

[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.440]
We have all the powered lines are open 767 W.I.O.D

[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.480]
We got one call on the board here at 11 o'clock

[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.840]
On a Monday is this beautiful or what no wonder we had Saul Steinberg on here the other night

[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:13.120]
We are just desperate we're gasping for oxygen here reaching out to testicles and tentacles

[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.580]
And what do we get that one sour bitch on air how come I don't know anything about the game give me a chance

[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.720]
But but but but then she goes on to elect you about what a great player number 23 is which I don't want to mention his game a name again

[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:31.080]
Anyway, screw these people. Okay. I got a great three-page facts here with a naked picture of Josh Moral who plays Nick on a young and a horny

[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.600]
It says many of you know him as Nick on the CBS soap opera the young and arrestless

[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.200]
But I knew Josh way before that big break happened

[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:43.200]
I mean as this from a guy or a whatever doesn't say but it does say he's straight damn it

[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.600]
Uh getting on a soap changes your life suddenly you've got money people start recognizing you start getting strange letters from W.I.K.D.

[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.340]
I'll tell you a secret being on a soap isn't really any big deal not out here

[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.840]
It's great because it's work and actors want to work

[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.120]
But it's considered pretty low on the entertainment food chain

[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:03.400]
Personally, I have a group of friends who are working actors several of them on soaps some of them drop the soap

[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:09.240]
We think of it is a job and we don't think of our friends as celebrities or any of that foolishness

[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.640]
Josh loves to perform

[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:17.580]
It says he loves the camera. He used to do theater out in the valley anything to have an audience

[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:21.000]
He used to call me up all the time and say let's go shoot squirt squirt

[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.940]
He'd say I remember he always used to say Marco. You're the man you the man

[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.180]
Bruce Weber also like Josh Bruce loved Andre too

[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.240]
He used to call my house in the middle of the night to talk to Andre

[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.400]
Anyway, Bruce had a hand money to Josh so we'd eat a right and work out

[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:40.200]
Josh like getting naked for pictures. It says he has uh had a freedom about that

[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.820]
He's a big flirt and a very girl crazy guy most of the time. Yes, he's straight

[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:49.560]
And it goes on and on and on Josh and I shot pictures many times we shot together

[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.720]
Squirt squirt many times at Griffin's

[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:57.440]
Griffith Park we shot at the nude beach and in my backyard. We shot out at Madador beach one time too

[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:04.060]
This must be somebody to know as the JC by the way and you notice we don't see him around here no more since he got the haircut

[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:08.440]
That's the end of him since he looks that good. You'll never see that child again no more

[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.900]
So evidently this is some fag model out there who used to get naked with Josh and look a lot

[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:23.660]
Dead County 6229 463 6222 W. I. O. D. Here's Portland. Hello. Hey main or Oregon. Oregon. Oh boy. Why I'm glad to be the hell out of there

I hope you're ready for this. This is the beginning of the summer yet

[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.360]
You don't realize this lot of people think it's the beginning of the spring wrong

[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:51.320]
Once Easter is over and then especially paysock the seasons over the parties over baby

[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:59.420]
I see highly a park they had 6500 people there yesterday on a Sunday no less on a Sunday. Oh my god man

[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.560]
Dead or then dead now the seasons over now

I'll just for making the emerald coast as popular as it is now. I couldn't get in there myself last night

[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.020]
Actually, if they knew who the hell I was

[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.400]
If they knew who I was when John went in there if we they knew us they would have said hey

[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:18.380]
We'll clear a table aside for you now mr. hot shot. Here you go. You go right in there and eat your hearts content

[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.460]
If they realized I'm making them millionaires the richest chinks in town

[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.180]
But do they have any idea who I am? Do I look for any special treatment there? You damn right? I do am I getting it?

[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.920]
No, am I pissed off? Yes

[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:36.780]
They should be treating me with velvet gloves in that joint. I'm packing that joint morning noon and night every month. I can don't

[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.040]
I stick and

[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:44.880]
Of course with publics decide to be very from yesterday on Easter Sunday and closing a lot of people you know they were eating out

[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:52.280]
All the Jews all the kids were eating out there yesterday all the real old ancient geriatric blue hairs

[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:59.400]
Dave County 6229 463 every line and dead is dead is dead is a date is a door meal. Here's plantation. Hello

[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.900]
Why are you picking one night? Oh god here's Hollywood. Hello

[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:11.920]
Hollywood hi, yes, sir. Go along with your Portland West Coast call. I was just out in California. I thought I told it

[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:15.060]
I heard your old pill handry out there. Yeah

[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.680]
Yep, congratulations. We're getting out of here. What's that he's no dummy. He got the hell out of here

[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:25.640]
Yeah, he was on late at night that out there, but uh, what is on late at night you need to

[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:30.300]
You need to get out there somewhere. I mean they have a lot of mediocre shows

[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.400]
But I tell you people here don't realize what we got with you now

[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.700]
But they're dead heads here. That's the thing that's the only thing besides working for this company

[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.780]
That's the only thing that's a negative is the fact that these people are impossible to get through

[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.720]
You have to beat him over the head with a sledgehammer

[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.420]
I mean out there if you try to have an intelligent or even a goofball conversation with these people about anything

[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:53.220]
It's not just hockey. It's anything. They don't know from nothing other than early bird dinners

[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.500]
That's the only thing they know about they know nothing here

[00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:01.080]
I tell you with that stuff that went down in Rancho. I was dying to come back here just to hear your talk, you know

[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:06.840]
Because I missed all that. Yeah, you miss what there's nobody talking about it. No, there's nobody talking about that here

[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.620]
I think this guy's name is apple sauce. They don't know who the hell he is

[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:12.860]
Yeah, well

[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.100]
Good luck you now thanks. I'll eat it pal. Thanks a lot

[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.960]
What that what would you like? I've been asking the question for a hundred years. It'll never change

[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.120]
Never change don't get all worked up about it especially on a Monday

[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.960]
Just relax now that you're finally getting your health back now that you're mouthing your tongue and your ears and your

[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:33.240]
Ennows that the pieces of your head are finally starting to fall back into place again don't get all worked up about these bastards

[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:39.220]
And that bitch that calls before giving me a lecture because she don't like what I have to say about the team

[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.960]
Who knows nothing about it? But now she's an expert because she went to a couple of games

[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.920]
So now she knows everything and how dear I say all of this and etc. Even though it is true of course

[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.440]
They can't handle the truth. Okay, it's just like the religion bull crap

[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:56.240]
They can't handle they can't cope with the fact that they've been lied to all of their lives

[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:01.700]
And they've been so stupid that they never just took five minutes to sit down and think to themselves is this possible

[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:07.540]
All these bubble mice is is there any logic? Is there any sense to it? Oh, there's no logic after that faith

[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.020]
Yeah, that's what Ralph Reed says

[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:14.740]
You have to have faith to be as much of a bigoted little prick as he is that's what you have to do you have to have faith

[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.280]
And now I see speaking a bigoted little prick they put the

[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.120]
Buchanan he ain't got nothing to run for now. He's back on CNN and by the way

[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:29.120]
How come David Halberstin gets in all kind of trouble because he said something that I thought was like much

[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.880]
You do about nothing about Tom Jefferson and the slaves he gets into a big jackpot Ted Turner

[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.640]
He says the other day that it's great that these and I agree with him by the way

[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.940]
But he comes out and he says that it's great that these people off themselves

[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.920]
They didn't run into McDonald's and shoot anybody else they killed themselves

[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.180]
So we got rid of 39 assholes and I scow and Ted

[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.720]
Nobody got pissed off about that

[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:55.720]
I don't see anybody saying Ted Turner ought to get fired course. He's the boss who we can't get fired

[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.960]
I don't see anybody getting all bent out of shape about it

[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:02.060]
Screamin's an anethnic thing, huh? That was an erasial thing

[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:04.740]
Oh

[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.140]
So in other words if uh, Tom Jefferson had white slaves it would have been all right

[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.520]
Is that what you saying or if he had crazy slaves

[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.280]
You can insult crazy people. How do you know they weren't crazy

[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:20.280]
After you go out there and pick all that cotton man in that hot summer sun trust me

[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.400]
You wind up in plantation

[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.300]
We have a broward lines wide open here. This is brutal today man

[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:31.720]
If this is the best you guys can do I'm I'm a heave and that music on it. We're playing Gacy the rest of the day

[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.800]
We're gonna play disco all day long until this audience finally gets with it

[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.760]
7679 463 three open lines at brown. We got people killing themselves out there in the name of religion

[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.960]
We got people killing each other. Let's hear about the Middle East peace talks talk about an oxymoron

[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:55.800]
Everyday we got another story about people killing kids killing each other the Jews and the Arabs and the Arabs and the Jews

[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.420]
And then the orthodox Jews here are huckin and china kabat unless you eat another the right kind of humontation

[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:04.220]
You're not quite you're not a real Jew and they're eating the little cookie ones

[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.660]
They're eating the little triangle cookie ones and they think they know something about being a real Jew

[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.380]
They know nothing about it

[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.400]
And it just goes on and on and these people here man

[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.640]
They got nothing to say because they don't want to be bothered with the truth and reality because it's too annoying

[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.240]
It's too annoying. They don't want to be annoyed

[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:28.620]
622 wild and date 767 wild and brown. We got the one guy on the 11 there. He's on hold

[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:32.040]
So we got like basically nothing going on here today as usual on a Monday

[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:38.760]
Why does anybody like I said congratulations to Ron and fiz and Bill and whatever their names are for taking off this morning

[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.100]
Maybe that's going to be their new format every Monday all tape Monday

[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.960]
What they took this morning off because they didn't take Friday off

[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:54.800]
So they're taking their Easter holiday day. What let me take Friday off did we take Friday off did even that didn't even born again

[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.740]
Rick Riley take Friday off no the other company people did

[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:58.820]
Yeah

[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:04.260]
So I guess they felt they were entitled. Oh my god like I said good choice guys

[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.040]
1114 a wild

[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:24.940]
And

[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:32.220]
These have done these I got them from Linda energy my

[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:39.580]
And now I've been slept for three days now

[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:53.060]
Some weight program give me a break how many drugs do I have to pay my hair's calling out and it's been hard to be

[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.720]
Since I saw Linda energy

[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.580]
My heart's been going wild

[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:02.260]
Like I want to die

[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.920]
Till that kill and

[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.220]
Not to mention I

[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:12.520]
Faze out peddling drugs all day that drops on weight

[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.960]
Your brain for doctor husband says it's okay

[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.060]
A physician is his name my

[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.620]
Down my next inning all around and around

[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.620]
Have been slept for three days now

[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.340]
Okay

[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:47.300]
What a pussy okay 1118 at W.I.O.D

[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:51.760]

[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:09.400]
Probably here's point and beach on a mobile hello. Yeah. Yes. I thought my battery was gonna die. I'm yeah. Yeah

[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.920]
Hey, I just want to let you know there's some real people up here in Palm Beach County who got some balls and

[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:21.760]
85 years old who lives lives in Syria. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:27.940]
Yeah, and you're absolutely right about every line being open

[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:32.720]
I call it on four different lines and everything is right. What was the point of that? Are you a line checker now?

[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.920]
Is that it? No, I was just you know sometimes I think

[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.660]
Not you but some radio station sir

[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:42.400]
I'm gonna tell you something when I tell you because I'm the one I tell you how many there are in date

[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.040]
How many brown to give the audience an idea of how many you know what's going on here?

[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:49.260]
I don't sit here and make things up. This is not contrived radio

[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.600]
That's you got the wrong station for that. Oh, I know

[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.640]
We don't sit here and say if you move quickly you might get in here when we got every line open

[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:59.020]
You know like certain people that try to psych out the audience right?

[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:05.360]
I don't think you're a psych out the audience kind of guy. You're just a straight up. I'm just a straight guy right

[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.320]
You're a straight up guy. Yeah. Okay pal. You keep calling and

[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:15.480]
Screwpud back. Okay. All right you first. Okay. We have an open line on the purple line

[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.240]
That's the mobile one in the out of town line or whatever it is the mobile line at pound IOD

[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.420]
And we have two and Broward 7679 463 767 WIOD

[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:26.600]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:31.020]
Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? Okay?

[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:37.420]
Listen, did you see that movie yet? Donny Rusk? No, I did not. Oh save yourself man. I had to walk out of that thing

[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:40.880]
I think

[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.680]
Adam Adam said it was very weak

[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:51.340]
Yeah, ponderous and just talk yeah, yeah, pop pop pop pop

[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:55.060]
Yeah, I heard you talking about it the other day and I'm like I got a save on from that

[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:59.560]
Yeah, now that it's another godfather wannabe and everybody's running out there to see that in the meantime

[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.980]
They should be going to see the godfather and only 95-year-old blue hairs are going. I don't understand that

[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:08.040]
I don't know which goes to show you that this so-called generation X-lacks

[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.780]
They don't go to anything unless it's hyped sufficiently if it has the proper hype

[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:16.540]
You can manipulate them to go do whatever you want, but unless you hype it right. They just can't be bothered with it

[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.840]
But what I don't understand is why wouldn't they put the second movie which is the better movie to me?

[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.460]
You know, right? No way. Oh, yeah

[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:28.120]
No way you don't think so godfather two is better than oh no

[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.120]
Oh my god, I can't believe you said that you're going to purgatory now, sir

[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.120]
Oh, man, you're gonna be there for a long time

[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:41.200]
Huh, you don't like it better. No way godfather one is the definitive. I mean

[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:46.960]
But number two is so much. I mean you you understand so much better where they coming from and everything

[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:51.920]
Yeah, I just like I mean godfather three is the worst made movie, but it's got wait a minute

[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.480]
Wait a minute. No, it was not

[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:59.960]
It was the work it was the worst acting but nevertheless it had the most important story about the murder of the pope and the Vatican

[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:04.060]
Banking scandal, but you see people don't care about the story all they care about was

[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:07.740]
Sophia had a big nose, you know, that's all they know right exactly

[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:14.340]
She made a hell of a canola that Connie I'll tell you I tell you he just flipped down. Yeah, yeah, how'd you like the way?

[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:19.080]
Well, I was beautiful. I loved it. That was the best acting that Eli Walla did in the whole movie

[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:25.360]
Was when he choked on it. It was awesome. It was that part was the guy. I love when he said I have a stone in my shoe and the

[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:32.100]
The assassin he said solo una spina. I love that. I like it. That was my first Italian lesson solo una spina

[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.980]
I like the part with opportunity. No says they should be afraid of it sister. Yeah, they should be afraid of you

[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:42.920]
Yeah, notice how there was almost like a comedy routine there. I know now they will fear you. Yeah, right

[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.000]
You're gonna bring that line back. Okay, bitch. Give me a break

[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:51.180]
All right, Neoma. Okay. Thanks. I'll save my save my eyesight. Okay. Thank you

[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:55.760]
So Donnie Brasco sucks is what everybody generally says even though the lovely Johnny Depp is in it

[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:01.520]
Boy, do I Johnny Depp boy? Yeah, I used to like Johnny Depp when he was like a natural guy when he was on the show on Zeta

[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.380]
But that was nine years ago. Wayne says it sucks

[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:10.280]
Wayne said it sucked Adam said it sucked everybody said Donnie Brasco bites the big one. Okay. So whatever you do

[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:14.040]
Stay home. Go see the godfather. Will you what else wrong with you?

[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:20.740]
We have a day lines wide open six two two another very aggravating day here on a Monday another very

[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.860]
Toothpulling day six to two W I O D

[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.720]
Two open lines and Broward seven six seven nine four six three. They don't care about Marshall applegate

[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:32.760]
Apple sauce. They don't care about that

[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:38.820]
They don't want to deal with the fact that really and you see that the the mainstream media are presenting this

[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:44.620]
Like well, they were all just you know very nice people. They just happened to be led down to Garden Pat and

[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.360]
Yadda Yadda but this has nothing to do with religion of course, right?

[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:54.140]
In fact this morning on that the CBS morning abortion with the five minutes of local cut in that we wind up

[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:59.520]
They show about two minutes of the network every hour and the rest of the time is like local cut-ins with the guy with the suspenders

[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:06.420]
And then of course mark McEwen comes on and the other guy that hose a DS blarge towards and you thank the lord that

[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.880]
They're only giving you two minutes an hour of that

[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:16.980]
And they're going on about there's over two how many of these say two thousand religious of these cults in America today and over a thousand of them have to do with flying saucers

[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:23.540]
Which she brings us back to another great scene in the godfather when Carla when nuts and uh

[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:28.120]
She was throwing all of the uh saucers in the everything talking about flying some remember that

[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:34.800]
She's throwing all the silverware. She's throwing the dishes. Go ahead. You're getting bastard. Go ahead. You spoiled getty brat

[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:40.180]
Flying cups and saucers right flying cups. How do you like that? I got a cup fatigues from watching that scene

[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:46.860]
They've county last call for calls and dates six two two wio day. This is this is useless

[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:48.200]
This is Miami for you man

This is this town hopeless and lifeless dead as a doornail and now that Easter is gone

You might as well just roll up between now and the what December between now and Christmas and Hanukkah forget about it

[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.440]

Take care of that delicate balance, which is the world economy. That's all God cares about

[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.100]
Don't be trusted like the rest of us. That's right is money money money

[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.860]
Forget about all this other bull crap

[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.780]
Don't let that Ralph Reed tell you that he cares about anything besides money

[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:01.700]
Yes, roll that money into all those farbiss and a goi. I'm there the so-called religious right who ain't neither

1132 W I do why sit that all these are religions. It's the the sex thing

[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:31.220]
That's so they're all hung up about that it's bad it's evil and when they're going to serious the reason that they got castrated here

[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:36.920]
Is because they eliminate all of that that's right get rid of the sex and all of a sudden were pure and wonderful and it's great and boring

[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:43.740]
Really boring and by the way he didn't have cancer oh damn it

[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.740]
Making it just a little more ironic, but like Ted Turner said I'll ride

[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:55.840]
Get rid of him here's a mobile in Key West. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:02.220]
Key West and you're breaking up on 1 11 mile mark. Oh, sorry about that

[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:07.080]
But I'm agree with you with Ted Turner. Yeah, I just wanted to ask you. I'm listening to you a lot

[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:10.200]
How come Ted Turner who's like a big hot shot says something that's very true

[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:15.480]
But nobody gets upset about it nobody got all bent out of shape and called for his ass. Why is that he can do anything

[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:21.340]
He wants the last last week he told his company to do whatever the he can do whatever he wants of course good for him

[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:25.140]
Good for him always thought he was kind of illiterate, but not a bad guy exactly

[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.680]
I'm listening to a lot when I'm out here

[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:33.680]
Excellent normally from Palm Beach, but one thing I'm Swedish and I'm I want to I want to watch those pandas

[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:40.020]
But if I can yeah one thing I don't understand is why can't they shoot when they have one month man more?

[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.340]
I mean when they you know, I mean this is

[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:47.840]
Hey listen the last seven power plays they got the seven goals course five for the other team

[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:49.960]
That's good five short handed

[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:55.220]
Yeah, it's so easy to do. It's just make a box and there's one one left. They don't know how to make a box

[00:59:55.220 --> 01:00:00.820]
That's the problem. Yeah, we ever talked to Eddie Jovenoski you understand is IQ ain't that good. You don't know how to make a box

[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:06.700]
Okay, I really said it. He knows the box when he sees one okay pal Max Sundin is God

[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:12.260]
Thanks, see ya and boy you're selling into bed either. We're bringing boy you're selling back for the leaves and bill he would

[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:17.220]
I don't care what that John Shannon says from the cbc and by the way, no, I still don't have my tapes

[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:25.500]
Oh brother, I'm sorry. I think we're gonna take John Shannon from the cbc and Michael Mayo, Moskovitz from the Sun Sentinel and make a match made in heaven

[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.580]
God all mighty talk about bull crap artists to pop up out give you a song in a day

[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.580]
I

[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:39.700]
Here's a lady in Davie hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, ma'am. I was at the game on Saturday night. It was so boring

[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:45.700]
It was way boring and we had a good seat where we could see bezers face. Yeah, he was mad

[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:50.460]
He was jumping up and down. He's screaming left and right probably taking naps at parts of that game

[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:57.280]
But if you would have been there I guarantee you would have had a great time. Why I was sitting between Dave and two

[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.560]
14 and Jose from the pizza loft

[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.380]
No, yes, oh no

[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:09.440]
Yeah, we brought him to see you. He was talking about nudity and everything Jose was there. Yep. Oh my god

[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:15.180]
If I would have only known it he was looking fine. He had a tight black shirt on a smell real good

[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.860]
He smelled real good. What do you do get your head under his arm? Pitter what?

[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.020]
Melt he felt and smelled

[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.460]
But they

[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.300]
Went down to see it and the mighty pressed first. They wouldn't let him in

[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.040]
Yeah, they thought they they just wouldn't let him in and I'm gonna straighten and you know they're very nice those

[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.380]
Usher's are very nice and they come over before the game and always asking the same question the million times

[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:43.560]
Which the first 500 times should you know let them know and I'd tell them if people want to come over before the gamer between

[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:49.320]
Piers I don't mind that and especially Dave and Jose and uh and uh, well, what's his name Jacob? Yeah

[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:54.980]
What is wrong with those guys? They're two, but he doesn't count. No, he's that big hairy guy that Dave brought down there

[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.120]
Yeah, sure whatever you say

[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:05.900]
But anyway, we so Jose was there and you were you were squeezed right in between Dave and Jose, huh

[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.120]
That's right and you went home with your husband poor baby. Yeah, well

[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:16.140]
Always dream. Yeah, but anyway, we got into a game and you weren't there and damn it. I don't know what to tell you

[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.260]
I'm turning the clock back now

[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:22.740]
Thanks for the bad news all right have a great day. Oh, how depressing how depressing

[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.920]
I'm there at almost every stinking game come on Dave and 214 get with it

[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:32.780]
We have an open line in day at 622 9463 apparent broward 767 W.I.O.D

[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:37.740]
The out of town the worldwide web the Palm Beach lines 1.88 474 9463

[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.420]
So like she said what the hell would there be to talk about that game?

[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:44.800]
One nothing Tampa on a shorthanded goal by the lovely Rob Xameter early in the game

[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:50.980]
Tommy Fitzgerald ties it up with a minute 25 to go in regulation and they wind up with a one-one tie against a very mediocre team

[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.700]
In a snoozer snoozer rhymes with loser and cruiser and booser

[01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:01.160]
Oh, and that guy up in 124 they're the rat man. I'm telling you we're gonna get his ass

[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:06.680]
We're gonna get the rat man before the city before the playoffs start. We're gonna straighten his ugly ass out

[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.480]
Here's Fort Lauderdale on a mobile. Hello

[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:15.220]
Yeah, I do a deal. Okay, sir. Hey, I want to thank you first of all for turning me on to the Atkins thing

[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:19.400]
Yeah, pounds two months. How's that great sounding in two months. That's outstanding

[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:24.440]
Now there's one question though. I know I know you're still doing it, but I know who said I'm still doing it

[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:33.280]
I'm as big as a house. I'm as big as a stadium. But are you still doing the Atkins thing? Yeah, right? Are you? No, I'm not oh you're not oh, why?

[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.980]
Because I fell off the wagon. Okay, question. Yeah, I can't I can't get the strips to get dark

[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:44.220]
What am I I mean I can look at a carburetidate and this I can't get the damn strips to get dark

[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.820]
Can I ask you a question?

[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.020]
Absolutely. You're losing weight. You're feeling great. You're doing good. Oh, forget about the strips. Okay

[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:56.880]
Forget about it. Well, I've kind of tapered off. I mean, I'm I'm not losing much weight

[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:02.040]
Leigh and I'm and I'm really being good man. I just thirty two pounds in two months and you're fetching

[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:08.220]
Well, I was pretty big. I was 248 just keep doing it just keep doing what you're doing. Okay, you're obviously doing a right

[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.960]
Hey, listen, you got a great show. The only way to improve it

[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.380]
But I realize why you got to do it is you got to take all these stupid sports calls

[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.140]
You got to fill material for four hours

[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.960]
So I understand that but like you say nobody knows the damn thing

[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.540]
And when you're you start talking sports and I'm a reasonably intelligent person

[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:23.800]
I don't know what the hell's going on

[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.120]
But I know you got to do it meaning what?

[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.260]
Well, I don't know it just wish you could fill it with something else other than talk about sports

[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:33.340]
When you run out you know get people like me to run out of material

[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:34.960]
So I shouldn't talk about sports?

[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:39.620]
No, no, no, it's okay. It's just a percentage wise. How much how much have I talked about sports today?

[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.920]
I mentioned I mentioned that I missed the game the other night and this woman just called and the only sports

[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.260]
He was talking about was having our head stuck under Jose's armpit, which is a good sport to me

[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:49.820]
What's wrong with that

[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:52.860]
Okay, pal

[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.660]

You you are God. Yes, I am and my wife is going on that's the only reason I can call because she hates you like boys

[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:02.780]
For why would it explain that to me? What is it with these humorless women? What is her problem?

[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.360]
Because she's from Jacksonville, South Carolina

[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:16.320]
First of all, I live in the Kendall and my cable was out for the first two pairs of the hockey game

[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.600]
Yeah, I think I was lucky probably it sounds like it from these from these reports. I'm getting

[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:26.080]
They can't give me reports about the highlights because there weren't any exactly except for the one goal

[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.680]
That was that was nice

[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.180]
But of course you knew that they were going to tie it you did I think

And they're all mocking at then and it's true it's true until a minute and a half left in the game

[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.260]

[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:45.360]
Which he was so uh she was so far tumult this morning

[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:56.200]
Adam not Adam our Adam like what other Adam do we have work in here by the way in the building not here

[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.640]
Somebody I never heard of so it wasn't even for an Adam in this building right

[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:06.900]
How do you like that and it was like for about a dollar seventy five. I says hey Wendy wrong check

[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:13.420]
As I followed it on the hall tackled her right there in the middle of the kitchen and said give me the right checks

[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000]
Okay, here you go

[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:21.320]
But other than that. I mean what the hell more what more what more could you want what could you possibly want more than that

[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:26.180]
Here's a mobile in poppano. Hello. I got mixed emotions about the

[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:29.460]
The spectators I call them instead of fans over there in the

[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:32.800]
Chronic chronic no chronic chronic

[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:37.100]
I can't get a ticket for nothing. Yeah

[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.980]
No, you generally have to pay for it. It's pretty hard to get a ticket for nothing

[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:47.160]
No, I don't mind paying for it. I like my name is thinking. What do you think I press pants for nothing? Yeah, right

[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:51.440]
But you got on the hand when you guys these guys are the only spectators that go there

[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:58.240]
It's incredible. That's why they start with the poop for poop, but they have no idea what it's like to be a fan of anything right

[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.740]
But at least they're consistent at least they're consistent

[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:06.860]
Yeah, you're right there. You're right. I mean JB Brown. He was one of the best. What are we gonna do without him?

[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:12.300]
Okay, get out of here two open lines in date six two two two W. I. O. D two and brown

[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.420]
We're gonna be doing music from noon to two ladies and gentlemen

[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:20.440]
Welcome to our new W I O D format wall to wall. We're doing it. So tonight we got Brooke from six to nine

[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.920]
I think tonight's like the official last week was just a warm-up

[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.520]
The night the midnight we got Kathy K Karen K. Whatever name is Karen K with passion clones

[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.960]
Now tonight is she gonna talk about something different beside the fact that she's doing Walter Sabo

[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:39.600]
Please do it Karen because everybody tells me you're a wonderful person and they love you profusely and they're pulling for you and praying for you

[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.740]
Etc. Are in so on

[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:49.040]
So we want you to do us a bang up. I mean a real solid fantastic great job or else. So that's tonight nine to midnight

[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:57.080]
Here's Miami. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing great? I was wondering if I could get you take on tonight's game with the the pain with the

[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:00.080]
What what now? What does that mean my take on the game? What does that mean?

[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:03.020]
Well, I wanted to find out what you think about it and the fact that

[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:09.740]
Will be will be playing against our former teammates Wiley and two Barnes. Yeah, and I was just wondering um

[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:14.460]
In your in your opinion, do you think we should rather you'd rather see the pain with the first round of the Rangers?

[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:17.780]
Now well now that yoghours back

[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.540]
I don't know they played a pretty good game on Saturday all of a sudden with him back

[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:24.700]
He had to assist and Mirio had to assist and uh there. It's hard to figure them, you know

[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:29.380]
It's really hard to figure them out. Okay, I also wanted to but I still say I'd rather play them because they got no defense

[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:32.680]
They got no defense. We might actually be able to score some goals on them

[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.700]
Whereas if Richter gets hot with those Rangers look out

[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.240]
You know what I'm gonna agree with uh with the German. I just called before you know, you know

[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.580]
It's hard enough to get a ticket around here, especially with all these

[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.340]
People who jump on the bandwagon or whatever they win

[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:48.880]
But you know leave leave some tickets for the real fans for those who support the team when they win

[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:53.880]
They won they lose on they divide all the paraphernalia right and that's his spectators amen all right

[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.900]
Have a good day and back to you. Right. I'm with you pal

[01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:02.480]
Let's get some of these phones out of there that don't even know what the hell's going on just to stand there and have everybody see that they're there

[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.160]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:09.300]
Like the silver fox. There's a good example. Just stand there and is anybody looking at me you look at my big ring

[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.300]
I'm very impressive. Here's my silver here and I'm a real hot shot

[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:17.340]
I'm a very important guy and I got passes to the uh to the big uh team box there whatever the hell it is

[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:20.940]
Who cares nobody cares we didn't come there to see you

[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:26.880]
They're all there looking that it's like the old like I said before the women with the main coach

[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:30.900]
That used to come into rato and Montreal and sit in the first three or four in the luxury seats. Oh look here

[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.180]
I am here. I am. I don't know what's going on

[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.760]
But I mean here with my main code on same thing. Let's get some main coach for some of these guys

[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:43.700]
Dead county. Okay, let's get the music ready here. Okay. We go on to these. Okay. Get the music ready la music

[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.900]
From known to two because it's really grim the man is working his brains out

[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:52.820]
He's doing everything but drinking the cyanide and cool it and taking the yellow pudding pops on here

[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:54.540]
And these bastards still don't care

[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.840]
You can't get a rise out of these people for love or money

[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:00.400]
Here you go last call of the day

Eat the canoli that's what you said. That's what you told Eli Wallach take the gun eat the canoli in your case

[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:44.460]
We have all the power lines open 7679 463 767 wiod on a bich of a monday man

[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:47.180]
And you know something this when you sit here and you look at this phone

[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:51.720]
It's the most accurate reflection of what's going on in this town. I mean deadly

[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:57.160]
It is just you can walk outside right now. I don't care whether you're like in margate whether you don't are in kindle

[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:02.200]
I don't care if you're like in sweet water just walk outside right now and take a like that

[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.820]
And you can smell the death in the air you can smell it you can actually see it

[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.360]
You could cut it with your butter knife

[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.280]
Do you hear that?

[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.140]
What is that?

[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:19.680]
You know

[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:19.680]

[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.080]
No, no seriously, but this

[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:24.260]
Do you hear that? Of course I do

[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:28.020]
And I'm wondering why this sounds so funky here today

[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:34.900]
What is that? You're not doing that? No, I'm doing it, but I mean why why is it like doing that

[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:39.560]
It doesn't ordinarily do that. I I've foundled my microphone every day this way

[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.620]
And it doesn't make those sounds

[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.440]
Oh, there is something there is a funguous among you as man

[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.200]
Guess who we haven't seen today by the way. I don't want to mention his name, but how about his boss?

[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:49.480]
roll

[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:58.020]
Open line at day 622 all three and powered 767 w. Y.O.D. Here's Miami on a mobile. Hello. How you doing? Okay?

[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:02.900]
I got a couple things for you. Yes, first a long overdue vote. I like the news guy

[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:10.520]
Really do okay? I'm happy for you. It's my opinion if you're happy. I'm happy. There you go

[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.800]
I have no comment. I went to the game. Oh, by the way those people talking about not being able to get tickets

[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.640]
Yeah, I have found the sure fire way to get pantheipats ticket. Okay

[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.020]
I played on the air because then it won't be

[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:20.920]
Yeah, don't do it

[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:26.440]
That'll be like my going on ear and touting the Emerald coast and then being real sorry. I did it exactly the last ten times

[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:31.080]
I've tried I've gotten tickets on my first try nice going pal excellent, but I went to the game Saturday

[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:35.280]
And some idiots of course pantheipats eats away up there

[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:40.760]
Some idiots sit in the very back row a couple sections over from me with their faces all painted

[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:47.580]
Passing bears back the whole game. Yeah, no matter what was going on on the ice if we were if there was a scoring chance

[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.940]
No matter what was going on there

[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:51.460]
Yeah, blue

[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:59.520]
Assholes more on I just I've foolish understanding. I don't end the guy like you said up to the point of minute 25 left

[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.500]
He was pitching a shutoff right he was pitching it

[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:07.440]
You're probably pitching a fit, but I sure I use one of your lines in the in the stadium when I got really

[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.800]
pissed off and everybody started cracking up

[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:14.600]
It was like when we had three consecutive shots right out of right dead point blank

[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:18.600]
Yeah, I like I said 90s guys couldn't score a capywillow at south right now

[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:21.000]
And it was I mean they had good chance

[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.020]
Yeah, they had good chances to get that puck in there

[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:31.060]
They just couldn't stick it in it couldn't they could not stick it in I couldn't believe it

[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:35.660]
And I hear the rumor that Eddie got benched uh, Saturday night that's the rumor. I'm hearing

[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.540]
Eddie Eddie healthy scratch. Yeah, it struck us supposed to be back tonight

[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:45.900]
They they're just holding them out. I don't know. I'm not waiting for uh to be absolutely sure

[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.200]
I guess I don't know how you're ever absolutely sure

[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.880]
Because he's re he's repulled that thing like three times now right right we don't want to see him pulling it

[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:59.140]
All right, Neil. I'm gonna let you go. I'm glad he had a great time. Hey, I had a good time, buddy

[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:03.800]
Okay, see you yeah, there's something wrong with this this thing is like do you hear that

[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.140]
And even when you do that it's like tinny

[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:21.700]
Boy, there is something really effed up in this joint today. Hey, but it's a technical thing don't get started on that

[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:26.940]
The tip off on the technical prowess around this joint is that run and run were on tape this morning

[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:29.720]
And about half of the especially when they had the guest on on the phone

[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.860]
It was like the whole gang was like singing roll out the barrel

[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:40.560]
As we can barely understand what the hell was going on two open lines in day six two two nine four six three six two two

[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.560]
W i o d our poll question today is is there anybody alive in his town?

[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.240]
A way to putting in the apple saws two open lines and browards seven six seven w i o d

[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.800]
Here's Kendall hello

[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.180]
Yes, how are you okay?

[01:29:54.860 --> 01:30:00.960]
Uh you were out of town so you didn't get to see a movie that Luis Miguel made when he was about 14 or

[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:05.000]
I've already seen that that's a movie for pedophiles. He looks like a little girl in that movie

[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.540]
Ernie, you had seen it already right? Yeah, somebody gave me then I looked at about five minutes of then I said who what kind of pervert gave me this

[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:19.160]
Doesn't he look like a little girl in that movie? He does he looks like that little that kid who can use to play on a does enough that little kid

[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.440]
Remember with the shortcut that he had the same shortcut who will he aims?

[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:29.440]
Oh, I don't know what's his name. Will he aims? No, no, he does enough. That's the show will he aims was on eaters enough

[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:32.480]
With the he was the youngest kid. Yeah, well, I don't know

[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:36.080]
Well, I don't know either, but he looked like him with the hair cut and everything

[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:40.320]
So if you've already seen it, I thought he looked more like Christy McNichol on a bad day

[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:43.800]
Uh, to tell you the truth, yes, was that gap in his tooth? Yeah, again

[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:47.160]
Now by the way the good news is Joe Rose got his gap feel and his teeth too

[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:52.060]
Did he have enough porcelain to fill it? Yes, in fact, we had to take three latrines to do the job

[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:58.860]
Well, you know how it is you already think so okay pal take care. Have a great day. Okay. We have day lines

[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:01.860]
Why there's something with this thing even the cord like uh the stuff

[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:07.440]
This is really bizarre. I'm afraid to touch anything in here. I think any second this place is gonna blow oh, it already blows

[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:15.320]
Daylines are open six two two nine four six three six two two W. I. O. D. Broward line seven six seven W. I. O. D.

[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:20.140]
As this man continues herneedically making an attempt here today. I'm working on it

[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.120]
God

[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:29.120]
And listen now now I'm like I better do this I better take this you think so we'll switch with the other mic

[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:32.760]
Switch it with what other might be the one that in the suds seat

[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:35.100]
Okay

[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:36.940]
One moment please

[01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:44.540]
Yeah, this thing's got to have some kind of disease. Oh, yeah, but this one you got to like uh unscrew this whole thing

[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:45.660]
This could take like hours

[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:50.700]
This could take the rest of the show so like I said good idea to pull on it real hard just the I got it oh

[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:57.180]
And I don't think you can do that on this now this one. This is not one of those just pull it

[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:01.000]
It doesn't I'm telling you it doesn't work. This is not one of those that does that

[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:04.760]
It's got the little deal either you have to press and then it pulls off there you go

[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.140]
One moment please you know Rogers is the thought of microphone. There he goes

[01:32:10.140 --> 01:32:10.720]
How's that

[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.620]
Is that better oh much oh, yeah

[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:17.660]
Yeah, there's something wrong with this microphone that half a show I done here today with a microphone

[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:22.180]
That's malfunctioning and nobody even knows about it. Yeah, now the court. Yeah, there's like a short net thing

[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:28.780]
It's like a short thing now we're talking now. It sounds like a real show in here in the audience is don't you know

[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:32.400]
Wonder we're not getting no response they can't listen to that now it sounds like a show

[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:35.600]
God dang it

[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.300]
As in oh god

[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:40.940]
Damn

[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:46.020]

It's this particular whatever general motors decided to do and now all the GM cars even that lumina had that

Oh, why did they do that?

[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:48.140]
The radio and my Corvette I wouldn't wish it on a Marconi. I would wish it on Mike Disney

How can you know and then I come back here and I get somebody sent me this somebody actually sent this and they look pretty a grotesque on here

[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:24.500]
So maybe the video was either doctor or maybe this is doctor because the public can't stand it

[01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:27.200]
Of course michael's is a jealous one of the other maybe they ain't putting out

[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:33.860]
Sub to you folks. It's been a rough go man two and a half hours with a bad microphone with a broken piece of equipment

[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.540]
With a broken down bunch of audience out there that just can't get their act together

[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:46.660]
They just can't make up their mind to get with it six two two w i o d in dade two open lines and browards seven six seven nine four six three

[01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:51.160]
Whatever happened to the days when we had our friendly folks out there whatever happened to Paul Harvey Jr

[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:54.720]
Whatever happened to the knots landing lady was busy doing everybody's taxes right now

[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:57.420]
Whatever happened all our good pizons out there in radio land

[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:01.740]

[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:04.000]
Called earlier to say that boon bent went back to Thailand

[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:07.960]
But he didn't go in the air well. Thank you so much for the good news

He went to lake worth with Thai food. Okay. That's like taking lots of balls and going to the Arctic Circle

[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.640]

The incident that happened in L.A. The guys couldn't afford a sex change

[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:16.460]
So that's what they ended up doing a pass rating themselves when a doubt cut it out

[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.540]

There ain't no freak in french fries. That's what I've been trying to tell you but breath there ain't no freak in french fries

[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:41.940]
I'll get out of my sight before I shove your teeth so far down your

[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.520]
Throw you'll have to sit on the jack burger to eat it

[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:46.560]
Oh

[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:50.740]
Have a nice day. I have no life twelve thirty six at w.io.d

[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:56.060]
So where did you clip this from because I heard it over the weekend in case you missed it woman's stone to death some of that good old-time

[01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:01.200]
Religion the Islamic religion again one of the most repressive and backwards and asinine religions in the history of mankind

[01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:05.360]
And thank God that basketball player Karim Raouf douchebag

[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.100]
Thank God he ain't standing for no national anthem. Okay, and they traded his ass away

[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:15.300]
Because it's an insult to that great religion. We don't want to be repressive in this country. Do we

[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:16.560]
like the

[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:19.440]
So anyway in the Kabul Afghanistan

[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:27.040]
Taliban religious rulers on Saturday stoned it at the young woman who tried to flee Afghanistan with the man who was not her relative as in

[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:27.740]
Oy

[01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:33.840]
Under the Taliban strict interpretation of Islamic law a woman found in the company of a man other than a family member

[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:42.400]
Found in the company of a man not necessarily cohabiting with found in the company of a man other than a family member is guilty of a crime punishable by death by stoning

[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:47.000]
So they did a Steve Nicholonner she got stoned

[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:55.860]
That's right the Taliban run radio shot a yacht identified the woman only is Jamilia and said the stoning occurred on Saturday in eastern logmon province

[01:51:55.860 --> 01:52:00.220]
Is everybody having a good time in Afghanistan? All right

[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:02.360]
Here's Davie hello

[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:10.440]
Yes, it is you know if iod doesn't sign you they may as well just close up their doors and

[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:14.900]

[01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:19.720]
Absolutely would be and i'm coming in every day. I'm showing up here every day sir

[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:25.820]
I'm showing up here every morning at 10 a.m. Sharp. I'm sure you would have no problem getting out of the station locally if you wanted to

[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:31.700]
I don't know about that. I hope you would decide to say a tough call. I mean it would be like when the red socks got rid of bay bruce

[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:38.100]
Right, that's right it would haunt them forever. Yep. You know, I uh the house that Neil built. Yeah, I can smell it now

[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:41.000]
I look forward to the show most most every day the house that

[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:45.620]
Bill now I went down what do you think about that you think got to change my name to Neil god

[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:46.760]
um

[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:52.360]
If you want that on your driver's license why not and they put a little halo over your head

[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:57.800]
If they can have god sham god on a basketball team on some stupid ass basketball team. Why can't I be Neil god?

[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:05.900]
Well the hoop is looked is shaped like a halo too. In fact, even if people that hate me even my detractors would say I can't stand that Neil god

[01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:08.860]
I love it. We could have

[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:12.160]
Somebody could be Satan also I guess yeah

[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:18.720]
The rest of the people on the show if there was even a station around maybe Walter Sabo could do that

[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:22.100]
It would be up maybe you could be the anti-Christ no station without you mr

[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:26.560]
Okay pal, you know, I'll tell him you said that hold on a second. Yeah, I'm not going anywhere. Okay

[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:33.240]
I'm going on to it. I want you to shoot somebody for me with your machine gun there. Yeah, I woke up feeling a great mood

[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:37.060]
You know got up early. I had to go to the department of revenue to get a form and

[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.780]
Yeah, I'm telling you this late

[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:53.600]
Oh, no, you don't you don't have to go somewhere else

[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:57.020]
And I waited you know she didn't

[01:53:57.020 --> 01:54:00.400]
Where do I go do you think we got her yet?

[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:04.180]
Just to be safe in the knee cap

[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:11.200]
I used to watch guiding light and I hear Rusty's coming back who?

[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:18.140]
Who the hell's Rusty? Not Riva's son or brother or something. Oh, yeah, right. Remember him. Yeah sure do

[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:21.580]
He was a cop as he was telling we want him back for he was there when they had the

[01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:24.020]
When Riva's mama died. Remember mama?

[01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:28.060]
She died in Italy and I stopped watching it for a while. I'm trying to get back into it

[01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:33.860]
It won't be long before Vanessa comes back either from her years of radical with her strange disease. She's coming back

[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:36.000]
She's in sweetener something now. She's in

In closing meal. Yes, sir

[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:49.700]

Thank you, sir. Okay. Nice job. Nice reading as somebody would say

[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:11.640]
Well, then just in case you're missing this

Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by

[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:24.120]
Sometimes I feel like life is passing me by

[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:27.380]
When I listen to your show

[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:30.000]
It just makes me smile

[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:33.040]
When I listen to your show

[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:35.680]
It just makes me smile

[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.440]
When I listen to your show

[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:41.380]
It makes me feel like a child

[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:44.080]
New Rogers on the radio

New Rogers on the radio

[01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:52.500]
New Rogers on the radio

484749 463 since I changed the microphone you know us we got some people on the phone here

[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.520]
Half the show I did it with a with a broken thing

[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:17.040]
Man, oh man, it sounded like crap. It was like really eerie. It was eerie

[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:19.180]
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello

[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:27.960]
Lady in Miami. Hi me. Hi. Yes, ma'am. Great listen. I was wondering if you caught the show a couple weeks ago

[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:34.120]
No on free loaders. No, it was on channel 10 with John Stoffel

[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:39.200]
They set up a buffet at the fountain blue hotel. Yeah with

[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:44.260]
Swim and everything and they had a sign on it that said

[01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:45.540]
S n f

[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:52.020]
Members only right and you see all these people eating all this food and they didn't know that the S n

[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:59.120]
S n stood for something for nothing right snores and they're just eating all this and they interviewed the people

[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:01.680]
Why are you eating and they kept saying because we're members

[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.560]
And they had no idea what the S that's right their members of the snores for nothing right it was exactly

[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:14.220]
They stole that from me. Wow. Oh, well. Have a great day. Thanks for the good news. See ya

[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:19.600]
Yeah, all you snores down here all you old disgusting fart. Oh, and yesterday we're driving over to Emerald Coast

[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.320]
Which unfortunately was aligned from here to you. You just love you

[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:27.400]
But at any rate there's this old old bunch of Canadians in a jukenoo

[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.740]
Quebec plate in a big big Cadillac. I mean a big ugly brown jukenoo going about two miles an hour

[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:36.580]
And

[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:38.840]
I can't get around this ass. So here I am in my beautiful

[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:43.780]
1996 purple Corvette and I'm following this old older than the thuisla

[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:48.940]
And finally he makes the left turn and thank goodness. He was going to know that seafood. You don't know where it is

[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:51.920]
They got a seafood joint too, which must be a real geriatric place

[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:55.700]
The Florida seafood something rather right in the same plaza with Emerald Coast

[01:57:55.700 --> 01:58:00.540]
So at any rate he's gonna make the turn into that plaza and he gets about halfway in there

[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:02.980]
He gets this big jukenoo with his halfway in there

[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:08.220]
My ass is still sticking out on the street and now he stops because somebody is like coming across

[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:13.660]
You know he's got all the room in the world to just make a little move around them and let me get my ass off the street

[01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:15.220]
And I lean on the horn

[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:17.700]
And now he gives me a toot back

[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:20.560]
gives me a little toot back

[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:25.460]
You miserable old frog go back where you came from and thank the Lord

[01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:26.420]

[02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:34.140]
You know it sounded just like one of those light bulb people to me

[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:38.860]
Pre-pube bus and he he should have joined that cult. He'd have been perfect there. They wouldn't had a waste to

[02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:40.080]
Dull the knife

[02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:44.640]
Wouldn't had a waste the effort because if you don't have any you don't have nothing to cut off

[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:51.400]
6229463 too bad Rick couldn't have been in that cult you know. I'm sorry. Just a joke Rick just a joke mr. Riley

We're all clones of Michael. They're all clones man

[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:41.520]
And I think they've all been doing each other, but they're much too old for him now believe me

[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:46.920]
And how about how about that baby nobody's buying the story and he's not living with this broad

[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:49.540]
He wasn't living with the other broad. It's just a really a sad thing

[02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:52.480]
It's a sad story that they just keep trying all these fags man

[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:56.720]
They just keep trying desperately to put over down the public and it just isn't working

[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:59.440]
It's not working. I maybe Tom Cruise. That's an exception

[02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:03.080]
I didn't say Tom Cruise was a fat. I didn't say it. I may have hinted it

[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:08.300]
I didn't say Troy Ekman who cares okay? Let him go do each other and whatever they're doing mind your own business

[02:06:08.300 --> 02:06:16.400]
Get a life get a life who cares what they're doing who cares of Ellen's a degenerate who cares about that boring sick-ass stupid show okay

Open line at Broward 7667-9463. How's Old Randy doing by the way?

[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:33.520]
She's still up there. I thought she'd be long out of there. That's what she was saying

[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:37.720]
That's what she was saying for a long time. She's getting out of that dump up there. That's what I heard

[02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:47.300]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hi. Yes, ma'am. Neil. Yes, it's Mike. Hey, I think it's what oh, yes sir. It's Mike. Okay

[02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:54.400]

[02:06:54.400 --> 02:07:00.400]
You know, it's like stupid exactly my dad has a 93 quart of it too. He's from people cut him off and all

[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:02.540]

We have an open line of day at 6229-463-622-W-I-O-D

[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:16.060]
So what about that new 97 vet, Neil? If you made up your mind that no, I have not

[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:19.920]
I'm glad you asked but I haven't made up my mind yet. I'm still I'm still

[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:25.880]
You know feeling it and the car too. I'm still examining and exploring it

[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.820]
Isn't that the way it is when you got a new play toy?

[02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:31.800]
You got to examine it explore it fondly feel it squeeze it

[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:37.100]
Dittel around with it and then you decide hey, this is not too bad or it's okay or maybe it's great

[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:42.980]
It looks great. It looks really neat everybody. It gets a lot of looks. I now I got a new deal

[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:44.880]
I'm driving to work this morning in my new Corvette

[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:47.960]
Now I got these people to kind of like look out of the side

[02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:51.400]
You don't want to say they don't want to look directly there. You know, they're staring at the car

[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:56.460]
But when you turn in your look at them because you know that they're eyeballing your car then all of a day kind of like oh

[02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:57.740]
That wasn't really looking okay

[02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:03.300]
Especially if they're driving like a red Mustang GT like one guy was this morning

[02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:06.400]
And believe me I saw your driving out here on Sheridan street when I turn the corner

[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.380]
No wonder your driving a Mustang okay

[02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:12.900]
You couldn't drive your finger up your record. That's why you're driving a Mustang you loser

[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:16.720]
God a red Mustang actually look pretty good

[02:08:18.060 --> 02:08:21.480]
Yeah, that new Mustang I got I got to be honest with you not that I would ever want one

[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:27.200]
But you Mustang people that I got a new Mustang the new real sharp looking ones. They don't look too bad for like a little kitty car

[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:29.380]
Here's West Palm Beach hello

That was a good call

[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:47.860]
Can you tell me about the line of a planet? I think when you spoke too much it makes your voice go up like Mickey Mouse

[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:49.220]
No shoot right

[02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:51.420]

She believes that crap with the Virgin Mary on the bank building. Oh my god

Why the hell can't the Virgin Mary show up on a cinnamon on a cinnamon? Oh man

[02:09:56.820 --> 02:10:00.180]
Isn't that what you say when you eat a cinnamon? Oh god, that's good

[02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:01.500]
That's right

[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:04.660]
I never I don't think I ever had a cinnamon but I smelt them

[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:08.880]
You know how in all the airports they have and like in Vegas in the Vegas airport you remember

[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:12.900]
They have that cinnamon is you that's the only thing I hate about Vegas is the airport

[02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:18.800]
Oh, I mean, it's not a bad airport, but it's just the walk no matter what gate you come in on the schlep from the

[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:22.040]
Gate to the to get out of there. It's like a hundred miles

[02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:27.300]
A hundred miles and of course you got a past four thousand crappy slot machines out of way out of there

[02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:31.380]
But god is that a long schlep to get out of that macarone international airport?

[02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:37.680]
You're just dying to get in your rented car or on the limo or the bus or whatever and get to the casino and start losing right away

[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:44.560]
But man, it is the longest lep and then you got to walk by that cinnamon and the aroma of that oh

[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:46.520]
God is that stuff smell good

[02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:47.620]
man

Watch my own there's a kick some ass Saturday at the college eight to two eight to two with a thrashing

[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:11.880]
Zigmund Palfi gets the hat trick just in the second period no less for three in a second right

[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:17.320]
The best thing that do I know what's going on or do I know what's going on mr. You know what's going on? I got my thumb on it

[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:21.880]
Listen the best thing could have into that team was for no dirty go upstairs and right

[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:23.560]
But I should take over the team there's right

[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:28.360]
But to the is you know something. They're not out of it. No. We were only one point behind

[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:34.900]
It's unbelievable. There is the I have never seen anything like this. There's like 150 teams vying for the last three spots. Yeah

[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:41.700]
In the east. Hey, yeah, we got a shot up and then hey, I went over to the metal ends and I caught the

[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:47.240]
Thursday game. Yeah, which was kind of nice to see Billy Gurer had to pretty good game right and good player

[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:50.160]
Like Billy Gurer and hell of a player. Yeah, he is. I think it the doubles

[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:54.020]
Can somehow squeeze the path filly and we can squeeze the the eight spot

[02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:57.200]
I think we got a shot and how about St. Louis knocking off Philly last night

[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:00.020]
I saw that game they beat him three to two. That was a hell of a game. Yes

[02:15:00.020 --> 02:15:04.920]
Grant Fierre actually played some damn game last night. He was unbelievable. Yeah, I didn't

[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:08.260]
Didn't watch him. He made a save off Lindross and last couple of minutes of that game

[02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:11.620]
Which you you had to see it to believe it. Yeah, hey, we caught the

[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:16.580]
The replay of the of your game Saturday night when we got back in the game and don't say your game

[02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:18.080]

Don't play me for that. I had nothing to do with that. That was that was beautiful

[02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:28.540]
Pathetic coma. How many of these coma games we're gonna keep playing now, man? I don't know

[02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:30.780]
You guys are offensive. We got to get it going tonight again

[02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:35.760]
That's right. Got to stick some in air against the team that has no defense not a bad defense no defense

[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:41.220]
We better score about five or six tonight or I'm gonna want answers in the morning. Hey, you think we're gonna be pumped up for this game tonight

[02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:42.780]

[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:04.540]
But it'll kill some good time looking

[02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:08.820]

When Roy was holding a gun to our head oh, we don't know more cards. You better get rid of all those cards

[02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:23.160]
You got a month to get rid of the cards. That was another part of the ass and they asked holding of W.I.O.D

[02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:28.500]
Was Roy Pressman in here? Tell us that we had a certain length of time that we had to get rid of the carts

[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:34.520]
Talk about an interpret act that was totally unacceptable and grotesque. I can't find it right now

[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:42.220]

Not with black people because black people are like anybody. You know, there's good black people

[02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:13.480]
Black people like white like anybody else, but with black culture in America. I got a real

[02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:21.200]
Serious serious problem with black culture many blacks don't call that black culture you realize what the normal people

[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:27.560]

Check it out, but that's that's like ten steps above rap music

[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:34.920]
That's like about ten steps on the food chain above rap crap

[02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:37.240]
It's just slow schmalti rap

[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:39.520]

[02:18:07.020 --> 02:18:11.060]
We have on an open line. We had a real flurry there even Calgary never had a flurry like that

[02:18:11.060 --> 02:18:13.580]
Then the guy called you started talking hockey and they all disappeared

[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:20.600]
I think that I think that's it no more hockey talk man these people they they not only don't they know anything about it

[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:22.620]
They don't want to hear it because they don't understand it

[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:26.660]
Even if they like it or they think they like it they don't get it

[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:31.060]
They wouldn't know zigmund palfi from the zigmfield follies these people

[02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:33.320]
They're clueless and shoeless and by the way

[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:37.160]
So I saw shulat that game last week which game was that that was that awful Ottawa game a

[02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:41.920]
Where we lost three to nothing but we made it look like three to two was really the final score

[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:43.720]
But it was really three nothing could have been five nothing

[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:45.620]
It was really pathetic again another comment performance

[02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:49.420]
That's why they don't care because we're playing pretty crappy these days. That's why they don't care

[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:52.520]
Cooper city hello

[02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:03.980]
Marlin

[02:19:05.860 --> 02:19:10.260]

[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:23.520]
What do you think? Give him my number. No, you think I should go absolutely. I don't think so

[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:28.000]
He can sit up there by your buddy Harry. Is he gonna me tell? Yes, he and I don't I don't know

[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.860]
I don't think he's making any of the road trips this year none and if he's not there

[02:19:31.860 --> 02:19:34.100]
It's not even worth going no, it's not it's right

[02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:38.200]
He's gonna get up there in the seventh inning and staying for it, but he doesn't do that

[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:43.280]
No, not out of town. He doesn't do it. He did he did that one time and some people got bent out of shape

[02:19:44.580 --> 02:19:46.580]
Why he's the best and he is

[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:50.100]
You're right. Get upset. I'm a cub fan

[02:19:50.500 --> 02:19:55.640]
I don't know but bad. I trust you are true. Right. Well, I guess I answered my next question

[02:19:55.640 --> 02:19:59.280]
I was gonna see if you were gonna have him on the show while he's in town, but I guess if he's in town

[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:00.960]
That's gonna be hard to do that really

[02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:03.300]
My ass a little bit. Yeah

[02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:08.860]

6229 463 and date and we got nothing in date. We got not one call

[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:04.880]
There's two million people in date county

[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:07.860]
There's over two million people not every one of them came in on a rubber raft

[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:12.560]
And we don't have one of them on the phone right now that to me indicates that a either nobody is listening

[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:18.180]
Which I know is not the case or be there a bunch of deadheads which I know is the case or see there to a busy on a Monday for us

[02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:19.140]
Which is also the case

[02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:25.740]
622 w. I. O. D. You better get with it right now, man. Are you gonna have tapes up the ass

[02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:32.800]
Open line on the purple line. That's the mobile one purple line at pound i. O. D. Where's my good friend Jacob for crying out loud

[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:35.020]
Come on Jacob. Where are you hiding it?

[02:27:36.080 --> 02:27:39.240]
Here's western hello. Hey, good morning. How you doing good evening?

[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:44.480]
It well what happened was you and you moved up to Hollywood all the date people fell off

[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:48.740]
They did I imagine I don't think so that was a fourth possibility. Okay

[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:55.340]
I'm really annoyed Neil. What are you annoyed about sir state police sir? Yeah, they suck there

[02:27:55.340 --> 02:28:01.180]
You mean the fhp pigs that is correct. Florida highway pigs. Yeah, that's right. They have nothing better to do

[02:28:01.180 --> 02:28:03.180]
They there's no reason for them to be in existence

[02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:07.420]
You do understand that because we've already discovered that if we need people to write speeding tickets and other

[02:28:07.420 --> 02:28:11.020]
Those stupid tickets we got more than enough to go around to write those

[02:28:11.020 --> 02:28:14.120]
So there's no reason for us to have the Florida highway pigs

[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:15.620]
Well, you know if you're broken down

[02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:17.520]
They're not gonna do anything for you. That's right

[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:24.720]
They don't even stop they don't even stop. I they just laugh as they go by with their big 10 gallon Texas head on as a matter of fact

[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:28.340]
When I tried calling you Friday afternoon on my way home at 130 in the afternoon

[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:33.140]
I paced a Florida pig fhp number one seven seven

[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:34.880]
Eight

[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:43.280]
And this scumbag douchebag slime ball. Yeah, he was doing more than the speed limit up 75

[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:49.800]
Yeah, I followed him from one I got on the palm metal all the way up to when he got off at Sheridan street

[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:53.900]
Yeah, and all this jerk off did was crawl up people's asses

[02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:59.440]
He tailgated a made people panic and kept the flow of traffic the kind of Sheridan street and crawled up people's asses

[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:07.760]
That's right. Okay, so his speed was nowhere less than at least 73 miles an hour and their times he topped over 80 rectum

[02:29:08.940 --> 02:29:13.000]
So I just reporting that I lost my case. I know randian as folks did the best they could there

[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:19.680]
You lost the case with the ticket defense team. I never heard of that. I did boy. That's a rarity. I know it is wow

[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:24.260]
Well, what happened was I was on my way to work in the morning. I go to work at four o'clock in the morning

[02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:28.560]
Yeah, it was a day before Thanksgiving. You know they got that construction. Yeah

[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:32.980]
All right, you know that the pigs can now pace you. They don't need radar

[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:38.340]
They can do something that they write on the ticket. They can tell you anything they want they've always been able to do that

[02:29:38.340 --> 02:29:40.180]
Well, I wasn't aware of that sure

[02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:44.380]
They they can say whatever they want basically these guys did yeah

[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:49.820]
And I got it man. I should mention my name. You should have told him Uncle Neil you you still be on the inside

[02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:54.760]
You'd be on the inside looking out. Yeah, okay. Don't do it again pal. All right pal. Okay

[02:29:55.540 --> 02:30:01.120]
Broward County wide open now we finally get date straight now to now Broward goes into a big deep blue funk and we're not too sure

[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:03.880]
We're not too sure why but we think we have a pretty good answer

[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:11.920]
7679 463 767 W1. I'm in a hallway here talking to a fat boy before how about that Panther game Saturday and he goes

[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:13.340]

He said where's the food that must have been a real stinker man

[02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:22.940]
I'll tell you one thing if you take a weekend off and you miss a home game and it turns out to be a really bad bad

[02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:26.220]

[02:30:55.200 --> 02:30:57.340]
Okay, all right, there you go

[02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:05.860]

[02:31:33.220 --> 02:31:34.040]
Words for it

[02:31:40.640 --> 02:31:43.540]
What do I hate this do I hate this particular brand?

[02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:50.940]
What

[02:31:53.420 --> 02:31:59.920]
So anyway look at that broward thing there look at this broward problem man seven six seven nine four six three seven six seven

[02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:04.720]
This has been one of the most excruciating Mondays I can recall in recent memory. This has been hard

[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:08.340]
It has been brutally hard. I can't even put it in the words

[02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:12.900]
God like a rock like a brick just like a brick

[02:32:13.400 --> 02:32:16.260]
Like a lot of those shots that were thrown up in the NCAA's by the way

[02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:20.940]
His little tip for all you better's out there wild cats gonna win the NCAA championship. All right

[02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:23.880]
And thank God that Arizona

[02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:27.160]
Thank God they didn't blow that game in the end. They give it a damn good shot

[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:31.600]
I'm so sick of North Carolina and Dean Smith. I mean, he's a great coach in the yada yada

[02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:36.260]
He's been there a hundred years already go away Dean go find a life go play majong

[02:32:36.820 --> 02:32:40.440]
Go read tarot. He's been a coach there for a hundred years already go away

[02:32:41.480 --> 02:32:44.620]
And Arizona how bad can they be with a coach who plays the skin loot

[02:32:46.260 --> 02:32:50.440]
He's got white herries a sweet. He's a sweet this guy the coach of Arizona

[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:54.540]
And they actually got a couple of white guys on their team, but they sit on the sideline of course

[02:32:54.540 --> 02:32:59.940]
And they've got three black guys who are very very light-complexed who I think might be related to 3t

[02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:03.420]
Why is that when you think it's just a coincidence?

[02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:07.940]
The Arizona we recruit black guys, but they can't be like over a certain degree of darkness

[02:33:07.940 --> 02:33:12.240]
Because there's all those real bigots out there in Arizona. All those John Birch types out there

[02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:18.640]
We'll support your basketball team as long as you don't got no darkies that are like a too dark over a scale of three on a rickter scale

[02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:21.200]
So like I said 3t might play for them pretty soon

[02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:26.620]
Broward County. We're waiting on you. I'm gonna put this microphone down. I'm gonna walk around the room and wait

[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.220]
I want to see an explosion in Broward like so which has never been seen everybody else is a smoking

[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:41.460]
7679 463 767 W I O D our poll question today is how do you like Ron and Ron? How do you like Rick and suds?

[02:33:41.460 --> 02:33:45.520]
How do you like the new bitch at night time? How do you like Brooke Daniels? How do you like the news guy?

[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:49.840]
How do you like Wandsmendietta? How do you like David Halberstam? How do you like Michael Mayo?

[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:56.840]
Hold the Mayo yeah, let me say it again in case you missed it earlier Michael Mayo writes a big column this morning about tennis

[02:33:57.700 --> 02:34:04.700]
About a pansy sport about Tomas Fuster mooster whatever the hell your guys name is and still refuses to apologize

[02:34:04.700 --> 02:34:09.140]
Michael Mayo. I'm gonna talk about this every day on his show for the rest of my life

[02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:13.480]
I'm gonna mention this until you write the apology that you promised you promised right here

[02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:18.580]
We got it on tape if we have to dig the tape out okay if I have to dig that tape out and play it every day

[02:34:21.020 --> 02:34:26.160]
You made a pledge to retract that line about trying to get David Halberstam fire just because you're anti-Semitic

[02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:31.320]
Because your grandma's name was Moskovitz or whatever it is you better get with it Michael or we're gonna start getting pithed off

[02:34:32.460 --> 02:34:35.920]
And when we get pithed off we might actually start buying the herald but I doubted

[02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:42.140]
This and the oven listen to you quite a while and I hear a lot of talk about the tickets and your your collars and you

[02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:43.640]
Talking about how

[02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:46.140]
unfair a lot of this is

[02:37:46.140 --> 02:37:53.500]
Hawn for what way man? I want to fear what is well that people are receiving traffic tickets, you know and

[02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:57.140]
You know you can keep in mind that are you are you a cop?

[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:04.240]
I'm sorry. Are you a cop? No, I'm not a cop. No, I'm an airline pilot and uh what a no for not for Delta

[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:07.780]
I hope not for Delta no not for Delta. Oh, thank god

[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:16.000]
You know you've got people you got 50 almost 50,000 40,000 people a year dying on the America's highways

[02:38:16.140 --> 02:38:21.940]
Yeah, look at that number look at the number. It's in cram and you've got and it's because of speed

[02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:26.980]
Is that what you're saying? Well, no, it's for a lot of causes. Yeah, I mean, it's let me ask you let me ask you this question

[02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:31.020]
When's the last time you saw one of these old 90-year-old drivers who should never have a driver's license

[02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:35.940]
When's the last time you saw one of them pull over for going too slow or impeding traffic when's the last time?

[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:39.640]
Well, you're right. I'm not never saw it never saw it in my life. I lived here

[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:42.320]
I lived here for 21 years. I've never seen it once

[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:47.640]
Well, it's you're right. It should be tail. We should have a system in place where these elderly drivers are

[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:51.860]
They have to be periodically tested when they reach a certain age, but they've got so much for the car

[02:38:51.860 --> 02:38:58.280]
We're talking about people in their 90s. We're talking about people in their mid 80s and 90s who are getting renewals by mail for six years

[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:00.140]
I don't have any problem with that

[02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:02.620]
You wonder why people are getting killed on the highway out there

[02:39:03.380 --> 02:39:08.700]
People deserve to get tickets because because they're going because they're going 10 miles over this speed limit

[02:39:08.700 --> 02:39:12.240]
Accidents and they're caught and people to get killed. Let me say let me say this to you

[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:18.580]
Okay, if you're going 10 miles over the speed limit 11 o'clock at night on a road where there's absolutely no other traffic in either direction

[02:39:18.580 --> 02:39:24.900]
I've never gotten a ticket for that. I routinely go 10 miles over the speed limit right by cost and I have never received a ticket for that

[02:39:24.900 --> 02:39:29.020]
That's not the kind of ticket I'm talking about those tickets are written every day every day

[02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:32.980]
Probably right, but Zillian's on the number of people that are running red lights in this town

[02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:35.020]
How about the people that are driving around stona?

[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:39.060]
How about the people that are driving around stoned out of their minds out there in his town?

[02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:43.380]
Well, that's true too. There you go. The point is is people who deserve to get tickets

[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:50.020]
Very often and some people don't deserve it. I is certainly nothing some doing some don't and sometimes it's just as well

[02:39:50.540 --> 02:39:53.040]
You know, I mean, you know look at the media attention

[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:58.300]
We have an airplane crash is and god knows any any airplane a crash and kill somebody at the tragic event

[02:39:58.300 --> 02:40:04.820]
Yeah, they haven't been they're haven't been seven or seven or eight thousand people or left have been killed in the entire history of

[02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:09.220]
Aviation. Yeah, we have 40,000 people per year. That's right

[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:14.240]
Because you also got a lot of don't you got a lot of dumb people out there driving to you realize that don't you?

[02:40:14.260 --> 02:40:17.940]
Of course, and the dumber you are the more dangerous you are well

[02:40:17.940 --> 02:40:21.300]
That's very I say let's get everybody off the road except you and me. How's that?

[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:25.660]
Well, I don't think that's gonna work and you start and date now all the stonest day and browards

[02:41:55.720 --> 02:42:02.200]
Offed himself? Are you serious? Didn't you see that in the paper today? I was a familiar with that guy from you, Em was one of the

[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:08.340]
cult members who drank the stuff and ate the pudding and the apple sauce and bought the story and then turns out the

[02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:37.380]
Committed that off himself. He drank the crap. So you think he was influenced by the Huracans? I think it was because he was a

[02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:46.080]
Cool. Yeah, that's enough that would be enough to make me blow my brains out. Come on. Okay. One more thing. Yeah, I got this dog over here. Yeah,

Go to the retriever. My goal and retriever hasn't done a number in the house since he was an infant. Okay.

Well, you take, listen to me. You take the depositories and when you want to put them out like after you feed them about 20 minutes after you feed them.

[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:35.400]
Yeah, you stick a depository in his rectum and then you take them out. Listen to me. You take him outside immediately and within a matter of moments that pressure there on his

[02:43:35.820 --> 02:43:41.380]
rectum will cause him to do the number outside and then he'll realize that when you go outside, that's where you do your thing.

[02:43:41.860 --> 02:43:46.800]
I'm telling you, I nobody wants to believe me. It's the surest way to house break a dog. You're a sick,

[02:44:54.500 --> 02:45:02.240]
You know, I usually look the other way. Well, the friend of mine that was with me, that was his first hockey game. And it was really funny because he's asking me.

[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:07.380]
Why do they keep dumping the puck down the other end and then they don't go and get it?

They say I love his taboo.

[02:47:06.860 --> 02:47:09.000]
That what we're doing is wrong.

[02:47:10.540 --> 02:47:12.680]
But I don't care what they say.

[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:16.900]
Because my love is so strong.

[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:20.920]
They tell us we should be ashamed.

[02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:24.460]
We're not husband and wife.

[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:29.080]
But I cherish each moment with you.

[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:33.160]
I'm so glad you're in my life.

[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:45.880]
You're my prison bitch.

[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:47.260]
My prison bitch.

[02:47:47.780 --> 02:47:49.680]
You're not a lie, girl, the man.

[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:53.020]
I'm glad we share a prison cell.

[02:47:53.020 --> 02:47:55.340]
When lights go out, it's in.

[02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.540]
I can't escape the way I feel.

[02:47:58.820 --> 02:48:01.100]
Now that would be a prime.

[02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:04.120]
As long as I am doing you,

[02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:06.840]
I don't mind doing time.

[02:48:08.020 --> 02:48:10.960]
Cause you're my prison bitch.

[02:48:11.340 --> 02:48:12.460]
My prison bitch.

[02:48:12.900 --> 02:48:14.740]
And I have no regrets.

[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:17.980]
I got you for a candy bar.

[02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:20.300]
And a pack of cigarettes.

[02:48:21.100 --> 02:48:23.200]
At first you were resistant.

[02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:26.100]
But now you are my friend.

[02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:30.440]
I knew that I would get you in the end.

[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:33.680]
Oh, prison bitch.

[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:36.540]
Oh, prison bitch.

[02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:41.340]
I guess that you were sent from a bar.

[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:44.880]
Yeah, prison bitch.

[02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:47.520]
Oh, prison bitch.

[02:48:48.060 --> 02:48:51.140]
Oh, and now you are my prisoner.

[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:52.160]
Oh.

[02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:55.640]
And I'm your prison bitch.

[02:48:56.160 --> 02:48:57.080]
Your prison bitch.

[02:48:57.520 --> 02:48:59.300]
And you're a sex machine.

[02:48:59.680 --> 02:48:59.840]
Ah.

[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:02.540]
I only have a one request.

[02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:04.880]
How about some gasoline.

[02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:05.420]
Yeah.

[02:49:05.900 --> 02:49:08.280]
I'm tired of these prison cells.

[02:49:08.740 --> 02:49:10.580]
I need to get away.

[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:13.920]
The sentence made to seven years.

[02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:18.060]
Not seven times a day, and you'll be in bitch.

[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:21.860]
You'll be in bitch, you're in for many acts.

[02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:22.280]
Kimmy!

[02:49:22.660 --> 02:49:27.640]
I really hate these markers that you've got to be on my back.

[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:33.060]
I thought that I could break away, but now I'm losing hope.

[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:37.280]
God, I'm bored of picking up the song.

[02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:39.420]
And I'll write.

[02:49:39.420 --> 02:49:40.700]
Where's a bitch?

[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:43.520]
Where's a bitch?

[02:49:44.980 --> 02:49:49.240]
Burn up the lights, because I can hardly wait.

[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:50.580]
Oh!

[02:49:50.860 --> 02:49:51.900]
Where's a bitch?

[02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:54.660]
Where's a bitch?

[02:49:55.700 --> 02:49:59.500]
And when I get out, I'm ready to go straight.

[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:04.120]
I know my prison bitch, my prison bitch.

[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:06.540]
I'll never say goodbye.

[02:50:06.540 --> 02:50:13.040]
You're not like all the others, too bad they had to die.

[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:17.020]
On the second bomb I think I'll stay.

[02:50:17.580 --> 02:50:26.620]
If you want me to, your prison bitch is never leaving you.

[02:50:36.620 --> 02:50:40.620]
I know I know why they call you up.

[02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:41.660]
Hard criminal.

[02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:48.900]
You're about to find out what you call this, the polkae.

[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:54.360]
We almost forgot that.

[02:50:54.740 --> 02:50:56.600]
Thanks to Farage for reminding me, or we'd do that.

[02:50:56.600 --> 02:50:57.240]
That would be in big trouble.

[02:50:59.020 --> 02:51:00.380]
151 at WIOD.

[02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:01.040]
Happy Monday.

[02:51:01.220 --> 02:51:04.600]
We apologize profusely for the intemperate first two hours with that bad microphone.

[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:08.160]
With the Faulty equipment, which is pretty unusual here at Paxing Broadcasting.

[02:51:08.520 --> 02:51:10.220]
Pretty unusual for us to have faulty stuff.

[02:51:11.760 --> 02:51:12.760]
By the way, did you see Juan?

[02:51:12.980 --> 02:51:13.480]
Did you run into him?

[02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:14.340]
Juan Mendillero.

[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:14.900]
You didn't see me.

[02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:15.720]
He was in here to get his check.

[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:17.040]
Juan's Mendillero.

[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:20.560]
He said he's doing over there at Channel 7, and they're all smiling about it.

[02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:22.500]
Here's Miami Beach on a mobile.

[02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:22.820]
Hello.

[02:51:23.240 --> 02:51:23.720]
Hey, Neonel.

[02:51:23.820 --> 02:51:24.200]
Yes, sir.

[02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:25.960]
Let me pick up here real quick.

[02:51:26.660 --> 02:51:30.940]
Listen, a little thing for your listeners to be lit on the lookout for when they're going out to the arena.

[02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:31.580]
Yeah.

[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:33.860]
There's some of these guys in blue.

[02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:36.060]
They call themselves City of Miami Police Department.

[02:51:36.820 --> 02:51:37.260]
Yeah.

[02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:42.780]
Well, they're doing a little something funny with those tickets that some folks are considered scout.

[02:51:43.220 --> 02:51:43.540]
Yeah.

[02:51:43.880 --> 02:51:49.040]
They're confiscating them, and giving them back to somebody they call a scout for to resell them.

[02:51:49.180 --> 02:51:49.620]
Hi.

[02:51:50.220 --> 02:51:53.280]
Now, don't tell me there's a scam going on out there at the arena.

[02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:53.380]
Yeah.

[02:51:53.700 --> 02:51:54.100]
Yep.

[02:51:54.320 --> 02:52:00.100]
And I'd like to call you listeners that go out there to be real careful who they buy these tickets from.

[02:52:00.260 --> 02:52:00.980]
Oh, hey.

[02:52:01.220 --> 02:52:03.740]
They might just be the ones that are taking their tax money, too.

[02:52:03.860 --> 02:52:07.200]
You know, it's funny because one of my chronic listeners came over in the before the audible game,

[02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:10.340]
and he almost got thrown into whose cow for scouting a ticket.

[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:12.520]
Well, I'll tell you, it's not even going to happen.

[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:16.560]
If you can buy it from below, these guys are going to take the ticket away from you.

[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:16.800]
Yeah.

[02:52:16.980 --> 02:52:20.100]
The guy who sells them to you just kind of wanders off.

[02:52:20.240 --> 02:52:20.440]
Yeah.

[02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:23.560]
And, you know, office or friendly there takes tickets.

[02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:30.860]
Tickets in his pocket gives you a few ex-putters and on to the next corner he passes them off to Mr. Joe Scalper.

[02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:34.180]
You know, it's interesting because they do confiscate the tickets.

[02:52:34.660 --> 02:52:36.020]
Oh, they confiscate the tickets.

[02:52:36.020 --> 02:52:37.660]
And they also save you got any other ones there.

[02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:41.420]
And of course, if you're still good enough to say yes and you give it to them, you're making them some big bucks.

[02:52:41.540 --> 02:52:43.980]
Oh, they'll take everything you've gotten, including your shorts.

[02:52:44.040 --> 02:52:44.460]
All right.

[02:52:44.460 --> 02:52:46.340]
So those right back to somebody else.

[02:52:46.480 --> 02:52:46.700]
Great.

[02:52:46.700 --> 02:52:54.260]
So if you want to let your listeners know that, yeah, and I encourage them to call in a little bit of people know they're not there on the track too.

[02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:54.680]
Okay.

[02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:55.340]
All right, man.

[02:52:55.500 --> 02:52:56.240]
Thanks for the good news.

[02:52:56.620 --> 02:52:58.980]
Okay, scam, ticket scam, arena scam.

[02:52:59.180 --> 02:52:59.520]
There you go.

[02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:00.820]
Hey boy, what's that in your mouth?

[02:53:01.100 --> 02:53:03.840]
We have an open line on the mobile one purple line there, pond IOD.

[02:53:04.020 --> 02:53:14.680]
We have one in day, six, two, two, nine, four, six, three, six, two, two, two, two, two, two, IOD on a great Monday, on a tumultuous Monday, at WIOD, where every day is a great day.

[02:53:14.680 --> 02:53:16.820]
Where every day is a picnic without the ants.

[02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:18.640]
Here's Miami.

[02:53:18.700 --> 02:53:19.020]
Hello.

[02:53:20.340 --> 02:53:20.700]
Miami.

[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:21.340]
Hello.

[02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:21.920]
Yes, sir.

[02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:26.340]
Yeah, I think the sweet water police department are a bunch of pigs.

[02:53:26.580 --> 02:53:26.800]
Yeah.

[02:53:28.300 --> 02:53:29.260]
Yeah, that was all right.

[02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:30.060]
Okay, okay, Don.

[02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:30.720]
Thanks a lot.

[02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:31.480]
That was Don.

[02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:32.400]
Was that Don on the phone?

[02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:32.940]
That was Don.

[02:53:33.100 --> 02:53:33.440]
That was him.

[02:53:33.740 --> 02:53:34.440]
Get a haircut, Don.

[02:53:34.740 --> 02:53:35.500]
Haircut, yes or no?

[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:36.640]
Let's do a poll.

[02:53:36.780 --> 02:53:37.480]
Should Don get the haircut?

[02:53:37.780 --> 02:53:39.120]
So Stan, what was this, Todd?

[02:53:39.120 --> 02:53:40.860]
Tell me that Stan's off that network thing?

[02:53:41.300 --> 02:53:43.360]
That he had into a big contra-tops with somebody.

[02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:44.060]
How unusual.

[02:53:44.540 --> 02:53:46.600]
Come on Stan, you got to put the food on the table baby.

[02:53:46.760 --> 02:53:48.360]
I don't have any money to be loan anymore.

[02:53:49.360 --> 02:53:51.860]
We have an open line in day, six, two, two, two, WIOD.

[02:53:52.780 --> 02:53:56.960]
We have one on the purple, the mobile one line of all places, which is impossible, at Pound IOD.

[02:53:57.980 --> 02:54:00.340]
Yeah, we better have a big night at the Track Tonight Fat, Rich.

[02:54:00.440 --> 02:54:00.960]
I'll tell you that.

[02:54:01.420 --> 02:54:04.080]
Mr. Hatchout there, he's got all the answers to every race.

[02:54:04.180 --> 02:54:06.440]
He's got the inside, the outside, the skinny, the fat.

[02:54:07.860 --> 02:54:08.760]
Now what the hell is this?

[02:54:08.760 --> 02:54:14.340]
This is a Fax or eight months ago I called, told you that would one, Fax you this story,

[02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:16.140]
and oh father Murphy.

[02:54:16.700 --> 02:54:19.040]
And it's supposed to be, oh look at the printing there George.

[02:54:19.460 --> 02:54:21.720]
Maybe if I'm like a real good one day I'll be able to read that.

[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:23.020]
If I get my health back.

[02:54:23.860 --> 02:54:24.820]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:25.100]
Hello.

[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:26.860]
Neil.

[02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:27.360]
Yes sir.

[02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:28.040]
How are you doing?

[02:54:28.180 --> 02:54:29.620]
Long time listen to First Time Caller.

[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:30.400]
Excellent day.

[02:54:30.640 --> 02:54:32.760]
I've got a great cop story for you.

[02:54:32.900 --> 02:54:33.120]
Okay.

[02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:35.200]
I'm coming home on Broward Boulevard.

[02:54:35.460 --> 02:54:35.620]
Yeah.

[02:54:35.620 --> 02:54:40.160]
And Fort Lauderdale, east of Federal, very busy part of Broward Boulevard at about four

[02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:40.960]
o'clock on Friday.

[02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:41.400]
Yeah.

[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:45.660]
When I notice this commotion up about a half a mile ahead and all the cars are stopped

[02:54:45.660 --> 02:54:46.680]
and I think it's an accident.

[02:54:47.100 --> 02:54:53.560]
But when I get closer it's actually cop in training, stopping traffic with their arms.

[02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:55.100]
And for what do you have to do on a Friday?

[02:54:55.100 --> 02:54:56.120]
And for what afternoon on a Friday.

[02:54:56.340 --> 02:54:57.280]
Oh my god.

[02:54:57.360 --> 02:54:59.540]
There were in the schoolboy guys neck.

[02:54:59.980 --> 02:55:00.160]
Yeah.

[02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:03.880]
There were in the schoolboy orange crossing guard things and they're out in the middle of

[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:06.140]
three practicing how to stop traffic.

[02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:08.180]
Want to go out there and break that **** guys neck.

[02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:08.920]
Yeah okay Wayne.

[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:09.300]
Yeah.

[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:14.700]
And the one in particular this this check look like she was getting attacked by a swarm

[02:55:14.700 --> 02:55:15.420]
of killer bees.

[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:15.860]
Yeah.

[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:19.560]
She's waving all over the place and stopping cars and she's almost causing accidents.

[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:22.180]
And I thought, you know, hey, this is this is the law.

[02:55:22.420 --> 02:55:22.820]
Here they are.

[02:55:23.540 --> 02:55:24.360]
It's nice going.

[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:25.040]
Yeah.

[02:55:25.380 --> 02:55:26.720]
I'd love to see her attacks always at work.

[02:55:26.860 --> 02:55:30.740]
It's like when they put the a trainee board ops in the middle of the day at my show between

[02:55:30.740 --> 02:55:32.060]
10 and 2 in prime time.

[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:32.940]
Same thing.

[02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:33.260]
Yeah.

[02:55:33.460 --> 02:55:33.780]
George.

[02:55:34.020 --> 02:55:34.160]
Yeah.

[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:34.220]

[02:55:34.260 --> 02:55:34.760]
The other geniuses.

[02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:35.040]
Yep.

[02:55:35.740 --> 02:55:36.220]
All right.

[02:55:36.420 --> 02:55:37.300]
Thanks for the good news.

[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:38.160]
I thought you'd enjoy that.

[02:55:38.460 --> 02:55:38.780]
Okay.

[02:55:39.020 --> 02:55:39.400]
In closing.

[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:40.900]
Can I call someone a douchebag?

[02:55:41.020 --> 02:55:41.580]
Deem I guessed.

[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:43.720]
Brad you are an internet leasing douchebag.

[02:55:43.860 --> 02:55:44.120]
Okay.

[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:44.560]
Thanks.

[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:45.160]
See ya.

[02:55:45.660 --> 02:55:49.340]
So anyway anybody seen Brad's pits penis on the internet yet everybody's seen that.

[02:55:49.860 --> 02:55:51.320]
Everybody has seen Brad pit on the internet.

[02:55:51.460 --> 02:55:51.960]
I tell you one thing.

[02:55:52.020 --> 02:55:54.560]
He may not be all that gigantic, but he sure can't act.

[02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:57.420]
Sure can act for a kid that looks as good as he does.

[02:55:57.660 --> 02:55:59.280]
He couldn't act his way out of a paper sack.

[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:00.520]
What's in the box?

[02:56:01.940 --> 02:56:04.900]
You talk about somebody desperately trying to be somebody else.

[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:10.040]
Now Matt Dillon, that kid always was trying to be a combination between Marlon Brando and

[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:11.160]
somebody I can't figure out.

[02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:11.400]
Okay.

[02:56:11.740 --> 02:56:13.000]
Always wanted to be somebody else.

[02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:17.500]
Brad pit in seven was desperately trying to be Marlon.

[02:56:17.540 --> 02:56:19.140]
Everybody wants to be Marlon Brando.

[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:24.460]
Which there's only one Marlon Brando and this to which why the hell would you want to be Marlon Brando anyway?

[02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:26.320]
That damn bag and I can't stand up.

[02:56:26.420 --> 02:56:26.640]
God.

[02:56:26.980 --> 02:56:29.000]
He must wait like 700 pounds now doesn't he?

[02:56:29.820 --> 02:56:35.100]
In fact, he's so big they were going to make Godfather four five and six all at the same time with Marlon.

[02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:37.540]
Do it all the roles, eatin' all the roles.

[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:42.000]
Poor Marlon man, they had to kill him off in the first movie.

[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:43.020]
Don Coyote.

[02:56:44.380 --> 02:56:50.480]
I am Marlon and grateful that you have invited me to your daughter's wedding.

[02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:51.000]
Exactly.

[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:53.340]
157 at WID.

[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:57.100]
Do yourself a favor and go see by the way, Fair Rich, like Donnie Brasco, there's one vote.

[02:56:57.100 --> 02:57:00.980]
From our movie review crowd, everybody else hated it like poison except a couple listeners,

[02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:03.260]
a couple of New Yorkers and Riches from New York anyway.

[02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:05.840]
Everybody else said don't go see it.

[02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:07.260]
Go see the Godfather, okay.

[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:11.920]
Then you'll understand where all these lines are that we use on the show all the time that everybody in the world keeps repeating these lines.

[02:57:12.220 --> 02:57:14.860]
How can you understand what we're talking about if you haven't seen the Godfather?

[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:16.860]
For your father, for your father.

[02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:18.040]
Right?

[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:20.800]
Leave the gun, take the canole.

[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:23.020]
If you haven't seen Godfather, what the hell does that mean?

[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:24.080]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[02:57:25.180 --> 02:57:29.860]
