RAD MAN

[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.060]
RAD MAN

[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.400]
RAD MAN

[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.880]
RAD MAN

[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.520]
RAD MAN

[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:57.700]
RAD MAN

[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.320]
Oh

[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:30.180]
Are you done?

[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.120]
Come on come on enough of the crying enough of the crying come on

[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.720]
All right

[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.020]
My god, it's we're changing the name of the franchise to the cry babies. I'm serious

[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.600]
I have never been so disgusted in my life. It's the last 48 hours or whatever the hell it's been

[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.860]
I just I can't cope with it. I cannot deal with it

[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.280]
Yesterday we sat here listening to four hours of sputum people who had no idea what they were talking about

[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.460]
And you know something you can you can debate that call two nights ago

[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.880]
You know from now to the end of time the fact is that there wouldn't have been any call and there wouldn't have been any

[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.520]
Lost if they wouldn't have blown the lead again with 19 seconds left. That's not debatable. That is a matter of fact

[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.840]
So let's find out this morning. What's the excuse for last night?

[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.660]
Let's be creative and find out at the end of the telecast last night

[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.260]
And I don't want to start picking on my close personal friend again, but I will anyway

[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.340]
At the end of the telecast and by the way in the pregame show they start out with 20 minutes of oh my god from Brian Murray

[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.440]
And the rim man and everybody else and we was robbed that by the way nice go and drive to make all you sure put somebody in place

[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.860]
That was great. Well, why don't you show the replay of that other one with Kirk Mueller last week. Wow, we don't have that all too bad

[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.800]
Yeah, and also wrong headline in the sunset last morning

[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.420]
Let's see this is this is what it took me 21 years to find out what this town is all about

[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.840]
Just put anything you want in the papers just go on a year and spew any kind of crap you want and everybody buys into it

[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.700]
They start repeating it like a bunch of parrots and HL official admits reason to feel angry. No, he didn't admit that

[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.960]
He admitted that there was a mistake in a one on Kirk Muller and Richter land those Sundays game

[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.400]
Not the one two nights ago, but hey, don't confuse the people of the Sun Sentinel cuz you had different people make the headlines

[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.240]
Etc. And so on let's hear the come on. Let's hear it. I

[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.580]
Want to find out what the excuse was last night. So on the post game show. I found out what it was

[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.400]
Oh, no, that wasn't it

[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.300]
That was not it cut the crap. Well, yeah, stop it

[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.320]
Put that tongue back into proper place will you the reason was according to the rim man that they lost last night in that

[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.640]
Gretzky had the natural hat trick there in the second period and made Eddie Joe and Paul laws and everybody else looked like a bunch of monkeys

[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.420]
The reason was because we still emotionally were so distraught

[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.920]
We just couldn't get our act together from the night before and I want to tell you something last season

[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.420]
With the whole organization okay from Brian Murray and Bill Tory and Doug McClain and every player on our team

[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.880]
It was character man every game they played they were never out of a game

[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.660]
They were always like battling right to the end no matter what the score was they had

[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.560]
Strumatic come back that for one game in Dallas. They were losing and tied it up

[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.480]
I mean time and time again never out of a game never cry babies never making excuses now

[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.200]
This franchise has become a bunch of winers and cry babies, okay?

[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:24.280]
How many times have that man in the creesteing been called this year that have caused teams dearly including already in the playoffs caused teams a goal and a game and

[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.960]
Yeah, you hear some conversation about it

[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.700]
But can that be used as an excuse the next day and the next week and the next month?

[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.900]
How long are we gonna make excuses that we got a defenseman there who's supposed to be a superstar that again last night in the third period

[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.540]
He's spending most of the time on the bench because he's an impediment to our lives

[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.040]
We don't trust putting his big ass on the ice and rightfully so

[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.900]
I mean it's a it's a sad thing. It's a shame

[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.300]
That's something that was so great and so positive has now been reduced to this this incessant

[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.860]
Winning and crying that just never stops now

[00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.340]
And especially the people on their last night on the telecast win and crying about it

[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.720]
The night before couldn't figure out what the hell was going on

[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.900]
And they were the ones who like kind of cheerlead everybody else in a wine and crying

[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.620]
Who also didn't know what was going on and what the call really was?

[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.500]
So let's hear it. What was the reason that the Panthers lost to the Rangers last night besides number 99?

[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.500]
Let's hear what it is come on. I'm ready. I'm game

[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.660]
W I O D. Hey, how you doing? No, okay, sir? Great game last night. This team. It was a great game

[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.820]
Listen to me. This team is completely calm and dozing

[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.940]
So why does that make it a great game? Yeah, there was a great game between

[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.700]
Buffalo and Ottawa last night. That was the great game of the three. Okay, listen

[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.140]
Let's let's get to reality here. Age of anowski stinks. Yes, that's great

[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.100]
Defense

[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.300]
Um

[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.920]
Pinching it last night

[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.960]
Yeah, what do you got to have a Jewish guys go on the middle of paysock?

[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.560]
Of course, I was you know, he was going anyway, but the problem about Robbie. There's the one kid

[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.120]
Why don't you mention Robbie? There's the one guy that's playing him in the geezer Robbie baby nice go and sweet

[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.380]
Our he's playing all of a sudden. He got a fire under his ass right meal

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.220]
Straca was useless Chris Wells wasn't even like paint watch and paint dry

[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.480]
He was less than useless

[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.700]
Staca will never be a player again to this team because McLean is he's totally destroyed his confidence and he's useless

[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:33.320]
Right, Doug McLean's head is so big. Yeah, his success got to his head so much what he thinks he can't do wrong

[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:41.500]
Yeah, Doug McLean doesn't have a clue right now of what lines to put on on the ice. Yeah, he doesn't have a clue on

[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:49.280]
Anything yeah, the only thing he knows is when and where he's gonna take showers with the players that he wants to take with yeah

[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.680]
Play a forming meal. Yeah, cuz I have a couple things to say about that. I'm listening

[00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.420]
Bill Lindsey. Yeah, it's a shame. He didn't do anything bad last night cuz he didn't play yeah, of course

[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:09.800]
Garth Alas a we got the matrix. He got her. There's no excuse for for sitting back in the third period two days ago

[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.240]
Yeah, there's no excuse

[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.620]
Well, how is it that the coach had a press conference yesterday

[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.900]
He said that the officiating had nothing to do with losing the game the other night that it had to do with the fact that they

[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.000]
Went into a coma and the third period had only three shots including only one in the last 60 minutes

[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.200]
And they sat back and then tried to protect that one goal lead in blue with 19 seconds left

[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:33.600]
How come he said that and and everybody else including the general manager is on there like belly aching and moaning and carrying on and

[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.060]
You know you got to get over it man. You got to get over it. I'm alive

[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.640]
Mm-hmm crying and crying and so very sad thing to me. It's a very sad thing to me

[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.700]
It honestly is taking over and I'm gonna be there tomorrow night. I won't I'm giving my tickets away today's matter

[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:55.160]
Fact in my parking pass for tomorrow night because we had a choice. I had a dilemma right and a rumor made it up for me

[00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.380]
When a post game show started and he came on there and made my comment made his I'm not oh god forbid made his comment about the

[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:07.000]
Reason that they lost is because they emotionally were so a distraught and they couldn't get their act back together after

[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.860]
I get in rob the night before at that point I picked up the phone

[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:15.040]
I got on the phone with the airliner said we're going away for the weekend and I'm gonna give away those not not because they're losing

[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.360]
But I just I I am tired. I need to rest from the ambiance of this whole cry baby syndrome man

[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.720]
I'm gonna tell you nobody wanted them to win more than I did tonight to go and let me say it again

[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.960]
But that was you know you can debate that pro-recon

[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.680]
I still think it was the proper call you can debate it forever

[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.420]
But when you blow the game for the umpteenth time with 19 seconds left and you see here like I did yesterday

[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.560]
Listen to four hours of people crying and whining and then here it again last night and here it is again in the paper today

[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.120]
Yesterday yesterday

[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.960]
There was almost nothing in here in the sunset and about it now. We got a whole big page with a headline

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:53.060]
The players are still upset. Where is it? Oh, yeah, Panther's still upset over this allowed goal

[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.740]
Here's a whole practically page

[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.580]
Then of course in little Predaco's on arrangers our set cuz Bill Burr got slew footed there by a

[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.820]
Kirk Mueller and

[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.020]
Broke his ankle, but we don't care about that anymore than we care about Chris Wells

[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:10.700]
Bust and Messie's chin wide open and open a leak called on that. I mean this it's gotten to the point now

[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.800]
We're the now I'm beginning to one understand I don't begin and now I do understand

[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.880]
Absolutely why the fans here don't have a clue why every time a guy gets somebody give a great body check

[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:27.100]
Get one of our guys banging into the boards great play and the crowd here is yelling hey raff you suck and are screaming for a penalty because

[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.140]
They've been conditioned of this the broadcasters the management the people associated with that team

[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.960]
It's become a crybaby thing we become a bunch of winers and

[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:43.920]
Like I said, it's it's so in contrast to the whole character or what this team accomplished last year and away this town was behind them and enthused and involved

[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.100]
It's very sad

[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.240]
It's very sad to me because character and guts and balls is what we kept talking about all your long last year

[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.980]
And the last few months and I do mean few months like maybe since December

[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.420]
We haven't seen too much of that here's a team that hasn't won what do they want two games on the road since January

[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.600]
This is the end of April two games on the road can't win on the road

[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.880]
Guess what you're not gonna go too far into playoffs because you can't play all the games at home

[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.280]
can't win a game on a road can't protect the lead late in the game

[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:20.300]
And they're on their last night. I mean just on and on and on from the pregame with Ned Smith with his one I and Randy

[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.500]
Molar and they're crying and then the rimmer and Denise they're crying some more and Brian Murray's on here

[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.620]
And he's crying and then after the game. I'm hearing this crying because oh, yeah

[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.400]
I don't hear anybody talking about the fact that Eddie couldn't he couldn't play little league right now

[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.720]
He couldn't play for the Windsor Spitfires the way he's playing. They'd still stick his big fat ass on a bench

[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:39.940]
I

[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.060]
Mean don't take it away from Gretzky as much as I hate him

[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.080]
You know, that's when the stars come through just like Mary old last night a minute ago

[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.100]
There were head three to one the game is in the bag already and he scores on a breakaway a brilliant goal

[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:55.020]
And probably his last game ever in Pittsburgh. I mean the big stars the great players they shine at the right moment believe me

[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.240]
And Gretzky just these guys were standing around watching him there

[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.600]
They were like mesmerized like oh here he goes again. There's another move. Oh, it's in the net too bad too late and

[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.380]
People are crying. Oh, it's the referees fault

[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.000]
I'm a serious man it makes me want to puke it makes me want to barf

[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.020]
The tremendous turnaround that we've seen in one year and you know something most of it goes back

[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.760]
I don't want to go into it. You know when it goes back to if you've got a brain

[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.700]
You know when it goes back to we're gonna convince you we're gonna be about your hardasses

[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.480]
And we're gonna convince you that we're the geniuses

[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.140]
We know everything and everything we do is right whether that fat slawb on a radio agrees or not or anybody else

[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.540]
So there you go Jeff Nudnik says radio ratings bounce like yo-yo's

[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.580]
There's a picture of Howard again Howard really is a publicity okay Jeff

[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.920]
Lovely picture though

[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.500]
But at any rate yeah the ratings really we had a bomb on this station make no mistake about that we had La Bomba

[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.740]
I mean gigantic La Bomba although somehow this show we were still number one and men from 10 to 2

[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:58.180]
I'd say we did about an eight five which most people would kill for that and if it took out that one bad month of February

[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.860]
Where nobody could find a diaries and when I was ready to walk out of here we would have done okay

[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.400]
But hey life goes on you know what I'm saying we'll have to fumble our way through some way some way somehow

[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.580]
So we'll take names today by the way George

[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.820]
And in the one to two hour will love Sabrina can pay she gonna be here the whole time of course she is because she's not driving home

[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.080]
Is she?

[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.720]
Not today. Oh tomorrow

[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.060]
So she can pick the name out of the hat that'll be very exciting

[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.880]
We'll pick a winner and give away the tickets in the parking pass and come here pick it up and watch right there in 106

[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.800]
You can fill the asses in those seats with all the great company. You'll have in 106

[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.760]
You'll be able to sit right there and look up behind it. You're right and there'll be Rimmer and Denise and the tongues will be like

[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.340]
Bapapapapa all over the place

[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:45.500]
Man oh man oh man just cry and wine and carry on you got to go out there and get the job done

[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.020]
You know what I'm saying you got to go out there and play the game you can't keep crying forever doesn't get the job done

[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.400]
Doesn't win ball games hockey games domino games

[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.540]
It doesn't win pinuck alternatives. You can't just sit around and cry

[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.160]
W-I-O-T

[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.360]
Little Rogers is my lover

[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.180]
Jennifer

[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.420]
What's the news today?

[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.760]
We like what you say

[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.140]
Tell those asses they can all go

[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.480]
Take it in and hold it just so

[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.160]
No one needs the headlines quite like

[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.900]
We love the way

[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.260]
Just keep your mind and tell them all

[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.080]
You never change

[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.500]
You're right when you say that this place needs a child

[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.380]
And the dorm is blow job

[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.540]
Genoa

[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.380]
It's not to be

[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.020]
That you'll really feel

[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.900]
And if a Jennifer says you don't like

[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.780]
Yankee baby and get a life

[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.560]
Cost no one beats the

[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.400]
Genoa

[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:38.900]
And 20 of W-I-O-D here's the lady mobile in West Palm Beach hello. Hi Neil. Yes, ma'am

[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:46.020]
What is it? Dropkick Rimmer. Yeah dropkick you don't need a guy like that

[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:51.020]
Don't need a guy like that as a friend what you know, I mean you consider the guy a friend

[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:57.000]
I separate business from personal. I don't think I could do that now with it not with the crap

[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.340]
He can't he can't do it, but I try to do it

[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.480]
What is this crap, you know, I mean aren't you sick of a I don't know yes

[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.340]
Well, what do you think I'm talking about I talked about it yesterday

[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:12.020]
I'm talking about it again today. I'm sick and tired of the company line show crap

[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:16.220]
Okay, these guys we played three playoff games so far or four of mom sorry

[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:20.000]
And now one of them have they gone out there and played a real game. We haven't seen any

[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.160]
Playoff caliber play from this team so far even again that we won that first game was nothing to write home about

[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.980]
Thomas I totally agree with you. I don't know if I could be friends with the guy

[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.920]
I mean how how do you have a serious camera? So now you're gonna

[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.960]
You've been talking about now you're gonna tell me who my friends are gonna be is that it? No, I'm not telling you who to be friends

[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.240]
I'm just saying I'm questioning why you would want to be friends with this guy

[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.500]
Don't you know anybody who's a good person except that in certain areas? They tend to be full of crap

[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.640]
You don't know anybody like that

[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:53.240]
You agree with all your friends and everything they say that's that you you can't separate business from personal

[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.060]
You better go talk to Connie okay, she'll straighten you out now. They will fear you

[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.580]
We have an open line at day at 622 w. I. Would do one on the other timeline one triple eight

[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.920]
And it's not just him it was Denise the same thing and go Brian Marie's on there. I thought he was gonna break into tears there

[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.240]
I thought he was absolutely gonna break into tears on it and interview in a pregame show

[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:16.180]
I love John Domingo though and believe me. I'm never one that sticks out for the officials because generally speaking

[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.360]
They release suck especially in the NHL

[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:25.380]
From Brian Burkin Domingo and all of the referees in the lines been most of them suck their performance is usually pretty weak

[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.980]
But get over it

[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.020]
Let's move on with life and then to use as an excuse when a game is over

[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:36.140]
We lost because we just couldn't emotionally get our act together from that from that horrible trauma that I'd be for now

[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:41.420]
Which trauma are we talking about the fact that we we got the goal taken away or the fact we blew the lead with 19 seconds left again

[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.620]
Like we did both games in Washington by the way once with 10 seconds left and once with 48 seconds left

[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.880]
And just do it over and over and over again

[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:59.360]
There wasn't one word about that there was not one word spoken about that that was the umpteenth time to this team can't protect the lead and can't win a game on a road

[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:07.660]
No conversation about that. It's just the same on and on and on and I can't deal with it man. I can't deal with it

[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.440]
Here's little Joey

[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.360]
Yes, sir, did you

[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.260]
Did you have the unfortunate pleasure of listening to the sports channel fellow cast yesterday?

[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.200]
Yes, I did did you hear in the first

[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.500]
Quarter for first quarter. I'm getting

[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:34.600]
Oh my god. Did you hear when Doug McLean said he was sorry. He didn't play Chris well enough the night before

[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.020]
Is that what he said? I did not hear that I?

[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.280]
Didn't hear that he said he was he says that he apologizes for the fact that he made a coaching error in not playing

[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.560]
Chris Wells and David Nemerowski more than I before yeah

[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:57.220]
More as if they didn't play enough falling third not Nemerowski but Wells didn't play enough falling on his butt losing his

[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:02.440]
Take it easy on factor in fact a he played better two nights ago. They did last night last night

[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.560]
He was invisible. I mean just useless as the days long

[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.300]
It's part again to this selling job. They're gonna pedal it to you whether you want to buy it or not

[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.540]
They're gonna keep shoving this guy down your throat whether you want to believe it or not

[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.360]
That's why he looks like Jesus same thing

[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.920]
Like the Christians are gonna make you know for you can't refuse like that inquisition

[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.340]
You're gonna believe this guy is great no matter what the hell you know how how weak he looks

[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.720]
You were gonna sell it to you and it's just this hard-ass attitude

[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.660]
We have to sacrifice the whole season because they made a bad deal and they refused to admit it and write down through the playoffs

[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.480]
They're still trying to pedal us this bull crap unreal

[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.640]
Then then yes, you can't let me tell you Joey you can't make gold out of chicken crap

[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.820]
Okay, you can't do it you cannot do it

[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.360]
I'm sorry. I wish they could do it. They can't do it

[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.640]
Well, it shouldn't someone be held accountable like van b's book nobody has asked him

[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.680]
Why did you decide to go out and do a belly flop?

[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.620]
No, nobody even talked about that. Did you hear anybody bring that up on the telecast?

[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:04.140]
Why does anybody have the ball to ask them beats me there too busy whining about the the call about the penalty?

[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:10.880]
Oh, yeah, and then yesterday the same reason that nobody talked about the fact we blew the lead again with 19 seconds left in the game

[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.220]
If you you know and we didn't play it all in the third period you've got to play 60 minutes during the regular season

[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.360]
But if you don't want to do that during the playoffs, please believe me

[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.040]
You've got to play 60 minutes not just a few minutes here in air and pretend you're gonna win a game you can't do it

[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:30.040]
No, and then more whining beneath yesterday when robot. I went to complain because Gordon Murphy jumped on he like oh

[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.760]
Stop whining right. Yeah, okay. The pot calling the kettle purple exactly

[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.920]
Don't I think that the night before they took a page out of Tom all of the dotties

[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.880]
Defense book and they played the prevent the right exactly

[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.540]
And it's right the only thing it does is it prevents you from winning the game

[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.820]
They don't learn that the dolphins have been doing that for 20 years

[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.300]
We get a week the same thing goes on with the

[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.100]
Yep

[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:58.720]
That's all I have to say me. Okay, Joey. Hey, yeah, you're up. Bye bye. Keep your kid up

[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:04.300]
You said we have an open line at day at 622 W. I. D. We have one at brown at 767 9463

[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.460]
Georgia'll take some names and phone numbers down

[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.280]
Anybody wants to apply you notice?

[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.160]
It's not quite like it might have been if we would have wanted you might have to explain it to these people that

[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.380]
They don't need to call me that's talk to you. Oh, that's right

[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.480]
If you don't want to talk to me and just think you're gonna call Georgia and register to win my tickets

[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.280]
I mean if you don't even want to speak to me to try to get my tickets in my parking pass

[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.900]
You really got some some gall man. You got some balls, baby as a matter of fact if they say the word free or tickets to me

[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.580]
I hang up on them. No, you're really immediately

[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.360]
Yeah, boy, does he have a lot of

[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.160]
What this thing is acting real

[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.080]
Real sensitive today even the equipment is sensitive today it might break out into tears

[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.560]
Or if that's unusual for the equipment to be sensitive around here. Yeah, right. Don't come in by the way

[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.480]
Howard everything's working fine just a joke

[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.700]
Oh my god, I just I need a rest. I need a rest from this place

[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.960]
I need a rest from this whole pan through a business now and people they're gonna be people out there say

[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.420]
Oh, yeah, just because they're down three to one. They're gonna lose the series

[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.720]
He's bailing out. It's got nothing to do with that has nothing to do and proof of the putting being

[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.600]
I mean being a leaf fan who were eliminated from the playoffs like three days after the season started

[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.080]
I don't bail out on my teams

[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:16.180]
But they're just did this whole ambiance man. It leaves a bad taste in my push. You can just you can smell it like 10 exactly

[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.020]
10 miles away. You can feel it

[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.700]
610 WIOD

[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.060]
Admission is the first step

[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.920]
I dropped my winger all right here's the moment you've been waiting for all night gentlemen

[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.400]
Let's give it up for our headliner

[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.020]
He's his back

[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.960]
You are the business who's just for you horny guy

[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.640]
Let's give us some dollars. You'll be

[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.560]
He doesn't work for nothing

[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.640]
Give him up

[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.840]
One of the years go for the $1 what

[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.400]
Buddy

[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:12.720]
How about one of you young Republicans get up there laying face up on the same with a dollar between you see

[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.160]
That's right there you go

[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.720]
He's going

[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:19.620]
And

[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:22.820]
Yeah

[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:38.160]
So how does that work in a snack to the dollar bill out of your push? It's 1032 a WIOD. Here's Pembroke Pines. Hello

[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:43.120]
All right, it's Brian Murray

[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.300]
What's up Neil? Yes, sir

[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.580]
Yeah, another thing that you didn't mention

[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:54.100]
Yeah, what about in a third period when they spent we love you higher power play

[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.840]
Yeah, I like that and they kept looking they kept standing behind their own net looking up at the clock

[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.940]
Making sure their time was running out on a power play. I don't know what that was all about

[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:09.440]
That before I was kind of like how the sharks used to run their power play all in their own end waiting to get organized

[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.420]
You can't score on a pass can't score in your own end

[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:17.300]
Well, I mean you can stick it in your own net. We've done that but yeah fact number 23 did that first game

[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.340]
Who yeah, I don't want to bring back bad memories

[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.780]
Oh, well, that's all I got okay, can I can I register for the tickets absolutely sir?

[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.560]
Okay, thanks hang on number five tell me better put away the crying kid though. Okay number five

[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.400]
Whatever it is stick his name on here between about one o'clock. We'll pick out a name

[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.080]
And somebody will be able to go and enjoy the game tomorrow night and in peace and quiet

[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.640]
Hopefully I hope we don't have no assholes in 106 tomorrow night because you're gonna have some honored guests you won't have to contend with me

[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.220]
Nope

[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.740]
It was a choice between getting out of here for a weekend or going

[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:55.360]
They were listening to all this crying and whining and belly-ikin and bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop you know you got to go out there and get the job done

[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.280]
You can't keep crying over spilt whatever was

[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:05.480]
Here's Davy hello, you know, sir. I don't know. I'm distraught after last night

[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.660]
Membrace you say when you would talk about when you first got on the new station you would say

[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.520]
It's not just a question of if it's a question of when yes

[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.100]
I'm beginning to feel that way

[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.620]
It's not a question of if it's a question of when right like when golf season for the panthers is gonna start

[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:27.860]
Uh-huh, and I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pick maybe anaheim or scenics and watch them you know pick the real underdog somebody who

[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.800]
Nobody would expect to get in the did yeah, how about Ottawa or Ottawa? I was playing well

[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.920]
Look at those senators man overtime last night. They win one nothing what a game that was people think that

[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.440]
Low scoring games are boring

[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.960]
But man that was some game phenomenal saves that shields kid playing great for buffalo and

[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.680]
Tug nuts playing great for Ottawa phenomenal game shield is a very good gold tender. Yes. He is

[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.320]
I just want to comment last night about last night's defense

[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.240]
There was none yeah, I can't complain about the defense because we didn't have any I don't remember if it was the second or third of

[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.780]
Of Gretzky's hat trick, but he came in and he wound up like he was gonna let it fly right

[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:06.640]
Did he just like stop for it? Yeah, he didn't like the angle so he kind of like dittled around little bit and said

[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:12.300]
I think I'm gonna go over here and of course nobody went anywhere near him and how many times have you heard me say if you stand around and watch him

[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.480]
He's gonna just burn your ass and sure he did any of those guys him

[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.360]
Mario yoghurt if you stand and watch they do a little movie spin right? That's right. All of a sudden they're gone

[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.360]
And I was I was yelling where is the defense?

[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.400]
Jovo could flop gave another one up and he rode the pine most of the night

[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.360]
Yeah, I do like that third period again

[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.780]
He sits the sits the pine almost the whole third period

[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.440]
And this is supposed to be our superstar defense been I've been telling people all year long

[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.740]
Trading while you can still get something for him while the word is still out people think he's a hot shot

[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:47.000]
And now now the word is out that he's a stiff man. I mean he's just killing us this kid is killing us

[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.680]
It's not just a quick to have it a bad game all season long every time he's out there. He's an impediment

[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:57.340]
He's really getting worse by the minute now. It's the shame because the book is out on nobody's gonna want him

[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.400]
It's right. I mean, you know, just like that Ron and Ron show man

[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.740]
I mean when you get down to well one nine or whatever that is there you know, they would have been better off getting another gig a couple of months ago

[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:06.080]
Well

[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.160]
I don't know the big guy that I want to pick on them, but well the best thing that we can hope for is the next year

[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:17.140]
There's a vacant number 55 on the roster is a vacant number 23 on the roster. Okay. No, that'll never happen

[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:22.160]
He's a star man. They're gonna jam him down your throat until you're gagging on it like I said

[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.580]
Quack quack quack go ducks. Okay. See you. Okay. We have an open line at Broward

[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.780]
Like the ducks by the way ducks have a nice little team. They got some balls they got guts

[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.960]
They don't sit back and wine and cry

[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:41.600]
7679 463 767 W. I. Would need there's an opening in Broward as we kind of find out what what the story was last night

[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:47.720]
We're trying to find out why what the excuse was they stuck no had to be more than that. There had to be an excuse

[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:53.160]
Maybe the fact that they that Gritzki scored three and we only got two that it might have been the reason that we lost

[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.300]
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello, they'll go on. Yes, sir. Hey

[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.040]
I got a lot of figures this weekend. Yeah. Yeah. Do I want to go to Vegas? Yeah. No

[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:08.920]
Why are you going? Well, you know, you're going out of town. I was gonna say once you take me with you

[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.180]
We can have you know have fun in the crash table. Yeah

[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.960]
I wanted to ask you

[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.980]
What the heck is rumored talking about at damn TV?

[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.640]
It's always ass licking and kissing Chris well that yeah

[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.940]
What's his problem? Well, that he gets paid by the Panthers. He gets paid by the lick

[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.560]
Oh, I mean that the Panthers actually pay him. In fact, you know

[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.800]
This alligator arms thing that Randy motor came up with what happened is that you know

[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.420]
He used to have normal length arms and when he went to work for the Panther organization

[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:42.240]
They did a skin graft and they took all of the skin that was like where his arms used to be and they put that on the tongue

[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.860]
So he can unroll his tongue now and it goes on the end of his toes and the arms are like a little flappers now

[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.980]
Yeah, alligator arms

[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.000]
Which comes in handy for a number one not reaching for the check and number two kissing a lot of ass

[00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:03.580]
Yes, oh, so that's so he is there you go now you're starting to understand now the pieces of the puzzle are starting to get in the shape

[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.140]
Okay, I knew there's something behind that is just wondering yes, sir

[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.020]
But you may get my name on the list of course why not?

[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.600]
I have to a brilliant call like this one on hang on

[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.400]
Okay, line five again line five seems to be the lucky line a

[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:25.560]
1038 a W I O D here's Port St. Lucy. Hello. Good morning. Neil. When is to you? I just got done blowing chunks from that performance

[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.660]
Uh-huh, so I don't want to get into that

[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.680]
You're paying so through

[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.260]
Yeah, I'm just singing that song and keeps going through my mind

[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.460]
Listen, I

[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:38.760]
Haven't been able to listen the last couple months because I'm now in Port St. Lucy. I can't pick you up here in the office. Yeah

[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:44.140]
Um, so it bit bit tidbit. I've heard you're going to five sixty. Yeah

[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.700]
The pack something as we have to look at it was just never

[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.220]
Good from the start disaster

[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.780]
They've they're destroying this place. They're turning it into a parking lot and they got this consultant and this new pd

[00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:02.320]
Who are basically the same person their clones of each other and they both really but they have this they think that you can make a formula out of talk radio

[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.000]
They have no concept of you know individual personalities

[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.060]
They really believe that you can just have this format and just plug in bodies, you know and do it

[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:13.880]
If you do the formatics right you're going to have a hit you're going to be a success and they're dreaming

[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:20.020]
They have no concept of why the station's been successful. What it's all about and they're they're they're burning it. They're savaging it

[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:26.260]
Well, Neil, I really miss you and I hope somehow I can can I get a shortwave radio to listen to you here or

[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.260]
Or how can I do that a shortwave radio that'll do it get you a GE super radio that might do it. Yeah

[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:38.360]
I think it'll do it. You know who this is right. No, I don't it's uh, I haven't talked to you in a while. You don't recognize me. No

[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.160]
I was formally in Bort Blaine Beach

[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:51.380]
I just wanted to say I miss you and I can't let not not Greg. Yeah. Oh, thank god. He's gone. Oh my god. Oh, let's have a party

[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.460]

[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.900]
Oh my god

[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.200]
No wonder we've been feeling so good last few days

[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.620]
Huh?

[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.180]
Life is almost worth living again

[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:16.180]
We have an open line in Broward. So what's that the shlump from the video place to when I don't have his boyfriend around anymore

[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:22.920]

Triple eight 474 w i o d Greg has been banished to Bort Blaine Beach. All right. Let's hear it. Let's have a major freaking party over here. Oh

[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.940]

[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.620]
Yeah, well. Oh man

Sorry, are you going to school up there or what? No, man. I just escaped Miami up here. Oh congratulations to him

Yeah, nobody obelisk anything up here

[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.860]
In fact, you remember the flood in the Bible, you know 40 days and 40 nights

[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.460]
I think we may have the same thing we're going to drown in a sea of crocodile tears from all these Panther people

[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.240]
Yeah

[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.940]
Right. Yeah

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:17.200]
We're drowning over here, man. I don't know nothing about no Panther thing. We don't why do we can get that up here? Yeah good for you

[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.600]
You didn't miss a thing

[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.900]
Yeah, can I uh

[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:27.260]
Well, I don't know I guess it's too early to ask you for the tickets. Yeah, I don't think you want to come down from Knoxville

[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.260]
Yeah, okay pal have a great day. Hey, yeah

[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:37.760]
Can I can I call somebody a douchebag? Go ahead. All right. Can't blend your douchebag and Glenn Hill your butt plugs. Okay. Bye-bye

[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.660]
Oh, George is nodding his head on the last part there

[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:48.140]
We have an open line on the other town line to Palm Beach left the line the audio netline one triple eight four seven four

[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.360]
Walters Sabo's a douchebag. There you go

[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.320]
Man, did I sniff that whole deal out? They lied through their teeth and they gave me a song at a dance

[00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:00.000]
And always not gonna do this and he's not gonna do that and he doesn't believe it as go give me that baloney

[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.720]
They believe that there's a formula the dick you can do what this station is done for the last eight years

[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.780]
You can make a formula out of it and pedal it like like jello

[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.180]
Remember what happened in the last guys ate a lot of jello look what happened to them man or was that yeah

[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.680]
Was I think Bill Cosby had his finger in that you could almost taste it

[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.500]
Just make a formula just plug in a bunch of bodies that doesn't make any difference who they are

[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.480]
It doesn't make any difference if they really have anything to say because if you just

[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:32.880]
Just put on those hot topics like how I read out a quarters trying to put up the the parking meter

[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.560]
I kept sticking quarters in there and the little thing wouldn't move

[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.600]
Or about that gas cap man every time I get gas now. I'm like self conscious about my gas cap not

[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:43.960]
10 for

[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:51.240]
Yeah, that's it just let him plug in those hot topics you can get those peaks of 20 shares look at this week book

[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.220]
We just had here man

[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.920]
We need buddy bud and water sabote to help us get those peaks of 20 shares

[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:02.120]
With these hot topics man this guy's an expert or some kind of pert vert

[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.560]
W I O T

[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.340]
That 47 at W I do we just had a spy report carrying gay uh Aaron K

[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.580]
Whatever name is last night at a really original topic do you pee? Do you wash your hands after you pee?

[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.500]
God, that's new and original isn't I wonder which is that number 48 on a list this week water

[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:26.600]
Which one is that and she and the rumor is she does not wash your hands after she's not every time and like I've said before with guys

[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.460]
I mean if you're peeing instrument is clean. Why should you have to wash your hands?

[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:36.620]
I had one in my mouth one here is Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, oh, yes, sir. Oh, God

[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:42.300]
Then that guy some log some log rolling tickets. Yeah, Tennessee

[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.880]
Anyway, the game Tuesday night with all the how about just some logs sounds good

[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:55.640]
Yeah, clearly interference on Melody. Yeah sure look like it to me. Yeah, I don't know what everybody's crying about you lose the game

[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.820]
She'll each run into a Richter and sput them around like a draider and that's it

[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.800]
You know you can argue that from now until the year 25 25

[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.180]
But to use that as an excuse for why we lost my see a team that's got real character

[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:13.960]
Okay, if they if they are so pissed off and they feel that they've been robbed you come out the next night and you beat the crap out of these guys

[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:19.320]
Because we kept hearing that all we had to do was show up last night and arrangers are old and it's back to back games

[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.740]
Randy motor kept talking on that thing a million times

[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:29.320]
And all we got to do is just show up with our uniforms on put up our put our skates on and we're gonna kick their ass because they're old and they're tired and back to back

[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:35.400]
Night so we got that second game all locked up. So what happened last night not only did we not come back looking for

[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:42.580]
Looking for blood, but they kicked our in an old man kicked our ass. All right needle nose. Yeah, hey last night though

[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.460]
Third period the final patrick goal

[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:51.200]
Did you see Jovanowski he was standing right in front of Greta he was just he was wandering around yeah

[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.100]
He turned sideways. Yeah, he didn't even attempt to try to block that this kid is lost

[00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:00.360]
He needs a road map and a compass he knew the he needs a one-way ticket back to Windsor Ontario

[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:06.640]
He does we need some more swaylers and some straw cuz out there and yeah, the truck struck is done the coaches

[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.380]
Taking away his confidence. He's made him into a head case. He's useless out there

[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.140]
Well anyway, you know you put that much pressure on somebody that if you don't score

[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.580]
I'm gonna sit you rise down the bench and I don't believe you're a player anyway

[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.220]
Well, you know you might forget about it just send him home set him back to checkers LaVaccia

[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.820]
Right on because he's destroyed him

[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:26.640]
Nail enjoy your move enjoy your your weekend and I'm not in chat new

[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.320]
So I stick around for the ticket sure no problem hold on line six put him on it. Don't be apologetic

[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.800]
We'll stick your name on that list. I mean you probably won't get him, but you never know

[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.720]
Maybe we'll send you a big bright yellow envelope. Okay. I got one of those in the mail again yesterday

[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:44.560]
Last week or two weeks ago was the big orange envelope from those uh go him out there in California

[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.440]
If I had a dollar for every piece of junk mail that I get every day

[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.180]
I could be tarry could just go home and sit around wait for the postal thing to show up

[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:58.380]
Just pounds and pounds and tons of crap almost all of it is fraudulent almost all of it is bull crap

[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.120]
And your federal government that's so concerned about

[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:07.700]
Everything else whether we say crap on here. They don't care what kind of garbage they send you to mail as long as there's no naked pictures in there by the way

[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.400]
Here's Pemberg Pines hello. Hey Nail. Yes, sir. First of all

[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.400]
The porkers are out hot and heavy with the radar really on

[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.040]
Finds bull of our between university great

[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.260]
I

[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:24.140]
So all the Niles will count for that one 24th of April must be something significant about it. Yeah, I need a few bucks

[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.940]
Yeah, that must be it and number two the pants has got my support 100%

[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:33.780]
But if they don't do something drastically different we're gonna be watching other teams playing the playoffs real soon

[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.680]
Yeah, because I mean, they still you know, they still got a shot just because they down three one

[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:42.780]
I mean it's a very very very tough thing now especially since they're gonna have to win some games on the road

[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.140]
But yeah, you know tough short of come back from that now

[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:51.460]
Yeah, but I think I just can't deal with the with the crying man. I can't I can't deal with I can't stand it

[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.440]
I don't want to be around it

[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:58.640]
I'm hoping that they can overcome that and they can like grow up and you know and and be like they used to be but I don't know

[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.620]
Well, crying is not going to get anything better for the team. So right? Right?

[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.120]
Number one number two if Doug McLean would start playing the right

[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.080]
Combinations again and give the guys a score and a chance and stop putting these

[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:14.160]
Assholes that aren't doing anything out there. Maybe just maybe we can come back to this. Well, just remember

[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.840]
He's selling us Chris well just remember that and don't ever forget it

[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.600]
He's gonna sell him to us whether we believe it or not. Nobody wants them. Well too bad

[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.940]
Hey, can I get in the left? Sure

[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.560]

[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.240]
Kissing the crowd he knows it's all over. They won a game. Oh, there's Mario right there in the locker room afterward

[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.520]

[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.980]

And here he comes again. Oh, he didn't like that angle takes that shot another one in the net hat trick

[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:30.540]
Needle nose baby hat trick as we stood around there wasn't anybody near him on any one of those three shots

[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.700]
There one he could he could have stopped and written a letter home. He could have written a letter to Don Cherry

[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:41.140]
And then picked up his stick again said oh by the way. I just stuck it in here again. There's another there's three

[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.640]
Man oh man oh man how embarrassing

[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:50.140]
But we're we're too busy oh belly it can that's the problem too busy crying

[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.820]
Too busy when

[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.300]
That's right. That's the problem

[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.700]
Here's Kendall hello

[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:03.860]
Hey, Neil. I'm not calling to suck around for take for you excellent. Oh well. I have I don't like too much suction today

[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:09.080]
I know you get enough of that now I go to FIU and I have a final tonight. I've had finals all week

[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:14.900]
Yes, sir. I couldn't even see the the game last night, but it sounds like believe me you made a smart choice

[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.780]
Well, I don't know it was a pretty sick final, but

[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.940]
Listen, I graduate today, and I am moving to Washington DC really

[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:28.420]
I just wanted to thank you for all the all the memories and memories. I've been listening to you for about 12 years now

[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:35.340]
All right, and um, I'll try to catch up with you on the internet, but uh, I'm gonna miss hearing you man. You've uh

[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:42.720]
made a lot of all this crap that I hear about in the news and everything a bit easy to take you have very

[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.000]
good perspective on things. Yes, I do

[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.680]
Now you do for real and I know I do and uh

[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:57.500]
You know stuff like the OJ not all that complete BS that was and you you told it like it was and about everything right

[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.620]
Well, listen best of luck pal. All right take care man. Good luck later. See you

[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.520]
I do like that. We're losing another young living and breathing person

[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.300]
We can't afford to do that and who the hell says this last rating book was anglo's

[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.880]
I mean, don't we have anglo's in there like most of our audience plus a few spics

[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.460]
I mean, what is that? Well, that's what it says in here Jeff Nudendick's analization

[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:21.960]
Then he goes on to say the top three stations were radio Amor hot 105 and uh, jams jamming it

[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.140]
Last time I checked those were still your ethnic stations, okay

[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.380]
Just the fact that we got a bunch of bogus diaries for love 94 and life

[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.680]
I mean does that prove something and then of course they quote the great ratings expert Rana Wolfe

[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.040]
Who says it's just who gets the books and returns them. It's the diaries. No kidding sweet art

[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.500]
Very good. She is right man. I'm telling you. She is a sharp as a monster ball. I run a wolf

[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.860]
I'm really gonna when I leave her

[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.080]
I'm gonna miss those days when they have the big corporate meetings up front here like I'm under your Tuesday

[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.420]
Whatever morning it was and she'd be up there and come out to get a freak up a coffee in the kitchen

[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.460]
And I'd come walk it in the morning. She'd look me right in the eye and see yeah, I missed those emotional moments with Rana

[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:04.240]
Here's Miami on a mobile. Hello. Hey, what's up, Neal? How you doing, sir? All right, buddy?

[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:09.940]
I must agree with you if they don't give up that gold 19 seconds to go. There's nothing else to talk about

[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:14.860]
That's right. Then we're in the driver's seat man. You know, then at the worst worst it happens. We're tied to a piece now

[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.980]
I don't know how many times that happened to us this year, but for some reason 400

[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:26.360]
We expect the beavers to be a wall back there. Yeah, and you know, he I guess he panicked and said if I don't jump on it

[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:31.180]
No, he did he didn't trust his defense. They were scrambling all around they were running around frantic

[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:34.520]
And he did panic a little bit and he said I got to take matters into my own hands

[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.660]
He took the calculated risk. I'm gonna dive out and grab it

[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:41.320]
And if I don't get it, I got a real problem here because I'm not in position to stop the buck

[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:45.340]
And he did not get it. It's courted loose and Messier stuck it over to Robatine

[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:51.460]
He stuck it right in the open net exactly what happened. He didn't have confidence in that defense because they can't keep guys away from him

[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:58.960]
Yeah, everybody there swarming all over them. They're taking shot after shot. Yeah, how many times did he freeze the buck in the third period like 20 times?

[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.780]
Yeah, you know, it's just

[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.420]
It's too much we're not doing it man

[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.720]
This hasn't been the same team

[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.440]
We didn't have you know three real nice games in a row. They were against Jersey and against Pittsburgh in the first game in this series

[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.120]
But three games doesn't make a season and if you look back on like from like I said

[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:17.460]
The December right on true and of course we only won two games on a road from January right up till this moment

[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.800]
It's just not the same. Yeah, yeah

[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.800]
There's something missing there. There's several ingredients missing

[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:27.900]
But I don't want to dwell on what they might be I would I would wonder when the last time we had the three game winning streak was also

[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:32.260]
Yeah, that gives you a lot of confidence going to pride in the night's game. Yep

[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:38.100]
Well, Neil, that's all I have to say if you don't mind put me on that list. I don't mind sir

[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:44.780]
Because this is America God damn it hang on line 13 on a mobile there put that goofball on there put his put something on there

[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.820]
Yep, that's right. I'm not going to moron. Of course, there are a lot of people out there

[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:52.940]
Oh, yeah, he's jumping off the band. No, I'm not jumping off or I wasn't and ever on a bandwagon

[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.260]
I don't buy these season tickets because I'm a bandwagon jumper

[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:02.440]
But there just comes a time when people just turn you off and you say sorry. I just I need a rest

[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:09.000]
I need to clear the cobwebs out of my brain. I've heard enough bull crap in the last 48 hours till last 50 lifetimes man

[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.520]
Start coping with reality and stop sugar coating in BS and manage it just kills me

[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:22.320]
It kills me you watch guys play and then you listen to some of these uh talkus liquors out there. Oh, yeah, he played a real great game. He did

[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:23.960]
I

[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.220]
Mean what game were you watching?

[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.340]
You know, why not why just not say anything at all

[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:34.140]
Wouldn't that be better some nights as opposed to when some nights like when Eddie is coughing it up 55 times in a first period to match his uniform number

[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:40.080]
I mean why just don't even mention it if you're terrified that you might say something negative and Wayne might get pissed off

[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:46.880]
But all these broadcasters and all the all the emogals there the general manager and this one and that one

[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.060]
They're all just uh, it's very sad

[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:55.140]
We had one gigantic wonderful marvelous spectacular year last year and now all of a sudden it's like a wow

[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.960]
We can't do anything wrong somebody's out to get us

[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:05.540]
10 58 at wiod here something that won't be wrong pick up the phone and call hydrant technologies at their toll-free number

[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:11.920]
And they'll send you absolute free. They're a great catalog of skin care products for both men and women and a free sample too

[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:17.860]
Let me say it again fr ee the way we all like it. What's wrong with free the best things in life are free

[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:24.400]
That's what the song said even the cockamoon is free isn't that what it says in that song that's right the best things in life are free dammit

[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:30.240]
So pick up the phone right now and call one one eight hundred four hydrant and they'll send you the catalog in the sample

[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.200]
And if you don't think you need uh, skin care products everybody needs it for something you got to you know what i'm saying

[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:40.280]
Everybody's got some place to got a smirror it for example if you play sports mental ice from hydrant

[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.640]
Now the most depends on you

[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.260]
And the powers you possess

[00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:01.780]
Since you saved his life with your flight scissor night he's got a job where you can do

[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.160]
Oh

[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.300]

Who's with the speed of the south

[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.100]
Sense of that dice straight to hell

[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.640]
When a building starts to grow

[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.320]

[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.260]
That's a whole different subject i don't want to go in there by any good watches lately

[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.440]

[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.620]

[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:07.700]
We have an open line in broward 7679 463 767 w.i.o.d

[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.880]
Ha that was great. Here's Miami hello

[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.380]
Miami hello nia when is this how you doing?

[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.160]
Come a star real good come a star

[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.240]
Watch it did you see the play where uh grisky

[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:25.160]
Um, I think was the second or third goal. I saw them all where i think it was the third one where he he burned

[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.800]
Joanowski yeah and then Joanowski tried to get back

[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:32.100]
But instead of like blocking his view to an office he got it his way

[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.300]
Yeah, yeah

[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:41.920]
And here i go mr. grisky always defer to my elders and then another thing i noticed you noticed like in the last five or six minutes

[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.260]
The panthers would get to the blue line and then dump the puck

[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:49.380]
Yeah, instead of trying to you know force their way in there or create something

[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.820]
I noticed at one time when

[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:55.840]
Stracco was flying down the left wing and shepard like what brought it to the blue line and then kind of like stopped and put

[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:00.540]
Marty offside and then Denise came on and very accurately said that you can't slow down

[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.940]
You have to keep the flow of the play going and it uh ray made a mistake on a play and then my good friend

[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:08.020]
Rimmer comes on and says because naturally you know if you rip struck it

[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:12.440]
That's the appropriate thing to do. Oh no well if Marty would have just not passed the puck to shepard and brought it in himself

[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:17.300]
That would have been the right thing to do and there was this long pregnant pause like even Denise was saying to himself

[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.980]
What what are you talking about man?

[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.300]
And there's one other thing that's driving me

[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:28.420]
No, just it's just it's just an ass sucking fest is what this whole thing has become man. It's very distasteful

[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:29.540]
Have you ever have you noticed it?

[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:30.840]
Yeah, it works here Kirk Mueller

[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.900]
Makes the shot. Yeah, that it's nowhere near the goal. Yeah, well

[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.840]
I mean it we said he'd get a lot of shots

[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.100]
We didn't say that they'd necessarily be near the net he kept hitting that double with sign. Yeah

[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:41.820]
Well, maybe

[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.460]
Yes, it can relate to it. That's right. Maybe he was trying to give us a message there. Maybe he needed a little relief

[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.880]
And there's one more thing I want to wonder if he washes his hands afterward anyway. Yes, I want to thank you personally

[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.680]
For getting me into hockey those guys from Kingston, Ontario

[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:59.840]
They know wash their hands after they take a leak even just asked on cherry even my wife is into it great

[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.720]
She's never like sports and hockey too. She's up. Yeah

[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.240]
Yes, you can that's one of the things and can I get on the list? That's why just said okay

[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:13.760]
Great one line 12 put him on air. I'm a psychic man. How did I know well as wife is into it in a game two so they want to go

[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.480]
Why not not great seats by the way even if there are a few assholes sitting at section

[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.380]
Where you're gonna go?

[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:22.860]
Where you're gonna sit in any arena in this town or any ballpark and not have a few assholes around

[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:28.400]
Just ignore them put on your blinders and your blinkers and your ear plugs and have a great time and don't eat too much of that food

[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:28.980]
It'll kill you

[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.180]
Bad food in that arena boy, bad except for the nuts

[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.100]
Oh, man, they got great nuts

[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.680]
Here's Hollywood. Hello, good morning sir. Yes, sir

[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.700]
Did you didn't get anything with Mike Lang last night, did you?

[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:48.840]
I did tape the game you did but I didn't bring it in okay one if it'll make you happy. I'll bring something tomorrow

[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.220]
You know what pisses me off because you can only I mean I got two satellites

[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:59.940]
Identicable I got two vc Rs so I'm taping our game of course the panther game I mean their game the panthers and I'm taping

[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.120]
The penguin game with the Philadelphia

[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.500]
But then

[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:09.320]
Layton the game I turned over because Buffalo and Ottawa playing an incredible game in rich generous go in a shot

[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.840]
And I turned that game on and it ends and they go into overtime now

[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:18.280]
I flip back to Mike Lang and Mario had just scored on a breakaway so I don't I missed it

[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.600]
I really it's just frosted my ass because the crowd at this point is going crazy

[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.760]
I know I must have been a great call it was incredible it would

[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:30.520]
That's why I thought Mike Lang I mean he must have been choking back tears last night because you couldn't get a better finish

[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.260]
Right he gets the break away. Yeah, well, I saw the replay. They showed the replay

[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:37.180]
But I didn't get the call which is very depressing to see alive

[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:42.220]
Or they're just been incredible. I know Mike Lang had a lot of nice things. How do you like the way Mario stuck it right?

[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:45.360]
Through snow his legs there. He had saw that opening and he stuck it right in there

[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.520]
You can't get any I mean you talk 110 120 percent class that yeah, 200 percent right

[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:55.180]
It's a real shame, but you looked at his wife and she know she's got the little baby in her hands

[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:59.420]
Yeah, you look at the man and if he's playing in that much pain and and everything else

[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:03.800]
You got to say go for it just go home and spend your days just being happy. That's right

[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.060]
You know he doesn't need to take any more cheap shots or anything like that. That's right. You got it

[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:10.480]
And there's nothing is nothing left to prove you know what I'm saying is got to be talks

[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:17.380]
He has nothing left to prove he can go alive happily ever after and we'll miss him, but more power to at least we got the chance to see somebody like

[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:23.460]
Tiny Tim would say God bless him you got it and the other thing I wanted to laugh at was Chris Mori yesterday around one third

[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.420]
I'm laughing already. Oh Chris Mori

[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:29.320]
He said that he had a talk with Brian Murray and Brian Murray

[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:37.080]
Came on and said you know I've talked to Doug and Doug is pretty well over it and Doug is assured me that the young kids now are gonna step up

[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:41.940]
And really come out and show us what we're made of and I think in all boy. What is David dunk?

[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.380]
Well, Numerowski played good. He got a nice school there

[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.500]
Well, there's and Robbie continued playing great. He got a beautiful goal

[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.420]
But other than that other than that

[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:55.860]
Other than that everybody was in a coma you got it. You got it. Everybody was in a coma. I'd love to go to more night

[00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:59.960]
Niel. Okay. Hang on. Thank you line six. This guy wants to go everybody wants to go

[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.260]
You know what I'm saying? If you want to go

[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:03.780]
It's a free country

[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.320]
Oh

[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.960]
My god the young kids are gonna step up and we're gonna win there all we had a new show up

[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:14.560]
That's what I kept here and see anybody anybody can spew bull crap that doesn't take any talent whatsoever

[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:20.560]
You don't win sporting events you don't win presidential elections you don't win miss universe just by showing up

[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.220]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:27.540]
Just by talking a good game you got to go out there and do it you got to execute and quite frankly eddie

[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.100]
A lot of be executed in fact here's a great fact

[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:38.740]
It's got the eddie down the side every defensive disaster incredibly executed eddie nice go on. Thank you so much Eric eddie

[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.800]
The crowd they're like foaming it to mouth in the arena. They love him

[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.020]
Eddie Eddie go home eddie go back to Windsor man will pack his salami sandwich

[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:53.780]
You're a good guy. It's not personal see eddie can separate the personal from the he can do that Kenny you can't

[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.960]
Because I know rimmer can't do it

[00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:00.120]
Very like that woman said before it's hard. It's very hard being friends

[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.940]
I mean like rumors why fairer than I we get along great. She's wonderful

[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:06.700]
She's one of the nicest people you'd ever want to meet. He went at big ring that he bought her but

[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:12.620]
Rimmer it's like separating business from personal you can't do it because he's so involved

[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:18.960]
It's such an integral part of his existence this Brian Murray Doug McLean the way the whole thing, you know

[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:24.200]
It's you've got to put it over in a compartment and he can't do it

[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.640]
He takes it personal this is business and he takes it personal

[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.840]
Remember the day it's how long did it take me to get him to finally say

[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.900]
They stunk you know what I'm saying? It took me like a half an hour to get to squeeze those words out of his place

[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.560]
They stunk exactly

[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:40.900]
And he and you know something life is still going on

[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:45.880]
My face still the world is still spinning around even though he said they stunk

[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.200]
1127 a W.Y.O.D. if your carpets stink well, I mean you know

[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:56.520]
Seriously, sometimes your carpets are so filthy that they not really look bad. They smell bad. Oh, I've a I mean

[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.700]
That's pretty embarrassing ain't it? I can relate to it though because I got a little dog that likes to

[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:04.380]
And I'm gonna do it there. No, no he does squirt squirt every now and then when he least expected

[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.080]
So if your carpets need to be clean there are a whole bunch of things you can do

[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.580]
You can open up the yellow pages and have an axe murder come to your home and maybe a kill a few people

[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:16.040]
Or you can go to the supermarket and slip home a bunch of heavy equipment and pretend you know what you're doing

[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:20.640]
And make a mess and smear it all over and get a herniad rag in the equipment or you can do the smart thing like

[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:24.460]
I do once so you're in called the experts the best in the universe at dry concepts

[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:37.000]
They look like brand new they apply a disinfectant while they're doing the job

[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.220]
So your carpets smell emity fresh they give you nice little rows when you get done no head-ons no

[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:47.180]
BS no games no tack-ons because like I said they guarantee you the price before they touch anything even your carpets

[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:52.120]
And when they get done you look around you're in amazement you say it looks like I got brand new carpeting installed

[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.800]
wall-to-wall even if you don't have wall-to-wall carpeting

[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:20.500]
on that i had to unfortunate uh... well unfortunate

[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:24.420]
experience of listening to the last couple of games on the radio

[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:28.480]
and uh... yeah uh...

[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.940]
much i didn't think

[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:35.600]
anyway uh... last night they were commenting mohler and uh... more were commenting about how after

[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.320]
creptski uh... did it at trick deal that the other players and the rangers were not

[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.880]
as forthcoming with uh... congratulations and we're sort of like acting like they

[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.660]
were uh... pissed off or jealous or something but not being able to see the game i was

[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:53.420]
wondering what you're taking to know to say i did not i didn't see any of that

[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.940]
seems to me that they were ecstatic that they were a brilliant and that they were

[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.920]
forming at the mouth because they were winning the game

[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:03.440]
isn't that funny how uh... people see things different i don't i don't know where they came up with

[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.560]
that i don't i mean i know that there's no love lost between greptski and robot

[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.060]
tied to hate each other like poison but uh... what's everything to make well it

[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:13.660]
doesn't make any they want the game right that's right to get paid to go out there and play the game

[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:22.680]
hey nail how are you great hey i felt sunny fox over the weekend on some wide

[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:26.940]
world of sports night hi this is sunny fox yeah he was it was like from 1966

[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:32.620]
67 interviewing the soapbox derby champion but that was not sunny fox i don't know

[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:36.720]
whether no you know thanks out no okay that's the sunny fox that used to be on a

[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.400]
quiescio i think oh yeah you're probably right right

[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:45.240]
hey you know it's not over yet yeah um people are all given up no i didn't

[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:48.280]
send given up i it's nothing to do with the fact that they're losing the

[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.660]
series and on the verge of extinction it has to do with the fact that i cannot i

[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:57.260]
can't stand the ambiance and it's whining and cry baby and belly aching and excuse making

[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:01.640]
you got to go out there and do it nobody else is going to do it for you you got to get over it

[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.740]
you got to go out there and you've got to execute you got to get the job done

[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:09.200]
and last year's team you never would have heard any of this bull crap but this year it's a whole

[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:13.100]
different it's just a whining thing yeah but you know what there's a lot of injuries this year too

[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:17.240]
we didn't have lost well every team in league has had to go through that some more than others but

[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:20.980]
um i don't think about it's a way of that this year now i think you're wrong well i think

[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:24.580]
there are plenty of teams that have had uh in fact calirato when they were they were they went

[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:29.040]
14 games on beat them and at that time they had sack it out and force berg out and reach

[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.920]
out and gooseirov out they had four their top players out and they still were winning every night

[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:36.740]
i know they're like you got you know you got to uh pull up your joxtrap a little tighter and

[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:40.200]
to go out there and get it done if you see the auto wall game last night they scored a goal that

[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.980]
wasn't allowed because yeah the replay official couldn't send or whatever right and even

[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:49.180]
rich janarette buffalo announce who said it looked like a goal to him well it was it was clearly

[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:53.740]
yeah it was no question about yeah even though buffalo is my second favorite so it was just as

[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:57.540]
anyway because they want to play it's just it's just was more exciting that way and over time

[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:03.580]
yeah hey could i get on the list sure no problem line 11 she wants she'd be on the list okay line

[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.700]
11 she'd be doing it we have an open line of day by the way for the first time i can't imagine

[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:12.060]
why we got open lines today i thought to myself boy this will kill a whole bunch of birds with one

[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:17.360]
big bullet just give away these tickets and the parking pass which by the way is for the exclusive

[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:24.360]
lot up there on the corner where you go in here and uh it's it's a beautiful spot here's a lady in

[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:31.580]
hollywood hello hi yes ma'am um did you catch a mario game last night i saw the i saw part while i

[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:36.440]
was taping the game and i saw the very end right after he had scored i did not get that on tape damn

[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:41.580]
when he scored the goal you know who was there at danie boy yeah i did i did see that

[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:48.420]
that's just trying to take them lessons on retirement yeah right exactly excellent point

[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:54.480]
yeah but um quick while you're still on top they said on the statistic last night that they always

[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.720]
run out which are ridiculous the reason that we lost last night is because Lindsay wasn't in the game

[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:04.880]
yeah they said we never win without them in line up yeah that's true but that's just another

[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:10.780]
lame excuse the fact is we won two games on the road since january it is now the end of april

[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:15.260]
and Lindsay was in line up for almost every one of those games until last night so uh i'm

[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:19.560]
missing something somewhere he is great though he's a he's a terrific player but uh you can't keep

[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:26.180]
making excuses right i know it's ridiculous we'll get it next year i hope can i get some tickets

[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:30.720]
can you get some tickets you can get on the list i can't promise you know tickets but i can put

[01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:37.130]
on a list and maybe your name too okay hang on line five she wants some tickets dammit everybody

[01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:42.490]
wants some free tickets i wish i had a whole bunch of free tickets i wish i had like eight zillion

[01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:46.350]
