[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.000]
Old day long guide, bid-idididibon.

[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.920]
If I was the pecsum, going,

[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.420]
boy, I'd buy up all the stations,

[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.900]
like the life of lovin' Zeta IOD.

[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.040]
I've had lots of money in the bank,

[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940]
annoying lots of goyem like run.

[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.300]
I have already own network that nobody carries,

[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.360]
but everyone has to run the spots.

[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.960]
TV cable real estate IOD home.

[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.420]
I'd have a half a dozen big FM stations

[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.240]
and 607 AM stations too.

[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.860]
And that's just in hell and there lo-lo-lo.

[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.760]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.760]
If I was but pecsum,

[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.960]
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.340]
Old day long guide, fiddle with my knob.

[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.300]
If I was my pecsum, going,

[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.620]
I'd be rearranged a format,

[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.060]
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.880]
By the way, the birds comin' back.

[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.160]
I have shackles, you know what I mean.

[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.080]
And that's Dan Major.

[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.280]
I'd be richer than the freaking queen.

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.680]
Steve Kane, Wayne High Zenga,

[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.220]
would be perniquet.

[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.780]
Joey Reynolds.

[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.060]
If I was that pecsum, going,

[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.300]
boy,

[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.280]
Panthers had a goal called back for a man in the crease,

[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.800]
the devils have the only legal one.

[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.000]
Drop Needomire with a shot in scores.

[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.820]
Endy McCay turning shouldered off by Lowry,

[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.000]
but McCay get moving.

[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.280]
Brandy McCay twisting with it.

[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.440]
Winnery pass scores.

[00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.840]
Lowry, two, one, Panthers.

[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.280]
Panthers have it, Brodoor hasn't left.

[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.260]
Hub had it knocked away by Enbridge,

[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.980]
shot, floated back on again,

[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.240]
and it's colored by Needomire.

[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.680]
Now headed to the bench, Brodoor.

[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.380]
The devils will go in six attackers,

[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.920]
Needomire sent it to the corner.

[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.460]
Hacked along by Devorak,

[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.980]
waiting his Gilmore keeps it alive.

[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.660]
Gilmore shoots,

[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.740]
saved made by M&B's brook.

[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.880]
Off Gilmore again,

[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.400]
fed one to Garin, knocked away,

[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.000]
backhander up over the,

[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.200]
or off of the net and then off the glass.

[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.280]
Odeline flipped the long further.

[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.600]
Needomire around behind,

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.700]
but his Gilmore out in front,

[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.940]
they hack away at it still.

[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.400]
It's Gilmore to Garin,

[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.260]
he can't get a shot away in the way of Devorak.

[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.360]
Clear back off,

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.140]
able to keep it his Odeline.

[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.620]
The fans are standing,

[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.740]
it's difficult to see.

[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.720]
Cuck came back over now to Devorak,

[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.040]
down the eyes and in.

[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.840]
You know, somebody better tell us reddit to Vorek,

[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.600]
kid to quit messing with my predictions, okay?

[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.820]
What did I say yesterday?

[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.620]
Panthers three New Jersey two,

[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.380]
and there it was, three to two.

[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.460]
It was right within my grasp,

[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.300]
and the score two.

[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.180]
And as smart as kids,

[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.180]
scores that empty net goal.

[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.940]
But thank you very much,

[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.140]
reddit, because it got out of us out of there

[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.000]
with 30 seconds left.

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.680]
No traffic whatsoever got out of there

[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.500]
like a bad out of hell.

[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.360]
And it was great.

[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.760]
All of a sudden out of nowhere,

[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.800]
and of all people,

[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.220]
of all people to set a fire

[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.540]
under the ass of this team,

[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.540]

[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.760]
Robbie Neetermire.

[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.300]
Robbie Neetermire,

[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.300]
who all of a sudden got that wake up call,

[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.000]
in fact, is he,

[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.880]
and this is the God's honest truth,

[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.560]
God dang.

[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.240]
Just before he scored the tying goal there

[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.060]
in the third period,

[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.420]
and this is the first time we've all

[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.840]
seasoned long one of game after,

[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.720]
trailing after two.

[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.920]
He's coming across the blue line,

[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.260]
and I'm starting my own kind of like,

[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.000]
under my breath,

[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.680]
Robbie.

[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.440]
Robbie, I'm doing it sarcastically.

[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.820]
And just before we took the shot,

[00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.140]
I'm going,

[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.900]
Robbie, and about I'm being right in the net,

[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.260]
and everybody including me gets up,

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.780]
and we're screaming.

[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.260]
Then of course he gets in the fight

[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.100]
and kicks chambers ass, big time.

[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.600]
And then the crowd is all going,

[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.740]
Robbie, Robbie, we're easy,

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.920]
okay, we're easy, okay,

[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.960]
we forget all the other stuff.

[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.940]
Nice going, Robbie.

[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.240]
And then Dave Lowry,

[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.340]
and what have passed by Shepard on at first goal?

[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.560]
I know you don't want to hear about it,

[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.220]
you non-hockey boring people, okay?

[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.040]
It was great.

[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.440]
Just with a doctor ordered at the right time,

[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.520]
a freaking miracle, okay?

[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.560]
A freaking unbelievable miracle,

[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.480]
just when things were looking pretty grim,

[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.480]
man, slim and grim,

[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.580]
and all of a sudden these guys butch stuff.

[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.400]
Nice going, Robbie.

[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.940]
Nice going, Dave.

[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.100]
Shepard, what a pass, huh?

[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.800]
So that was some night at the arena last night.

[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.060]
The only problem again that the crowd, oh, man.

[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.940]
Our topic today, by the way,

[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.860]
and I notice certain shows

[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.380]
they're doing topics these days.

[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.060]
But our topic,

[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.060]
our topic today is,

[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.120]
Drunken Goyam at the sporting events in South Florida.

[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.740]
Boy, did we have drunks there last night?

[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.400]
We had more drunks per square inch

[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.640]
than you could shake your thing into.

[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.260]
I mean, just unbelievable.

[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.300]
And then the crowd,

[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.380]
and I'm not just talking about the a rat man up there

[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.100]
who's a real asshole,

[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.840]
I'm talking about a whole thousands of people.

[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.160]
In the third period there,

[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.000]
there was that situation,

[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.720]
I figured who was,

[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.940]
was it Scott Needomar and Murphy?

[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.000]
Somebody in Murphy.

[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.720]
I'm pretty sure it was Scott Needomar,

[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.180]
I better check.

[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.360]
Better check the thing here

[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.800]
and see who got the double minor, okay?

[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.520]
And Rob Shick, the referee,

[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.360]
calls the penalty.

[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.160]
There's an original penalty against Jersey,

[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.200]
and then Murphy and whoever it was,

[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.460]
I think Needomar, get into it.

[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.400]
Let me check here.

[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.140]
Where's the thing?

[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.980]
Okay, let's see.

[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.940]
Third period.

[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.160]
Yeah, Scott Needomar,

[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.180]
a double minor.

[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.640]
And so the referee is called a double minor,

[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.520]
four minutes on them,

[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.240]
and two minutes on Murphy for retaliating,

[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.060]
which is fine.

[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.500]
We got the man advantage.

[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.280]
We got a power play.

[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.080]
And now the crowd,

[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.580]
not even understanding it,

[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.320]
not even getting it,

[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.560]
even though they only put the two minutes

[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.200]
for Needomar up there and a board for them.

[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.140]
And now the crowd,

[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.240]
thousands of them are screaming,

[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.900]
hey, ref, you suck!

[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.180]
And we're all looking at each other like,

[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.300]
what is wrong with you?

[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.940]
And he just gave us a power play out of that.

[00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.060]
You idiots, you morons.

[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.360]
When are you going to learn?

[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.820]
It's embarrassing, okay?

[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.300]
Oh, and by the way,

[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.400]
so Rimmer don't get all ruffled.

[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.160]
The reason I had to play a Mike Emmerk this morning

[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.420]
is my small dish.

[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.180]
The VCR had gone with that for some reason.

[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.440]
One of the 85,000 power outages

[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.980]
and plantation in last couple of days.

[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.480]
It flipped over to short play.

[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.160]
So I get home after the game last night.

[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.020]
And all I got is the New Jersey.

[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.440]
Thank goodness I taped them both.

[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.480]
See, always have a backup.

[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.300]
Always have a backup behind you.

[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.860]
Well, even if it's Paul Coffey.

[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.300]
But at any rate,

[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.060]
so that's the only telecast I had.

[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.460]
And Mike Emmerk quite frankly,

[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.700]
that wasn't his best work ever,

[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.660]
but it's all we got.

[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.620]
So it's better than nothing.

[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.100]
So that's why you weren't on there, Rimmer.

[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.260]
So don't get all bent out of shape

[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.960]
and psychotic,

[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.300]
and emotional as usual, okay?

[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.120]
That's the reason we had the Emmerk highlights

[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.020]
from Sports Channel,

[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.580]
whatever it is that does the devil's games.

[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.240]
So there we go.

[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:48.920]
It was a great night.

[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.140]
A good time was had by all.

[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.980]
We had a lot of drunks.

[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.920]
And I saw the mad dog there last night.

[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.040]
Mad dog was up there enjoying it,

[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.560]
sitting up there kind of kicking back

[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.860]
with 85 beers in his hand.

[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.720]
He was really a,

[00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.640]
having a great time.

[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.400]
And he said to me,

[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.380]
I like guys.

[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:02.960]
And I said,

[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.980]
hey, I'm, I'll see you.

[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.480]
So at any rate, let's see,

[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.200]
Mandage was there,

[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.760]
who well owned it before I left the house.

[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.240]
This is the best news of all.

[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.160]
Get ready to go to the hockey game,

[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.700]
hoping for a three-two panther win.

[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.900]
Which it really was three-two.

[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.480]
The empty net goal was the icing on the cake.

[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.240]
Oh, it was icing?

[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.760]
No, just a, anyway.

[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.200]
So at any rate,

[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.900]
the phone rings,

[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.580]
and who is it?

[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.580]
It's that bitch,

[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.800]
Eleanor Breffer,

[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.840]
from the Miami Herald.

[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.140]
That fucking bitch.

[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.920]
I just want to say this, okay, Ellie?

[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.160]
Don't bother me.

[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.900]
Any information that I have to pass along,

[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.340]
I will give to Tom Jicca.

[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:36.780]
Because Tom,

[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.380]
even though we've had our moments over the years,

[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:38.980]
who hasn't?

[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.080]
When you've been here for as many years as Tom and I have been,

[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:41.800]
you're going to have your moments.

[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.840]
But Tom's a good guy,

[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.920]
and he doesn't write bull crap.

[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.500]
He doesn't just make things up.

[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.020]
And he also isn't an Ojohn provocateur,

[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.000]
desperate to try to create a problem

[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.860]
just to get his spicy quotes and create some kind of a war.

[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.840]
Tom's got a real nice piece.

[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.280]
In fact, he ought to be wearing it in that picture.

[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.360]
Now, I mean, he's got a nice piece in the Sunsettless morning,

[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.940]
on page 4E,

[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.180]
bid to sensor Rogers, prompted move.

[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.820]
How do you like that?

[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.140]
So at any rate,

[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.100]
and basically,

[00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.440]
what I'm reading in the article here is all pretty accurate.

[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.420]
And all what I told him.

[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.240]
And Eleanor Breffer,

[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.640]
I have two minutes before I'm leaving the house to go to the hockey game,

[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.780]
and this bitch calls again.

[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.880]
I said, what do you want, Ellie?

[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.600]
Well, you won't believe this,

[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.280]
but I'm writing another story.

[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.240]
I said, when's the book coming out already, honey?

[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.720]
Why don't you just write a make in 10 million a year

[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.060]
and just get it over with, make up whatever you want?

[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.680]
And she's another one of these people who doesn't get it.

[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.940]
She ought to work for Paxton.

[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.120]
She doesn't get it.

[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.220]
She doesn't get the message.

[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.620]
Like a lot of other people who don't get the message,

[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.660]
we're getting email now, we're getting faxes for people about,

[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.060]
oh, well, Hank thinks this.

[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.600]
And the Paxton people,

[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.300]
see, what you don't understand,

[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.920]
that little handful of malcontent Yentis out there,

[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.860]
I don't really care.

[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.540]
I don't care.

[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.740]
I don't care if this one's going ballistic.

[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.860]
I don't care if that one is having a nervous breakdown.

[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.060]
I don't care if, let's see,

[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:58.840]
who are they bringing in Don,

[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.320]
I'm as Howard Stern and Jerry Williams and William P. Williams.

[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.720]
They're all coming in here to do midday.

[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.260]
Fine, great.

[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.800]
Life goes on.

[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.900]
Most 11 as they say in China,

[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.880]
it's a paycheck, it's a living, okay?

[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:12.760]
It's a business.

[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.980]
But the number, I mean, just the feeding frenzy

[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.060]
that's going on here lately,

[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.760]
I mean, Stan Major calling in on the air,

[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.500]
we're here the other day.

[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.380]
I almost said they called somebody off the air,

[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.200]
which I don't want to do that.

[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.440]
But no, seriously, Stan sniffing around over here

[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.120]
like they're going to put him on the air here.

[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.160]
On this radio station again,

[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.820]
after that earlier debacle,

[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.920]
to talk about Milky Way dark.

[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.660]
Remember those shows?

[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.700]
Were you around that?

[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.160]
I was doing them, I was bored out.

[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.680]
Oh, my God, and you survived that?

[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.260]
Let's hear it for George, folks.

[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:45.660]
Come on.

[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.740]
Remember, that's how he got me the job with you.

[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.480]
Anybody buy a good watch lately?

[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.940]
You know how many years ago that is?

[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.840]
And I still remember it now,

[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.320]
that's like seven, eight years ago.

[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.000]
That's when Mr. Ego went to New York to WABC

[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.820]
for his short-lived run up there.

[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.760]
And Stan Major, and yes, I must confess,

[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.480]
I had, well, I had nothing to do with that.

[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.580]
I had something to do with getting money

[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.360]
around the weekend there,

[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.460]
which was bad enough.

[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.560]
But then as a desperation move,

[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.180]
and they stuck a money around afternoon drive,

[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.840]
and Stan did many, many shows on Milky Way dark

[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.660]
and Milky Way lights.

[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.600]
I mean, don't take it personal, Stan.

[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.620]
It's not personal, it's just business and God.

[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.260]
I mean, it was pretty exciting radio.

[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.000]
See, there are a lot of people who think

[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.160]
that they can do this.

[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.780]
Stream of consciousness.

[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.720]
Come on, and bap bap.

[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.080]
See, I'm going to tell you right now,

[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.500]
I don't care what Walter Sabo says.

[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.720]
I don't care what Harry Penis says.

[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.360]
I don't care what Peter Bolder says.

[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.620]
I don't care what anybody says.

[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.400]
Topic talk radio.

[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.200]
Where we come on in, this is the topic.

[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.020]
We're going to talk about how many pedestrians

[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.720]
you've hit this week with your car.

[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.360]
It is so boring.

[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.440]
It is so terminal, and the demographics

[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.160]
that it gets are so old.

[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.720]
Just look at the light bulb, man.

[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.080]
They had to put a special column in arbitrage

[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.200]
for dead people just so that the light bulb

[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.040]
could show up in there.

[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.140]
That's how old topic radio gets demographically.

[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.420]
Because living and breathing people,

[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.680]
don't care about that.

[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.360]
It is so, that went out with knickers.

[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.420]
That went out with two piece bathing suits for men.

[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.140]
And these guys, man, they got all the answers.

[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.500]
They want to hear those hot topics.

[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.520]
They want to hear you push those hot buttons, baby.

[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.820]
Even Lord asked limbo is in the tank.

[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.160]
This company spent 125 grand,

[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.580]
so I was told by the big man.

[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:21.800]
What's his name?

[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:22.800]
What's his name?

[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.560]
Yeah, he told me they spent 125 grand on wins

[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.340]
to get that half-assed fat slub show.

[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.660]
And he's dead in the water, man.

[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.940]
Because nobody wants to hear all that right-wing rhetoric anymore.

[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.500]
They've heard it till it's coming out of their body parts.

[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.580]
But all these people are experts and everybody,

[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.820]
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.740]
and they're in a feeding frenzy.

[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.740]
Know something that's great, because it's kind of a boring time

[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.000]
in a boring town anyway.

[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.420]
So leave it to me once again by hooker by crook

[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.900]
to stimulate something out there.

[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.740]
Get a little something going.

[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.640]
Even the bird is calling Alan Mason now.

[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.360]
Alan Mason, though, as he wants to do this show.

[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.500]
I don't think we could handle that.

[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.200]
Do you?

[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.700]
I think that...

[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.180]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.640]
We'd have to bring our own bird on there.

[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.800]
Or instead of the bird, maybe we could bring on you bird.

[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.260]
Or the bird.

[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.580]
For somebody who's been here this morning saying,

[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.220]
well, what's the difference?

[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.020]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.000]
I don't want to be being afraid of confidence.

[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.200]
But I think everybody feels that way pretty much.

[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.840]
As a matter of fact, just one last time.

[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.100]
Okay, just the whole time, say.

[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.740]
If you missed the Neil Rogers show yesterday on 610WIOD,

[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.380]
you missed this.

[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.020]
Is this the bird?

[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:34.580]
Yeah.

[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.620]
Bird, how you doing?

[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.040]
Okay.

[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.620]
Listen, do me a favor, play anything.

[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.140]
Because I can't stand listening to you.

[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.620]
You sound like a douchebag.

[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.660]
Do it.

[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.180]
Just do me a favor, play anything.

[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.160]
Well, can I ask you a question before you go?

[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.220]
Oh, God, you sound so stupid.

[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.360]
I hate to talk to you.

[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.000]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.160]
Why did you call me?

[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.000]
I didn't call you.

[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.840]
You're not just to tell you not to say anything.

[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.160]
Just play something.

[00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.740]
Oh, God, can't stand it.

[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.220]
Well, then why are you listening?

[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.920]
Oh, play something already.

[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.360]
Why won't you answer me?

[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.720]
Oh, God, stand it.

[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.680]
You won't see who won't talk to me.

[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.980]
Oh, God, we got a car here.

[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:09.360]
Hello.

[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.680]
Yeah, we better get that car phone.

[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.260]
1015WIOD never...

[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.440]
When McDonald is in town, she's not listening to us.

[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.100]
What's this discussion with, huh?

[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:19.760]
1018WIOD.

[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.580]
The happy Thursday.

[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.960]
It's a great day in town, man.

[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.240]
We're going to have ticket tape parades.

[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.560]
Everybody is on their feet.

[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.680]
Everybody's all pumped up.

[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.000]
They are.

[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.260]
And of course, we're going to be talking to Mike Lang,

[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.660]
the voice of the penguins later on, about 1 o'clock for a few minutes.

[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.700]
Don't get panicky now.

[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.800]
Rumors not coming.

[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.740]
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.040]
Hello.

[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.560]
Hey, Neil, I think the team might have had their B-I-12 shot yesterday before the game.

[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.140]
Good B, I think that's what done it.

[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.600]
What did I tell you?

[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.920]
All you doubting Steve Thomas' out there, I told you, 3 to 2 Panthers.

[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.420]
And I'll take 4 to 2, just to be safe.

[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.340]
And 8 to 8 minutes, but I think even Joe Watt, a pre-deafing game lab.

[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.320]
Not bad for him.

[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.140]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.780]
It's better when he's spent half the game in a penalty box, keeps us out of trouble.

[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:56.780]
That's right.

[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.620]
He keeps out of our way.

[00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.340]
How you going to a Italian class in Saturday?

[00:14:59.760 --> 00:14:59.960]
Yes.

[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.940]
Well, I want to invite you right across the way on the Swapule University,

[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.780]
where you have a big, all-water pole tournament.

[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:06.340]
Yeah?

[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.180]
I mean, maybe we want to check it out after class.

[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.440]
We got some of the top players in the world competing there.

[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:10.920]
Really?

[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.380]
It's a very fun sport to watch.

[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.660]
Very physical and exciting.

[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.520]
A lot of almost naked young guys, huh?

[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:15.820]
Exactly.

[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:16.380]
Great.

[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.520]
Check it out.

[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.280]
A little short walk, kind of, right on the conference center where you're out there.

[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:21.660]
Oh, it is?

[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.060]
Yeah.

[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.480]
I don't think there was anything behind the conference center.

[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.300]
Yeah, just a little bit.

[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.280]
There's a bunch of naked guys.

[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.680]
Just a little bit to the side there.

[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.800]
And a big, big swimming pool complex.

[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:30.300]
Great.

[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.220]
Yeah, check it out.

[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.260]
If you put your name on a list, you want to stay in this and even.

[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:34.960]
All right.

[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.740]
All righty.

[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.200]
Thanks, pal.

[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:36.600]
All righty.

[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.260]
Bottom's up.

[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:37.640]
Okay.

[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.380]
There you go.

[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.740]
You know about the swimmers and the polo guys.

[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.060]
Two open lines in day six, two, two, two, WYOD.

[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.600]
Two and Broward, seven, six, seven.

[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.420]
Anybody out there hit any pedestrians this week?

[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:47.800]
Come on.

[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.020]
That's our topic today.

[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.500]
Who would you rather have?

[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:54.040]
The bird, a Stan Major, Steve Cain, Ellie Brecher.

[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.320]
Who you want to do in his show mid days when I'm out of here?

[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:56.840]
Come on.

[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.440]
Let's hear it.

[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.660]
I hear Andrew Calba's coming back and Phil's coming to produce his show.

[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.700]
That's the reward that I heard.

[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.380]
Are you positive?

[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:06.540]
Here.

[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:07.700]
Here's.

[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.840]
Oh, God.

[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.840]
But Pete Boulder kind of laid it out.

[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.540]
Fourth, did you notice?

[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:17.080]
He's not only very defensive continually and also very like, you know, he's, he's what he is.

[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.120]
But did you notice the little thing he said that we were talking about one of the personalities on this station

[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.540]
who happened to my opinion, he's very weak.

[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.980]
And he said, oh, you won't have to worry about that once everything kind of like plays out.

[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.500]
Did you notice that?

[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.320]
And then like, I just kind of like take my curiosity is that oh, I've picked him up already kind of like,

[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.480]
I've spanked out into the hole once everything plays out.

[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.020]
Yeah, right.

[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.320]
Because we're terrified of these up this operation.

[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.480]
Make no mistake about that.

[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.980]
Make no mistake.

[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.220]
Everybody in the market is terrified that packs him.

[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:47.780]
I keep it.

[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.240]
I mean, might sell it.

[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.020]
That's what it is.

[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.320]
I had it like almost right.

[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.940]
Might sell it to somebody who knows what they're doing.

[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:54.960]
That's what it's all about.

[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.960]
So I'm going to read Tom Jekyll's column in a little while just to spice up a little interest in here.

[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.940]
Because not everybody reads the Sun Sentinel, I guess.

[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.800]
And there's some pretty interesting crap in there that even I didn't know.

[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.900]
Okay, let's go to Evan Tura.

[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:06.280]
Hello.

[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:07.560]
Hello.

[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.820]
How about that home ice advantage coming on for us, huh?

[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.600]
He looks pretty good.

[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.120]
All we got to do is win one game.

[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.760]
I wanted to talk to you about a news comment.

[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.580]
Commentation I heard this morning, I comment on the news.

[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.920]
Yeah, ask you before we do that.

[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.220]
Have you hit any pedestrians this week?

[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.180]
No, I'm, I'm trying real hard not to do that.

[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.320]
I get into work really early.

[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:24.640]
Okay.

[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.760]
But anyway, they just 9-1-1 operator.

[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:34.220]
They, they took the call from that, that young teenager that there was some crime going on in their home.

[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.780]
And they accused the 9-1-1 operator of being rude.

[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:39.300]
Yeah.

[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.080]
Can you imagine?

[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:40.560]
Yeah.

[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.600]
I thought it was a prerequisite to be a resident and day to be rude.

[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.020]
Or at least a tendency to be rude.

[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.540]
That's right.

[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.160]
Especially if you're going to be a phone operator.

[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:47.620]
Absolutely.

[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.340]
Can you imagine if all the rude people in South Florida became like unconscious,

[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.060]
like at 10-30 for like two hours?

[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:54.820]
Or if they just left.

[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.140]
Or if they just left with their, with their, with their being anybody here.

[00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.320]
Not too many, just us.

[00:17:59.600 --> 00:17:59.960]
Hallelujah.

[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.920]
I can't believe it.

[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.140]
Just try and George.

[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:02.780]
It's it.

[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.080]
You're in George, talk to you later now.

[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.140]
Okay. Go get some pedestrians.

[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:05.780]
Absolutely.

[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.220]
Okay.

[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.680]
Dave Lines, wide open here.

[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.560]
I thought we'd be having a party on the phone here today.

[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.420]
Man, I thought this town would be jumping on it.

[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.960]
Oh, guess who was at the game last night?

[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.160]
I didn't recognize him at all.

[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.620]
You know, it's embarrassing when somebody comes up between periods.

[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.420]
And they got a big smile on their face.

[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.300]
And they shake your hand.

[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.340]
And remember me and you say, no.

[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.040]
No, it was costus.

[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.300]
Remember our friend, costus, the Greek, not Bob.

[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.680]
Just put like a much younger and much nicer than Bob.

[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.700]
It was like a regular guy, but he's in the military.

[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.320]
And he's got like different hair.

[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.160]
And he lost a lot of weight.

[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.780]
And he looked great.

[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:36.840]
I mean, real good.

[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.280]
Nice to see a costus.

[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.220]
622 W I O D and D.

[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.520]
We got any takers this morning.

[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.160]
We're going to have to read the time, jicker column to jumpstart these bastards.

[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.000]
I don't want to do that.

[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.440]
We don't want to keep dwelling on this thing on and on and on and pop, pop, pop.

[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.400]
And let me say it again.

[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.060]
LA Brecker don't bother me anymore.

[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.360]
When you don't get the message, what does it take to get the message across

[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.260]
to some of these people?

[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.020]
I've got nothing to tell you, sweetheart.

[00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.480]
Just keep doing what you've been doing.

[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.900]
You and Barry Jackson make it up.

[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.320]
Just keep making crap up and put it in the paper because we all know

[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.340]
the hero's got great credibility.

[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.160]
And not only that, but I know that you've been trying to stir up the pot.

[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.800]
And try to get people to say all kinds of crap about me.

[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.080]
She did it with, let's see, with Harry Penis.

[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.260]
She did it with Rhonda Wolf.

[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.320]
She's doing it with everybody here.

[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.620]
Call the packs and people and desperately try to get them to make all kinds of

[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.280]
cost of comments about me so she can start this war in the newspaper because

[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.140]
there's nothing else going on and she's bored, I guess.

[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.240]
And then she calls me on a phone and sucks my ass over the phone last night like

[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:29.820]
you wouldn't believe.

[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.320]
Oh, I wish you the best luck.

[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.600]
And you know how fun I am.

[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.460]
But blow it out your ass, Ellie.

[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:35.880]
Get out of here already.

[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.740]
Go run out of goat.

[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.760]
Go eat loaf with Randy Rhodes and get out of my face.

[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.060]
God, you jappy broad you.

[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.920]
Nothing worse than phony backers who give you the real, you know, the real good,

[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.600]
oh, yeah, I love you so much.

[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.100]
And then behind your back there just they're just turning it and twisting it and yanking it

[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.000]
and pulling it and pushing it to try to stir the pot.

[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.680]
Here's a mobile and Palm Beach Garden.

[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.020]
Hello.

[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.280]
Hello, Neil.

[00:19:59.420 --> 00:19:59.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.940]
You know how things, more things change the more they remain the same.

[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.120]
Well, I know who your perfect replacement will be.

[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.660]
OK, Jay Michael.

[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:09.540]
All right.

[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.560]
Now we're talking.

[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.260]
All right.

[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:11.680]
Great.

[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.100]
That'll be a good one.

[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.040]
I like that.

[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:14.800]
Yeah.

[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.120]
Well, I get one else.

[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.420]
I'll be following you down the dial.

[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.600]
That's not what I'm hearing.

[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.620]
That's not what I'm hearing.

[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.200]
They think I'm they're pretty sure here that everybody staying with six, ten,

[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:24.940]
W-I-O-D.

[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.760]
Well, I think they got a good point.

[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.320]
Well, take care, Neil.

[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.140]
OK, see you.

[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:30.540]
Bye.

[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.300]
By the way, what's that, what's the name of that song that's in the, the, the,

[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.020]
the J Michael's did?

[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.120]
Let's say I got sunshine on my radio.

[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:37.500]
What is it?

[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.360]
I guess it's still in the card.

[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.320]
I saved that what I know and I got it somewhere.

[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.220]
It's another one of those stand major show, show songs.

[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.540]
And I'm sure that in fact, most of the people who are listening now,

[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.700]
they're saying, Stan, who, who are you talking about?

[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.660]
What is that?

[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.680]
What is a Stan major?

[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.660]
And then of course it was Pete Boulger that brought that up this morning,

[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.800]
hoping I would talk about that.

[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.440]
And you know what I'm saying?

[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.700]
Not good for the ratings, Pete.

[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.560]
Not good.

[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.860]
We don't want to put up all those billboards and blow the audience off,

[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.900]
talking about Stan major and those are Stogies.

[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.760]
Although it is, so anybody, eatin' any good Milky Way darts?

[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.940]
Oh, and by the way.

[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.240]
So I spoke to my doctor yesterday.

[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.100]
This is a miracle.

[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.020]
This is a major miracle how I've survived this last several months.

[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.380]
I'm not exaggerating.

[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.580]
As fat as I've gotten, and I mean, I'm fat again,

[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.680]
gained all the Atkins weight back, but you know something great about the Atkins?

[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.160]
I hope, I hope that that babbling bitch, by the way,

[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.040]
is listing along with her eight physician husband.

[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.660]
The one thing about the Atkins diet, not only does it

[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.420]
improve your blood lipid levels, but at least in my case,

[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.400]
it has this tremendous staying power.

[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.540]
In other words, you can gain the weight back, you can do all you can eat ice cream,

[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.580]
and I'm not recommending that you do this.

[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.800]
But for some reason, it seems to, there's this residual effect

[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.800]
after you've done a long period of time with that.

[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.020]
And if at least you try to do it occasionally in between,

[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.840]
which it's been very much in between for me,

[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.140]
like you know, six days off and one day on, and the diet too.

[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.440]
But at any rate, my blood sugar was 139, which is not bad.

[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:08.780]
My cholesterol was 229, which is only like a point higher than it was some months ago,

[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.760]
whenever last time I did it, and not really that bad.

[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.940]
I mean, it should be under 200, but 229 is not bad for a fatal fart like me.

[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.020]
And my triglycerides were 100.

[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:17.480]
Oh!

[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.620]
Which back before I did the Atkins, they were 300.

[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.240]
Then they went to 66 and end of 77, and now 100,

[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.320]
which they do tell you now that they'd like them to be 100 or less.

[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.600]
Used to be 200.

[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.740]
Your triglycerides, which is a very key indicator of like fart attack,

[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.380]
is keep it under 100.

[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.660]
But I thought that was pretty damn good.

[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.460]
And Dr. Watts's name, Dr. Mark said,

[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.920]
you're right, these people around here are nuts.

[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.640]
I said, I know, whose blood is, it must be somebody else's blood test.

[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760]
That's why they came out so good.

[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.940]
Now I'm starting to get the message.

[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.220]
Okay, we have an open line at day 6222WOD1 and Broward, 767,

[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.940]
one on the mobile one for a poline, pound IOD,

[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.700]
two on the other townlines, one tripele,

[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.240]
our topic today is your favorite pedestrians you've killed.

[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.300]
Our first caller will be Rick Sanchez.

[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.980]
Oh, soapers on the line?

[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.200]
16, W-I-O-T.

[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.580]
Okay, I don't want to let the cat out of the bag,

[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.100]
but Pete did tell us who's going to be my replacement here at it.

[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.480]
All right, oh, look at that, it's eating the cart, I love it.

[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.960]
It refuses to play.

[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.500]
Look at that, Pat.

[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.820]
I just can't keep my secret, you know, how did you came to town?

[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.320]
Two, six, six, seven, eight,

[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.580]
oh, that thing's had it in that cart.

[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.840]
It's the world ever he knew you would care.

[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.940]
I am that him right.

[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.020]

[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:37.660]

[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.040]
Joey, I better stop it there, because that cart,

[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.900]
that's an old Zeta cart by the way, Pete.

[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:43.880]
Look at that, look familiar.

[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.740]
Oh yeah, you got that, huh, bring it back.

[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.600]
No, seriously, that's one of those old Zeta,

[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.800]
will you give him some B12 or something,

[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.720]
give him some drugs.

[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.820]
Just a joke, don't you remember,

[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.580]
you packed up all those carts for me and said,

[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.820]
here, go ahead, get us a Salami sandwich,

[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.940]
and have a great life and get on here.

[00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.760]
They gave me a whole, in fact,

[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.160]
we're taking these carts too, by the way,

[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.480]
because they all belong to me or Roy.

[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.000]
Should I give them to Roy or should we take them?

[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.600]
He said, here, take them with Marble Shingen,

[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.040]
we'll also give you a Stale Salami sandwich

[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.200]
from Wolfies right up the street.

[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.140]
Bye, bye, Joey, and I'd play the whole thing,

[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.860]
except for the fact that this cart is like,

[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.040]
and you know something, this is one of those real old carts

[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.080]
that's got, oh, it's got no pads in it.

[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.260]
How the hell did these play?

[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.420]
They don't even make, well, they don't make carts anymore,

[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.620]
anyway, I guess they're hard to get.

[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.740]
But these are carts from like, before Einstein was a baby,

[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.400]
the ones with no pads, remember these?

[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:34.020]
Oh my God, Scotch, cart two, 1827, I love it.

[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.040]
And that's just, coincidentally,

[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.020]
the year Joey was born.

[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.860]
How do you like that, Joey?

[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.000]
I am that him right.

[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.300]
Starts Monday, 10 to 2 on 610, W-I-O-D.

[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.840]
Bill Marshall's coming back too.

[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.820]
We couldn't get the bird, little too expensive.

[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.860]
Bill Marshall's coming back on a laugh loop.

[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.880]
Here's Coral Springs. Hello.

[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:52.900]
I knew how you doing.

[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:53.200]
Great.

[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.980]
When you leaving for QAM?

[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.120]
Someday.

[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:56.980]
Okay.

[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:57.360]
I don't know.

[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.380]
Someday soon, someday down the road.

[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.020]
Who knows?

[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.720]
Only the shadow knows.

[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.300]
I don't know.

[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:02.880]
I can't fight.

[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.880]
If I knew a date, I would tell you right now.

[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.300]
If I were a betting man, I'd say someday.

[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.000]
So rumor has it you're teaming up with a mad dog and Brian Cox?

[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.320]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:10.860]
We're doing it.

[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.140]
Yep.

[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.300]
I don't want to say what we're doing, but you can guess.

[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.060]
The panthers look pretty good last night.

[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:16.880]
They were great, man.

[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:17.400]
What a night.

[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.940]
What a great night, except for the drugs and except for those assholes that don't understand the game.

[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.800]
You all went through referee, but other than that, it was great.

[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.740]
They look pretty good.

[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:24.260]
I got to be out.

[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.440]
Hey, Ralph, you suck you.

[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.460]
But he just called a double minor on Scott Needermire.

[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.500]
He plays for New Jersey.

[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.740]
Maybe they thought it was because his name was Needermire.

[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.340]
It was on us.

[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.080]
These people are so dumb.

[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120]
It's four years already.

[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.080]
Dummy's get with it.

[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.400]
Learn the game a little bit.

[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.820]
They knew I got to be honest with you.

[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.420]
I've been a flyer.

[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:38.860]
I've been a flyer.

[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:39.640]
For 13 years.

[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.080]
No Lindros, the next two games.

[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.100]
He's got suspended a sentence, by the way.

[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.580]
Is Michael Remberg out for the year?

[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.620]
Well, he said that it wasn't as bad as they thought, but I don't know when he's coming.

[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.580]
No, he's not out for the year.

[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.460]
I tell you what, I'm going to put it in the middle.

[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.800]
He got like eight million stitches in his purse.

[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.960]
I can't believe Bobby Clark has an address to Goldton in the situation there.

[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.460]
If we would have a Goldtoner, I mean, they can go somewhere.

[00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.020]
Yeah.

[00:25:59.380 --> 00:25:59.980]
Hexball and that.

[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.100]
I'm ready from the drapeback, Pellie Lindbergh, in between the pipes.

[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.700]
They're bringing it back.

[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.300]
I'm sorry.

[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.120]
They're going to put him in Terry Sautchuk in there together.

[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.080]
They're going to time together.

[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.480]
I'll tell you what, anybody could take that.

[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.740]
It's going to be good playoff at the show.

[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.740]
It's going to be exciting to watch.

[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.680]
They're going to bring Glenn Hall back and see if he still pukes before the game,

[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.380]
although he did play for Chicago and St. Louis.

[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.000]
How'd your vet run it?

[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.120]
My vet is running great.

[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.120]
It's a beautiful thing.

[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.080]
And now I have two vets that are totally different.

[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.260]
And how happy could I be?

[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:25.800]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.980]
You got an NSX-2, right?

[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:27.700]
Yes, I do.

[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:28.180]
96.

[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.900]
A 96, red NSX, which I don't drive, but it's a great car.

[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:32.840]
What about the Luminor?

[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.960]
Yeah, I can't afford it.

[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.660]
Have a great day, Pellie.

[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.620]
Can I call for me a douchebag?

[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:37.860]
Yes.

[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.720]
Ricky, Jimmy, and Dennis, you're a bunch of Flamian, drippy douchebags.

[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.280]
All right.

[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:42.860]
ADL.

[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:43.160]
Yeah.

[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.460]
Can I make one request?

[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.360]
By the way, Steve Conway is going to be doing mid days.

[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.020]
What is it?

[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.540]
Can I hear the two wavy song, please?

[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.440]
Okay.

[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.000]
Thanks a lot.

[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.340]
See ya.

[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.220]
The two wavy song.

[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.060]
Oh, and Dave Graveline is going to be doing it.

[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.980]
The Bulletin's are coming in fast and furious.

[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.380]
Dave Graveline is going to be coming in.

[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.260]
Of course, they're going to lock down all the equipment real tight.

[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.420]
They're going to tie everything down real heavy duty.

[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.320]
My family, my wife, grow my extra wavy.

[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.340]
You only have one wavy, son.

[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.760]
Oh, mommy, am I deformed?

[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:12.560]
No, no.

[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.180]
You're only supposed to have one.

[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.620]
Is Daddy deformed?

[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:16.660]
No.

[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.340]
He has two wavy's.

[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:19.620]
No, son.

[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:20.700]
He'll be has one.

[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.360]
Oh, he's big.

[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.280]
Mommy, no.

[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:23.640]
No, uh.

[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:24.900]
He's a little.

[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:25.820]
No.

[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:26.860]
Yeah.

[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.660]
A little wavy piece with.

[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.160]
And a great big wavy brush is the baby sitter's teeth with.

[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:32.900]
Here's Miami.

[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.260]
Hello.

[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.240]
Hey, Neil.

[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:34.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.100]
Happy birthday to you, sir.

[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.160]
It's a great day, man.

[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.040]
I haven't run over in the pedestrian all the way.

[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.600]
Try to this guy in an earring.

[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.340]
He moved too fast.

[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.180]
Have you ever had even I noticed Rick and Suds are doing topics now,

[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.820]
which I know Rick would deny vehemently, but I noticed they're doing topics.

[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.040]
It seems like a disease.

[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.680]
We better stamp it out before it kills WIOD.

[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.060]
They're doing topics now.

[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.720]
You don't think that came from Walter Sabo.

[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.580]
Do you are consultant?

[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.480]
Oh, God.

[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.080]
I hope not.

[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:57.940]
Oh, my God.

[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.480]
We're doing topics even on the Rick and Suds show.

[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.000]
That's that's a.

[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.200]
That is a scary thing.

[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.980]
And Rick keeps saying we're not going to do topics, but the topic today is.

[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.220]
Yes.

[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.680]
There it is.

[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.780]
That's a clear indication of the downfall of West civilization.

[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.460]
It is.

[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.360]
Listen, great game last night.

[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.720]
Robbie Neetermeyer had some testicles for once.

[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.820]
Robbie was here.

[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.500]
And you know something earlier in the game, he wasn't doing anything.

[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.020]
He was just, but I sat there in my seat as they crossed center rice.

[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.380]
Here was Robbie with a puck and I was going, Robbie.

[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.920]
And then he crossed the blue and I went, Robbie and he took that shot.

[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.500]
And all of a sudden it's in the net and everybody went ballistic.

[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.900]
And from that moment on, it's like somebody woke his ass up like he came out of a rip-fen winkle like coma.

[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.300]
Yeah, he did the Gordie.

[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.200]
And then he beat the snout out of Sean Chambers there, which was great.

[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:42.780]
I love that.

[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.140]
He just beat the, he picked somebody good to fight with.

[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.120]
He didn't pick like a Lyle Odelein or somebody like that.

[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.880]
Yeah, a Kendanico.

[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.840]
He didn't mess with them.

[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.580]
He picked somebody who could beat the crap out of me.

[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.120]
He did a nice job.

[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.200]
Nice going, Robbie.

[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.560]
He did a Gordie housing.

[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.400]
And the crowd is screaming, Robbie.

[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.140]
Robbie.

[00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.180]
What a night to be there.

[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.460]
How too bad the fans didn't understand what was going on most of them.

[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.460]
Oh, that was hilarious.

[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.360]
I mean, we got a power place.

[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.100]
Got Neeter Meyer.

[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.580]
Got the adult.

[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.700]
He gets a double minor.

[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.680]
They give him four minutes.

[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.080]
We're all excited where I am.

[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.680]
And then these other assholes across the way.

[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.800]
Thank God on the other side.

[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.420]
Oh, hey, ref, you suck.

[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.840]
I think they're too close to the rat, man.

[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.660]
I think it's rubbing off.

[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.380]
Yeah, all that.

[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.020]
When you guys get a clue over there.

[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.700]
Yeah, I told you, alcohol, the fume seem to work.

[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.860]
What we're going to do in the playoffs because they're such a demand for tickets now.

[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.520]
We're going to give them all a written test before they are allowed to come in.

[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.440]
And if they can't answer five basic questions about the game, then I've got to be allowed to come in.

[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.720]
No matter how many tickets they've got, how much money they got.

[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.840]
That means nobody from Dave County is going to pass.

[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:35.160]
Right.

[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.500]
Listen, just have one shameless request.

[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.040]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.340]
Play Mike Wann calling a stew barns or Mariela Mughal.

[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.340]
A stew barns goal.

[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.700]
Well, we'll have Mike on at one o'clock.

[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.040]
Oh, okay, but I'd love to hear his calls.

[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.620]
Can you just play the goal call?

[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.700]
It's a four minute penalty.

[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.920]
Johnson looks at over.

[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:54.340]
He's covered.

[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.780]
No, the man stewed barns just get it by Guzano.

[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.720]
And the penguins have afforded to leave.

[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.300]
Oh, fuck him, Dano.

[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.320]
That wasn't very good.

[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.820]
I don't like that.

[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.360]
In fact, I don't even know why that one is in there.

[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.800]
Okay, that wasn't one of Mike's, you know, Hall of Fame calls.

[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.040]
I wouldn't say this might be better.

[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.740]
And head back to the penguins.

[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.260]
Look at his head.

[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.040]
The penguins break out.

[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:14.660]
They've got a chance.

[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.180]
Here comes X on the right side.

[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.400]
You can get any of his trying to close it down.

[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.660]
His way's got him in open here.

[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.860]
Bar's in the sky.

[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.600]
Still bars.

[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.240]
Nails are going in the penguins' lane.

[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.020]
Turn it up.

[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.880]
I'll never teach a finger thing.

[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.600]
The bar.

[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.020]
Who opened lines in Broward, 7679463, 767W, IOT,

[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.120]
our poll question today is it Joy Reynolds?

[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.900]
Is it Davey Gravy line?

[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.940]
Would you like to have Stan Major on here midday?

[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.020]
What do you like to see?

[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.700]
Kane, how about Alice Rantell?

[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.080]
Come on.

[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.320]
These are the names Jim Phillips from Orlando.

[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.140]
That's a very hot rumor that I just started.

[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.980]
We got some heavy duty names coming in.

[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:49.760]
We've placed up only.

[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.140]
It'll be a piece of cake.

[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.880]
Because when I see what plays out here,

[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.840]
it's going to be dynamite when they start playing at

[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.360]
Polka Music.

[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.100]
It's going to be good.

[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:57.600]
That's right.

[00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:58.940]
Nobody's irreplaceable.

[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.420]
I'm not under any delusions about that.

[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.460]
This station is going to continue world-unalong,

[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.800]
real strong, singing a song.

[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:04.620]
Sing a lot of songs.

[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.440]
So Tom Dicker writes,

[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.320]
fifth December Rogers prompted moves.

[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.540]
It will get to that moment fairly.

[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:10.820]
Nice article, Tom.

[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.180]
See, one thing about Tom Dicker, you can trust him.

[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.540]
If you say something to Tom like, well, this is off the record,

[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.740]
he doesn't put it in the paper.

[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.640]
If you say, here's what I think.

[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.200]
He puts what you think into paper

[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.040]
and doesn't like change it to suit himself.

[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.340]
Even if he does have a big bald spot.

[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.700]
But with Eleanor Bricker and Barry Jackson,

[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.440]
who are busy doing magic mushrooms, I guess,

[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.200]
they just hallucinate and then they start calling around trying to stir up trouble.

[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.680]
Just when we got out, they pull us back in.

[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.080]
Remember that Godfather 3?

[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.020]
Just when we were out, we got out.

[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.480]
They pull us back in.

[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.240]
Or whatever they want.

[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.800]
What did he say?

[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.500]
Let's get the script from Godfather 3

[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.920]
and see if the Pope wants another glass of Latte.

[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.000]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.340]
Hello.

[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.340]
Neil.

[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:51.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.960]
You think the fans didn't know the game yesterday?

[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.880]
What are they going to do tomorrow when it may be the last time they see Lumiere play?

[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.940]
I'm going to tell you, if we don't respond for, yeah, that's a very good point.

[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.100]
If we don't respond for Mario the way we should, in fact,

[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.480]
it's very possibly the last time he's ever going to play here,

[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.140]
because unless we meet them in the playoffs,

[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.080]
and it's possible we would not, unless that happens,

[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.480]
he may never play another game here on our ice.

[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.260]
And if we don't treat Mario with respect and the admiration he deserves,

[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.040]
then I'm going to be really pissed off,

[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.040]
because Mario is, you know, I know that some people say Bobby or,

[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.720]
and I used to say Bobby or, and some people say Gretzky,

[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.180]
which I get really pissed off with that nose.

[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.860]
But to me, Mario Lumiere is the greatest player that ever put on a jockstrap.

[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.620]
Man, he's the best.

[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:32.640]
Go pins.

[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:33.420]
Back.

[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.160]
See ya.

[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:34.860]
Go pins.

[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:35.380]
Yeah, right.

[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.840]
See, now I take it back.

[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.940]
Like I said, just be silent.

[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:38.700]
Go pins.

[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:39.900]
No, not go pins.

[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:41.880]
Blow pins.

[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.320]
They got no defense.

[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.160]
Just keep that in mind.

[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.580]
Shakey gold tending, no defense.

[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.420]
And also the rumor is that Yager will talk to Mike Lang about it later.

[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.280]
Rumor is that Yager has that reagivated that hamstring

[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.660]
and may not play in the game tomorrow night.

[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.580]
Very good chance of that.

[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.240]
Because in the game last night in Boston, I mean two nights ago,

[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.660]
he looked really off his feet and was a non-factor, Yager.

[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.080]
And if they don't have him healthy for the playoffs, they'll be out fast.

[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.320]
I mean real fast as in Zipini, Duda.

[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.440]
But we'll find out from what's his name later on.

[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:14.880]
What's his name?

[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:15.940]
Oh, yeah, the great Mike Lang.

[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.240]
I want to mention it two times, somebody gets upset.

[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.300]
Here's Kendall.

[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:20.900]
Hello.

[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.300]
Yeah, I know.

[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.640]
Quick technical question for you.

[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.840]
Did you see yet the replays of the goal they took away from the playoffs tonight?

[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.500]
The Melanby and the Crease thing?

[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:31.720]

[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:32.240]

[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:37.460]
The way I understand the rule is the puck has to be crossing the goal line not to crease.

[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:38.640]
Wrong.

[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.200]
He has to be out before the puck enters the crease.

[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:43.780]
Right.

[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.540]
Okay, then our boy Dennis Parvian had a completely wrong.

[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:48.580]
Well, he's got the rule wrong.

[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.880]
A lot of these people don't know the rule.

[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:54.280]
If they'd read the rule, they'd find out that when the puck is going into crease, if you're in there, it's not a goal.

[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.920]
Well, the producer had to say to him off camera, his stick was still in there.

[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.080]
That's why they just allowed him.

[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.580]
Well, I knew it wasn't going to be a goal because I saw him desperately.

[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.980]
He knew he was in there, Scott.

[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.100]
And he was frantically trying to back out.

[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.520]
And even the puck was in the net before he got completely out of there.

[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.540]
Even if you've got a toenail in that, I mean, it's the worst rule ever.

[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.560]
And this has got to be the last year for it.

[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.140]
It's a nightmare.

[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.220]
And the fact that Brian Murray is defending that rule really frosts my ass a lot.

[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.200]
Not a little bit a lot.

[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.520]
Especially when his own player is saying that we're going to be called religiously for it.

[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.240]
Right. Well, everybody is called for it.

[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.460]
I mean, every team in the league has been hurt by that this year and it's just dumb.

[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.480]
Now, last night, I will say that Melonby was right in the middle of the crease, basically.

[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.620]
And it could have interfered with Broder's ability to see the puck.

[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.380]
But most of these goals that are being disallowed is the puck goes in on one side.

[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.600]
And here's a guy like that Sundine goal, though we played the least here a few weeks ago.

[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.780]
Sundine's got a toenail on the red line on the border of the crease.

[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.000]
And because he's like touching it with a puck is in the no goal.

[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.300]
You know, that's just bull crap.

[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.980]
It's the worst rule, the worst rule in the history of any sport and they better cut it out.

[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.040]
Okay, next question.

[00:34:55.140 --> 00:35:01.340]
Because like Cherry says, boy, if we have a big goal, this allowed into playoffs because of a bogus rule like this, people are going to be pithed off.

[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.500]
Okay, next question.

[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:02.940]
Yes, sir.

[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:07.980]
Well, the auger played tomorrow night because their last game is Sunday night at Boston.

[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.500]
And I think tomorrow night's game should be more important to them than...

[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.900]
Yeah, but you understand if he's like...

[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.120]
I mean, would you play him if you're going to jeopardize him for the playoffs?

[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.160]
I mean, one thing they do know, they're going to be in the playoffs.

[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.760]
And I sure wouldn't jeopardize the auger because they're a...

[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.400]
I mean, Mario is great, but without the auger, this is a different team.

[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.600]
They've got to have him in there.

[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:29.700]
That's your point.

[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.360]
I appreciate it.

[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.640]
Don't forget. Don't forget.

[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.700]
If we beat him tomorrow night, does make any difference what they do against Boston.

[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:36.740]
They have to throw.

[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:37.680]
Or against Tampa tonight.

[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.060]
All we got to do is win one more game.

[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:39.820]
That's it.

[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.140]
Okay. You know what? After last night, we will.

[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:42.620]
All right.

[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.900]
All right. See you later.

[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.600]
Could it be happening again, he asked just like last year?

[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.380]
Actually, I didn't believe that. I thought that all these...

[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.760]
I mean, I'm a doubting Steve Thomas. I just don't buy this crap.

[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.680]
But it could be going to a blue, deep funk and all of a sudden something...

[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.260]
somewhere, some magical thing.

[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.380]
Fat Neal gets on here, predicts the score and says these guys are going to win tonight.

[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:02.980]
And they didn't believe it. Then somebody...

[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.060]
The coach on a bench, Doug McClain says, hey, Neal says we're supposed to win tonight.

[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.680]
That means we've got to score at least three.

[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.580]
And all of a sudden, these guys wake up like magic.

[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.520]
As I wove my magic spell and I'm going, roby, roby, all of a sudden, but I'm bing.

[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.660]
But I'm bing.

[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.200]
As Mark McClain would say on the CBS Morning News, and why does he say it?

[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.320]
We have an open line. I mean, there ain't no black people in the Godfather, okay?

[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.560]
Now what they said, so let them lose their soul, something like that.

[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.600]
I think the shoe salesman said that.

[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.620]
Oh, shoe Steve said that?

[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.120]
Oh, by the way, shoe Steve's going to be doing midday.

[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.120]
We have an open line at day 6229463622...

[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.720]
Oh, Jerry Williams is coming down?

[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.920]
Okay, we're going to do a thing. Don't we?

[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.620]
We've got to do a thing. I got so much going on here.

[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.740]
I got that jica thing, which I'm desperately going to read that,

[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.040]
because it is really very entertaining, I thought, since most of it came from me.

[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.600]
W-I-D is not the radio.

[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.060]
It's the radio.

[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:05.120]
If you missed the stand major show yesterday on News Talk Radio 610WILD,

[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.580]
you missed this.

[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.880]
Get your jump on your sleep with stand major.

[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:37.200]
This afternoon at 2 on News Talk Radio 610WILD.

[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.880]
1050WILD, we have an open line at day 6229463622WILD.

[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.080]
Want it to be great to get all the old people back on here again.

[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.780]
Sam Geissen is going to be doing a 10 to 2.

[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:50.960]
Larry, bottom some teeth.

[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.520]
Here's sunrise. Hello.

[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.740]
Holy mackerel Neil, how's it going?

[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.500]
Great, Joe.

[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.900]
The end of the day major used to be a DJ in Toronto.

[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.180]
I don't think so.

[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.400]
I don't think they let them in.

[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.380]
Anyway, that last caller talking about what I was going to talk about

[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.180]
with the being in the crease.

[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.760]
That's a rule. It's too black and white.

[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.880]
It's got to be some gray area.

[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.160]
If you're on the opposite side of the crease of the goalie.

[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.520]
If there's interference with the goal tender, then the goal should be disallowed.

[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.520]
If it has nothing to do with the goal, then it shouldn't forget it.

[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.700]
And leave everybody alone and go get a life.

[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.840]
If you're on the opposite side of the crease, it should go in.

[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:26.180]
Right.

[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:31.820]
And just after that pot van said, I don't know the exact words,

[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.980]
but he was mentioning that he was, who would have known that God would have been there helping the goalie?

[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.520]
Who would have known that God was there, huh?

[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.760]
Yeah, that's what he said.

[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.300]
God, I thought I was sitting in my seat.

[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.160]
Why didn't God help the goal go in better?

[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.220]
You know, I feel really, really, f*****ing, yeah.

[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.960]
Well, leave it to Dennis to come up with another assing on comment.

[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.160]
That's what he does best.

[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.820]
He's really been in coherent lately, more so than usual.

[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.860]
I know. You got a hat trick over in coherency last night.

[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.120]
Good. Nice going, Dennis.

[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.400]
Maybe that's why my VCR shut down.

[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.780]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:09.300]
We have an open line in day 622-946-3622-WYOD.

[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:15.100]
We have a parent, Broward, 767-9463-767-W-I-O-D.

[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.300]
So what do grabers come in a half hour, by the way, about 11.30 this morning,

[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.660]
with the Stella Blue restaurant providing us,

[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.480]
what is it, Stella Blue Restaurant at nightclub on the beach,

[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.060]
providing us with some real nice juicy steaks.

[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:27.820]
Atta boy, Woody,

[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.240]
Rimmer couldn't make it today because he said that wasn't good enough.

[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.320]
He wanted to chat to everybody on.

[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.480]
Too bad, you lose.

[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.160]
Here's Cutler Ridge. Hello.

[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:36.600]
Hello.

[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.280]
Neil?

[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:38.980]
Yes, I am.

[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.640]
Yes, good morning.

[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.340]
Good evening.

[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.660]
I met you last night.

[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:43.800]
Right before the game.

[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:44.900]
Did I be for the game?

[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:45.360]
Yes.

[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.760]
I thought you got hooked to you because of my son.

[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.040]
I was working on the bell.

[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:50.720]
Right.

[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.940]
And I didn't want to say I enjoyed doing what you get.

[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.640]
You show because my wife is Jewish from the Bronx.

[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.780]
So when you meet me,

[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:04.720]
mix the Jewish things that you have with the Italian that you are in Italian now,

[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.240]
I really, really love it.

[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.360]
What a combination. How can you go wrong?

[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.220]
And you know how I can hook up?

[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.100]
Can it be Ravi Oli or Creplock?

[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.560]
What difference does it make, you know what I'm saying?

[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.960]
I got hooked on hockey in New York in 1950 when I came.

[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.240]
I couldn't speak a word of English.

[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:21.680]
Yeah.

[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.260]
And in South America,

[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.400]
the only thing they talk about,

[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.480]
not through them,

[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.860]
Madison Square Garden,

[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.160]
St. Petersburg,

[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.340]
and St. Patrick's Cathedral.

[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.860]
So naturally, I wanted to see the Madison Square Garden.

[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.880]
They got the marquee.

[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.140]
I didn't know what they were saying,

[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.300]
but I have money in my pocket.

[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.560]
I bought a ticket and I went in.

[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.480]
What a spectacle.

[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.840]
What a beautiful thing.

[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.260]
What a beautiful thing, right?

[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.660]
My God, I got hooked into that game from 1950.

[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.940]
Now to you, because of my son.

[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.080]
I know you are in Italian.

[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.060]
And I have a little thing you want to put in a card,

[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.180]
if not, it's nothing nasty, it's nothing...

[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.780]
Okay, we'll put your little thing in a card.

[00:40:59.380 --> 00:40:59.740]
In a card.

[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.060]
And mail it out.

[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.840]
In Italian, everybody,

[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.980]
Italian said it when, say,

[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.940]
before they eat or during dinner,

[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:08.800]
and he goes,

[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.180]
I don't know,

[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.040]
manjares to eat.

[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:11.780]
Right.

[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.000]
Which means,

[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.840]
which means eat plenty,

[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.060]
go to the bathroom and do plenty,

[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.300]
and don't feel afraid to die.

[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.560]
All right.

[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.040]
A manjare forte,

[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.080]
a cagare forte,

[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:32.720]
not the more you're in the morte.

[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.560]
Archipy, here.

[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.380]
Can I say a douche pack to my son?

[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:36.820]
Please.

[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.980]
Tulio, I know you're listening,

[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.080]
because you're listening every day.

[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.400]
You are a douche bag,

[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.420]
and your wife agrees with me.

[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.560]
Okay, amigo.

[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.780]
A ribbon-airchi.

[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:47.500]
Thank you.

[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.780]
I'm getting you yesterday.

[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:49.600]
Okay.

[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.580]
I'm gray-gain, man.

[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.160]

[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:51.900]
Ciao.

[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.100]
Two open lines in day 622-9463.

[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.200]
Two and Broward, 767-WYOD,

[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.020]
767-9463.

[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.600]
By the way, the talkstations in the Paxen Empire

[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.540]
and our state of flux

[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.940]
is the latest rumor that we're hearing.

[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.040]
They're in a state of flux,

[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.180]
which is right next to Jersey.

[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:08.800]
Here's Fort Lauderdale on a mobile.

[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:08.920]
Hello.

[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:10.260]
Hello?

[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:10.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.160]
Hey, George, how's it going?

[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:12.720]
I mean, hello.

[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:13.540]
Sorry, Neil.

[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.260]
I was talking about that.

[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:14.700]
How's it going?

[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:15.580]
Great.

[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:15.920]
Thanks.

[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:16.280]
Yeah.

[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.820]
Oh, well, I was like,

[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.360]
I was like, what's the name of this party?

[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:21.920]
It's the party.

[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.020]
Oh, I got the clothes.

[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:24.900]
Yeah.

[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.140]
How's it going, Neil?

[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.460]
What did I ask you something, though?

[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.000]
I really enjoy your show.

[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.940]
I've been first time call a long time listener.

[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.560]
It's wanted to find out where I can get like those CDs.

[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.600]
I went to boarders a couple of days ago.

[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.300]
And we'll ask George.

[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.100]
He'll tell you, hold on.

[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:37.960]
Take care of him.

[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.220]
Okay.

[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:38.760]
He's so boring.

[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:39.280]
Okay.

[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.560]
We have two open lines in day six,

[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.580]
two, two, two, nine, four, six, three, six, two, two,

[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.340]
W-I-O-D.

[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.220]
And two and brown.

[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.500]
Where's the excitement this morning?

[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.480]
Where's the enthusiasm?

[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.640]
Where's the vinegar in what goes with it, man?

[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:49.720]
Oh, my God.

[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.580]
Are we going to have to do stupid boring topics again?

[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.140]
Let's talk about dead pedestrians.

[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.360]
Every day of my life, when you come in here on a day like this,

[00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.440]
I'm going to read the jicke column.

[00:42:59.520 --> 00:42:59.740]
Okay.

[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.260]
I'm just going to read that.

[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.040]
That'll kill some good time.

[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.780]
I'm just going to read that piece,

[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.700]
even as much as I hate reading long, long elaborate stuff

[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.320]
out of the newspaper.

[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.820]
It looks like that's what it's going to take.

[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.580]
10.56 at W-I-O-D.

[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.380]
This is the time to get down to Kendall Toyota,

[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.080]
if you're interested in a new or used car.

[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.460]
The reason being that they're lowest, no haggling,

[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.460]
no negotiating prices are waiting for you.

[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.420]
And they're all clearly marked right there in a windshield

[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.060]
of very new and used car in the vast inventory at Kendall Toyota.

[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.420]
Prices like these, unbeatable prices,

[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.160]
like brand new 97-ter cells,

[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.060]
where they see for an unbelievable 99-91.

[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:35.320]
Brand new Corollas with AC for a phenomenally low 12,991.

[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.120]
Tacoma's with air for just 10,691.

[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.940]
And finally, the deal of deals, the price of all prices,

[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.860]
Camry, L-E's with air conditioning, automatic transmission,

[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:48.360]
and ABS brakes for an incredibly low 17991.

[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.720]
Kendall Toyota's never been more capable of fulfilling

[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.580]
your automotive dreams and speaking of dreams and or nightmares.

[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.840]
Don't forget, before you put your head on a pillow,

[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.560]
before you put your head on it, watch Miami Tonight hosted

[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.600]
by Mark Jacobson, co-hosted by Don Cox,

[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.800]
catch it late night at 1 o'clock in the morning

[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.300]
if you're a real masochist.

[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.680]
Kendall Toyota on US1, just out the day land,

[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.480]
the largest, the biggest, the best in the universe,

[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.880]
even if that infomercial at TV show, whatever it is,

[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.460]
is pretty weak.

[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.860]
Prices include all incentives and rebates, and of spot.

[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.520]
Don't get weird on us.

[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:18.920]
It's only radio.

[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.660]
610, W-I-O-D, Miami, Fort Lauderdale.

[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.060]
In a survey, we asked all the inmates at the Halondale

[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.540]
in St. Asylum what they thought of Stan majors.

[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.260]
Here's what they said.

[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:31.780]
Yeah.

[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:32.700]
Yeah.

[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.060]
In the gumboos.

[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.020]
Yeah.

[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:36.980]
Bwuck.

[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.180]
My mother used to beat me with a hair brush.

[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.980]
The Stan major show.

[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.440]
You've got to be nuts to listen to.

[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.880]
They say I love his tapoo.

[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.900]
That what we're doing is wrong.

[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.520]
But I don't care what they say.

[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.900]
Because my love is so strong.

[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.880]
They tell us we should be ashamed.

[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.460]
We're not husband and wife.

[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.860]
But I cherish each moment with you.

[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.140]
I'm so glad you're in my life.

[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.100]
You're my prison bitch.

[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.400]
My prison bitch.

[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.020]
You're not a light of the men.

[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.100]
I'm glad we share a prison cell.

[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.500]
When lights go out at ten.

[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.740]
I can't expect the way I feel.

[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.360]
Now that would be a prize.

[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.340]
As long as I am doing new.

[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.100]
I don't mind doing time.

[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.280]
Cause you're my prison bitch.

[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.020]
And I have no regrets.

[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.240]
I got you for a candy bar.

[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.540]
And a pack of cigarettes.

[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.440]
At first you were resistant.

[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.400]
But now you are my friend.

[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.760]
I knew that I would get you in the end.

[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.920]
Oh, prison bitch.

[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.860]
Oh, prison bitch.

[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.440]
I guess that you were sent from above.

[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.220]
Yeah, prison bitch.

[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.920]
Prison bitch.

[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.640]
And now you are my prisoner.

[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.460]
Oh, oh.

[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.080]
And you're prison bitch.

[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:40.460]
You're prison bitch.

[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.740]
And you're a sex machine.

[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.020]
Only have a request.

[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.360]
How about some gasoline?

[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:48.860]
Sure.

[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.820]
I'm tired of this prison cell.

[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.160]
I need to get away.

[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.480]
The sentence made to seven years.

[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.940]
Not seven times a day.

[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.580]
I'm your prison bitch.

[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.040]
Your prison bitch.

[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.220]
You're in for a maniac.

[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:05.900]
Kimmy.

[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.280]
I really hate these markers.

[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.280]
That you tattooed on my back.

[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.400]
I thought that I could break away.

[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.700]
But now I'm losing hope.

[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:21.040]
Oh, god, I'm bored of being a lost son.

[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.520]
Hey, I'm not giving one of your words.

[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.200]
Oh, prison bitch.

[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.180]
Prison bitch.

[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:33.100]
Burn up the lights because I can hardly wait.

[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:35.620]
Prison bitch.

[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.380]
Oh, prison bitch.

[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.280]
When I get out, I'm ready to go straight.

[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.440]
I know my prison bitch.

[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.920]
My prison bitch.

[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.360]
I'll never say goodbye.

[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:50.900]
Oh.

[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.460]
You're not like all the others.

[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.640]
Too bad they had to die.

[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.800]
On a second thought, I think I'll stay.

[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.460]
If you want me to.

[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:09.680]
Your prison bitch is never leaving you.

[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:11.580]
Oh.

[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.140]
I hurt you when I still make.

[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:18.760]
But now you're my soulmate.

[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.840]
So prepare, merry, merry, merry.

[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.000]
I know, don't go.

[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.600]
No one knew why they call you a heart criminal.

[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.460]
You're about to find out where they call this.

[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.360]
The Polka.

[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:33.800]
Hey.

[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.400]
Oh.

[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:42.020]
I'm looking at the food section, the scum center this morning.

[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:43.540]
It's all about the Pesach.

[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.480]
Pass over repaste.

[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.420]
And it's all about the Italian Jews celebrates Pesach.

[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:50.860]
What's he?

[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:53.500]
It says author.

[00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:00.620]
The author of the two volume classic, classic cuisine of the Italian Jews.

[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:03.880]
And it goes.

[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.100]
What was this?

[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.400]
What was about the food already?

[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.100]
What were they eating?

[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:07.460]
Okay.

[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:13.140]
It goes on and on and on and on and about the Italian Jews who came to Rome from Jerusalem and

[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:17.120]
Hock that China can made Ravioli and called him Cretloch etc and so on.

[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.800]
Being able to make their own Matsus, something I used to do with parents' children.

[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.160]
We nourished our souls and it's nothing much to do about nothing.

[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.500]
Leave it to the sun, settle, okay?

[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.740]
But anyway, it's got a picture of a lady here.

[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:30.740]
It's Ethel Anton.

[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.780]
Ethel looks, she could be anything.

[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:33.640]
She don't look all that Jewish.

[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:36.120]
In fact, I don't think Ethel's even Jewish with a name like that.

[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.040]
Probably Greek.

[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:44.000]
Ethel of Sunrise has a farful cougle stuffed with pineapple raisins and bananas.

[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.940]
Oh my God.

[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:48.540]
Farful cougle.

[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.500]
So what's the deal?

[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.660]
We can't have potato cougle on, I see I don't know anything about other than wine and

[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:53.920]
Matsus.

[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.540]
That's all I know.

[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:55.560]
What?

[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.180]
I'm not looking at that stupid Jew calendar on the wall there, okay?

[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.160]
I don't want to know from that.

[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.400]
But she's got a farful, have you ever seen what farful is like?

[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.760]
There used to be a show on years ago on TV before you were born.

[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.000]
There was a character called Farful the Dog and I have no idea what show it was.

[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.380]
But there was Farful the Dog.

[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:15.720]
Farful, I think, it's like a grain.

[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:20.220]
Like what's that awful, oh, that kosher, those little tiny bow ties.

[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:24.080]
Oh, oh, just a thought of it makes me want to barfall over my shoes.

[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.720]
And here's Ethel with a farful cougle.

[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.080]
What's wrong with a nice potato cougle?

[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.260]
You can't have that on pay saw.

[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:32.260]
What's wrong with that?

[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.340]
They don't have no bread in it.

[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.340]
They don't have no leaven or levin or nothing like that in it.

[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.500]
We'll find out some Jewel call.

[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:43.720]
Anyway, we have two open lines in day 6222, WYOD 2 and Broward 7679 463.

[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.760]
Big dissensure Rogers prompted move rights Tom Jic in the paper this morning.

[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.000]
Something to look forward to it says.

[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.320]
Near Rogers says that someday he'll tell the whole story of the contract negotiations

[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:57.280]
that culminated in his jump from WYOD to all sports WQAM.

[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:02.680]
In his characteristically colorful manner, Rogers promises it'll make your hair stand on end.

[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.940]
Of course, I forgot I was talking to Tom, which I think it'll happen, Tom.

[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.620]
I think I told Tom it'll make your hair grow back.

[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.680]
In the meantime, Rogers fans will have to settle for the condensed virgin version,

[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.060]
which is still pretty juicy.

[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:23.360]
A window open for Rogers to consider new options when tax and communications acquisition of COXON WYOD was completed on September 30th, 1996.

[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:30.220]
Rogers had signed a five year contract in February 94, which contained an escape clause to WYOD change hands.

[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.100]
Rogers had a year from the date of the sale, determined he just contract, provided he gave 60 days notice.

[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:35.900]
Or more.

[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:41.040]
Rogers is an outspoken controversial showman on the year.

[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:45.780]
Off the year, he is a soft spoken and cordial with a strong sense of professional loyalty.

[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:51.640]
His initial inclination, he says, was to stay at WYOD, which has been his radio home for over eight years.

[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.260]
I didn't want to create a bidding war or anything like that.

[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.520]
I was trying to be an ice guy. That was my stupidity, said fat fag kneel.

[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:02.360]
Indeed, Rogers and his attorney, Fagnorm Kent, approached Paxon about an extension to his contract.

[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:07.860]
In return for a longer deal, they sought a signing bonus and a pay raise, a customary practice in show business.

[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.660]
According to Kent, the Paxon people were amenable, amenable.

[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:16.800]
Attempts to reach J. Hoker, president of the Paxon radio group, were unsuccessful, a secretary said he's out of town.

[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.520]
Isn't that unusual? He's out of town.

[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.660]
Everybody in his company, they're always out of town.

[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:22.880]
This bureaucrats out of town, that one's out of town.

[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:27.620]
They're on a plane on a way to Montana. They're on a way to Ume Arizona. Buds on a plane circling New York.

[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:34.620]
Rogers salary was to be kicked up to about 650 grand a year from approximately 500,000 last numbers wrong time.

[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:36.680]
And we'll get a $200,000 signing bonus.

[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:42.080]
A meeting to formalize the contract extension was set. Rogers even told his listeners on the area he'd agreed to re-up.

[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:50.400]
To re-up it as in, however, problems arose when Paxon demanded a quid for its quo.

[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.260]
A quid for its quo. Interesting. Nice going, Tom.

[00:52:54.260 --> 00:53:01.600]
Palm Beach resident Bud Paxon owns the company as a board game Christian and he reportedly was put off by some of the racing material on Roger's show.

[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:07.300]
His lieutenants asked Rogers to sign an agreement that he would tone down and affect cease doing such material.

[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:11.200]
Any departure from Paxon's restrictions could result in immediate termination.

[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:17.260]
As far as Rogers is concerned, Paxon wanted to strip the format that's dominated South Florida ratings throughout the 80s and 90s.

[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:22.420]
Kent says he informed Paxon we will not change anything in the contract that reduces Neil's rights.

[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:28.920]
During the ensuing give-and-take, the new owner made a counteroffer of three strikes in your out.

[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:37.360]
According to Rogers, he wouldn't be a subject of firing unless he violated company policy which goes beyond FCC guidelines three times within 12 months.

[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:43.140]
There are days, Jika says, when Rogers violates those rigid rules being suggested three times in 12 minutes.

[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.020]
How about 12 seconds, Tom? God dang!

[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.700]
We told him the stick it Kent says.

[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:52.440]
Finally, Rogers said a deadline for Paxon to agree to a new deal with the old language.

[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.020]
15 minutes before the deadline according to Rogers, Paxon officials called and said they would go along.

[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.460]
Rogers said he thought the deal was done.

[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.240]
That was on a Friday. By the following Monday, Rogers says a new complication arose.

[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:08.140]
Paxon wanted Rogers to sign an agreement to abide by a company policy manual.

[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:15.260]
The one with those Christian values that think it is not as restrictive as the conditions suggested previously but still would have cramped Rogers style.

[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.400]
And I'm not becoming a Christian, okay?

[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:21.060]
The breach of faith as the talk host considered it was the final straw.

[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.620]
Every time we thought we had a deal, they came up with some new crap Roger says.

[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.180]
Underlined the crap.

[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.900]
Kent was authorized to open negotiations with WQAM.

[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:37.000]
While WQM format is all sports, Rogers makes a need fit because he's an avid sports fan and his program already features a heavy dose of sports talk.

[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:41.160]
Moreover, Rogers audience is dominated by young males, WQM's target audience.

[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:47.860]
WIOD jerked this around for five months. Kent says I had a agreement with WQM for twice the money within 24 hours.

[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.520]
Within 72 hours, everything was approved. The deal was sealed at the end of the week.

[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:56.460]
Rogers will keep his current hours of 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and the show will not change in any way. He says.

[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.500]
God dang, that might change.

[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.060]
The only remaining issues are when Rogers will leave WIOD and start on WQAM.

[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.960]
Contractually, he is bound to WIOD until September 30th.

[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.140]
He says he will honor this commitment although he hopes WIOD will release him early.

[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.140]
What time is it, George?

[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:18.440]
His contract also contains a 90 day no compete clause which could keep him off WQAM until January 1.

[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.000]
I'm hoping we can work something out that doesn't happen.

[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:26.920]
Rogers says. But if it does, he says he's been promised by QM that he'll be paid while sitting on a sidelines.

[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:32.340]
WQM extended the same consideration when Jeff Deforth moved over from WIOD at the end of last year.

[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:38.340]
Rogers jokes that he wouldn't mind having a few months off with pay to travel especially at his new salary level.

[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:43.780]
As how he feels to finally be in the million dollar a year category, Rogers quips great.

[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.180]
I think I've earned it after all I've been put through.

[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:49.120]
After all the crap I've been put through, we left the crap out of their time.

[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.120]
Nice going Tom.

[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.460]
Actually, I contained most of what I said.

[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:58.860]
Unlike Eleanor Brecher and Barry Jackson who just sit there and kind of make it up as they go along and try to stir up problems.

[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.360]
Try to stir up problems. Try to create some hostility there.

[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:05.660]
Try to get other people to say crap about me and me to say crap about them.

[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:10.980]
They ain't saying no crap about me. I'll say plenty of crap about them but that's nothing new they kind of enjoy it.

[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.140]
Don't they? Here's a lady mobile in Boca. Hello.

[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.040]
Neil. Yes ma'am.

[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.660]
You don't know a thing about Fawful.

[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.420]
Don't even bother coming back.

[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.860]
Okay. I'm listening.

[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:25.480]
Yes?

[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.520]
Fawful is little pieces of nuts.

[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.120]
Right. It's not a grain.

[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:34.420]
Well, but it's like it's like crumpley. It's like oh it's horrible.

[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.840]
It's pretty good if you come to my house.

[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.620]
Oh Faw, I'll pass over.

[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.780]
I'll pass over.

[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:44.620]
Now let me tell you can have potato cougo on Passover.

[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.380]
Okay. This is a way to do it.

[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.320]
Nobody makes a potato cougo like my mother.

[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.300]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.760]
Nobody in the universe except my grandmother resting pieces.

[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.480]
Nobody makes a like my mother.

[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:56.480]
What did she do in the pan?

[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.560]
I don't know if she does it in the pan.

[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.700]
I think she's still as it were where we do it.

[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.140]
She's getting a little older but I don't think she does it in the pan.

[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.940]
Yeah, that's how you sear it in there.

[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.540]
Yeah, she does it in the pan.

[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.680]
But anybody out there doing the pan?

[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.340]
About in the bag. But anyway.

[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:16.900]
You want to know why you have to do Fawful cougo?

[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:17.320]
Yes.

[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:22.140]
Because it's just a way to use the crappy material we can put on the whole.

[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:25.880]
So in other words, if it's stale, yeah, but when you're paying 85 bucks for a five pound box,

[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.440]
you don't want to use it for Fawful.

[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:28.180]
Right?

[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:29.080]
But no.

[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:33.580]
When the goyam have jacked a price up like that, you want to use it, put some butter and salt on it and enjoy it like it is.

[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:38.280]
You don't understand when you go to Publix now, there's a box that says Fawful.

[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:42.860]
What it is is teeny-weeny-weeny little pieces of matsu already broken up.

[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.900]
So in other words, it's old and stale probably.

[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.220]
No, you make stuffing out of it's good.

[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.040]
Come to my house, I'm telling you.

[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:50.160]
Okay.

[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:50.900]
Goodbye.

[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.200]
Have a great pace off.

[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:52.780]
Thank you.

[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:53.220]
Bye-bye.

[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:57.260]
Two open lines, one in day one in Broward, Dave County 629463.

[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.340]
Woody Graber is here with lunch.

[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.300]
Oh, thank God.

[00:57:59.420 --> 00:57:59.700]
Hallelujah.

[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:05.600]
And we have an open line in Broward, 7679463, 7677, W-I-O-D.

[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.460]
Woody Graber doing midday is 10 to 2.

[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:08.600]
That's right.

[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.200]
What do you be on here?

[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.820]
You know, let's show they have on INZ on the weekend.

[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.080]
I think that guy Bob, who used to be the sales guy over there.

[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:19.220]
No, the show where he does the restaurant reviews on INZ on a weekend.

[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.420]
God, is that a horrible show?

[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:21.160]
Bob's a good guy.

[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.200]
I wish I could think of his last name, real good guy.

[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:24.920]
And he does that show.

[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:26.500]
What is it?

[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.660]
No, I don't think that's his name.

[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.220]
Do you know him?

[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.380]
Is that his name?

[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:34.360]
I don't know.

[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:34.920]
I don't think so.

[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:35.900]
That doesn't ring any bell with me.

[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.980]
Well, he's kind of like a heavy, a little heavy set.

[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:39.180]
He's a good guy.

[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.000]
At any rate, what is a good guy that show blows?

[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.400]
But that's what he's going to be doing.

[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.320]
He's going to be doing a restaurant review showing, eating free meals here every day,

[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.120]
attended to.

[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:46.640]
Yeah.

[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:47.340]
Just like we do.

[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.160]
Okay, what is here with lunch?

[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:49.880]
Thank God.

[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.580]
Thank the Lord, hallelujah.

[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.240]
Thank you, Yeshua.

[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.200]
Thank you, Yosuke.

[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.680]
1115 at WIOD.

[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.340]
Now, 16, WIOD.

[00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.760]
Say, boy, let me see your license there.

[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.360]
What's the problem, officer?

[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.020]
Go a little fast, won't you?

[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.940]
Say, what's in the back seat?

[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:12.920]
Nothing.

[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.360]
Crock rock.

[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.280]
Sitting in his back seat.

[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:17.780]
I said, crack rock.

[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.160]
You can sell on the street.

[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.680]
You can smoke it.

[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.120]
And you'll catch a good buzz.

[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:29.400]
Just don't get pulled over by the buzz, gay cop.

[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:33.360]
Singing with a big band, he's a gay cop.

[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.100]
His nightstick in his hand, he got busted.

[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:42.340]
With three pounds of dope, so bent over and picked.

[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:44.540]
Up the soap.

[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.520]
I like it.

[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:50.600]
The party's over now at J.A.I.L.

[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:54.600]
You got busted and it J.A.I.L.

[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:55.660]
Rack them.

[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:59.280]
You were once a big dog, then you made the big switch.

[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.780]
And Jill, you're just for fun.

[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:06.240]
It's the party's over now at J.A.I.L.

[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:10.560]
You got busted and it J.A.I.L.

[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.160]
It's a W.R.D.

[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:11.740]
Woody Gruber.

[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.520]
A graver is here with a great lunch.

[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.100]
It is dynamite.

[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.700]
It's from Stella Blue, 1661 Meridian Avenue,

[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.120]
just north of Lincoln Road, Miami Beach.

[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.500]
Stella Blue has got great food.

[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:22.520]
They also have live entertainment.

[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.900]
And they got a parkridge and a pear tree and a great menu.

[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.820]
And a sunset menu.

[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:27.340]
And all of a sudden, look at this.

[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.240]
Oh, look at that.

[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.320]
They got some fancy, schmancy stuff there, two on this menu.

[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:35.740]
Like baby, romaine, Regiano, Parmesan, and teponade croutons.

[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:36.540]
Whatever the hell that is.

[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.400]
What an eggless Caesar salad.

[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.280]
Sounds damn good to me.

[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.680]
Mixed baby green, served with Sonoma Jackchis and raspberry vinaigrette.

[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.240]
And then they got a pene pasta with sauteed garlic and fresh buffalo mozzarella

[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.140]
and Roma tomatoes and a torn basil and extra all virgin olive,

[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.620]
et cetera, and so on.

[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.960]
And a whole bunch of good stuff.

[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.300]
So thank you Stella Blue and thank you Woody Gruber.

[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:57.660]
A graver.

[01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.600]
Got a nice big piece of meat.

[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.280]
Nothing else here.

[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.520]
Just a little steak sauce, little A1 and that's it.

[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.360]
Doing this atkins so seriously.

[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.880]
Now man, I've had a final chance.

[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.700]
I thought I had my last chance at life.

[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.120]
Thanks to the atkins, Stella.

[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.280]
I got one more chance now.

[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:12.820]
This is it.

[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:13.520]
This is it.

[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.260]
Last chance.

[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.440]
We've only heard this from this guy 4,000 times.

[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.060]
That's okay.

[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.220]
As long as you're still breathing, you can still do it.

[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.820]
And today I have the feeling I finally,

[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.240]
oh, I was talking to Kim by the way,

[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.240]
whom I happen to like very much.

[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.560]
He's one of the nice people in our building.

[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.120]
And Kim this morning was telling me that he does a B1 shot every week.

[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.120]
Are you listening to me?

[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:31.600]
Oh, that's right.

[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:32.440]
He's eating food in there.

[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.680]
I'm sorry, paying no attention whatsoever.

[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.980]
So the B12, I'm sorry.

[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:37.600]
B12 may be the way to go.

[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.900]
I think that helped me a lot.

[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.020]
I could be wrong about that.

[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.320]
And especially since half of it was dribbling down my arm

[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.880]
in my doctor's office while the girls

[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.300]
and they were trying to figure out where you stick it.

[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.120]
And the needle too.

[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.480]
But at any rate, Kim says B12 is the way to go.

[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.100]
Is that what you said?

[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.180]
Once a week.

[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.440]
In fact, I think Buddy Buds going to come in personal

[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.520]
and give me a shot pretty soon.

[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.320]
That's right. That's the rumor.

[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:57.820]
Here's Boka.

[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:58.380]
Hello.

[01:01:58.760 --> 01:01:59.060]
Neil.

[01:01:59.340 --> 01:01:59.660]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.400]
Congratulations to you and George.

[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.020]
I'm a mover.

[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.340]
Thank you so much.

[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.260]
I need to run the front door.

[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.120]
We're moving on up just like the Jefferson's, man.

[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.620]
Yeah, moving on up.

[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.860]
I've been listening to you this morning.

[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.020]
It's fascinating listening to possible replacements.

[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.400]
And I think a stand-in burger both working, aren't they?

[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.600]
No. Neither one of them is working.

[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:21.140]
Oh.

[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.260]
Oh, they're working.

[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.900]
Neither one of them.

[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.560]
Well, you know, they're both the police.

[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.180]
But I think you're the police.

[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.500]
They're both available immediately.

[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.580]
He's got that show on New York.

[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.000]
He's got all the insomniacs full of the thing he's got talent.

[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.660]
I don't think he's ever going to leave that place.

[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.200]
Who's that?

[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:39.800]
Joey.

[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.120]
Oh, that's right.

[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.020]
That's amazing.

[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.640]
That is a miracle that he's working, you know?

[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.540]
I mean, he's got everybody fulled up there in New York.

[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:46.400]
I don't think he's going to leave that place.

[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.380]
I am that him right.

[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:47.720]

[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.560]
Pete Folger said he wants Joey desperately.

[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.340]
But what would be interesting would be, uh, Joey said,

[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.920]
he said they'll write him a blank check.

[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.620]
He said he's going to be firing and moving down to Florida

[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.640]
and taking on some kind of commandos.

[01:02:58.780 --> 01:02:59.220]
There you go.

[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.720]
In fact, I had a call.

[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.360]
God, Joey's number in my pocket right now.

[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.340]
Joey called yesterday because he heard I say some nice things about him.

[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.920]
I remember when he was in Chicago taking an old band dairy.

[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:08.560]
That was fun.

[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:08.820]
Right.

[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:13.020]
But I'm going to call Joey this afternoon and suggest he come on down if he can make it.

[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.060]
I want to talk about the jitter column.

[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:20.180]
It's very interesting because he talks about intolerance and integrity and royalty in the town.

[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.120]
And, uh, I don't know if he's, the intolerance is a Christian attitude.

[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.900]
I don't understand tax and at all.

[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:31.600]
But I don't think that has really worried about it because after that Supreme Court decision,

[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.620]
he's going to make so much money from his TV network.

[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:35.140]
That's right.

[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.920]
That I don't know if WID has anything more.

[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.660]
No, this is, this is like a play toy.

[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.680]
This is like a play toy.

[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:46.780]
See, my idea of what I want to do with the rest of my life in this business is working for people who take the business seriously.

[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:52.380]
In other words, not people who got 80 million different projects going under selling TV stations for 40 million one day.

[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:52.900]
Right.

[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:56.720]
And they're doing infomercials the next day and they got 80 million different things going on.

[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:03.060]
I'd like to work for people who take it very seriously and to whom it is something important as opposed to just a play toy that they can't be bothered with.

[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:06.140]
And who are always out of town because they're busy diddling with their play toys.

[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.180]
And basically that's the way the tax and the empire works.

[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:11.100]
And they got all these zillions of dollars from that home schlock network.

[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.440]
And they just keep buying up stuff and selling stuff like take a playing card.

[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.520]
And the meantime is all these human lives in the middle of it.

[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.100]
And it's like, we don't mean anything.

[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.560]
That's the worst thing that ever happened with his business.

[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:27.480]
This letting people gobble up all these radio stations not only from the standpoint of the public gets screwed over,

[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:31.460]
but the people in the industry who've devoted their entire lives to this thing, they're getting screwed.

[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.020]
Exactly.

[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.200]
Apparently, I'm going to make so much more money now that I think I was years of becoming almost an afterthought.

[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:37.740]
Yeah.

[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.440]
And finally, I just want to be an afterthought with him.

[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.040]
As far as loyalty goes.

[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:54.680]
When you know when Rick and Sudson and Neil and Phil on my radio was stuck on WILD from 66.

[01:04:55.700 --> 01:05:02.000]
And now that you're going to be on Q&A, I'm going to move with you because the real question,

[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.600]
the real issue of loyalty, I don't think Paxen understands it.

[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.400]
Just wait till he sees those numbers after you move over.

[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:08.980]
Okay.

[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.900]
There's no question about it. Good luck, Neil.

[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:11.620]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:12.600]
Okay.

[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.620]
We have an open line any out of timeline, one triple eight, four, seven, four.

[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.440]
We have one in date, six, two, two, nine, four, six, three, one in Broward, seven, six, seven.

[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:22.380]
We had them all filled up there for a second, but they're very busy today.

[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.820]
They got something mighty important going on.

[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.860]
They're all busy getting drunk, getting ready for the big game against Pittsburgh tomorrow.

[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.960]
And I will have Mike Lang voicing the penguins on a one.

[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.780]
Mike is over in Tampa, of course, for the penguin Pittsburgh game tonight, which is a big game for them,

[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:34.980]
which they desperately need to win.

[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.720]
And you do realize that if Pittsburgh, let's see, we got 87.

[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:40.960]
They got 84.

[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.580]
So Pittsburgh's got to win.

[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:48.420]
They got to beat us and they got win one of these other two games to get home ice.

[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.760]
But even if they do win the other two games, if we win tomorrow, we're in the driver's seat, Panthers in the driver's seat.

[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.880]
If we beat them tomorrow, no matter what else they do in these Tampa and Boston games, we're in.

[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.780]
We got the home ice advance.

[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.520]
So let's just take care of our own business and not worry about what they do.

[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:02.980]
Okay. Okay. Sounds good to me.

[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:03.860]
Robby.

[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:04.620]
Robby.

[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.120]
All right.

[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:06.420]
I know we could do it.

[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:12.140]
After he scored that goal, I look up at Rimmer and he's beaming.

[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.520]
He's like hyperventilating.

[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.340]
He's like dripping all over himself and he looks at me and he said, because he's always mumbling to me.

[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:18.040]
The crowd is screaming.

[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.280]
He looks at me and he whisper.

[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:19.820]
He mows.

[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.580]
My boy, my boy, Adam, why Rimmer?

[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:23.080]
Nice going.

[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.520]
Give you all a credit for butching him up.

[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.160]
Here's a lady in Davy. Hello.

[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:27.960]
Neil.

[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:28.720]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:29.340]
Congratulations.

[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.340]
Rimmer butch the Robbie up.

[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.360]
Now he's going to try it himself.

[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:33.400]
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.960]
You are worth all the million and I will be going wherever you go.

[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:37.320]
Great.

[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:37.940]
Okay.

[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.760]
And that Italian Jew celebrates Passover thing.

[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.740]
There was one recipe.

[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:42.340]
There was?

[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.100]
It says...

[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.480]
But by the time you get to it, you're promising already.

[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.840]
It's called Mazzagna.

[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:47.420]
Yeah.

[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:48.900]
What is that?

[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.800]
Oh, not Mazzagna with Mazza.

[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:51.680]
Oh, no.

[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:57.480]
Why hasn't Italian he would have a fit that's even printed?

[01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.880]
I have a shameless request.

[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:01.840]
He got a new job in Del Rey.

[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.780]
He's on his way there.

[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:03.540]
He hates it.

[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.480]
He calls it dead Rey.

[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:05.860]
Of course, you know why.

[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.340]
Can you...

[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:08.920]
Have a great day.

[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:09.780]
Neil.

[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:10.260]
Yeah.

[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.140]
Can you play please, please, sitting on Vincent Del Rey?

[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.560]
It's playing right now.

[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:15.120]
Thank you.

[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.400]
I took their card or the mall.

[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.940]
Great talk up, sweetheart.

[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.480]
He drives my viewer again.

[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.920]
She's three feet tall.

[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.320]
I wouldn't ride with a no-way.

[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.760]
I said I'd need it and lead it today.

[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:35.560]
Oh, hey, I'm just sitting on a Vincent Del Rey.

[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.060]
I like waiting for the early fester to take me away.

[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:47.340]
I'm just sitting on a Vincent Del Rey with my friend, Cine.

[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:55.660]
Looks like it's time to check my change.

[01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:00.100]
Custom bus days don't always stay the same.

[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:03.960]
All that gonna do would get a tells me to do.

[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:08.360]
The driver at high rates, she must be insane.

[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.140]
Just sitting here resting my bones.

[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.040]
Oi!

[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.240]
Wondering why my wife won't leave me alone?

[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.720]
We've talked it over, but I never win.

[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:26.020]
I just wind up schlepping through the mall again.

[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:26.620]
Oi!

[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.780]
So I sit on a Vincent Del Rey.

[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:34.320]
Waiting for the early fester to take me away.

[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:41.600]
Oi, I'm just sitting on a Vincent Del Rey with my friend, Cine.

[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.440]
There he is.

[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.240]
It's about damn time.

[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:49.480]
I can wait for the old damn day in this race.

[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.960]
I'm gonna have you there.

[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:55.860]
I'm anywhere who you going, come catch me, motherfucker.

[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:59.180]
Lover 28 at WIOD.

[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.320]
Six times WIOD.

[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.620]
About as functional as Al Bundy.

[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.220]
Back edge.

[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:08.460]
And...

[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:10.280]
Wave at me.

[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:15.940]
Nothing but blue hands on my TV.

[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.640]
Blue hands on blue sheets.

[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:28.740]
And they got 90s on their feet.

[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:34.320]
I never saw the house smelling so nice.

[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.420]
Now I'll have to lower my assing price.

[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.540]
Nothing but containers lying on beds.

[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:42.200]
All of them weird.

[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.640]
All of them dead.

[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:48.660]
Yes, blue hands waving by by.

[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:51.100]
Going just serious.

[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.380]
Serious we die.

[01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.680]
Just do it.

[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:02.920]
Oh, geez.

[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.020]
Thanks for the good news there, Max.

[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.680]
Leave it to Max to come in here and cheer you up.

[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.960]
He brought in a cigar with a big cross on it.

[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.520]
It's the Paxton home brand.

[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.940]
Tomorrow is Max's last day.

[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.540]
By the way, I think we ought to have a big lunch in here.

[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.540]
Let's have a big party.

[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.860]
That's an excuse to have a bunch of Atkins food in here tomorrow.

[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.340]
Where did you get that cigar, Max?

[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:21.660]
He stole it.

[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:22.380]
He didn't ask me.

[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.280]
We let him go.

[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.580]
Okay, let that day go.

[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:26.940]
He's just to leave alone.

[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:27.640]
When?

[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.740]
Congratulations to him.

[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:31.320]
He's getting the hell out of here, which means automatically he's moving on.

[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.080]
We're not forward in the world.

[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.380]
Tomorrow is his last day.

[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.080]
We're having a going away party for Max tomorrow.

[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.560]
Make all the arrangements, okay?

[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:38.720]
Oh, we got the arrangement.

[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.820]
That's all it needs.

[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.840]
So at any rate, we'll have a big blast here tomorrow.

[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.380]
Everything is looking up roses, baby.

[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.360]
So Adam just came in and agreed with me as we were analyzing last night's great Panther victory.

[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:53.680]
That it was the most embarrassing moment in the four-year history of our team of this franchise

[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:58.620]
when the fans started yelling, hey, ref, you suck when Scott Needlemark got the double minor.

[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:03.780]
Well, we got the power play and the fans, the 4,000 of them over there on the other side,

[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.980]
are too damn stinking stupid to understand the game.

[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.880]
And just because they have, I mean, you talk about sheep.

[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:15.080]
If there's anybody in this audience who doesn't understand human nature and why people are so easily led down to garden path.

[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.300]
It's like one guy yells fire.

[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.040]
There's no smoke.

[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:18.840]
Nobody smells nothing.

[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.740]
One guy yells fire and all of a sudden everybody starts running, ah, they're screaming and yelling.

[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.020]
Same thing last night.

[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:29.360]
If you want to be led by the nose the rest of your life, just like all you stupid religionists,

[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.380]
just continue on being led by the nose.

[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.560]
Don't use your brain.

[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.860]
And the same thing with this game.

[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.960]
It's not that complicated.

[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:36.700]
It's a great sport.

[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.000]
It's the best in the world by far.

[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:38.920]
It's not that difficult.

[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:44.360]
But when you're screaming and obscenities at the referee who just gave us a power play, it's embarrassing.

[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:48.860]
The singular, most embarrassing moment in the four years of the frat.

[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.740]
No, I take it back.

[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.680]
You know, it was the most embarrassing franchise.

[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:57.080]
You remember the game last year when they started throwing rats on the ice before, ah,

[01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.540]
while the game was going on, the game wasn't over yet and was late in the third period.

[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.600]
And some assholes started throwing rats while the game was going on.

[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.840]
And guys were practically tripping and breaking their legs.

[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:10.100]
I mean, you know, but hey, when you've had the first 40 or 50 beers, what differences are Mike?

[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.620]
Come on. Have another one.

[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.420]
There you go.

[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:17.480]
Two open lines and Broward, 7679-463-767-W-I-O-D.

[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.400]
Here's Matt from Family Bank.

[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.960]
How can I leave him with hangin' her so long?

[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:21.500]
How you doin' Matt?

[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:22.800]
Hey, Neil. How you doin'?

[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.000]
Great.

[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:29.560]
I just thought I'd call you up for some obligatory butt kissing for a second and also to dispel a rumor I caught wind of just today.

[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.420]
Did you say you want to give me your kiss? Is that it?

[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:32.920]
I'll be right over, Matt.

[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:40.320]
Hey, all my customers love it when you come in. They all know it's you because when you pull away from the drive-thru and that hot new Corvette, they say,

[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.460]
Hey, was that Neil Rogers?

[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.520]
I say, yes it was, but it is a pleasure serving you.

[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:48.180]
And I just heard that someone called and said we got bought out by Barnett.

[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.500]
Yeah, but we had a correction on that. I would have contacted you.

[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.840]
Somebody called and started it with some old bag who heard it about 10th hand and she said,

[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:57.520]
Oh, your bag is being bought out by Barnett's bag.

[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.700]
And then somebody called yesterday and just straightened that out.

[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.960]
But you can go ahead and straighten it out.

[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:06.140]
I think they just wanted to get you all excited and hear you rant and rave because it's not true.

[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.480]
No, they wanted you to call which they knew would get me all excited.

[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.080]
Did they tell you what is happening now?

[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:10.380]
No.

[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:17.800]
Yeah, because what we are doing is we're planning a, we're thinking about merging with another small bank in the city.

[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:18.740]
Long off the city.

[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:22.260]
Yeah, it's good though. I mean, it's going to be a good thing for everybody there.

[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:25.120]
It's called Republic Security Bank. It was in the paper and everything.

[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:29.920]
It's a merger. They're just like us. They don't even have any branches here in Broward County.

[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.500]
So it's just going to be a good thing for everybody and promise I will still be here.

[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.180]
And if I'm not, I'll call you and tell you where I'm going.

[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:36.580]
You're not going to be there.

[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.760]
No, but I said I promise I will always be there.

[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.860]
You better be there, Mr. I'm going to tell you right now.

[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:45.020]
The day you leave is the day that I take my $40 million in the head right down the road.

[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.280]
We won't be able to meet payroll then if you leave.

[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:49.080]
That's right. You got it.

[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.220]
Hey, man, it is a pleasure helping you and if you ever need anything, just call me.

[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.380]
I'm taking it out and trade.

[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:53.780]
Okay.

[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:54.440]
Thanks, Matt.

[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:55.420]
Take care of yourself.

[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.000]
Bye-bye.

[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.140]
There's a great guy, Matt, from Family Bank over there by the Sawgrass.

[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.880]
You'll love to meet him. Believe me, I sure did.

[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.780]
We have two open lines in Broward, 7679463.

[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:07.680]
This is a great thing. You can eat this meal for like five hours this steak.

[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.020]
Have you ever seen a piece of meat this big speaking of Matt?

[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:10.800]
My God.

[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.020]
This is a good.

[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.000]
It is not good. It's great.

[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.020]
It is some prime steak. I'll tell you that.

[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.960]
From Estella Blue, 1661.

[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:21.540]
What is it?

[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:22.700]
Black angus marinade.

[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.440]
Black anus?

[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:27.380]
Are you getting personal again with Mary?

[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.420]
Are you getting personal?

[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.540]
Black angus beef. It's the best going anywhere, man.

[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.060]
A great steak from Estella Blue, 1661.

[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.820]
We're eating it and having just North Lincoln road by me, Beach.

[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.440]
And Woody Graber says it's a great place.

[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.560]
It says it's his account.

[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.800]
So actually, he says that.

[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:45.860]
That's why Woody has blown up like a bullfrog because he's taking out all of it, speaking to take it out and trade.

[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.440]
He's eating up all the profits in every one of the restaurants.

[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:52.120]
See, Woody was having a tough time a couple of years ago and I told him I said,

[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.560]
just go get a bunch of restaurants and then he'd eat all your meals for free and look at him now.

[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:56.700]
He's a giant in the industry.

[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:01.140]
Here's a, and he also says that the packs and people are assholes.

[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.260]
Okay, let's go to a mobile and a fort-laughter deal.

[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:03.500]
Hello.

[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.440]
Hi. I have a comment and a question for you.

[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:06.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:07.880]
I'm enjoying the show.

[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:09.260]
He didn't say that.

[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:09.880]
So I just moved to Florida.

[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:13.580]
And do you see any major rule changes in the NHL coming up?

[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.300]
The only rule change I see coming up, I pray, is that they get rid of this in the crease thing.

[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.160]
Okay.

[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.540]
That's the only thing that we need.

[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:22.760]
I mean, I'm just an old-fashioned guy.

[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:27.940]
I don't like to keep screwing it and I also would like to go back to the off-sides rule the way it was last year,

[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:28.860]
not the way it is now.

[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.380]
I've slowed the game down.

[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:35.940]
I've read a couple sporting editorials where they want to increase the scoring by some little changes.

[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:36.560]
Crazy.

[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:37.880]
Crazy, crazy, crazy.

[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:38.560]
Don't do it.

[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.080]
Okay.

[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:39.800]
Don't mess with the game.

[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:41.680]
Okay. Thanks a lot.

[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:42.160]
Okay.

[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.020]
See you.

[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:48.060]
I'm just in the middle of, just in the middle of cutting my meat here with one hand.

[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.020]
I may have to use that other damn mic.

[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:51.840]
But I don't think so.

[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:52.920]
Hmm.

[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:57.060]
I couldn't mistake with no hands, I do like that.

[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:58.840]
Well, that's disgusting.

[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.180]
He's not going to be eating on a year like that the other place, is he?

[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:04.120]
I might get Hank in there early, I'll tell you that.

[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.440]
We have an invite of all this talk.

[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.760]
You know, I am so sick and tired of all the rumor mongers and all the yantos about the fine.

[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.480]
This one's upset, you know, it's just relax.

[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.240]
Okay, just go find a life.

[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:14.520]
Take up a hobby.

[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:15.660]
Partizzy.

[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.280]
It'll be great for a shuffleboard.

[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.800]
You'll be able to live to be 200.

[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:19.780]
Just play shuffleboard.

[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.380]
Just shuffle it.

[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:25.060]
Open line at day at 622-W-I-O-D.

[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:28.800]
Two open lines in Broward, 767-9463.

[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:30.580]
Here's O'Cala.

[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:31.080]
Hello.

[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:32.480]
Hey, I'm Leo.

[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:33.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:33.840]
How you doing, buddy?

[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:34.240]
Great.

[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.200]
Congratulations on your move up.

[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:36.880]
Thank you.

[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.180]
And good luck to you.

[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.440]
Listen, I'm a truck driver.

[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.040]
I want to get listed to you a couple of times a week when I'm down here in town.

[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:42.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:43.940]
You're never going to send a K-Day.

[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.140]
Never know.

[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.180]
I'm talking about it.

[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.640]
All right, well, I got a question, yes.

[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.000]
Now I was listening to your traffic report the other day.

[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.680]
That was your first mistake.

[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.360]
That's right.

[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.620]
He said there was an overturn truck down there with sod.

[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:57.340]
Yeah.

[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.200]
Passed by there.

[01:16:58.260 --> 01:16:59.580]
I didn't see any trucker, any sod.

[01:16:59.800 --> 01:16:59.940]
Yeah.

[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.580]
Another accident down southbound in the Palme de O'Hour.

[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.620]
Yeah, but you've got to understand, listen, let me say this to you.

[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.500]
If it's a slow day and there's nothing going on, these people have to justify their existence.

[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:09.000]
Yeah.

[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:12.980]
In other words, if they just come on and they say, there's no accidents anywhere.

[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.760]
Who the hell's going to buy a spot on that deal?

[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:19.260]
But if they come on and they make up all this good stuff and then somebody buys a spot and pays for it,

[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.760]
then they feel like they're doing something.

[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:24.060]
Well, I live in O'Cowell and I'm on the road like 330 days a year.

[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.680]
I just wonder how much that job paid because hell, I could stay home and call you from up here and tell you where to act.

[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.140]
And just make up a bunch of crap, right?

[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.640]
By the way, you haven't had any pedestrians lately, have you?

[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:33.320]
No.

[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.260]
Well, get busy.

[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:34.800]
Why?

[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.120]
No, just for the hell of it.

[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:36.840]
Oh, come on.

[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:38.320]
That's careless driving.

[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.220]
That's right.

[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.700]
We had Kieran K on here last night talking about the bragging about the fact that she hits pedestrians.

[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:45.600]
Oh, really?

[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:45.980]
Yeah.

[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.480]
How many points are you collecting there?

[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.300]
And then she was talking about how bad the pedestrians are like it's their fault.

[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:53.980]
I don't think it ever dawned on her that she maybe can't drive with a crap, but that's beside the point.

[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:54.700]
You had to have a baby.

[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:58.480]
Well, listen, pal, have a great day and watch out for those guys who are giggling.

[01:17:58.700 --> 01:17:59.440]
Never trust truckers.

[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:00.420]
I'm going to call somebody a douchebag.

[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:01.820]
I know he's listening down there in Miami.

[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:02.380]
Go ahead.

[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:03.500]
All right, Chett.

[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:04.440]
I know you're listening.

[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.580]
You're rock calling a fuel pump on double-sided douchebag.

[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.780]
And don't trust those truckers who giggle, man, especially at the truck stops.

[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.000]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.240]
And, Neil.

[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:13.520]
Yeah.

[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:14.260]
Neil.

[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:15.200]
In closing, yes.

[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.560]
In closing, sir, being she got to raise, low me $50.

[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:19.200]
All right.

[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:20.320]
It's in the mail.

[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.140]
See you, pal.

[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:26.120]
Yeah, Howard Kleinberg last night, who, by the way, is almost as big a fan of any Jovenoski as I am.

[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:26.740]
Oh, man.

[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:28.500]
Howard, he was just hyperventilating.

[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:32.720]
Every time he got another major penalty, in fact, he was saying, how about a game that's conduct?

[01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:33.300]
Just get them.

[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:33.980]
We have no problems.

[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.240]
Nothing to worry about the rest of the game.

[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:35.940]
Atta Boy Howard.

[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.360]
And I'm not lo anding no money.

[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.720]
You're doing OK for an old Jew.

[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:45.020]
We have two open lines in Broward, 7679-463-767-W-I-O-D.

[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:45.780]
We got an open line.

[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.340]
And as a matter of fact, why don't we get stand this job, huh?

[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:50.360]
Could I always use that to grand?

[01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:52.360]
Right, George?

[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.040]
1142 at W-I-O-D.

[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:59.060]
If you haven't heard Brooke Daniels lately, here's what you missed.

[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.420]
Right now in front of my face, I've got the ultimate man of heated-inism to calendar.

[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:04.680]
And the other ones is stud muffins of science.

[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:12.500]
By the way, you haven't lived until you've seen a calendar made up of 12 men who, when their real lives, are scientists of one sort or another.

[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:14.420]
Like these guys are normally nerds.

[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:18.200]
So they just take their tops off and I'm supposed to get psyched on these guys when they know.

[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.820]
They'd rather be playing around with a peatry dish than me anyway.

[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:25.180]
Brooke Daniels, week nights on 610-W-I-O-D.

[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.800]
610-W-I-O-D.

[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:30.840]
Wow, it's God!

[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.900]
I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure.

[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.360]
Again, it is God!

[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.460]
I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure.

[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:06.100]
Be true to your show!

[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:11.860]
A new clock, y'all, my key, a broider, and gold.

[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.640]
It sure is bold.

[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:18.500]
I wear it everywhere, when I go round to other AZAs.

[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.480]
They don't know what to say.

[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:22.700]
So be true to your show.

[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:24.780]
I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure.

[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.640]
Be true to your show!

[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:30.240]
Be true to your show!

[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:35.060]
So be true to your show!

[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.680]
Be true to your show!

[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:59.760]
Our Friday's all be jacked up on the sound of service.

[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.520]
I'll be ready to pray.

[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.260]
I'll be standing up, I go present the offer in the choir now.

[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:08.040]
She'll be singing away.

[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.640]
Be true to your show!

[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:20.820]
A new clock, y'all, my key, a broider, and gold.

[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.120]
It sure is bold.

[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.460]
Be true to your show!

[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:54.440]
Be true to your show!

[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.840]
Be true to your show!

[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.160]
I can't under a piece out there.

[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:01.260]
Be true to your show!

[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.900]
And if you need a powerful Google, we'd like to.

[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.640]
Man, wait till it comes out.

[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.340]
You're going to be in for a real surprise.

[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.740]
1148 at WIOD.

[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:12.680]
We have an open line today.

[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.200]
We got two in power at 767-9463.

[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.620]
We got one on the out of townline.

[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:21.260]
One AAA-474-WIOD, where it's a Goyez-Yurvelle.

[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.420]
Here's the mobile in West Palm Beach.

[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:23.700]
Hello.

[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:25.420]
Hi, me, how you doing?

[01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:25.760]
Great.

[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.320]
Hey, did anyone call yesterday about the article on the Palm Beach post about your move?

[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.040]
Somebody faxed it to me and it was pretty weak.

[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.280]
Yeah, I thought so too.

[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.160]
I'll try to get you a couple of times as to what you know about it.

[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.960]
I thought it was first of all amazing that it was on the sports page.

[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:40.660]
Oh, was it?

[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:46.720]
Yeah, it was some page two of the sports page, which shows you where there had that.

[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:47.680]
Right, up the rest.

[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:53.640]
Yeah, and then also the comment about Hank Goldberg being referred to as the Hummer.

[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.520]
And you were openly critical of Chris Moore.

[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.600]
Oh, isn't that a shame?

[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.260]
I guess what will continue to be?

[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:00.300]
Good.

[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.160]
I saw him at the game last night and he was speaking.

[01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:06.100]
He wasn't as happy as usual with me, but he was speaking and life goes on.

[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:06.560]
Yeah.

[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:07.440]
They just don't get it.

[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.560]
They just don't get it.

[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.120]
They don't get it.

[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.240]
Well, best of luck to you, buddy.

[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:10.960]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:11.340]
Thank you.

[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:11.680]
See you.

[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:15.080]
Two open lines at day 622-29463.

[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:15.580]
I like him.

[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:17.460]
I'm not going to go over there and start saying, hey, that Chris Moore.

[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:18.960]
He's the best hockey announcer in America.

[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.380]
Give me a break, OK?

[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:27.020]
You can't make a chop liver out of a farful.

[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.460]
Two open lines at day 622-2WYOD appearing, powered 767-9463.

[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.920]
So the word is out of the catch out of the bag, by the way.

[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.820]
About Rick and Sons doing topics now.

[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:41.880]
I didn't I warn you about this, about that freaking water sable.

[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.020]
I told you that bastard.

[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.320]
He would screw up this place.

[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.580]
That's another reason I'm tickled at that.

[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:47.500]
I'm getting out of here, man.

[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.600]
Another formula talk show guy.

[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.560]
Yeah, we got to do topics.

[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.740]
Stick that topic up your rectum.

[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.760]
You phony piece of crap.

[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:58.720]
It's just unbelievable.

[01:23:58.780 --> 01:23:59.700]
They're going to bring in key.

[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.440]
You know why people bring in consultants because they don't know what they're doing.

[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:05.900]
That's the only reason they bring in consultants is they don't know what they're doing.

[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.400]
And these people bought this radio station.

[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.940]
They had no more idea what the station was all about than the price of rice in Peoria.

[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.880]
They hadn't got a clue what it was all about.

[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:17.080]
And even in the interim months, they were too busy with all their other properties,

[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.960]
with all their other investing and speculating and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:20.880]
And whatever else they're doing.

[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.780]
And didn't do justice to what was going on here.

[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.860]
To say the best, okay.

[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.520]
They didn't have the foggiest idea.

[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:31.460]
So let's go out there and hire a consultant and pay him big bucks.

[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.920]
Instead of paying Wayne the few dollars that he's owed his short on his salary on his pathetic paycheck.

[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.140]
Oh, we can't afford it.

[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:38.620]
That's life.

[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.340]
Life is tough.

[01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.180]
That's what that brought him.

[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:41.960]
And that bitch is telling him every payday.

[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:45.040]
Instead of that, we can't afford the few bucks.

[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.620]
But let's give hundreds of thousands of this Walter Sabo.

[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.640]
So we can put his girlfriend on here here at night.

[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:54.260]
And he can come down here and screw up Rick and suds and screw up the whole damn radio station.

[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.800]
I knew I knew what was coming.

[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.580]
And they kept saying, oh no, this isn't going to happen.

[01:24:58.580 --> 01:24:59.020]
You're wrong.

[01:24:59.020 --> 01:24:59.520]
Yeah, right.

[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.440]
Topics, topics, topics, topics.

[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.140]
That's it.

[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.340]
You're not fooling me, Walter.

[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:03.900]
You geek.

[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.700]
You phony, you slick tongue piece of turd.

[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.220]
We have an open line of dates.

[01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:10.220]

[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.040]
Six, two, two.

[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:11.940]
We have two and a half hours.

[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:12.720]
Seven, six, seven.

[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.100]
We're talking about drunken drivers.

[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:17.820]
We're talking about pedestrians getting hit by people that can't drive their finger up their nose.

[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.300]
Far were you carrying that stop hitting pedestrians?

[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:20.800]
Okay.

[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.240]
I think that was on the problem.

[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:26.080]
Quit the exactly because the next you do.

[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:27.520]
But be the last if you don't watch it.

[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.160]
Quit hitting pedestrians out there.

[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:29.920]
You crazy bitch.

[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:30.880]
She's very nice though.

[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:32.980]
She's a nice, but she's a crazy bitch in a car.

[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:35.660]
Wonder what's going on in that car.

[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:37.420]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.320]
I mean, ordinary when you drive in a car, the light changes.

[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.960]
If there's somebody crossing the street, I'd like to see your driving room.

[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.760]
Talk about hitting pedestrians.

[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.800]
I'd like to see your driving LA.

[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.060]
You know, in LA, they got that militant thing in the black neighborhoods, which is in between all the chick neighborhoods.

[01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:55.100]
And when they step off the curb in Los Angeles, I guess all over the state of California,

[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.920]
the pedestrians have the right away, regardless of where and even if they're j-walking.

[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:03.540]
And so like if a white person is driving like in a black part of town in LA.

[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.700]
And they just step off the curb in the middle road just to piss you off and make you slam on the brakes.

[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.840]
It's like a statement.

[01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:16.280]
So I'd like to see your driving out there and see some pedestrian come across the street and think that she's got the right away because the light's green.

[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.480]
Get with it sweetheart.

[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:19.100]
Quit killing people, okay?

[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.120]
That's what Rick Sanchez said.

[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:23.360]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:23.740]
Hello.

[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:25.860]
Congratulations on your move, Neil.

[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:26.960]
Thank you so much, sir.

[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:29.400]
Here's your 100% right about consultants.

[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.440]
Here's something for the consultants to take in.

[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:31.800]
Yeah.

[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:38.480]
I listen to your radio show not because of your six 10 dials because I only listen because I listen to what Neil has to say.

[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:38.720]
Right.

[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.600]
People listen to a show because they like to show.

[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.620]
They like the personalities.

[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:43.300]
They like them.

[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:43.760]
They eat them.

[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.620]
They're aroused.

[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.220]
They're entertained.

[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:45.940]
They're amused.

[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:47.920]
Whatever it is because there's something going on.

[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.500]
Not because somebody is coming on you.

[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:54.520]
Well, what do you think about you know, in the fill in the blank in addition to which when somebody brings up only one topic

[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.820]
and they try to beat it into the ground.

[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.540]
Guess what?

[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.760]
If somebody's not interested in that topic, they're gone.

[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.700]
It's like an invitation to tune out.

[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:03.160]
It's like I said here, you're hockin' about hockey all day.

[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:03.580]
Oh, sorry.

[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:04.320]
That's right.

[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.740]
I would imagine your business, you have to be as flexible as possible to capture a large audience.

[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:10.300]
Not me.

[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.540]
I am inflexible in Adam and time.

[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.280]
Listen, I'm immovable as a rock.

[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:15.960]
I don't care where you go, Neil.

[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:16.840]
I'm going to listen to you.

[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:19.520]
Listen, one other thing I was in your favorite place this week in Tampa.

[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:20.320]
Oh, yeah.

[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:21.500]
Oh.

[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.720]
Man, that's the first time I've been there.

[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:24.300]
Let me tell you something.

[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.140]
You're 100% right on the money.

[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:26.580]
Uh-huh.

[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:27.900]
When these people are, it's nowhere.

[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:28.860]
That's it.

[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.320]
That's the most Yahoo place I have ever been in my life.

[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.480]
I've never seen so many Yahoo's per square inches there are on the year in Tampa.

[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.240]
Amazing.

[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:37.240]
Uh, did I say on the year?

[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.440]
And also off the year.

[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.220]
In the year.

[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:39.460]
Oh, obviously.

[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:41.760]
Have you heard of this guy Bubba on 97.9?

[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.980]
Bubba the Lobsbud, yeah.

[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:44.160]
Never heard of him though.

[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:45.120]
You never heard of him?

[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:47.280]
You know they can say a bull shot on the air up there.

[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:48.500]
Oh, can they?

[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:49.680]
Yes, they were six.

[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:50.660]
They're right on the like what?

[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.800]
It's most amazing thing.

[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:53.660]
What was in that grade?

[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.440]
It's that one time I had in three days.

[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:57.580]
What time is he on?

[01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.560]
He's on the morning.

[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:00.520]
He's on the morning.

[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.660]
Yeah, I understand the rumor.

[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.460]
Rumor has it that he may be coming over here.

[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.560]
Oh, really?

[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:04.940]
Yeah.

[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.240]
I didn't hear him say that.

[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:09.960]
I know that people don't want to let that out, but I just I just started that rumor.

[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:15.320]
What's the piss off Tommy Kramer because he's a butt plug because he's got all that hair up somebody's rectum.

[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:17.300]
Hey, listen, need to ask Kisser.

[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.040]
You are Tommy.

[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.500]
If you look if you looked in Alan Mason's rectum, you'd find Tommy Kramer's head print.

[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.260]
Hey, listen, I admire a character in your integrity, man.

[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.120]
You keep doing what you're doing.

[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.360]
I'll listen to you anywhere you go.

[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.020]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:28.580]
Have a good day.

[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.040]
See you.

[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.840]
We have an open line in day six, two, two, nine, four.

[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:36.980]
And you know something since since it became official, you know, right up to the last minute, Tommy Kramer was in here.

[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.480]
I realized they're in their other studio there, but I see him in a hallway tomorrow.

[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:40.580]
And he avoids me like I got.

[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:41.220]
I got.

[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.420]
Which I do, by the way, Tommy.

[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.140]
So stay away.

[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:47.080]
But before then, he was in here every morning sucking around.

[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:48.640]
I mean, the suction was so great.

[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.300]
I was holding onto this chair with both hands.

[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.900]
I had my feet cupped under the bottom of the chair just to keep from getting sucked away.

[01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.840]
And now all of a sudden since it's official, I could have been here anymore.

[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:03.120]
And it gets sucked into all the bullcrap and well, all animation is great and buddy buddies.

[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:03.820]
Yeah, right.

[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:04.160]
Great.

[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.060]
Have a great life with him.

[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:05.580]
Okay, Tommy.

[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.140]
You old burnout.

[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:13.820]
Now all of a sudden, he don't like, he don't even look at me like, oh, like the unclean, the antichrist.

[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:17.440]
I think Tommy Kramer is the freaking antichrist.

[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:20.940]
I told you that months ago and you know something that more I'm here, the more I'm positive, it's true.

[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:22.120]
I'm positive.

[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:22.640]
It's true.

[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:26.040]
Either Tommy Kramer or Bud Paxner, both.
