[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]
Okay, I see yeah, I didn't know D for was one I knew Joe Rose

[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.920]
Why you think you got that gap in his mouth?

[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.040]
We have an open line in the out of town lines one triple eight four seven four nine four six three

[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.660]
We have one a day six two two W I O D on a great Monday you can feel it you can smell it in the air everywhere

[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.820]
My thing is healing back up in fact

[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.060]
I should have brought a big bottle of hydrogen peroxide in here today and just kept gargling with it right on the air got a 90 share easy

[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.380]
Are you using just straight peroxide or the peroxide mouthwash?

[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.420]
Do they have a peroxide mouthwash? I didn't know they had one. Oh, yeah, we use it all the time. It's great. It is

[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.560]
Make sure mouth all foam up, but it tastes good. So does hydrogen peroxide makes it real foamy

[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.980]
But it tastes all minty and I'll tell you what it makes it even better net is if you just take your lead foamy

[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.200]
And your spritz that in your purse can't get foamy or the net

[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.580]
Well, here's a Pemberk pines. Hello. I wanted it. Hello. Yeah, sir

[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.300]
Hey, these panthers were in a coma. Yeah, I mean, I mean that's the understatement

[00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.180]
I mean the last two games that we played well were back against Jersey and Buffalo since then it's I got news for that

[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.480]
Buffalo game was okay, but they they they came down here to play golf that weekend. They didn't show up at all

[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.220]
I mean, this is this is I mean the Jersey game was a great performance and other than that

[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.900]
We've been playing mediocre at best and embarrassing at worst and these guys are like

[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.840]
Tonya it's I mean, even just watching a

[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.380]
Watching paint dry it was pathetic. Yeah, thank God I had a tangent class didn't have to see that crap

[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.480]
Well, you know what you might want to take lessons on Sundays too. I can't I mean

[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.800]
I mean here I was a couple of what's old geared up by the way

[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.220]
Haven't got my playoff tickets yet and me either I don't know if that's I sent him the money a long time ago

[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100]
So I have no playoff tickets yet Wayne

[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.380]
Is that a sign of things to come possibly? Yeah, maybe they're switching the dates around now or maybe just

[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.440]
I mean do you remember when we were like in first place by so far

[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.860]
We got off to that phenomenal start again. We were so many games over 500 now. We're just five games over 500

[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.700]
We got 19 ties. Oh most of those ties you do realize we've blown the lead late in the game

[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.320]
How many games have we blown a lead late in the game over and over and over again?

[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.580]
I'm looking at the schedule just from the last you know, let's say March

[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.900]
Like you know 15 games that we played two games that we played well and the rest we didn't show up right

[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.920]
I mean we're losing a team the Tampa game the Tampa game

[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.760]
I was out of town that weekend. Thank God. I hear it was a coma coma and you know and I have to I'm not saying that the

[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.620]
I mean

[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.580]
First thing is best luck over Q a M

[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.620]
But I agree with it. He's not playing a stroke. I mean he's got these guys in there

[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.200]
I mean did I miss something did struck a re-injure the groin again after that

[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.560]
Why me he put him in there for one game? I thought he played okay in that game

[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.420]
He didn't score any goals, but he played okay was rusty and played in weeks

[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.840]
I thought he was okay now all of a sudden while if I'm gonna sit out Chris Wells

[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.180]
I'm gonna set out struck a two to piss off Neorodgers. I don't know what kind of a coach this is anymore

[00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.280]
What any place Kirk Mueller? How could you in good conscience when you're fighting for all mice put a dead man out there on the ice?

[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.560]
I have I've watched Kirk Mueller for years. Okay, I'm gonna tell you he had his moments with the Leafs this past year

[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.620]
But generally speaking and earlier in the year I was saying that Kirk Mueller that trade and the Larry Murphy deal

[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.280]
We're about killed the Maple Leafs and so instead of getting dug Gilmore they might have gotten Kirk Mueller Kirk Mueller blows

[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.500]
And then some they can send it back to Kingston with a banjo on his knee

[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.520]
But you know the other thing is like they keep saying that struck is not score

[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.360]
Well, I don't see anybody's score right? Who's the who the hell is scoring? How many goals have we had in the past?

[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.200]
We had three I'm gonna tell you one more time the best line this team has had all year long with

[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.440]
Strocalaurean Shepard and you'll never see that line reunited ever again. You'll ever see it again

[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.280]
I mean it's because the coaches become a hard ass. He's a legend in his own mind. He's a genius

[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.120]
He knows it all the general manager. He's a genius. You can't tell these guys nothing

[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.840]
They had one tremendous year and all of a sudden their experts they know everything

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.860]
Well, you know the sad part is in believe me. They can keep trying to pedal Chris Wells from now until the end of time

[00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.440]
This kid is never gonna be a player. I don't care how hard Jeff rumor tries how many hernias he's got

[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.720]
How long his tongue gets Chris Wells is never gonna be a player? Well on that, too is every opportunity during or any broadcast

[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.280]
When his name can come up it goes on and on about it's like no other players

[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.660]
Who they touch the puck you have a great to see Chris scored the tie goal. Oh, yeah

[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.960]
Right, well, guess what he didn't then they lost the game now. I can't wait for you to get the QA

[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.400]
And this way you can stop management from talking about hockey because he is oh just listen to him

[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.120]
I had a accident yesterday listening to his synopsis of the game other than saying that we suck

[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.800]
Yeah, just try to him to describe I mean he's just I mean he's just take the football

[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.080]
Let him talk on his show about football when you get over there

[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.420]
You do your hockey thing and it'll be great for George's now. He's just got to drive right down the street

[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.640]
He'll be happy right? Oh, we're we're not gonna be in that building. Oh, you're not no

[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.640]
We're gonna be someplace else really well

[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.940]
Neil the best to look to you because you don't deserve any of the crap that you put up with and

[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.600]
These people here I really

[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.100]
Have you and I feel sorry I'm not exaggerating there must be some people in this organization who need mental assistance because what they put me through and

[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.280]
Others as well the last few months. I wouldn't put my worst enemy through

[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.420]
I mean I just don't know what these people are thinking about you know

[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.140]
You always say for people not to get in this business and this is a class example. Why you got this one guy

[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.440]
It's I mean, maybe he's got nothing better to do. You know, like you see you got a $12 million house

[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.200]
It's like maybe I don't know something. I don't know how he finished that $12 million house because I think he's a few bricks short

[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.540]
Well, you know what have a great day pal. I'm in your love. Yeah, okay. We have I mean a lot of brick short

[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.740]
I'm seriously I had a meeting with that man about tomorrow be a three or four weeks ago tomorrow and I never I never had such a

[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.280]
Hour and a half in my lifetime. I walked out of there going. I've been a little bit like that

[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.820]
What what the hell just happened in there. What was he talking about?

[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.480]
What was that man talking about in there?

[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.960]
And about getting peaks of 20 shares and about this soccer team that he didn't wind up getting anyway and about

[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.240]
Bapapapapa just just kaka just kaka

[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.040]
He's gonna reinvent everybody and make us all better and in 15 months

[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.880]
He was he was very he was prussian about that George when he kept on everybody in 15 months

[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.820]
I was gonna be a much happier man. He was right about that because I'll be out of here

[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.140]
I'll be away under from the thumb of buddy bud rhymes with

Some parts of town it's so bad that you're naked. I can see how yellow that water is how schmutzy it looks

[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.960]

Proud of the round you should try rap quick rap quick yeah rap quick is an easy step by step course into the rap world

[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:43.880]
It teaches you how to look cool how to string groups of rhyming words together and most importantly it guides you into gang affiliations

[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.940]
Well that sounds great, but I still don't understand how it helps me to kill myself. You don't kill yourself. Someone will do it for you

I'm not shocked like when's the move in a few months. All right. What happened? You went into a meeting and they just let me through the bombshell on your work

[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.360]
They threw up bombshell at me. What are you talking about? Well, I'm you're going to Q.I.M. Yeah

And you've been with the Iowa dreams for so long. I mean how does that happen because it was my decision?

[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.000]
Good for you because I came to my senses and I said I don't want to work for people who treat me like this who haven't got a clue

[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.660]
I don't want to work for a buddy Bud Paxing who doesn't belong in this business. Let him go sell his a pubic sir

[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:06.600]
Coni is I'm saying let him go do something that he knows how to do which is not radio broadcasting it is not his vocabulary

[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.380]
I love out of his realm that the people in this company are drowning. They have no clue what this business is all about

[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.080]
I cut you I saw that in the light bulb is right up there rally and they're even screwing that thing up

[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.600]
You know I'd say one thing there goes neighborhood because

[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.920]

[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.260]
Station yes, are we gonna do now? We are we gonna discuss this now for

[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.640]
It's not for months. I'm going to another station. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not leaving the market

[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.100]
This doesn't have to be like the Phil Henry thing. He was going to Los Angeles. I'm not leaving town

[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.540]
I'm not gonna spend the next six months on the area. You're talking about I'm going to QAM. What kind of a show with that be?

[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.280]
I love you. Don't leave. I'm not going. I'll pay you whatever you make just not to leave town. Yeah, right

[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.140]
How come everybody's joining the morning bandwagon now because they're phony's because this is Miami

[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.180]
You don't understand that this is Miami. Would you expect any different?

[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.220]
Sooner is gonna be the heat in the dolphin. No the heat. They don't like the heat the heat when every day they still don't like him

[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.100]
No, seriously, you know you're in trouble when you when you're in first place when you win every stinking day

[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.700]
And they still don't show up then you know you've got a real problem. That's great town. You know, right great

[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.020]
All right, well, I'm glad you're not leaving. I'm not going

[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.680]
You know what you know the bash the station because whether you're fired you set to pay a contract

[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:01.580]
I

[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:06.720]
Have a great day pal. Okay. I

[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.800]
Think he wants half I wanted it. Yeah, but

[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.520]
Oh these people today. What the hell is with them? I mean this thing is going on day after day stories in the newspaper

[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.960]
Finally Friday we give the you know the Emma's there it is. Okay. There's this story and now let's go on with life

[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.980]
Oh, you're leaving a station you're going down. Yeah, that's it. We're leaving even Harry Valentine. Don't get it

[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:32.000]
Even he doesn't get it. He's the new PD slash manager. He's asking George's neor really leaving

[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.880]
What can we do to get him to stay?

[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.840]
Did he really say that what can we do to get him to stick around?

[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.320]
Words to that effect oh

[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.680]
Let me draw you a big picture. Let me draw you a big huge on a give me a crayon. Okay, give me a big crayola

[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.100]

[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.160]
Good luck. I wish you know

[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:59.440]
The best in the world you should only have mazel. Okay, you go. Yes, you're cup you you should only have lots of mazel

[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.160]
But get out of my face already. It's over its history. I

[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.620]
Could tell you the I could write not a book but in cyclopedia not about the six months here

[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:14.860]
Just about the last three months about the so-called negotiation the contract renegotiations all brother

[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.580]
How come some other people could do in just a matter of a moment's practically what these people couldn't do in three months

[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.460]
But bud really wants you. Yeah, right

[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.080]
He's gonna reinvent the a Roger just like he's gonna reinvent the wheel

[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.080]
He's gonna reinvent everything else because he stepped into a bucket of crap with that pubic sir Kony of stuff with the home

[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.560]
Shlok network now all of a sudden he's a genius I

[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.540]
Mean I've spent better hours and a half with diarrhea than the hour and a half

[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:46.880]
I'm I'm a serious I have spent with with screaming diarrhea more productive hour and a half of my life than that meeting

[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:53.360]
I had with buddy bud three weeks ago tomorrow and that right here in this building I can throw a brick from here to where that meeting was and I probably should

[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.320]
But like I said when you're a few bricks short you can use an extra I

[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.620]
Mean that was just unbelievable talking gibberish talking kaka

[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.880]
We have an open line at day 622 W I O D. We have one and Broward 7679

[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.740]
I keep showing up here every day try to be a bench try to be a professional try to do a job

[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.520]
And these people here they just how many how many months have I said it how many times if I had if I had a

[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.500]
Thousand dollars for every time I've said these last six months these people just don't get it

[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.400]
I could be tear right down say screw all of them

[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.820]
They don't get it. They didn't get it then they don't get it now and guess what they are never gonna get it

[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.320]
I wanted it well big deal. You're still not gonna get it

[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.220]
God almighty clueless clueless

[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.300]
I'm a working I'd bud like crazy. We're working so you don't have to send it

[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.540]
Yeah, get off the phone. Okay, Rhonda. I'm in the middle of a show here already

[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.580]
Crazy people

[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.780]
Okay, let's have a meeting with Alan then we'll have a meeting with Jay and then we'll have a meeting with Jim

[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.580]
Boca they got more damn bureaucrats like I said

[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.460]
You talk to somebody 930 in the morning about something 2 30 and after doing somebody else calls you back with an answer

[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.920]
And oh guess what they never even talked to the first party

[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.000]
Open and then you remember the question here that we had to fill out about

[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.900]
And it was all the quiet everything that they do wrong which is almost which is why I was such a long questionnaire like 400 pages

[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.960]
Is there too much bureaucracy here? Is it too difficult to getting getting things done?

[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.920]
Are there too many people involved in decision-making? Yeah, yes

[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:33.820]
Like you got to put out a question air for this to figure it out like maybe this was all from a guilty conscience or maybe we have to document for somebody

[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.720]
Maybe we have to put it in front of his push to convince him that this ain't the way you do business

[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.320]
Hey, I'm busy. I saw him a 45 million dollar TV station

[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.680]
I don't have time for this see when you got that much money

[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.760]
You can dittle people's lives around and I just decided I don't want my life dittled around

[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.420]
It's too important to me. It's not important to some other people

[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:55.260]
But to me it's still important which is called self-respect. Thank you fat boy

[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.640]
1127 at W.I.O.D. when it's time to get a new mattress man when you've like

[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.320]
Can you imagine a mattress that fat boy must sleep on oh my god?

[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:10.460]
Because he was just in here handed me something Jeff. Hi. Can you imagine what that mattress must look like?

[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.780]
And if his wife is smart, he sleeps in a separate room at this point not just on a separate bed in a separate building

[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.120]
But at any rate. Oh, now what are you holding your nose for? Do you think his mattress? I want to give you a

[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:23.860]
exactly

[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.920]
Thanks. Yes. Why let's see as plastic a mattress covers you

[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:38.720]
That was bad Jeff. Hi, you better go in there and have a talk and do a George. Okay. He's saying terrible things about you

[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.620]
Even if they are true anyway, if your mattress is had it okay, whether Jeff high is slept on it or not even whether CT is slept on it

[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:51.760]
I wanted it. Here's the answer pick up the phone to call 1 800 MATT R E S leave off the last S it stands for

[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.800]
Sucking around. That's right. They've got every kind of great mattress. See Lee posture pedic

[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.160]
Surder perfect sleep or Simmons beauty rest rest on it comfort care

[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.900]
They got the electronic adjustable mattress. They got that brand new mattress that comes with a 20 a million year guarantee

[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:11.400]
They got every kind of mattress under the sun and they save you a humongous amount off what you pay for exactly the same goods in your department store

[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.020]
And as far as deliveries concerned you can't be to many where they deliver every day seven days a week from

[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.500]
Seven o'clock in the morning all the way up to 11 o'clock and I within a two-hour period

[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:25.300]
So the bottom line is they deliver when it's convenient for you and you don't have to sit around waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting

[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.880]
Until you get as old as mothuzla pick up the phone to call them today. No questions asked to give you a great deal convenient delivery

[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:37.200]
Save you a ton of money 1 800 MATT R E S leave off the last S it stands for strata

That's the place for me. I got my brand new Nike's and I'm ready to die

[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:08.720]
A poison cello with the rest of the guys. We're going to a spaceship. There can be see our souls will be taken by a particle beam

[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.460]
Castration is the only thing that bothered me. You got to sit down to be

[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.420]
You know I think the poison is affecting me. It's the hellbop comment for me

[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.560]

We got one in brown. We got them all over the place. Okay. It's one of those days. They're spastic

[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.980]
They're here. They're gone. They're everywhere all these Panther fans

[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.300]
They're waiting for Wednesday against New Jersey when we'll probably get shut out and then Friday against Pittsburgh

[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.000]
Which you that could be you do realize that could be the game penguins. We got four games left. We got two

[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.920]
That's bad news

[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:50.020]
That's bad for us and they got two of the pathetic Bruins which I guarantee you they aren't gonna lose to the Bruins like we did

[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:57.060]
Saturday and Boston what an effort that was was that pathetic was that week was that unbelievable was that sad

[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.680]
Here's Kettering Ohio. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir? I got a phone call at 10.30 this morning saying you were going to Q.A.M

[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.860]
And I jumped straight up out of bed. Yeah, and here you'd like to stay in bed. It's about 35 degrees out

[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.180]
Yeah, sure

[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.380]
Mm-hmm. So 85 here you have a no compete you can

You'll be on the air and you'll go straight over there. You won't I'll be back in two weeks

[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.920]
I'm not gonna get into a legal discussion of oh, you know

[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.880]
Which day it is that I'm leaving and which day I'll go on. I mean, uh, how do I know? I don't know

[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.860]
Well, I'll tell you what I was happy to hear it because when they get rid of Phil Henry

[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.300]
I told my dad. I said you'll be right behind me

[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.460]
He's not gonna stay there. They've jerking around so much

[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.800]
I mean the way that they've treated me here these last three months especially has been so grotto

[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.880]
Well the whole six months, but it's been like about the last five months since we came in the studio and nothing was working

[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.380]
And then the so-called renegotiation on their part. I mean, seriously

[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.880]
I'm not exaggerating these people need help. They need psychiatric help

[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.740]
They have no idea how to treat human beings. I don't want zero

[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:59.880]
Zipity doda. I don't know what they think that if they can passify you by taking you for a free meal once every six weeks

[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:05.580]
That that's gonna like they can you know kiss and make up and smooth everything over and they can apologize for how inept they are

[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.620]
I'm sorry that don't get the job done. I don't know what they paid for the station

[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:13.160]
But I think they just read 13 million they were they were given this radio station 13 million

[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.960]
Paxons got a house that's worth 12 million

[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.280]
They paid only 13 million for this station and the property over there on 79th Street

[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.920]
They were they were given the station

[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.820]
Well, I'll tell you what the stress they put you through I'm glad to hear you're going to QAM

[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.700]
And I'll call you in about another six months. I'll be back in two weeks. Okay pal. All right, Neil. I'm fine. Stay warm. Okay. All right

Any way you doing it great

[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.740]
You know at the panther game. There's a gentleman that sits by me and

[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.160]
I've noticed he's brought a couple of guys to the games that are obviously hockey players a couple weeks ago

[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.080]
He brought dominant cash when we played Buffalo. Yeah, I introduced myself to him and he said that he

[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.840]
He defected from I believe he said the Czech Republic and he was the goalie for

[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:13.380]
Toronto and from 79 to 83 and I forgot his name

[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.260]
He was the goalie for Toronto from 79 to 83. That's what he told me

[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.760]
And he defected from the Czech Republic. That's correct

[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.000]
And his last name was real short like a four letter

[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.520]
name

[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.420]
79 to 83

[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.340]
Peter in

[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.880]
That's the only short named goalie I can think of it might have been a check for the maple leaves

[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.040]
Peter in i and g

[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.160]
Ryan GE

[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.000]
It wasn't him. No sure wasn't well. I don't

[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.860]
Beats me maybe somebody else knows beats a lot of me. Okay. I just thought of check. Okay. We'll find out

[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.620]
Or not okay. There you go. All you elite fans out there all three of you

[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.020]
Peter eng that's the only name that seems could fit into me. He was uh who

[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:00.920]
Yuri Sura

[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.240]
Yuri Sura I never heard of Yuri Sura of course he back in that period of time

[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.980]
I was in I was in limbo because I was in Florida. That's before I got my satellite dish

[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.880]
Boy back in those days if you were a hockey fan down here

[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.180]
You might as well forget it because there was no you think the coverage is weak now

[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.240]
There was no coverage in those papers would have the scores

[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.820]
Maybe a sentencer to here in air and uh, and that was it

[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:27.600]
That was it nothing zippity doodah like we're talking about aliens from outer space

[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.820]
What was it again Yuri Sura?

[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.280]

Oh no it can't be it is oh they're back

[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.960]
We are you guys actually had the balls to come back to town. I didn't need to go on the air

[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.880]
I just wanted to let you know that indeed was Yuri Sura. Peter eng was a good guest though, wasn't it?

[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.540]
Yeah, Peter eng is a pretty good guest. Yeah, not right though. No

[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:56.880]
Kind of like some of the misinformation your partner has been passed out less is he on laughing gas now or what how you doing

[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.460]
What is he coming up with he i'm telling you yesterday

[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.420]
This man came up with names and with stories. I love the way he pronounced that Russian kids name

[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.840]
This the i'm not gonna get into it. Yes, I'm doing great. How are you?

[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.360]
Congratulations on what i'm shocked they come home and my wife tells me this exciting news. Yeah

[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.140]
Congratulations quid bull crap in rumor

[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.780]
I'm just congratulating you once a matter you're afraid Barry Jackson is gonna find out that you already knew is that it

[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.900]
What do you need Barry Jackson for what's he gonna do for you? Hey, I'm not getting involved in your

[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.880]
What's that little pudwacker gonna do for you? I'm not getting involved in your business. Yeah, okay. How are you great and

[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.720]
Pretty bad road trip rumor pardon me pretty bad road trip. Yeah, we struggled

[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.880]
I thought the team played better yesterday though

[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.760]
It all you thought they played better than what again spost and maybe huh?

[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.180]
Well, no, I thought they showed obviously a sense of urgency was a pretty good effort

[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.900]
And if you remember it was a good effort

[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:58.200]
Neil blow in the game with less than a minute to go who was covering Peter Bondra there at the end

[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.940]
Well, obviously you could have gone down there covered him with a blanket and done a better job

[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:08.140]
There was nobody within 15 feet of Peter Bondra the one guy we needed to be worried about the one guy and as soon as he got the pass

[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.080]
I'm saying oh no here it comes. I know it. I could smell it

[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.780]
Anyway, Mike Lang says to say hello. Yeah, we should do a hockey show this week. Yeah, let me keep threatening it

[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:24.660]
Yeah, all right. If you want to do it before the playoffs Mike great good idea. Let's get Mike on a year. We'll get a real broadcaster on there

[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.080]
Yeah, you okay and Mike yeah, yeah at any rate

[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.780]
I thought that yesterday's effort was much better way as Mike you've Paul coffees

[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.680]
Okay, I know that he remembers him from his Pittsburgh days the rumor is he keeps backing into things

[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.260]
Yeah, well Paul's out for seven to ten days and here you want to hear some real good news for rain

[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:47.980]
I hate to break the news to you but Paul coffee played yesterday. He did play. Yeah, okay

[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.460]
Well, see I didn't see the game obviously. We were playing at the same time

[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:56.160]
But coffee's got a bad back and I know it but he did play but there are two other first like Bondra wasn't supposed to play

[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.760]
And our bad luck he winds up playing and scoring the time goal well

[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.440]
Boy, see that kid is a great player and a dirty player too. He was my neighbor when I lived in Maryland

[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.160]
Yeah, he was telling me so but don't tell anybody

[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:13.340]
This is before the game yesterday don't tell anybody but I'm gonna try to play and we'll see what happens after the pregame warm up

[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:16.680]
But there are a couple of other serious injuries the teams right after contend with number one

[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.880]
Pittsburgh may have lost Ken reggae for the balance of the season really for the third time that hamstring

[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.180]
Problem has affected him maybe on his bad as the previous two

[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:30.000]
But more importantly for the New York Rangers mark Messier is having an MRI today

[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.480]
And the word is he might sit out the final three games of the regular season with great good. That's good news for us

[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.600]
Which means that the Rangers aren't as much concerned about finishing

[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:44.060]
Fourth as they are getting Messier healthy for the playoffs. Yeah, but a determination on his

[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.280]
Available would be made later on today as well

[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.560]
So it should be quite interesting here this final week of the season

[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.680]
We're in trouble. No, let me so let me ask you did struck a get re-ingered

[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.360]
Uh, no, he did not so how come he didn't play again yesterday? Well yesterday

[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.360]
How come he didn't play the last two games again yesterday the coach says matter of factly

[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.360]
I've got to go with my veteran players and

[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:10.700]
Obviously he went with the veterans and I thought as I said they played with that sense of urgency something you thought Kirk Muller played good yesterday

[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.340]
He played better than he has oh

[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.880]
Man, oh man, he played better than he has

[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:22.900]
Let me also I know some guys that have belts shorter than this guy's tongue. Let me also remind you now

[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.780]
Yeah, all right just so you don't

[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.600]
How about you Jeff high's belt is shorter than Jeff from his tongue?

[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.520]
Yes, just so you don't jump off the

[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:36.160]
The nearest bridge you remember last year you were saying what's the same thing the final week of the season not the big no not like this

[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.020]
I'm sorry not like this not like this different story

[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:44.360]
We haven't had the chemistry back for months. Okay. We haven't had the chemistry there for months and you can see it

[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.600]
You can smell it you can feel it. It's not there

[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.600]
But golden and Kirk Muller man gold tending's been fine gold tending is not our problem

[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.760]
The Kirk Muller has been the biggest disappointment. I've never seen anybody so useless so invisible

[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.220]
So absolutely

[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.640]
He gets great chances. He's one time yesterday. He shot at five feet wide

[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.700]
He had a big rebound there. He did have one good shot. There was a pretty good save by Kerry

[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.960]
I buy a randford and then the rebound. He shoots at five. He he whiffed on it

[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.320]
In his defense. He's not playing he probably shouldn't have been playing when he first got here. Yeah

[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:23.560]
He had the bad ankle and obviously he has struggled and he's one player the panthers have got to get going before

[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.640]
Yeah, well it's too bad. We didn't make that deal with the Leafs for a ducky Gilmore and Dave Elleth

[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.500]
That would have been a great deal

[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.820]
But you know these guys are the experts. They got all the answers. You know that while they tried to make the deal

[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.880]
As you know, yeah, couldn't do it. They didn't want to give up certain guys who by the way are playing real bad right now

[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.020]
I don't want to mention no names. All right. So a striker's not going to be playing anymore. Is that it?

[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.820]
That's not what I'm saying Chris Wells will be a near-strock. I'll be out

[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:49.840]
No, Doug Doug says that he feels for the first time this season the panthers have got some depth so when you say play veterans

[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.080]
You mean like Steve Washburn is he a veteran? No, but he's a centerman. Uh-huh

[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.960]
Who's got more experience? Straca or Steve Washburn? Who's played better? Who's played who's played better?

[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.800]
I'd say that well Straca hasn't played so how can he play better? He doesn't play anymore

[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.280]
Washburn had a big game yesterday

[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.380]
I thought when he first joined the hockey club that line was shepherd and devorak was pretty effective. Yeah

[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:14.000]
So but see you're all over the place again remember you first you say that all the veterans have got to play the coaches the veterans

[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.840]
Then you tell me that there's 20 year old kids got to play. I didn't say he's got to play

[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.140]
But he's one of the players that's in the mix right now

[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.160]
Well, he's never going to get Straca back into shape

[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.600]
And I still think you know, he doesn't like the little guys. He didn't like all the washburns

[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.040]
Not a very big guy, but he didn't like Stewie doesn't like Straca

[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.140]
He doesn't like the little guys out there and uh, what can I tell you?

[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.040]
Doug Yelmore ain't exactly gonna tower over anybody either, but he's kicking ass

[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.160]
Is it true? Can I ask one question? Yeah, is it true that

[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.580]
And I heard this second and third hand

[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:45.460]
But while we were gone you made the comment that Marty Straca was a better hockey player than Rob Needle-Mire

[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.020]
No, I did not say that at all

[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.420]
But you know something I believe that very positively yes

[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.600]
And he also was a plus nine Needle-Mire is like a plus one well

[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.640]
I defended you and said I can't believe Neil would say that

[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.840]
Needle-Mire plays about one out of every five or six games. He shows up

[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.200]
He got that great goal last week

[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.900]
It was a one one of it that was his claim to fame for the whole season was that incredible goal

[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.440]
Although Hatcher didn't have his stick at the time by the way

[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.020]
But nevertheless it was a great play and that was it and he makes a play like that about once every three or four weeks

[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.360]
And that's basically it he scored when the team struggling for goals here

[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.180]
He had two

[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:22.620]
Yeah, he's got twelve last time I checked he's got twelve and he's playing yeah, and he's playing every day

[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.540]
Okay, I don't think twelve goals is anything to write home if you're top if if a guy you consider to be your best center

[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:32.820]
Is only got twelve goals at this stage of the season with two games left after 80 games you got some real scoring problems

[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.060]
I'm not arguing with you

[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.040]
He has not had the kind of year and he'd be the first kid to tell you that he hasn't had the year that he wanted

[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.400]
Yeah, but it's all a clean slate when the playoffs

[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.300]
I'll tell you one thing

[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.540]
I know Marty Straca's a hell of a lot better hockey player than Chris Wells will ever be

[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.560]
I'll tell you that right now if you want to get into a debate about that. It's not a debate

[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.760]
I mean

[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.320]
Or I didn't need to go on the air was to do it. No, but you why then why did you they wanted you ask me the other question

[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.520]
Reman why did you ask me that about Straca need about how about Straca Chris Wells?

[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.900]
I wanted to make sure you and I were on the same wavelength we're not well

[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:07.060]
We are about my tongue just healed up how about yours pardon me. I said I'm just healing up

[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.940]
You're a beauty put that thing together Rimmer whenever you want it's a

[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:19.640]
Our congratulations will try for Thursday our place is your place. Bye. Bye. And the food is on us. All right or whoever brings it see you

[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.280]
Okay, there he goes

[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.440]
Okay, it's safe to call out two open lines and date

[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.820]
622 w. Y.O.D

[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.580]
Oh

[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.060]
Jeff Rimmer

[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:34.740]
The

[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:42.220]
The pucks must be flying because now the show is done. We just got

[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.760]
Rolling in now

[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.160]
Olden pullers are

[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:58.260]
Now get you notice Rimmer didn't tell a real story about the Straca being hung like a moose

[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.780]
Which is why the coach is yellow. So we'll not put them in the lineup anymore

[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:06.480]
He didn't tell that story on here just now, but I'll tell you we have two open lines in day at 622 9463

[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:13.060]
We got one open and Broward 767 9463. So anyway that name that he just confirmed that I never heard of that guy

[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.700]
I never heard of that guy and if he was the leaf starting goalie during those years then I really was out of the loop

[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.140]
I'll tell you that I never never heard his name in my life

[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.160]
1145 at W I O D

[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.120]

Let's get something really important going instead of these people try to compare apples with oranges like Robbie

[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.280]
Neatermire with Marty Straca who's this guy kidding huh? Is he kidding somebody?

[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.620]
Is he talking to some lemon out there that doesn't know what he sees with his own five eyes

[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.200]

a series of unfortunate accidents

[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:59.400]
Don't even go out of the coming back when I was little I was a skinny little punk

[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.780]
They wouldn't let me play basketball

[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.300]
The games used to push me around

[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.080]
Even the holes beat the crap out of me

[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.440]
But then I started drinking milk

[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.220]
And I kept on drinking

[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.020]
And I kept on drinking

[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.520]
And now I'm a 6 foot 5 inch

[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.240]
285 pound angry mother

[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:25.280]
And I'm gonna put some serious hurt on everybody whoever dissed me

[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:31.600]
You f*** with me you go home in a body bag because I'm a natural born milk drinker killer

[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.940]
Milk it does a body good

[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.380]
It'll kill you man all that milk and milk products all that dairy

[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.560]
It'll put you right in the grave you'll be coughing a big big juicy ones

[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.820]
It's 1151 a w-i-o-d. Here's curl springs. Hello. Hello there Neil. Yes, sir

[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.500]
What you were talking about this morning is the perfect dismantling of a station

[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:03.580]
And it's I think it's a part of the reason it should the iFCC should look back at the ruling when they allow people to own multiple stations in the same market

[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.580]
Right, I mean, it's just unbelievable crazy

[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:09.960]
I said it at the time and I'll say it again now. I'm not saying anything different than what I said when the ruling came down

[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:17.260]
The worst thing that ever happened in the industry for the public for the people that work in the business the absolute worst possible thing they could have ever done

[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:22.380]
Do you think maybe Ronnie D knew what this packs and character was about probably probably?

[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.540]
Oh, that's another thing I left out when I was talking about the changes that have taken place

[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.260]
Ronnie D walks out and instead of the Ron and Ron show they got the Ron and Bill show

[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.820]
Which I'm not gonna know as guys, but there's another thing

[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:39.500]
It seems like since they bought this station everything they touched has turned to you know, I'm saying absolutely everything they've touched

[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.500]
Now he's gonna sure touched me. I'll tell you he's gonna go after and try to sanitize rick and suds now

[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.540]
What's the sanitize?

[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.080]
What do you mean by that? Well, I mean there's some of the shows. I'm sure he's not a

[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.040]
Being this Christian lover. He's not all thrilled when they talk about dope and marijuana and all this sort of stuff all the time

[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.320]
Yeah, so I mean he'll go after them next just like you know try to

[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:02.400]
The

[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.160]
Are you telling me the good Catholics don't smoke dope if it's good enough for the Pope?

[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.180]
Well the Pope spoke soap. We don't know. Well. It's good enough for him

[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.720]
But buddy bud's gonna reinvent the whole wheel

[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.800]
Well, you know something that's a his problem. He may try to reinvent the wheel

[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.780]
I'm not the he's small potatoes to me. He may have all the money in the world

[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.740]
Like I've said many times before just because somebody's got a lot of money

[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.440]
Doesn't make them smart and also doesn't make them the kind of people that you want to work for

[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:29.020]
And he is not the kind of person that I want to work for believe me when I tell you and I kiss the ground

[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:35.040]
I came so close you have no idea how close I came because they just wore down my resistance with aggravation

[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.660]
I came within a Harris breath of signing wave the next five years of my life to these bastards

[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.620]
And if I would have done that had it been better off to put a bullet to my head

[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.920]
I'm glad you had this stamina and the foresight to realize it amen. I listen here. I don't know one thing

[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.660]
Something totally different. I was watching the other night the

[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.620]
Miami tonight show. Yeah, I couldn't sleep so I flipped the TV on that's a good reason

[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.580]
He's got a holy reset. He's got a whole new set now. Yeah

[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:03.360]
They've got a couch and a couple of chairs, you know chairs and a desk and everything unlike when you were on

[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:07.060]
Well, now I'm using the shrink to go with it. Well, he's got done Cox like the Ed McMahon

[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.520]
Yeah, does announcing on the microphone and then sits with him on the couch and then he's amusing

[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.340]
No, that but that's nothing new that's they used to do that now they're referring to their origins again

[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:19.620]
Unless maybe this was an old show that I hadn't seen and I was in a one and new one

[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:25.420]
But it's a I mean you're right about this shrink on there question when you down the yet when you go down the dialer

[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.060]
You're gonna be able to talk about Baldi

[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:32.380]
Oh, yes, good. I'm just this show is not going to be any different except it'll be better because I'll be

[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.580]
I'll be able to do a show good. Did you see what the stock is doing?

[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.260]
Could I I don't know no, I did not hopefully don't don't depress me on Monday, please

[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:44.880]
You know at one point on Friday it was down to 27 and 8th yes, I saw it then finally had made a comeback

[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.440]
And got back up to even for the day 28 and a quarter whatever

[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:54.660]
But uh 20 860 it finished oh my god. This uh this thing is killing me. Are you gonna be at the shareholders meeting on the 11th?

[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.640]
I'll be there. I'll be jumping up and down on the table

[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.180]
At the right day pal. Okay. Oh, look at that. We're down to two calls now

[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:05.260]
We made it almost two hours today with a show on a Monday, which is pretty good for you bastards

[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:10.300]
But I don't think we're gonna make it till two no chance two open lines and date all over mergers called little while ago

[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.420]
We were cooking until that point you notice that once again

[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.740]
once again with that kaka

[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.280]
Oh my god and if you know Thursday

[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.880]
I mean we haven't done a hockey show in months since before the season started back in September

[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.260]
I think so I've been looking forward to that to finally the day he would butcher up and come in here

[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.480]
We get some you know Mike Lang on a year and Sherry and some of our usual people

[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.140]
But I'm gonna tell you something if I'm not gonna spend one minute of this show on Thursday

[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.940]
Doing what he got me to do and they're gonna. I'm not gonna argue all of his stepchildren

[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.980]
How great they are because I know how they I know how jovon oskies playing

[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:46.440]
I know how neat I'm Irish plan nobody's gonna pedal me this corporate bull crap. Okay. I got enough

[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:50.280]
corporate bull crap from the Paxon people the last six months. I don't need

[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.100]
Panther corporate bull crap. I see how these guys are playing

[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.620]
Anyway, and this vendetta. I want to apologize personally to Marty straka the worst thing I ever did on the year ever

[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:08.440]
Was say that I thought he was a good player and that I liked him as soon as I said that the curse the hex went

[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:15.040]
Was payback Neil thinks straka is good. He likes him good. We won't we'll screw him over real good to get even for all this stuff

[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.220]
That he's talking about the Chris Wells deal in stew barns and Jason Woolie even if it happens to be true

[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:23.540]
Okay, Stewie's a minus 22 you feel better, but he does have 50 points. Oh, sorry

[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.760]
We have an open line indeed six two two we got a parent-broward seven six seven like I said

[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.120]
This is a market don't ever tell the truth don't ever really give you your opinion

[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.660]
Just kiss a lot of ass here man

[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.340]
Don't ever give you a real opinion to tell people what's really going on because they can't stand it

[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.880]
They can't deal with it. They can't cope with it

[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.620]
It's enough to make them want to go out and buy a necklace

[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:45.800]
Please

[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:55.460]
Here's a pember pine. Hello, hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay? I don't know what you want to talk about baseball a lot of people don't even know what an RBI is versus an MRI

[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.540]
But anyhow, they know an MRI

[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.560]
What I wanted to actually discuss with you. I wish you well on your new ventures

[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:09.440]
I know there's a couple of months away from it. You are I hope they treat you better than they did to me this past Friday on your actual last day

[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:17.380]
What it happened to me was I was working in a department with two rookies and since there was two other veterans and only three computers

[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.960]
You know was perfect for me in the true rookies however my last day

[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.080]
They told me you know what we really don't need you will pay you through the week

[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.360]
But we really don't need you because we're gonna bring somebody else in and at the same time

[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.660]
Free up your PC is and then by the end of veterans will be back. Yeah

[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:36.360]
I just hope they didn't do anything like that to you. You mean the Paxing people exactly

[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:41.600]
Hey, is they want it like I said if they want to bring me a check and pay me for the next six months through September 30th

[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.860]
Which is what it's all about hey? I'll kiss the ground

[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.900]
What's wrong with that?

[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.940]
I'm getting paid for the week so what's the problem?

[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.120]
Well the only thing is I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to anybody. It just came unexpectedly

[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.980]
Yeah, you know, so I just so which would you rather have the the pay for not working or saying goodbye

[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.200]
Well, call him up at home and there you go call him up at home and tell him goodbye

[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.640]
Come your sentiment saw Salami sandwich

[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:10.900]
I certainly will okay, I wish you the best deal. Thanks. All right good luck to us

[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:16.020]
Two open lines and Broward 7679 463 767 W I O D

[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.380]
1157 yeah, this should be the worst problem the worst dilemma of my life

[00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.480]
You know like I said I plan to come in here every day just doing the show

[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.340]
Just doing a show every day for the next several months because when you come right down to it

[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:33.120]
What differences are making this town whether you do in a show over here whether you're doing a show down there

[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.520]
Whether you don't show anywhere you're doing a show

[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:43.100]
The only difference being whether people are treating you civilized and like a human being or whether they're tearing your guts out your kishkis out

[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.220]
And the bottom line got to be that I don't have any kishkis left to tear out they they stripped them all away

[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:55.580]
They're selling tripe by the ounce right outside the front door there when in doubt go out and buy some

[00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.640]
Wanted I wanted it?

[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.800]
1158 at W I O D

[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.900]
I also wanted to get rid of my bank a few months ago and I went on the year

[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:07.940]
We went nuts for days on end about banks and how they make mistakes with your money and how they screw you over

[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.440]
And how they try to like point the finger at you and they just don't want to give you good service because too many of these banks

[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.440]
That's like the radio business

[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.180]
There's a handful of big

[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.660]
Corporations that own the overwhelming majority of the banks and so you're just small potatoes

[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.800]
Even if you put a pretty good amount of money through they're like I do they don't care

[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.120]
They just don't give a crap and so they don't give you any kind of service

[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.500]
That's why I fired my bank and went to family bank one of the smartest things I've ever done in my life

[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.520]
They treat you great

[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.080]
They're happy to see you whatever you need they take care of you no cross examination

[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.360]
No third degree no finger pointing no a big mistakes every five minutes you turn around

[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:46.180]
They've got the lower service fee in Broward County if you want to get a loan you talk to somebody right here in town

[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.440]
The loan office is in a thousand miles away in Charlotte or Atlanta somewhere

[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.480]
They've got all the convenient things of any big bank

[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.860]
They got ATMs at all their locations like Sirus and Presto they even honor honor

[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.600]
How do you like that?

[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.020]
They've got seven convenient locations all over Broward and they'll take great personal care of you

[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:07.940]
You'll be you'll be in heaven when you take your cash to family bank like I did family bank member FDIC

[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:13.380]

She didn't want no money

[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.900]
She thinks that I'm a son that I'm a dad

[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:24.940]
I'm dad

[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.940]
Can you rub it in a hand?

[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.140]
And I'm so glad

Can you rub it in a hand?

[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.540]
Just say no bad

[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:33.620]
I'm glad

[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:35.900]
Can you rub it in a hand?

[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.100]
And the whole world's gonna wander up

[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.480]
Now was a kid look like a step too bad

[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.500]
I wanted it

[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.980]
Cove 04 at WIOD happy Monday

[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.820]
It's a great day for the Irish to Chinese

[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.400]
The Yiddish everybody else we're having a whale of a day man

[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.600]
We have an open line and Broward has in two of them

[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.380]
767-9463

[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.940]
767-WIOD we got an open pair down the

[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.200]
Out of town lines the Palm Beach lines

So that launch that was going to be here around 11-30 this morning

[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:06.360]
That was outstanding

[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.360]
Did you enjoy it George?

[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.060]
From wherever we are not really sure

[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.400]
Wherever Kim was telling us about that

[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.000]
They were gonna have a nice Philly Mignon here 11-30 this morning

[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.060]
It was sensational

[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.740]
It went down like Gafilta fish

[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.980]
Smooth as can be

[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.640]
I heard Brooke talking the other day about

[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.900]
Now she doesn't have to eat Gafilta fish now that she's not officially

[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.200]
She's not from enough to be a real Jew anymore

[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.160]
According to these orthodox lunatics out there

[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.420]
The rest of us we're not real Jews

[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.700]
Because we're not orthodox enough

[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.400]
We're not far-bison like they are

[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.580]
So we don't have to eat Gafilta fish and all that gelled stuff

[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.340]
That's in the jar

[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.800]
Which I think she's I do like Gafilta fish

[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.340]
But the gel I could move without

[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.720]
Whatever it is

[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.680]
I think it's mung

[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.620]
I think that's officially mung

[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.620]
Whatever's around the Gafilta fish in that jar

[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.280]
To keep it from like spurling

[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.020]
Here's Miami

[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:52.800]
Hello

[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.480]
Hello

[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.420]
Yes sir

[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:58.000]
Hey keep the root man off your show when you move down the dial

[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.240]
Keep it the kneel show

[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:01.700]
Yeah

[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.680]
Not the kneel in jail

[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.400]
I work alone

[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.180]
Uh

[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.500]
Get uh got home from work Saturday

[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.000]
Yeah

[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.180]
I listen to the best stuff

[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.500]
We're talking about the pen pen

[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.860]
I pick up the herald

[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.840]
Right on the front page of the local section

[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.600]
Society paper

[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.340]
Board of Medicine to crack down on pen pen diatils

[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:17.580]
Oh

[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.320]
All right

[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.760]
Long overdue

[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.380]
Big story about people just walking with 300 bucks

[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.740]
And walk out with the pen pen

[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:24.040]
Right

[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.800]
There's all these people that are like maybe three pounds overweight

[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.320]
Or ten pounds underweight

[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.560]
And a lot of these uh places are just

[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.500]
And they just got a pill clinic going again

[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.380]
Just like back in the 60s and 70s

[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.080]
Just a scam

[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:35.540]
Right

[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.440]
Have a good one

[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:36.960]
Thanks

[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:37.600]
Catch you later

[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:37.980]
Okay

[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.960]
How do you like that?

[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.260]
Oh and i don't know whether i should tell a story

[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:43.780]
Did are you familiar with this

[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:47.300]
That somebody wanted me to advertise their clinic on the year

[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:48.500]
Yes

[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.900]
Like my mind totally put it out

[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:51.940]
Because it's his David

[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.740]
It was on the most astonishing

[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.860]
Like after the fact

[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.080]
After all this crap went down

[00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.400]
We're talking crazy people

[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.960]
I mean we're talking people that just don't get it

[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.040]
Don't get it

[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.360]
The word credibility evidently

[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.380]
Just the in the vocabulary they're somewhere

[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.420]
I'm going to go on to your in pedal pen pen

[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.340]

[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.880]

[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.400]
Hello

[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.300]
Hey Neil

[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:25.900]
Yes sir

[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.840]
Yeah i was listening to when you had the

[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.940]
Italian cold cut spread from Lorenzo's last Friday

[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:31.220]
Yeah

[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.500]
And you're the only one i've ever heard called capacola

[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.180]
Gava ghoul

[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.060]
You said gava ghoul

[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.220]
No, Guido say that

[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:39.100]
Guido's right at

[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:39.580]
Capacola

[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.320]
So that's exact because my mother's you know Italian-Americans

[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:43.660]
Yeah

[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.160]
That's what she called it was gava ghoul

[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:45.980]
That's how i grew up

[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:46.340]
No

[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.260]
I don't know if that's thing is gava ghoul

[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:52.580]
Maybe maybe like Sicilian's or maybe in Naples the Schlepper's here

[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.980]
Yeah that's where my mother's a friend that's in the politin

[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.760]
Oh in the politin

[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.560]
George the politin

[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.480]
Oh he says that yeah

[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:56.960]
Junior

[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.360]
Because you're the first

[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:58.900]
Capacola

[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.260]
I've ever heard say that

[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.540]
By the way you know it's interesting

[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.200]
Because after a tagging class on Saturday

[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.420]
We stopped at Lorenzo's

[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:07.020]
And got a whole bunch of that Columbus cold cuts

[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.020]
If i could tell you how good that stuff is

[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:09.600]
I'm serious

[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.440]
It is unbelievable

[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.380]
I'm gonna lick on my chops

[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.540]
You know the day when i'm in there

[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.580]
Man was that good stuff

[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:14.900]
Unreal

[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.360]
In fact the best

[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.140]
I mean the uh the salami and everything on the turkey is great

[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.800]
But the the roast beef is so great

[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.300]
I can't i can't put it in the world

[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.140]
I think I got the best meat and town up there

[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.440]
There's no doubt about that

[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.500]
But this is a whole new line

[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.420]
It's called Columbus

[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.880]
Cold cuts and it's out of this world

[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.420]
I went and saw uh Donnie Brasco this weekend

[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.160]
And I think it's worth it's worth it's worth a visit

[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.100]
It was pretty good

[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:36.440]
Yeah

[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.420]
Pacino was good the kid uh what's his name

[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:40.600]
I forget his name

[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.200]
Johnny Depp

[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:41.900]
Johnny Depp

[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:42.880]
It was all right

[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.340]
It was you know

[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:43.920]
It was just

[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.060]
I don't think it was good as uh good fellas

[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.200]
Which was it was the same much

[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.260]
But it's worth seeing

[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.000]
Okay

[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:50.840]

Uh this year at least since last november it's just not there

[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.780]
Nearly the fact that they outspot

[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:39.160]
Traditionally opponents yeah and unfortunately i don't know what rimmer and pot van were seeing in that first period last night where they were

[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:42.180]
You know spreading hosanas, you know the way of the panthers

[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:45.600]
Well, do you just hear him on here a few minutes ago tell me what a great player robby need him

[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.640]
I raise and how dare i compare Marty stracco with robby need him i

[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.180]
Well, you know something i would agree with that i don't think there is any comparison

[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:57.940]
I want to ask dracos out there on a ice there's exciting things happening skates every time he plays many plays with

[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:01.820]
Intensity he's got tremendous speed he makes things happening since obscuring chances

[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.340]
Needle-mar half of the time robby's out there for us skate and figure eights

[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:09.360]
Well, I i definitely he's lost like he needs a compass in a road map

[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.940]
Well, that's that's probably what i was alluding to right in the beginning here

[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:18.400]
The fact that you'll see uh scrum in the corner and there's need a myreligently playing his position

[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:25.440]
But last year they would have gone after that to make sure even if it's a two on one advantage in the corner

[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.820]
That they come out with the puck and then somebody's heading for the net

[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:31.560]
And that's just not happening this year there's you know

[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.580]
So we might reach the puck behind the opponents goal first

[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:40.760]
And then we're waiting for somebody to be in front of the net and mustling in there and these guys are skating as you say figure out

[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.980]
The chemistry is gone. They don't they don't seem to have their act together like in the in the last minute of the game yesterday

[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:52.380]
Of all the guys in the world you're going to make sure somebody somebody is on peter bondra like glue on crap

[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:56.480]
You know what i'm saying and the one guy you don't want to leave open and meantime you looking there's melon

[00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:03.060]
Be skating around in circles and carcass and sphela we don't know who the hell they're and here's this guy all alone all alone

[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:08.560]
What are the outstanding players in the game a sniper and butta bingy ties it up and we blow it again in the last minute of play

[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.600]
And you just have to wonder what are they thinking about i don't know what's happened to sphela since the all-star break

[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.880]
He's been caught out of position

[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.040]
um team million times

[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:23.960]
Right now the player i respect most on that team and unfortunately not spectacular so that doesn't

[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.460]
Endear them to the local from anything he's that lorry a warner a warner is great

[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:33.480]
I mean the kid is fantastic if they ever want to talk about untouchable from that team

[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:38.040]
You know forget the need of myers forget the blowjows or whoever else is out there

[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:38.580]
You know

[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.160]
Let's go with warner is untouchable and built from there

[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:46.920]
Well, i'm going to tell you right now that if stew barns were still on his team that if i were the coach over this past

[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.660]
Weekend stew barns and marty straka would have been to the starting centers and i don't care

[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:56.080]
How big or small either one of them are and i don't care how dirty and physical washing in is the fact is that

[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:59.640]
Those two guys would have been out there doing a job and crook muller and

[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:04.320]
And the Steve washburn would have been sitting on the bench. I mean washburn's gonna be a good player

[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.500]
He's not a veteran. He's not ready for prime time yet and i'm just not buying it

[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.320]
There's just heaven grip rat

[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:16.280]
And the idea that Chris Wells is ever cracking line up at this stage of the game now that we got all the healthy guys back

[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:20.520]
Is unacceptable to me unacceptable? Well if any team has

[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:21.480]
shown

[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.800]
The deficit that that i was referring to earlier. It's Washington

[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.640]
They have out hustled us in the last three games and they've deserved it washing

[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.240]
Washington stinks. They do

[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.020]
Washington

[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.720]
And that's that's the problem in the last three games we played with them. Yeah, that's what i mean

[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.400]
No, it's the week but every time they've come back to either tie it or win it yeah

[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.340]
And i don't know what what the hell is happen

[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:51.660]
I don't buy the excuse that we played in Boston the day before and then let me tell you also there are a crap team

[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:55.780]
Washington is a really dirty yes, but there are crap team. They've been struggling

[00:54:55.780 --> 00:55:01.660]
They're they're not gonna make the playoffs and for us to wind up walk out of there with the tia yesterday was really deflating

[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:07.480]
Not as deflating as losing in Boston the day before losing in Toronto two days before that have a great day pal

[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:13.320]
Okay, we have an open line in date six two two nine four six three two open lines in browards

[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:17.760]
seven six seven nine four six three. They're all the experts out there. It's the same old song

[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:24.200]
It's the old i'm not talking about the caller. I'm talking about the the the staff man the staff and their mouthpieces

[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.960]
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop same old stories

[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.860]
500 years from now they'll be peddling the same bull crap. Okay, they'll be selling it by the pound become a millionaires

[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:38.280]

Yeah, all right, but but before I do I have to get one question

[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:09.580]
Go ahead and I have one of those don't nice all our writers were once in prison here on crabital television

[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:14.640]
Oh, man, I wanted it truck 20 at w-i-o-d happy Monday from all your good pizons over here

[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:30.540]
767-9463 767 w-i-o-d

[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:36.620]
Here's Miami. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, do you want to do two things number one on you say that the chemistry of this

[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.000]
Team um for instance the Panthers was broken up on the trade happening

[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:46.100]
Let me take a little bit further back than that in the year that jernathi came in who the hell takes the defense man number one

[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:51.500]
I mean meanwhile the guy was I guess rusted number two which was um the step from Ottawa score and goes like left and right

[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.520]
I mean, that's just that's just something I couldn't believe I remember to bahaki but um

[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.700]
I think that I was just a turning point if you will

[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:04.140]
You know, maybe you was you was good yesterday and they can call him Joe. I mean nicely last year

[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:08.860]
But um, I think that's that that was some part of the problem. He's taking the joint out. He's killing us

[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:12.720]
He's killing us. He's playing horrible. Mm-hmm. And also um

[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:18.340]
Number two, I'm trying to recommend a movie to you. So this weekend is called sleepers. Yeah, I don't know if you're seeing it

[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.480]
But you're having to remove the sea. Okay. All right. Have a good day. Thanks

[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:25.600]
See ya to open lines and date 6229 463

[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.740]
Eddie Eddie don't confuse these sort of these people want to yell what they want to yell

[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:30.980]
loser

[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.420]
Poop out. Yeah, but poop a pace replace for Tampa. We're playing New Jersey

[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:40.180]
Poop out while they know how to say that I mean brodure don't rhyme with the loser plus he's only got 85 shutouts in a row

[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:46.660]
And his number one in the league and maybe in the world. Dodd cherries says right now martin brodure is the best gold tender in the world and who might argue with him

[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:55.160]
Here's a poppin. Oh, hello. Hey, Nail. Yes, sir. Got one of those water systems that you're talking about earlier. Yeah, excellent

[00:59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.620]
I wanted to tell you that to start out. Thank God. Yeah, it's even great in the shower

[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:06.360]
Oh, I'm in the water too. Yeah, I was listening to a man did yesterday. Yes, he did mention something about you

[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:12.560]
That I thought was kind of odd. He said that you were like a top show host, but a sports host wannabe

[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:16.340]
I don't understand sports host wannabe

[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:22.080]
He said he goes well Nail does a show, but he's really a sports host wannabe. Yeah

[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:30.840]
Wrong. I told him why didn't I don't want to be a sports host if all I talked about was sports. I'd blow my brains out

[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.620]
Right boring. I'm firmly on that Marlon bandwagon

[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:38.480]
See there you go with sports again, right? Uh-huh. I don't want to turn it into a sports

[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:45.100]
Yeah, but I think you're a Marlon fan wannabe if you ask me I couldn't cook yeah, right? Right

[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:48.420]
I couldn't call him and ask him about baseball because he he only does

[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:51.960]
He only does football right he's already he's already doing the draft stuff

[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.140]
Are you notice that I heard him the other day was taught

[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:59.220]
He was promoting the big draft show coming up. Yeah, he came on yesterday and he started talking about the pan

[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:04.900]
I was switching between the panthers and the Marlins and we're gonna have some guru from the lions on the talk about the draft

[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.440]
He had this guy come on I never even heard of that oh

[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.060]
I did hear that we were coming back from the emerald coast and he was uh

[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:17.560]
He was thinking Ken Maldon for waiting with the sports update for um because he had this long drawn out thing

[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.980]
You wanted to do with the lions guy heard that and then he said something of the guy about they lost blades

[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.120]
Detroit lost blades and now they're gonna have to replace them and

[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.580]
That I guess he went to Seattle brother. Yeah

[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.680]
It's kind of fit in what you played

[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:39.480]
I don't have a clue I'll straighten them out. You're gonna get out to the old ballpark this year

[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.360]
Yes, I am as a matter of fact the price is right. We got free tickets waiting for us. Why the hell not?

[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.980]
Yeah, I went the other night. They got a pretty good team so far. Let's see if they can

[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.200]
abstain let's see if they can keep winning every day for us otherwise this groom

[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.500]
All right now, okay pal

[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.200]
So yeah, that's the way we look at it. We don't want to be too pushy, but unless you win every day

[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.540]
We got other things to do okay. We don't know what they are, but we'll figure it out. We'll go to emerald coast every night

[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:07.020]
Because quite frankly, I mean if you win every day and if it's exciting see this problem with baseball and another thing

[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.820]
Man some of these games in this first week of the season have been going on so

[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:16.040]
Long what game was it I was watching yesterday. We watched a little bit of the um

[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:20.120]
Was it the white socks who the hell were the white socks playing yesterday, George?

[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:27.480]
Ha ha ha ha ha like he would know huh he couldn't give a he wouldn't know a white sock if his wife put it on the bed

[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:34.780]
Let's see the white socks were playing uh whoever the hell Detroit was it now. I wasn't that game whatever the hell game

[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:41.480]
It was the umpire gets into a bit. Yeah, it was the white socks because it was uh what's his name? Ozzy Geon

[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.400]
And he's arguing of whether this is on Saturday

[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.680]
I guess he's arguing with a plate umpire about where he's standing in a batter's box

[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.320]
That's right because that's a game Detroit one like 15 to 13

[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.360]
Which is the only way they can win if they score least 15 because they got no pitching

[01:02:54.700 --> 01:03:02.260]
And this argument this discussion and argument went on and on and on and again was already like three and a half hours old

[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.440]
See this is the problem with baseball and then then the pitcher decided that he you know

[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.660]
He had something deep inside of his crotch and we know what it wasn't and uh

[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:17.700]
It just it goes on and on the delays are interminable

[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:23.660]
Speed up the game man. That's one of the reasons it is so ponderous and so monotonous and so boring

[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:29.720]
Even though you're enchanted because we've won every game except one but nevertheless it is ponderous too stinking long

[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.020]
Here's a mobile and curl springs hello

[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:13.400]
Different faces all the time. I would like to see Neil Rogers on channel seven

[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.560]
What are fruitcake? We have an open line in there. Who is that?

[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:32.140]
Oh, that was Brian Andrews boyfriend. Good God. Boychup a little bit. Well, will you have for crying out loud? Hey boy

[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:38.980]
What's that in your mouth? Two open lines and broard seven six seven nine four or was that bill come all seven six seven nine four six three

[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:46.420]
Embarrassing okay. I was turned into a sports show today. Oh my god. Yeah, but don't you like those hot young guys and jog straps now?

[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:49.720]
You're talking pal now we all of a sudden got real interested in a hurry

[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.100]
He can smell that leather a million miles away

[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:59.220]
Anyway, oh, I'm telling him just why am I so worked up here today? Let's relax its Monday

[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:04.240]
Just sit back in the chair that the great lunch that was coming 1130. How was it? By the way?

[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.740]
Hmm. I didn't want lunch anyway. Why did she do that? I mean

[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:12.200]
I know she was doing it as a gesture to be nice and also where is that disc I was supposed to have now

[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.620]
I'm sounded like Casey Casey Kissum

[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.760]
Where the hell is that disc I was supposed to have like two hours ago?

[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:23.080]
Which what are they doing getting those spots over there? See this again goes back to the way that everything goes on here

[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.500]
So slow and so ponderous

[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:34.100]
There's a few spots on one of those discs that they need to get off of there could have been done in five minutes by by a blind man could have done in five minutes, okay

[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:41.340]
Mike bohan could have done that in five minutes easy put it on the tape somewhere and brought me the disc back

[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.800]
I asked for it like two and a half hours ago. I still don't have it

[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.480]
Do you have it?

[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:54.460]
They're hatching it back there in in traffic back there or in continuity whatever the hell they're doing it. They're playing in traffic with it

[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:03.360]
But the lunch man, that's which we didn't want in the first place that's coming because somebody wants a free plug and guess what it ain't here

[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:08.420]
610 W-I-O-D is all in your head, okay

[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:11.860]
1232 here's a very educational facts by the way

[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:17.480]
Which I'll use the last half of the facts first it says last night. I watched the program on Discovery Channel about elephants

[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:21.620]
They said on an average day an elephant expels enough methane gas

[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.020]
To drive a car 20 miles

[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:30.380]
So if you want to save on gas, I just get a long hose and hook it up to Jeff highs. Beckham would be a good way to start

[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.940]
Talk about a great hose job. Beckham. There you go

[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:42.780]
But anyway the facts in the first part says which is why I saved the first part for last because I didn't realize the other stuff was on air

[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:46.340]
Which was pretty interesting pretty entertaining about elephant farts, huh

[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:50.220]
Anybody out there ever cut an elephant fart eyes your have

[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:50.920]
Whoo

[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:54.860]
Elephant teen baby shaking rocking the world

[01:07:55.820 --> 01:08:00.380]
It says I called on Friday to request Courtney loved a Shakespeare you tried but you couldn't get to it

[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.420]
Could you please squeeze it in and the car today too?

[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:08.580]
Did I say we weren't too request today? She gained a claim with her breakout performance in the people versus Larry Flint now

[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.620]
Courtney loved takes the theater by storm

[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:17.880]
Appearing in the classics at the Seattle Reptory Playhouse see her riveting performance is lady Mcbeth in the Scottish play

[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.700]
Is this the mother

[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:24.040]
Jagger I see before me as blanche Dubois in a street car named desire

[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.400]
I've always relied on the kindness of strangers

[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:33.860]
And of course st. John by George Bernard Shaw get that towards away from me mother

[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:40.600]
Suck in bastards. Yes, Courtney loved plays the classics this spring at the Seattle Reptory Playhouse. Yeah

[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.960]
Yeah, yeah, get out of my face. What are your tickets today?

[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.300]
Here is the Virginia Bay hello

[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:15.440]
I mean key did I say bae? What is it? Don't be lighting them elephant parts. Yeah

[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:22.620]
Uh, there news flash news flash the not so virgin Mary is shown up again. Yeah in sunny day or Washington

[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:27.120]
Good place on the back of a highway adoption sign. All right

[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.820]
Oh, they showed the pictures of it looks like you know when you when you say a little bit of oil on something you get that rainbow ring

[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:37.340]
Uh-huh, these people are saying it's the rainbow and the virgin Mary's got a rainbow ring, huh? Right

[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:41.200]
What does that tell you sounds like a dike thing to me? I don't know if it's metal or not

[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:47.160]
But uh, but they they there are people for for seeing the virgin Mary after that in the different intersections around

[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.840]
Everybody explains why she was a virgin

[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.260]
And with a cop saying anything is possible things of course

[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.180]
So anyway, she's hitting the high spots man

[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.400]
Clearwater, Florida, and where was it sunny uh sunny sunny day. Oh sunny day. I'll wash it in there you go

[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:03.700]
It's right

So anyway, uh virgin Mary moves mysterious ways and I bet she's out there lighting that elephant park as we speak

[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:13.460]
Thanks for the good news. Okay, bless you my child. We have two open lines in date

[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.800]
Here's four-letter day on a mobile hello. Hello Neil. Yes, sir about the QAM thing

[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.400]
I think it's funny that different so long the event wanted to be wiod

[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:39.880]
Yeah, and now they're slowly become iod by absorbing everyone has left you how do you like that?

[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:44.020]
I mean if you they got the dolphins they got default they got managed they got bull campers

[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:49.440]
They're gonna have me and you're right. I mean that they've become wiod except they don't have the initial

[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.880]
But I mean they are what wiod used to be now. Yeah, and before you know, I would have a radio station

[01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:00.340]
Yeah, I would never listen to them, but if you go I will yeah, and do they do the Panther game? Yes, they do

[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:05.280]
Is there any chance that you know like you might do some color commentary? I doubt it. Oh really

[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.440]
Because I used to listen to you do the baseball games for you. I'm yeah

[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.740]
Even though I'm not a baseball fan, but I enjoyed listening to you do the commentary

[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:17.720]
Yep, that's in the past bell when I wanted to work you know 15 hours a day 20 hours a week

[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.520]
You know what if you want hours of this every day is enough for me. I like to go as a spectator

[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.760]
No sports want to be leave Chris and and Randy to their own resources

[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:32.100]
Also, I missed you at the beginning of the show today. Did you do anything about the big non-event of Ellen the generous coming out?

[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:35.580]
No, I did not. What is there to say about it? It's like you said. It's a non-event

[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:41.000]
I mean she finally actually opened the door and was that a surprise that would be like Rex Reed coming out of the closet

[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.780]
Is that a shock to anybody that Ellen de generous is a bulldike like anybody doesn't know that well some people

[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.280]
It just because Charles Nelson Rides going to come out on Hollywood squares next week

[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:54.920]
You know what's the big deal other than the show is not a year anymore, but other than that

[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.600]
Well, you you'd be surprised how many people that goes over their head because when I mentioned the two and before the announcement

[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.860]
I said no it is if anybody didn't know so many people looked at me like what are you talking about?

[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.640]
Yeah, next thing they'll be telling yourself many of us Jewish

[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:11.240]
But you know it you I think were you telling what you think I think it's gonna be the kiss of death for her show

[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:16.480]
Why I think it's an important thing for her to do, but I don't think that the mainstream is gonna accept it

[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.880]
They couldn't care less. There's a million show. Why is this so revolutionary?

[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:26.560]
There's a zillion shows on for last 10 years now that it got gay characters in them. How about Melrose plays to that?

[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:27.380]
She'll go off the year

[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:33.640]
The lead actor come out and say he was here

[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:37.880]
The police okay the people in the major markets where the ratings are really important

[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.440]
They're not shocked that they find out somebody's a fact especially in her case

[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:47.500]
Well as if it's a big surprise right have a great day pal see you down the dial no can't butchup

[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:52.960]
We have two open lines and dates. Yeah, it's a shock to me that Ellen D. Generate that she's a bull-dike wow

[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.400]
Could have fooled a hell under me just like when Martina came out man. What a shocker that was

[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:01.000]
And Billie Jean Queen when she finally said well

[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:06.180]
Canis must macho me or Janet Reno and we thought about it for while still haven't come up with an answer

[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.740]
We have an open line of dates six two two w i o d

[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:16.800]
Ellen in addition, which the show blows anyway who cares about Ellen who gives a crap about that stupid show

[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.560]
God

[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:25.200]
Here's this country man these people are so far in the stone age. They just don't get it. Oh, there's a dyke

[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.140]
Yeah, there's a dyke. Oh, okay. It's a dyke and there's a faggot and here's a drag queen

[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:33.340]
Grow up already come into the real world get a life

[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:42.660]
Get a real life and you wonder why they're huckin and trying to quit this thing with the tobacco and the cigarettes and everybody's so uptight about who's gonna smoke and

[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:47.000]
Oh, they're all suing each other because that's all americans about it's a bunch of crazy lawyers

[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.940]
Suing each other and uptight nervous people who are in denial. That's what it's all about. They're all in denial

[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:59.080]
How come all these other countries how come in Italy everybody smokes nobody's got cancer? What is that all about?

[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.340]
What is that about

[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:05.280]
How come they eat like pigs they eat a five-course meal?

[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:10.640]
There's no fat people there's like 10 fat people out of 70 million in a whole country. There's 10 fat people. Why is that?

[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.700]
How come they got women with naked boobs on there on TV commercials in France in Italy and

[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:23.640]
Holland and all over Europe they got naked breasts on here on regular tea over the air TV right on the commercials and

[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:27.720]
People over here are getting upset because somebody's got a website with the boobs on it

[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.120]
I don't want to mention no names you know what I'm saying

[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.780]
But the rumors are that somebody's getting all bent out of shape because somebody some show

[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:38.080]
I don't want to mention which one it might be has got a website

[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.720]
