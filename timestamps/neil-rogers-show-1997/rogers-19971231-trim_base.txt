[00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.920]
I would suggest flying in coach because nobody important is going to want to fly in coach so you won't get bumped anyway

[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.320]
Bumped by the Dan Bee Gees. There they were there was Barry and there was Marisa and there was the agent and there was other whole on to Roger

[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.620]
Miss Fitz there they were

[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.600]
If I would have had if we had tragedy if I still had Bee Gees music first of all I threw it out the window

[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.240]
We could open a window if we had Bee Gees music in here. I would play tragedy because that's what they are

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.200]
I mean here's a bunch of guys like the Bee Gees who supposedly made all this big money

[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.100]
Wouldn't you think they could afford a little bit better than a miracle worst airlines to go to which it wasn't for another week by the way

[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.800]
It wasn't that weekend. It was the following weekend that they were coming to do their big stick in Vegas. They were gonna stick it

[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.700]
So they stuck us instead

[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.420]
1124 at 5.60 Q.A.M. dry concepts man is a sponsor I've had for a long long time a sponsor that I use

[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.460]
Because they've been in town since 79 they do a phenomenal job. They don't rip you off

[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.680]
They don't have any kind of gimmicks no scams. They come to your home and whatever you want clean your crop

[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.140]
It's your draper your upholstery your furniture whatever it is

[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.980]
They do a phenomenal job like you wouldn't believe and they give you a written-guaranteed price right up front

[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.200]
No, these you know so much 5.95 per room scams rain this other crap like you see with some of these other

[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.000]
Joints that wind up doing a crappy job and then gouge you when the job is all done

[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.680]
So if you want to keep your cup. It's clean which of course for sanitary purposes

[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.720]
Plus if you're not a slot, you know kind of makes your house look beautiful as well

[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.240]
And also keeps your cup. It's clean a lot longer and makes them last a lot longer too

[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.120]
You save all the way around do yourself a favor forget about just let them on the heavy equipment from the supermarket forget about the

[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.320]
Fakers and the shysters out there these are people you can always depend on in this town or just out that many of those folks around anymore

[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.720]

Neil Rogers

[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.480]
Hi

[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.180]
You had to

[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.820]
in X

[00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:01.500]
you rode

[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.900]
For a way to

[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.320]
든�

[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.840]
Mike

[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.440]
It's like your career, a fellow heart and a crab.

[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.140]
Spend some with your lucky.

[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.580]
As you want to fly like Rocky Mountain,

[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.760]
I've been a plane with Lizzy Weak.

[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.680]
What happens is for us to take the country road and save.

[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.580]
And some kind with our new shelter, when you're all dirty,

[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.240]
Your sense to spill down, long before the country born was in.

[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.720]
So great, but goodbye John Devo.

[00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.260]
Thank God I'm not a country bull who writes all about and good.

[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.980]
I've been a fly a plane.

[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.540]
All your songs were lame, but you made money.

[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.300]
Yes, we tried to act like a down-owned country,

[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.600]
It's to appeal to those with no praise.

[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.600]
As you want to fly like Rocky Mountain,

[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.260]
I've been a plane with Lizzy Weak.

[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.440]
What happens is for us to take the country road and save.

[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.320]
And some kind with our new shelter, when you're all dirty,

[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.200]
Your sense to spill down, long before the country born was in.

[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.540]
That's another one we lost while I was off to your John Denver.

[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.400]
Thank God, 1129 on 560 QA in the near Roger.

[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.300]
Sure, I'll forget Hank, the Humphrey, he'll be along 2 to 6 an hour earlier.

[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.560]
2 to 6.

[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.760]
And all those people, all you know, those guys hate each other wrong.

[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.020]
Wrong. No problems.

[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.540]
You when you're a pole, you operate like a pole.

[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.760]
I don't hate Rick Wally.

[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.340]
I mean, this crap that some of you people started with yesterday,

[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.140]
Rick and I worked together for years.

[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.240]
I wish them luck and God without outfit they'll need it.

[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.260]
And then I did hear a little bit of the aftermath,

[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.080]
which evidently after they had several of those calls from O'Jahm,

[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.940]
provocateur, I'm Graham, starting the stuff and such,

[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.860]
and saying, well, I didn't know he's not here washing our car.

[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.420]
Yeah, right.

[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.800]
I'm out there washing your cars.

[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.940]
Okay, Mr. Shoma, here is. I'll show you mine. Start licking.

[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.300]
Right.

[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.640]
Anyway, here's the facts about the pizza lot.

[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.740]
He's got enough publicity already.

[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.960]
But he's with Jimmy Johnson.

[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.880]
Shoma, you're Johnson.

[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.100]
He's got his finger nails all brushed up for the holidays.

[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.900]
Great. Here's a bunch of stuff from Davey Gravy line.

[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.160]
So where is it? Yeah, it's not in there.

[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.480]
Anyway, no matter what I want to play, it's not in there.

[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.860]
Anyway, just be glad we got to them.

[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.700]
Yeah, so what is it, Davey Gravy line?

[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.420]
Welcome back. We missed you. Happy New Year.

[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.320]
Send us over a bunch of luck orifice supplies.

[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.220]
And if anybody knows about orifice supplies,

[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.120]
it's Davey Gravy line. Thanks, Dave.

[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.380]
As we continue, there's Tony Yup, Yup, Yup.

[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.000]
In the other room, he just continues walking around with a big smile on his face,

[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.060]
like he knows what's going on.

[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600]
Is there anybody here today?

[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.200]
Few people.

[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.340]
They'll be bailing out around noon.

[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.740]
New Year's, oh, I shouldn't be planting new year stuff.

[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.520]
Shouldn't I? Yeah, I'd rather play the good stuff though.

[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.300]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.080]
Miami.

[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.720]
When is this?

[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.620]
Bon journal.

[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.480]
Okay.

[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.920]
Well, it's these phones. It's just set up.

[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.720]
Well, it'll start working in a few months.

[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.620]
Here's Kendall. Hello.

[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.140]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.700]
Just start, uh, since you're at the game, you didn't get to hear a rimmer last night.

[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.120]
You'd like to know why they weren't playing Whitney toward the end of the game.

[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.940]
And why was that?

[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.240]
The teams that Brian Murray wants to get a chance to have cons love make a goal.

[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.480]
So every time you turn around, Victor cons love it on the ice.

[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.080]
Wait, wait, wait.

[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.020]
See, I was saying this.

[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.920]
I was saying this to all the people in my role.

[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.020]
We have to keep seeing cons love and Chris Wells.

[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.700]
And you know why?

[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.140]
Because Brian, this, you know, how I'm trying to prove a point.

[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.600]
I want to jump out the window.

[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.680]
If we were on a higher floor, I would jump out the damn window.

[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.180]
It proves what I've been saying.

[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.160]
This guy is a hard ass, a hard head.

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.640]
And he is going to prove to us what a genius he is.

[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.060]
So all this money he wasted on Victor's cons love, I'm almost a million a year.

[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.300]
And all the money he's spending on Chris Wells, whatever it is, he's going to keep playing these guys

[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.640]
and playing these guys to prove to us what a genius.

[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.120]
Even if we have to give up a point, how about if we missed a playoffs by one point this year?

[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.520]
Okay, let's look back at the game last night and keep in mind that he decided to put this big Russian out there

[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.160]
who does nothing instead of our best player.

[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.560]
Because Brian Murray does not like small guys.

[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.840]
He's a size queen.

[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.300]
He's in the big guys.

[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.820]
He does not like small players.

[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.680]
Remember the shield kept saying too much of the wrong thing.

[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.540]
Look how much time cons love got.

[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.420]
Murray really went through the score.

[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.800]
I was screaming.

[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.460]
I was screaming at him up there.

[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.900]
In fact during one of their commercial breaks, I was a hot band and he took his headset off.

[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.040]
And I was screaming at him.

[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.400]
I said we played half the period.

[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.120]
He's sitting with me on the bench.

[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.060]
At least and he knows what's going on up there.

[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.960]
You know what he's wearing 14 just like points did.

[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.580]
There you go.

[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.120]
Same story, neurotic repetition man.

[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.520]
The subject one I know about Brian Murray is the anti-Christ.

[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.380]
You got it.

[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:23.720]
Okay.

[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.980]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:25.880]
You have Victor Kuzla.

[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.100]
Go back to Siberia.

[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.960]
Victor will pack you a parogue or whatever the hell are you doing over there.

[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:30.680]
What do they eat?

[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.220]
I know they eat in Russia.

[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.160]
A lot of it.

[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:33.920]
Okay.

[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.660]
We have open line 56670560.

[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.300]
56670560.

[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.420]
If you have 18th-Ewellers or mobile one.

[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.260]
It's pounded 560.

[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.400]
You pick it up and pounded.

[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.960]
Here's a mobile in Miami.

[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.340]
Hello.

[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.700]
Hey Neil.

[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.140]
How you doing?

[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:48.500]
Great.

[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.460]
Welcome back.

[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.220]
I have a comment about the panthers.

[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.200]
Who?

[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.220]
The panthers.

[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:53.920]
I remember them.

[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.500]
Yeah.

[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.320]
Well listen.

[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.120]
Next year if they do these bonehead trades with Visa or they don't give Whitney enough money

[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.000]
when they go to the New Arena, let's talk as a sawgrass mills mall.

[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.180]
At 10,000 cars a night, I'm $10,000.

[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.180]
That's $100,000.

[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.240]
What do you think last year?

[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.080]
30,000?

[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.500]
Yeah.

[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.200]
And we can send a message to the team to manage.

[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.840]
And it's a Tory and Murray and say, hey, we have fans don't like what you're doing.

[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.340]
And we'll just do that when they do bonehead trades.

[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.520]
Stay over there, walk a mile, go to the game and they'll get the message.

[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.620]
I'll park at the Shell Station.

[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.160]
I'm serious.

[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.140]
I can frankly, we walk from my house to, I mean, it's a little bit rough.

[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.780]
It may get some mile, two miles.

[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.480]
I look at it two minutes from the New Arena.

[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.020]
Yeah, but you know what?

[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.960]
Do you think that's a great idea?

[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.700]
We go into the...

[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:42.800]
No.

[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:43.600]
Okay.

[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.080]
We have an open line, 567-056-6756-7056.

[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.480]
That's a great idea.

[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.040]
And by the way, let's also trade the Beesoo for Red Henrikin.

[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.320]
Right.

[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:51.880]
Okay.

[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.480]
See, a lot of these guys on the year, this is...

[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.900]
Why are there so many ass suckers on the year?

[00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.880]
This is what bothers me.

[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.180]
It's one thing to be a...

[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:00.540]
Sucker.

[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.500]
But to be an ass sucker, I mean, that to me is extraordinarily disturbing.

[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.520]
Oh, these guys that get on no matter what these people do.

[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.160]
We're going to do this.

[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.780]
And no matter what the caller say, no matter how in name it is.

[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.920]
A great idea.

[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.160]
Forget it, pal.

[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:15.780]
Ain't going to happen.

[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.900]
But while lazy, we want to park up close and personal and to leave us alone.

[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.260]
Here is Lighthouse Point.

[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:20.560]
Hello.

[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.660]
Hello, Neil.

[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.260]
Happy New Year.

[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:22.780]
Thank you.

[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.280]
Likewise.

[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.720]
Now, listen, the Panthers, they have what?

[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.640]
Fourteen wins, like 20 losses.

[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.020]
I was just wondering.

[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.340]
They have to do...

[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.440]
Everybody keep in track of how many wins or how many losses we'd have.

[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.820]
If Whitney wasn't on that team.

[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.720]
If Ray Whitney had not joined this team, if Ryan Moran, I give him credit,

[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.140]
if he hadn't got out there inside Ray Whitney, this time would be right down there with the Lightning,

[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.920]
a vying for last place in the conference.

[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.280]
I mean, he's got to be responsible.

[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.560]
I would think for five, six wins or a equivalent of six, seven times.

[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.100]
At least.

[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.100]
At least, right?

[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.800]
So where the hell would they be without him?

[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.340]
No worries.

[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.120]
So why the heck is he setting them down?

[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.300]
And when we need it, we can need a win.

[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.560]
So they have to ask the brain trust, okay?

[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.800]
He's trying to showcase all these other guys to show us what a genius he is.

[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.220]
No, I was showing out on two left, right?

[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.160]
But in doing...

[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.700]
They didn't do me any, didn't do you much good.

[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.260]
Now, I didn't out of my system.

[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.540]
I'm not holding you then anymore.

[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.300]
I'm going to tell you one thing.

[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.400]
If we go to that arena tomorrow, which I'll be there,

[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.100]
and Kirk Muller is out there on EIs, I am going to go ballistic.

[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.960]
If he puts Kirk Muller in line up tomorrow, I personally am going to go out there

[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.080]
and tie him up in bandages and send it back to Kingston, Ontario.

[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.260]
He's got to settle it.

[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:28.800]
I'm going to...

[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:28.920]
He's got to settle it.

[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.540]
He's got to put Kirk Muller out there with Cosloff and...

[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.500]
Chris Brown.

[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.140]
And what?

[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.940]
Yeah, and he's got the ball at the same time.

[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:36.480]
Nice.

[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.660]
It sounds good to me.

[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.880]
Sounds like a real wiener to me.

[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.020]
Yeah, how'd it go?

[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:40.480]
Right there, amigo.

[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.300]
Yeah, take care.

[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.980]
1136 and 560 QAM.

[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.700]
You know, so is the dump thing still going or you just don't want to tell me?

[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:48.280]
Joe.

[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.100]
Huh?

[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.440]
Oh, Joe, you're going to ask Joe.

[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.220]
By the way, I mentioned yesterday what a great job Joe did for us.

[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.460]
How about us putting all this stuff in the ECS?

[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.280]
What a good guy he is?

[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.220]
No, I don't think he mentioned it.

[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.960]
His name is Castello and he's Italian, but not related to Frank Castello.

[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.860]
The mobster we don't think.

[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.360]
We hope not.

[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:00.840]
But not.

[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.120]
It hasn't dumped in 45 minutes.

[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.180]
Well, it's about time to let one loose, I would think.

[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.680]
Most of the people down here haven't dumped in 45 weeks, so what are you worried about?

[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.300]
That's good.

[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.000]
Okay, maybe it just needs a little time to, you know, get greased up and loomed up and ready to go.

[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.620]
What am I going to do about my side view mirrors, by the way?

[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.860]
You know, it's bad enough that we have, oh, you brought his daughter.

[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.240]
See that, that's a cover up.

[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.380]
That's a cover up.

[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.920]
It's healed people who brought his daughter so that they don't say anything bad about Don Cox, the degenerate.

[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:36.160]
I mean, that wonderful guy up there, Power 96, who brought us a very nice, you know, he brought us an elephant.

[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.260]
Is that a elephant's depository yesterday?

[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.500]
Disguised us as cigar?

[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:46.740]
Your daddy smokes elephants' depository and pretends that they're cigars, which is great because they're delicious no matter which end you insert.

[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.720]
Okay, here's Fort Lauderdale.

[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:48.980]
Hello.

[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.120]
Veedio.

[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:50.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.820]
You were absolutely right.

[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.020]
Things have gotten right back to where they were a certain month ago.

[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:02.400]
Except now, you've got a, you know, an interstation kind of a thing going like they used to do.

[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.180]
Well, like they used to do.

[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.500]
What do you mean?

[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.020]
Well, with this thing with comments by Rick and Sir Jeff today.

[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.800]
But it ain't going to happen.

[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:13.880]
It ain't going to happen.

[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.660]
I'm not going to, I have no problem with Rick and Sir Jeff.

[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.540]
I wish them the best.

[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.500]
I mean, Rick knows that it's Stick and that he's a certain part of Rick Wally.

[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.340]
You like to pick on.

[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.600]
He knows all about that.

[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.660]
I like those guys.

[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.840]
I don't have a problem with them.

[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.920]
I'm not going to get into some kind of a, can leave that to Mr. Ego.

[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.980]
I don't, that whole outfit.

[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:40.260]
And I'm not talking personally about Rick and Sir Jeff, but this, this queer channel thing with this, with this crap talk network,

[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.460]
whatever the hell it is, the stupid talk network, it doesn't, I don't have time to waste talking about them.

[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.120]
I don't respond to things that nobody is listening to.

[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.520]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.200]
Correct, sir.

[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.040]
It's what it's like.

[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.020]
It's like the light bulb.

[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.420]
They tried forever and ever and ever.

[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.100]
Oh, they're talking about Neil to do it with that.

[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.380]
I don't care what they say.

[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.200]
It's like Christina Moore on this station, who thinks that I, number one, listen to him, which I don't.

[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.040]
And number two, care what he says about me.

[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.040]
I couldn't care less.

[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.100]
I don't have time for spot potatoes.

[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.900]
No, I make, I, I like to make a suggestion.

[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.560]
Why don't you and Hank put together a trip to Las Vegas?

[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.120]
That's a good idea.

[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.480]
That's a great idea.

[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.800]
Well, I'll find out.

[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.940]
Let's just hope it's not on America Worst.

[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:20.300]
Yep.

[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.240]
Okay, pal.

[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:21.600]
Thank you.

[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:22.580]
See, there's a caller.

[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.320]
Had a good idea.

[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.740]
Hank loves Vegas.

[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.680]
I love Vegas.

[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.380]
Anybody in their right mind loves Vegas.

[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.260]
What does not it like?

[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.260]
Let's just hope that NBG's don't screw up the deal.

[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.640]
We'll call up our good friend Bob Lincoln.

[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.520]
That's a good idea.

[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.500]
All right.

[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.160]
You must be dropping acid again.

[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.760]
21 till noon on 560 QAM attention audio Toyota buyers out there don't make a big, big mistake.

[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.640]
Like a $5,000 mistake.

[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.080]
Only Kendall Toyota America's low price powerhouse beats every advertised price in America.

[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.120]
Not just in this, not in Miami, Dave County.

[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.380]
Not just in South Florida.

[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.880]
Not in this guy forsaken the penal shaped state, but in the entire country.

[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.560]
Or Kendall Toyota will give you $5,000 in cash if they don't beat that advertised price.

[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.320]
You can't beat that.

[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.280]
Over 1,000 new Toyota's and used cars in stock.

[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.060]
At Kendall Toyota on these 39 month leases, you're going to save a lot of cash.

[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.380]
New 98 QOLAs with Aaron Automatic 149 a month.

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.680]
98 Camries with Aaron Automatic 169 a month.

[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.420]
98 4 runners just 239 a month.

[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.120]
And Georgia's got one is a little more than that because it's loaded with all kinds of stuff and he's very happy with it.

[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:24.680]
What is it?

[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.460]
That's what it says here.

[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.600]
I'd run down here immediately.

[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.160]
Kendall Toyota will beat every advertised price in America on the same equipped in stock Toyota.

[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.140]
Or they'll pay you $5,000 cash.

[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.560]
And this may be our last spot ever for them because that price sounds very picky to me.

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.660]

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.660]

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.660]

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.660]

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.660]

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.660]

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.660]

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.660]

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.660]

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.660]

That's me.

[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.120]
You've been off the air for seven months and I it's like a soap opera you show you you you you you're

[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.120]
off for seven months you turn on it's the same stick.

[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:20.600]
Yeah.

[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:21.160]
What is that?

[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.280]
What do you mean what is it?

[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:22.940]
I mean it's great.

[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.400]
I love it.

[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:29.280]
But I mean because look if they took guiding light off the air for seven months and they put it back on.

[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.140]
What's your name would still be walking around trying to find out where she's going and the guy

[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.820]
would still haven't shaved and Vanessa would still be having the baby.

[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:36.720]
That's exactly right.

[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.680]
That's what it's all about.

[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.860]
That's why I got you on.

[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.020]
Thank you sir.

[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.860]
That's right he's absolutely correct.

[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:42.820]
Like I said.

[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.020]
Absolutely correct.

[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:46.560]
Absolutely correct.

[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.080]
So we do have two open lines which strains me strains my imagination.

[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.520]
The only thing I'm a little disappointed considering everything things are going very well.

[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.660]
But a lot of our lot of my friends not yours like Paul Harvey Jr. for example whom you hate like poison.

[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.400]
A lot of those people we haven't heard from.

[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.860]
The knots landing lady a lot of our geoclose personal friends out there we haven't heard from yet.

[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:13.820]
And I don't understand I mean if they just forsaken us maybe they are like inside a real building and they can't get you in.

[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.080]
We don't have look let's face it one a.m.

[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.180]
We got some signal problems.

[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.580]
We don't have the world's greatest signal.

[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:28.160]
But I'll tell you compare this this this other schlock network there where every station at this before sunrise and after sundown is fading out and you drive another 10 blocks.

[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.660]
Oh just keep turning your dial.

[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.240]
It's a good thing we got digital radios in the car.

[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.200]
Just keep cranking that thing up 10 kilo cycles or 20 kilo cycles and you'll be able to hear it.

[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.400]
You might miss a few words or a few sentences but just keep cranking it up.

[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:40.900]
Hello.

[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.020]
Oh my god you must be psychic.

[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:49.420]
Do you were anyway have you got something in your mouth or an apple let me make a little likely story.

[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.520]
Let me ask you a question I don't want you to mention to you.

[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.280]
George has got a sour look on his purse.

[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.000]
Why does he hate you so much?

[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.240]
Oh that's a stick.

[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.280]
No it's not.

[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.560]
He hates you like poison.

[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:08.000]
I told him that that thing here is which I'm looking feverishly I think it's lost forever that Chris with somebody.

[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:16.960]
Chris is Chris well as I said that make him a rimmer that was thrown out that was thrown out out that George hated that I love wasn't I didn't hate it it was just I think

[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.580]
Rimmer Rimmer slept Jordan out remember I was gonna say something a few bucks Rimmer wouldn't slip anybody a few bucks.

[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.440]
Let me probably give my hockey puck.

[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.260]
What was your first reaction when you heard McClean was like I was very surprised.

[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:35.120]
That it happened so soon I wasn't surprised it happened because I predicted it would happen but I was shocked that after only 23 games that they went

[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:42.760]
I saw such a panic and I will say it again I keep I keep hearing these rumors that it was motivated by Wayne because the time when he was

[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:48.860]
Can was the same time they had all the big newspaper ads about buying tickets for the new arena and Wayne saw all these people

[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.880]
leading early in the third period and the team sticking the joint out at home and not running any home games and people getting

[00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:00.920]
Real disenchanted and he started panicking and there screaming a toy we got to sell all these tickets to fill in the arena you got to do something

[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:07.760]
Now that this is just a rumor that I heard yeah obviously not from our friend but I mean from outside I've also I've heard a couple rumors similar that

[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.200]
But add a little more yeah the profanities that were used during the game.

[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.760]
What about it well that wasn't very much like by Mrs. I think.

[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:26.660]
Oh no oh yeah you have to be joking oh no so we have to have a family oriented team now.

[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.400]
Now you you're I mean you know nothing about the game but if you turn a game on TV you know they have all the

[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.140]
mics that are down just over the ice and Rocky yeah and every time a penalty is called a player that's screaming what kind of an

[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.980]
app and call you I mean you hear every word that's ever been invented with little Canadian accent you were but I

[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:48.100]
mean it's all the same and they're worried about because Dougie has got a colorful mouth.

[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:55.600]
Mm-hmm I that's what I heard I'm restraining myself I've been hearing so much crap lately if I'm

[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.800]
believe with the inside stores I've been going to games so I'm used to crap let me tell you what another scene last night I'm

[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.800]
serious last night to call that performance and abortion would be a compliment and that's the damn truth.

[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.780]
Another explosion that took place while you were off the air when the brain stem was getting a

[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:20.800]

Start bombing Baghdad

[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.140]
Through it every day

[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.600]
I want to watch it on TV

[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.700]
I rat, I rat

[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.360]
We've not moved

[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.100]
It should take a day

[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.500]
Oh my gosh

[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.480]
Let us just put a nut to it

[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.420]
I rat, I rat

[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:56.840]
Okay

[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.720]
I want to wake up

[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.480]
And see their cities don't exist

[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.820]
But in thin air

[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.240]
And tell that Saddam Hussein

[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.320]
We're really pissed

[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.160]
You're on the my skin

[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.940]
That little piece of shit

[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.940]
Ain't yet no way

[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.160]
I'll get none of the make-ahits

[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:32.000]
From all through your eyes

[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.060]
The sun has got to go on that now

[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:42.980]
We all know it's time to bomb

[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.060]
I rat, I rat

[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.180]
I rat, I rat

[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.340]
I rat, I rat

[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.060]
I want to wake up

[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:09.120]
And see their cities don't belong to fits

[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.820]
I'll blow it away

[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.400]
And say that when number one

[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.460]
Oh for the heat

[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.080]
We can't be beyond

[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.740]
Again we have won

[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:28.660]
Start bombing our rat

[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.140]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.260]
What's wrong with us today?

[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.960]
Let's make the party lot of這

[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.680]
That old guy right

[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.820]
Right

[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:57.920]
When all the boys are there, I'll do a show

[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:02.420]
With that kickcare and say goodbye

[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.980]
I'm right

[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.060]
I'm right

[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.640]
I'm right

[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.000]
Hold on, I'm right

[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.320]
What is he going to croak over?

[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:19.960]
I love him

[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.600]
Okay, it's good

[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:27.480]
The city telly book was written in 1986, the unauthorized biography of this guy, which was great

[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:31.660]
But once he croaks, then the real good stuff will come out, speaking of Frank Kaiselman

[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.100]
Okay, let's go to a...

[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.920]
I'm starting to do that in sound like Rick Rally used to do, and he used to really buy used to rip him for doing it

[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.900]
I apologize not

[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.520]
Here's Daryl, hello

[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:41.620]
A Neil

[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.100]
Yes sir

[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.000]
Wow, I missed you man

[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.960]
So did everybody, even if the ones that don't admit it, even the ones that pretend they hate me, they had no life for seven months

[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:55.300]
Wow, I've been listening, crying to listen to the radio all this month and it's like it is crap

[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.380]
Yeah, crap

[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.880]
My radio got a good rest

[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.240]
Peace, thank god you're back

[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.020]
Listen, I was listening to you show yesterday, because I said let me call him today

[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.780]
Because I know you're going to have a million callers yesterday

[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.320]
Yeah

[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.460]
So today you're probably getting only about a thousand, so I'll probably get a half a million

[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.900]
You never was that right here on 2 a.m.

[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.840]
Listen, yesterday you were talking about Ambyship

[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:21.420]
Is that really true that she says that no one to interview you?

[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.360]
That you said that there would be fired?

[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.960]
Yeah, she's still saying that, she's in debt for a couple of months and she's still saying it

[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.880]
No, it wasn't that they weren't to interview me, it was that she didn't want them to listen to me

[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.900]
Oh god

[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:37.960]
She put a note up and again this is alleged but nevertheless I heard it from somebody who worked over there this several years ago

[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:45.020]
She put a note up on the bulletin board in the newsroom at 10 saying anybody caught listening to the Elijah show will be terminated immediately, no questions asked

[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.620]
And don't call her a bullbike and stuff like that

[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:52.020]
Of course that's simply a bitch-sandy, Peyton comes on the air

[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.200]
Oh yes, well Anne was such a good friend and she had such a great sense of humor

[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.040]
You mind to be a Margaret, we needed a fillback for that

[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.360]
I mean, oh just pathetic, simple ring, whip ring, pathetic

[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.160]
Listen, I was wondering

[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.060]
Peyton was doing a five watt make-believe show

[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:07.900]
That's a fucking bitch

[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.160]
Right, let me tell you something pretty clear in this station

[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.940]
Yeah, very clear

[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.560]
We never know what in here because we're getting used to the new surroundings and the board

[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.800]
But I guess it's okay

[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.920]
Yeah, no, it's all great

[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:24.320]
The reason it sounds better than the rest of the station is because the rest of the guys are working that red and festive toilet over there

[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.620]
And everything that you, if you ever listened to any of the ball games

[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.060]
The stuff that comes from outside like the Dauphin games and the ball of games

[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:37.700]
Sound real crisp and clear on the station but then when you go back and listen to the spots or the people talking at QAM

[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:38.680]
It's probably good

[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.840]
Because the stuff is like from before Marconi was born

[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.120]
Yeah

[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.400]
And as a result I would say it again I'm doing them a hell of a favor by forcing them, forcing

[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.300]
Screaming and yelling and making them build a studio and getting this place going over here

[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.680]
It's going to get those guys out of there, hell of a lot sooner

[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.440]
Yeah, listen one last thing

[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:59.940]
I was watching the interviews that they did with you in Channel 4 and the last one in Channel 7

[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.220]
Yeah

[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.480]
And you know I'm looking at you guys

[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.800]
You got these two new Corvette

[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.100]
And I remember you had one new one and the silver one and you had the old one

[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.120]
Which is like a light one

[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.000]
The silver 96 is the one I smashed up

[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.400]
Yeah and then I guess you got tired of the old Corvette

[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.780]
That I'm reading the paper yesterday of course the Harold

[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.200]
And I see yeah they crushed the car

[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:19.780]
Oh yeah

[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.780]
That must have been horrible

[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.400]
Very lucky I didn't I mean I had bumps and bruises on my forehead

[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.900]
But they went away in one day but I was lucky I didn't get killed

[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:33.140]
But that was like they must have been really scary trying to see if you can make it with your radiate or leaking and overheating

[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.960]
Because that's happened to me before it

[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.240]
And of course I don't want to say that Honey Hill Road or 199 for whatever it is is a bad neighborhood

[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:39.600]
Yeah

[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.680]
But I wanted to be getting out of that hood real fast and getting to 441 and be getting to a phone

[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.720]
And I wanted to thank again the people who put that into it and were very nice to me

[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.760]
The guy I don't know how the guy happened to have an ice pack over there in the refrigerator

[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.860]
Maybe he works in management I don't know

[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.760]
But he had an ice pack and I was sitting there holding it on my head

[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.520]
And calling Trump and all the Chevrolet and came in to tow the car in right away

[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.380]
And George stuck me over to the hospital which was totally unneeded

[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.640]
And Dr. Mark said don't worry you got a hard head and everything was fine

[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.280]
But you don't you don't carry around a cell phone or anything

[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.620]
I mean you got two cars I mean I have one

[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:15.700]
And if you're thinking about it you know you switch phones and you take the car you're using but I always remember to do that

[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.180]
Yeah because I carry it just for that

[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.040]
Gotta have it

[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.200]
Yeah

[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.840]
Alright welcome back Neil it's good to have you know I'm always listening

[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.340]
Thanks a lot

[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.180]
Alright bro see you

[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.900]
Happy New Year everybody

[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.200]
We'll be off tomorrow by the way we got a hockey game

[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.800]
We got the Panthers remember them

[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.120]
And then after the game you know Randy Moher comes to me before the game like this

[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.440]
I said how come you didn't rip me I said I'd never had anybody complain that I didn't rip them

[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.380]
He wants me to rip them

[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.100]
Or I'll rip you Randy because he's on her last night with Geldie

[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.240]
And they're belly I can oh gee all the clutching and grabbing and that's tough to play

[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.340]
These guys are first of all if it's so tough to play them how come the records things so bad

[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.660]
How come their team is horse crap

[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.800]
And number two clutching and grabbing was always the trademark of the Panthers

[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:59.640]
The first four years in league all the other teams especially when Fred Chusik and Derek Santis were doing a Bruins game

[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.320]
They used to practically be in tears when they played the Panthers

[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.720]
But all this clutching and grabbing and they won't call it penalties

[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.440]
So please stop making excuses

[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.320]
Stop sugar coating

[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:14.220]
We're going into a diabetic coma from all the sugar coating of the crappy play

[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.960]
Okay cut it out Randy you're a great guy I love Randy Moher good guy

[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.080]
But for a crap any worse for Wayne

[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.740]
Here she is what is taking you so long

[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.960]
Well it's hard to get through

[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.500]
Is it so hard?

[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.400]
Very hard

[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.700]
Yes it is

[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.820]
Great to have you back

[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:29.500]
Thank you

[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.580]
Sorry I steer your voice

[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.360]
I like thank you

[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.200]
I can even hear the call is a little bit today

[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.340]
Not too much they don't want to go overboard but much better than yesterday

[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.300]
Well that helps

[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:37.960]
We're getting there

[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.460]
Sure

[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.100]
See that actually there's a method in these people's madness every station have worked that

[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:45.540]
They like to screw things up when you're first start because then it gives you material

[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.020]
It gets you agitated and they enjoy that

[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.680]
And then you open it

[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.760]
And of course when you have a stroke and croak the next day

[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.420]
Maybe we've all went all the low

[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.540]
That's a little too much stress

[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.260]
Well next guy will take it easy Ron

[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:57.820]
Oh yeah

[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.740]
Nobody could replace you

[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.760]
Everybody should know that now

[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.600]
I guess this market found that out the last seven months how sweet huh?

[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.180]
That's right

[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.500]
That's right

[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.060]
All these experts out there with these slime bags that bring it off the street

[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.400]
Oh proof you're a talk host you're an entertainer right

[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.240]
All these 20 year old this jockies try to be talk host

[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:16.740]
That's right

[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.680]
I can't

[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.780]
So how are you doing?

[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:19.980]
Real good how are you doing?

[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.280]
Are you doing your accounting thing?

[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:22.880]
I'm doing my accounting thing

[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.820]
You come back saying?

[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.560]
Yeah checking over my new software

[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:27.500]
Really?

[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:27.920]
Yeah

[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.240]
How about your computer?

[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.320]
My computer too

[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:30.700]
That too

[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.880]
Yeah the hardware is great

[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.500]
Maybe I'll have you do my regular taxes this year

[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:35.960]
There you go

[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.780]
Because I do pay those people in Texas a lot of money to do my corporate taxes

[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.820]
But maybe I'll have to because I need something to do it

[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.880]
So I can cheat the government real good

[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.600]
There you go

[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:48.000]
Now that I have all my investment losses

[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.100]
That there you go

[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:49.960]
That's what you need

[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.940]
Nothing like that to start from

[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.200]
You know the day, remember the day the market went down 550 points

[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:54.600]
So I do

[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.260]
Luckily for me

[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.320]
Because you know when I was in town I had CNBC on a lot

[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.440]
Which is a bad mistake because it makes you very neurotic

[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:01.660]
Right

[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.800]
The market is off and down

[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.420]
And the little arrow was in your getting psychotic

[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:05.700]
Right

[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.620]
And by the time that that day came I had already conditioned myself

[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.980]
If it would have gone down 1200 points I was laughing

[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.900]
But well you know this is a silly game and it goes down

[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.420]
It'll come back up and then of course all this stuff with the gook starter

[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.120]
With the you know over there in South Korea and Japan

[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.660]
Did you buy yourself an island in Korea?

[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:23.220]
Huh?

[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.920]
Did you buy yourself a little town?

[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.920]
Yeah right

[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.880]
For $15

[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.620]
That's right

[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.500]
And it doesn't phase me anymore

[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.360]
It doesn't phase me and sure enough I bought a lot of GE stock

[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.900]
Because I have friends at Channel 6 or whatever the reason would be

[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.400]
And it went down to like 60th back to 70th almost 35th

[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.020]
A lot of people you know you just sit around and be patient and start listening to all these BS artists

[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.860]
That's right the only people I think that really lost out with the ones that sold the next day when it recovered

[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:47.280]
Right

[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.900]
That's right and of course the packs and people who stock isn't worth the pay of the shaman that it's their rignaut

[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:52.420]
That's right

[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.160]
Is that yours?

[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:53.840]
Yes it is

[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.520]
Oh thank god I thought we were starting to hear a fan from my nose again

[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:57.960]
No just my

[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.240]
Well it's great hearing your voice

[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.180]
How good hearing you too

[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.220]
Have you kept the weight off?

[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.820]
I've kept most of it off

[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.380]
Well it's great

[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:03.880]
I'm definitely

[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.020]
I just give Bill Tanner the adkins book by the way

[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.900]
I just bought the new one there was a little soft cover book in the store

[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.440]
Yeah

[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.660]
I don't know if it was that thing

[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:10.920]
I've seen that

[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.300]
But I thought I'd pick it up and give it a read and since you're going to start it again

[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.400]
I think I'll do it again too before I really need it

[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.720]
Yeah I'm getting on it too

[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.180]
Well you know I hate to say this because he's such a good guy and a very talented

[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.060]
broker-blind

[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:23.320]
Right

[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:28.020]
For us all this great material, funny, funny stuff and yesterday he comes in here

[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:33.100]
I thought I finally cheered him up a little bit and he brings it a box from Doris Market

[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.840]
Okay which I shopped at Doris Market

[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:35.260]
Right

[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.140]
Because it's close to me to want a plantation

[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:37.440]
Right

[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.060]
And then of course on the weekend I drive down to Lorenzo's

[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.340]
But anyway he brings me half a dozen canolies

[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.920]
Do you know how fattening canolies are?

[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.000]
And I love them

[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.500]
And of course they Italy they've got these unbelievable canoli in the all the bakeries

[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.740]
And he brings me half a dozen I want to be eating three

[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:55.420]
Wow

[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:56.500]
Is that disgusting?

[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.060]
Yeah

[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.580]
Somebody who ate one

[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:02.320]
And I have two sitting at house which I pray that John eats those two

[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.220]
But I want to be in three canolies because Brian doesn't get it

[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.340]
Brian I'm trying desperate I was having such a great day yesterday

[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.420]
I eat only the lunch meets out there I didn't eat any of the dresk

[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.560]
I had only one of those jalapeno pingapoppers

[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.260]
What was the name of those guys with the lunch meet?

[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.960]
The sub center right across the street

[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.140]
Oh I don't have a menu for that

[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.900]
They'll bring us a menu when you just rely

[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.380]
Like today was jalapeno peppers over with damn good

[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:26.540]
Oh yeah those things are great

[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.300]
Those were too bad if they have one

[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.000]
They're great taste to you

[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.860]
But anyway so he brings me the canolie and I scoot up

[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.100]
I'll get back on it

[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:33.460]
Yeah

[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.320]
And the diet too

[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:34.800]
And the diet

[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.920]
Well how do great taste sweetheart

[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.500]
Great talking

[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:37.960]
Take care of yourself and happy new year

[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.040]
Love you happy new year

[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:39.680]
Bye bye

[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.860]
They're not slanting lady how do you like that?

[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.000]
Oh and I forgot to ask oh damn it

[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.080]
Well I told her we'll talk to her again sometime this next year

[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.540]
Forgot to ask her if she realized that the young senator from not slanting

[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.520]
The guy which I hate this guy like with her

[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.380]
He's got a nose you could make a real bad but it's been broken

[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.200]
Like a hockey player to sky 85 times his nose has been broken

[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.940]
He's playing on a guiding light now

[00:44:58.940 --> 00:44:59.700]
Ben Rowan

[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.380]
Ross Marrow's long lost illegitimate brother

[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:02.960]
Whatever it is

[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.500]
And one of those characters that you despise

[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.380]
That you hate

[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.000]
Wonder what's your name Michelle's gonna be able to see today

Not 560 QA and pizza lot wants to thank every but they want to thank me mainly

[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.380]
But they want to thank you folks for all of a sudden come in last night

[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.440]
Like the world was coming to an end like it with the last supper

[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.920]
And the good news is all that great family style Italian food

[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.600]
The pasta and the pizzas and the subs and the eggplant and the chicken and the

[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.960]
Veal and their great garlic rolls which are the juiciest in the best in the world

That's right they're open new year's eve

[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.360]
New year's day featuring their regular menu

[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.480]
And no price scouting

[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:44.880]
Every time it gets to the holidays especially the big use Christmas New Year's

[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.480]
Whatever a lot of the other restaurants that do stay open they got they you know they

[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.720]
They skyrocket the prices because they know your despic most places are closed

[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.320]
And they gouge the hell out of you never it pizza lot same menu same prices which are

Estonishingly low every Monday's lasagna night Tuesday is eggplant and both nights

If you buy one of these you get the second one for only five bucks and they give you tons of food

[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:09.200]

[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:55.120]
Hey Neil yes sir I was going great great show yes it is let me just add this during the commercials we don't hear anything

[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.860]
So I may have been listening to our radio we're working on it all right hey I was in the

[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:06.240]
Bumper last night up in a box you were sitting above me huh up in a box okay what

[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:11.540]
Did you hear me during the third period streamer about first spray Whitney no I couldn't

[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:14.440]
Have heard anybody because I was too busy screaming the same thing I was screaming up there

[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:18.980]
It's remember in Denise Poppin and what you know what the hell is going on here and the time is going by

[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:23.260]
I kept saying five minutes seven minutes seven minutes half the period's gone before we got his first shift

[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.380]
And then finally he sticks him out there for 20 seconds and I looked up at Denise Poppin and he said

[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:33.420]
I was really really happy because he knew it was a bunch of crap yeah I see I see need a matter of flying go out

[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:39.580]
I think I need a thing to go out well flying do you mind again I mean they're just trying to destroy the fans by proving to

[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:44.520]
Watch that need a Mars going to be a real force and that cosla was going to be real play I'm tired of it man

[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:49.140]
Put the guys out there they're playing you know Lindsay and Fitzgerald and Wells that lines playing okay and

[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.460]
And Whitney's playing great. He should be double shifting that kid every power play

[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:58.220]
I don't understand he plays them for half the power play then the last power play we had he puts Eddie out there

[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.940]
He's on air for like the first minute and 40 seconds puts Whitney out nothing happens

[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.540]
Okay, puts Whitney on in the last 20 seconds it creates a scoring chance

[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:11.040]
We didn't score but he creates an opportunity why wasn't he out there the whole time he was not on the shift before the power play

[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.200]
I'm Tonya man Brian Murray is the anti-Christine's just I'm forming at the mouth with this guy

[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:23.760]
I love him because I don't like I don't care how many times people lie to you Brian Murray does not like guys who are not big

[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:28.980]
Goofy gooo like cos love and Chris well that's I'm telling you that's his idea players

[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.880]
Dougie had a lightning record

[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.900]
I'm pretty more in Detroit these Caroline and I look at a stepheater and into he's a step

[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.120]
Dougie had a winning record on the road last before he left. Yeah

[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:44.140]
And just because he had some lost the oh my no it's not but I got news for you

[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:48.940]
We can't worry anymore about Dougie about stew barns about the past they have got to make some moves now

[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.720]
And because we still thank goodness the mediocrity is so rampant

[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.340]
I mean we're only a point behind islanders the Rangers a couple of points

[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:59.860]
We're still in there for the playoffs Buffalo is coming on a little bit though now these other guys aren't gonna wait

[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.600]
Around all year for us to catch up to him

[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:06.540]
He has got to do something now because he's got a bunch of stiffs on his team that just can't get it done

[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.740]
I think it's the white jerseys we can't win with the white jerseys tomorrow tomorrow's the red jerseys

[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:15.880]
What's that tomorrow? We're in the red jerseys. They they're right. Yeah, Devils are wearing the white ones

[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.540]
We're in the red jerseys to change our luck. Well, we're gonna win that's I hope all those two okay

[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.840]
Yeah, I'll see them all again. Goldie's go. I mean go punches go

[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.840]
We need Ty Dohme on that team to shake these guys up

[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:33.020]
Maybe get a high stick some of his own guys and shake these bastards up. Okay, wake up sniff the panties man

[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.920]
Some of these guys are like sleepwalking and we're paying the big bucks for the tickets

[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.760]

[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.940]
Neil yes, sir happy New Year. Welcome back to you. Uh listen now

[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:46.040]
I'm sorry about your accident and a related birthday to you too. Thank you so much

[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.320]
And how do you suck us don't forget that? Oh, thank you

[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.400]
Where did you lie? Listen? I you know, I was listening to people on Rick and such yesterday

[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.980]
I know what you said on your show. Yeah, and it was just you know

[00:50:55.980 --> 00:51:01.100]
It's back to the same old crap with some of these people, but you know something George was telling me heard some of it and Rick

[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:06.400]
Is credit said I'm not gonna get stuck into this and I'll leave that to King because he likes to create that that can try for any

[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.580]
Controversy I'm not gonna get stuck to it here. I am not gonna

[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:14.620]
I've already said what I have to say about it and I'm gonna do my own show and I'm not gonna publicize

[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:19.580]
You know the the the Phantom talk network there that you have to keep turning the radio every block

[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:23.660]
You drive up the road because you can't hear any of the stations. I am a wife and bother well

[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:28.700]
That's an idiotic. They cried on F.T.L. for five years desperately to get me to talk about them

[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.620]
And I won't do it. Why should I bother?

[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:35.680]
No Rick or some of my audience doesn't listen to those stations. Neil Rick and such didn't fall for it at all

[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:40.540]
Yeah, you know Rick was upset because you know Bob Green was there and he hates Bob Green

[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.980]
And okay, but let me tell you something. Let me tell you it. This is one thing I do want to say. Yeah, Tom

[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.680]
Jicke has been a friend of mine. I've been in the market for I don't know
