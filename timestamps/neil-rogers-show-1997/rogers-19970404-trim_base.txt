[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100]
610 W I O D. Present the Neil Rogers show.

[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.500]
To talk with Neil, call 622 W I O D and date.

[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.820]
767 W I O D and Broward.

[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.260]
Mobile won an AT&T wireless customer can call toll free at pound I O D.

[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.600]
And now, not only across South Florida, but across the nation and Canada too.

[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.700]
Call toll free at 1-888-474-W I O D.

[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.280]
And now, the Neil Rogers show.

[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.720]
It's Friday, you bastard.

[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.280]
Thanks to the state of California, Ibonics has become an official language.

[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.160]
But on the east coast in Brooklyn, Pisannix is ruling the street.

[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.040]
I used guys check out the f***ing bambenos on that broad and get a load of her poop.

[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.060]
English translation, I really enjoy her company.

[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.020]
So last night, I banged the hell out of this sh** in this real classy joint.

[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.260]
English translation, I made love to her in the back of my Camara.

[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.520]
Yeah, yeah. I'm the main penance director. We're all the youth hang out.

[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.620]
English translation, I'm a janitor at the elementary school.

[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.360]
If you'd like to get your copy of Hooked on Pisannix,

[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.980]
just stuff some money in a plain brown envelope and shove it under the back door of Mario's over on the west side.

[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.220]
And we'll be in touch.

[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.900]
Hey, Pisann, did he didn't say Mario, did he?

[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.760]
I went at Banny Tier, they explored 15 goals for on four of how he'd just buy.

[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.140]
The auger bursting back in, he gives a f***ing bamboos.

[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.640]
He's so, so scoffed, he tied the game.

[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920]
Very on the mute, get it on.

[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.000]
The pen was making four four.

[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.040]
I'm calling on a slick, procternal query on the mute.

[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.420]
Well, that was some game last night to watch,

[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.900]
which of course, unless you had the small dish, you didn't see it too bad.

[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.980]
If you don't have the small dish, what are you thinking about, huh?

[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.960]
So you will get 700 solicitation calls every other day,

[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.900]
but it's worth it.

[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.520]
If you don't have that dish, man, you ain't watching squat.

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.800]
How about those marlins?

[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.980]
Nobody cares, but they're three and three and one.

[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.360]
Exactly right.

[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.400]
And they're doing it.

[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.540]
Alex Fernandez, the view was a major success.

[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.980]
Kona, it's a grand slam.

[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.380]
Nobody cares, but they had 30, what was it?

[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.080]
32,000 people there last night.

[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.340]
You see, in order to make the two and a half million that somebody was writing about the other day

[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.680]
who doesn't have a column today, by the way, and if he did, he still wouldn't apologize to David Albert's dream.

[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.620]
But at any rate, in order to make two and a half million,

[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.260]
they got an average 30,000 a game.

[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.460]
A little more than that, which may not sound like much, you know, at first glance,

[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.400]
since we did three million the first year, but that was the novelty factor.

[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.240]
They got an average at least 30,000 a game.

[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.080]
Just keep that in mind unless you want to lose your baseball team, okay?

[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.400]
I mean, I'm not going, but don't worry about me.

[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.180]
So more stuff in the newspaper again this morning, huh?

[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.180]
More stuff in the sun.

[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.480]
Sentinel, more stuff in the hero.

[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.200]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.880]
At least Barry Jackson's found some other stuff to write about.

[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.340]
Not too exciting.

[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.600]
Is there too much Marlins on TV?

[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.120]
And is that going to hurt the attendance?

[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.940]
Good point, Barry, for a change.

[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.340]
That's an interesting topic.

[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.140]
Do you think there's too many games on?

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.400]
And watching the games free.

[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.460]
If you can sit in your living room comfortably, especially in July and August when it's going to be 140 degrees in the shade,

[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.800]
would you rather sit on your ass at home and watch the game free?

[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.060]
Or would you rather go out there for like 20 or 25 bucks and sweat your ass off and fight with the mosquitoes as big as bowling balls?

[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.000]
That's the question everybody's asking.

[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.620]
So I guess we'll wait and find out.

[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.640]
But then at the end of his article, which this just seems to become positive in our local newspapers lately,

[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.560]
more speculation, more stuff.

[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.800]
Before we get to that, here's Rodgers' quote of the day.

[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.940]
Wait a minute.

[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.720]
Rodgers' quote of the day.

[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.660]
Oh, I'm sorry, quote of the day.

[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.240]
Oh, thank God I didn't take a quote of the day.

[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.880]
Rodgers' Cross, our corporate sales hole, our plastic sales guy who's in the building on Understand.

[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.220]
His quote of the day is,

[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.760]
generosity is giving more than you can and pride is taking less than you need.

[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.660]
Which I think what he's trying to say is pride is working for Paxton taking less than you need.

[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.960]
How do I ride your ass-wing Roberts about that?

[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.040]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.500]
That's the people with their talent checks every month.

[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.000]
Take it less than you need, less than you earned, less than you deserve.

[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.420]
It's the Paxton Way.

[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.840]
Thank you very much, Rodgers.

[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.680]
That's a nice silk suit you're wearing too, by the way.

[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.520]
All plastic people wear nice expensive silk suits.

[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.880]
10.05 at WIOD.

[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.340]
So anyway, Barry Jackson writes today,

[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.680]
as the rumor mill continues all around town, they're all doing it, baby.

[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.860]
He writes WQAM sales staff is telling advertisers that WIOD's Neal Rodgers will join WQAM by October.

[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.300]
But WQAM says it is not ready to make the announcement.

[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.600]
Norman Kent, Roger's attorney says the deal is close.

[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.980]
WQAM has made a multi-million dollar offer that blows away WIOD's offer, Kent said.

[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.920]
End of quote by Barry Jackson.

[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.220]
Pretty short today, Barry.

[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.720]
And thank you so much for not putting in all the misinformation that some people were feeding you out of one of mentioned Jay Hoker by name.

[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.680]
Then anyway, on the inside second page made people in the news again today.

[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.620]
We're getting almost as big as Howard George.

[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.840]
We just mentioned a few of zeros on a paychecks.

[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.680]
People in the news, no ugly picture today, no fat ol ugly picture today.

[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.740]
But Rodgers to pitch for sports station, it says,

[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.860]
and it doesn't have anybody's name signed to this one.

[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.080]
So I guess Jic is too embarrassed to keep putting it as long as they don't put their name on it.

[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.080]
They don't have to say, well, we made him made him another mistake.

[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.500]
The embarrassment factor may be limited.

[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.820]
Rodgers to pitch for sports station, it says, as in opposed to catch, which thank you very much for that.

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.560]
Because there are a lot of people out there wondering, is he going to be pitching wherever he's going to be, or is he going to be catching?

[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.340]
Probably neither, although their softball team is pretty weak.

[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.740]
It says WIOD 610AM talk personality, Neil Rogers, has tendered his resignation to station owner,

[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.760]
Paxon Communications, effective September 30th said Rodgers attorney, Norman Kent, on Thursday night.

[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.080]
Kent also confirmed that Rodgers likely will move to all sports station WQAM 560AM.

[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.320]
WQAM made an offer that blew Paxon out of the water, and Paxon said they couldn't match it Kent said.

[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.940]
Rodgers makes an estimated $500,000 annually on his current contract.

[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.300]
Where do they come up with these numbers?

[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.540]
Wrong. Rodgers announced on the year two weeks ago we had signed a new contract with Paxon through 2002.

[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.380]
However, Paxon never received the signed contract.

[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.340]
Thank God.

[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.700]
I mean, so that's the end of that quote from the Sun Sentinel this morning,

[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.040]
is the speculation continues and on and on it goes, all I can say is,

[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.120]
I don't know.

[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.900]
Here's Miami, hello.

[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.420]
Neil, this is really exciting.

[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.120]
What is that?

[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.460]
That you're getting out of there.

[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.680]
Yeah, who said that?

[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.620]
I guess Jirka did.

[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.860]
Whoever wrote that said, yeah, Norman Kent said it.

[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.560]
No, but Paxon, they're a bunch of idiots.

[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.420]
They let Phil Henry go, they're letting you go.

[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.480]
I mean, two of the greatest talents in radio.

[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.300]
What about the dolphins?

[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.780]
What about the dolphins?

[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.040]
What about the dolphins?

[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.860]
The dolphins, Mandage Default.

[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.200]
Yeah.

[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.980]
What about what's it?

[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.800]
Juan Mendiera.

[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.680]
Are they going to put Alan Burke back mid days?

[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.300]
Dig him up?

[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.600]
Yes.

[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.920]
Are you really going, Neil?

[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.760]
Am I going what?

[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.660]
QAM.

[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.300]
I don't know.

[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.960]
All right, Neil.

[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.320]
Good luck.

[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.120]
You know that old saying, the less said the better?

[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.480]
Yep.

[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.140]
I show up here every day, don't I?

[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.020]
Yep.

[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.820]
Every single day, I show up here.

[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.220]
What Paxon, you're an asshole.

[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:32.680]
Okay.

[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.920]
Thank you so much.

[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.140]
Okay, there's a good call to get us started this morning.

[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.440]
Oh, man.

[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.420]
You know, it's amazing how this time you couldn't,

[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.920]
you couldn't keep anything quiet in this town for more than five minutes if you're like,

[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.240]
if they held a gun, if they stuck a gun deep inside your rectum,

[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.560]
they put an oozzy up in there.

[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.200]
You still couldn't keep it quiet because basically what this town is all about,

[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.540]
it's Yanta Central.

[00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.920]
Everybody's got stories.

[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.240]
Everybody's got stories.

[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.240]
Everybody, not only Joe Zagaki up there with his big eyebrows and loose lip,

[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.480]
everybody is hocking back and forth and blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.560]
And let me say it again.

[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.220]
The limited number of baseball fans we have out there,

[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.580]
they think that the big topic of conversation is that the Marlins are off to this great start,

[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.140]
that Alex Fernandez pitched a good game that Keith Brock,

[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.000]
Kevin Brown pitched a great opening game,

[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.780]
seven inning one, hitter, et cetera, and so on.

[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.760]
They're not talking about that in the dugout.

[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.220]
They're talking about his neal really leaving.

[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.280]
Oh, exactly.

[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.580]
I have that unvery good authority, by the way,

[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.900]
from people who have been very close right there in the locker room,

[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.780]
right up close in personal, right under those steamy shower heads.

[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.860]
That's where I'm getting the information, so make no mistake about that.

[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.240]
So it's an all-request Friday.

[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.200]
It's all we're going to play jingles today.

[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.380]
We got, we're going to kill four hours today because it feels like holiday, doesn't it?

[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.360]
And there was no traffic this morning.

[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.640]
I mean, if people earlier in the week missed their opportunity to get there a lot of this town,

[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.640]
they sure are taking that chance this week at Paxen Headquarters,

[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.360]
a major Messiah, they say, I say,

[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.820]
I say, you say, Messiah.

[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.220]
Here's Delray on a mobile.

[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:07.560]
Hello.

[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.580]
Hello, Neil.

[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.080]
Wow, ten years of listening to you.

[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.460]
I will follow you anywhere.

[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.460]
I don't know if you're going to be leaving or what you're going to be doing,

[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.360]
but wherever you go, we're going to be there.

[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.280]
Yeah, of course.

[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.060]
And, you know, I think everyone is aware of that.

[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.860]
I don't know.

[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.780]
I don't think Paxen really wants you around.

[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.240]
Yeah.

[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.940]
I think deep down inside, they don't want you're kind.

[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.780]
You know, you're spewing all this great stuff and we love it.

[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.080]
Yeah.

[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.400]
But I don't think you fit in.

[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.340]
I mean, they don't want some Jew-fag atheists down here.

[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.320]
No, I don't think so.

[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.600]
I mean, I think they want some total line liberal conservative,

[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.480]
over conservative crazy man out there, breaking into us.

[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.980]
I'll tell you, Rush Limbaugh, they already have the rights to that INZ.

[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.260]
I think it'll be great when they start samolcasting Rush on IOD and IOD.

[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.740]
That should be pretty good.

[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.000]
Don't let them change you.

[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.260]
Don't let them change anything.

[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.340]
Don't let who change me.

[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:54.820]
Anybody.

[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.520]
They're not.

[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.600]
Anybody change you or tell you what to say or do.

[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:57.760]
Yeah.

[00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.240]
They just like you are.

[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.740]
No, Walter Sabos is, we got to have a lot shorter call,

[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.520]
so I have a great day.

[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.180]
And thanks for listening to 610, WIO Day.

[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.800]
We have an open line and they out, I can't stop doing that.

[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.180]
She stopped doing that because I love Brooke and I got a very nice note from her this morning.

[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.820]
I was so angry yesterday and she says that she's not being manipulated by Walt Sabo at all,

[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.060]
that she only keeps the call short when they happen to be boring.

[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.780]
No, wrong.

[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:20.880]
Well, that's what she said.

[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.440]
I mean, I'm not wrong about the manipulation part, but believe me, I mean, just relax.

[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.860]
Once she's here long enough, she'll discover that you can't afford short calls.

[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.240]
Not in this time.

[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.240]
You got a milk one for what each one is worth.

[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.060]
Because if you're going to have like short calls, you better hope that you have like 7,000 calls in three hours,

[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.320]
which is what she's on now from 6 to 9.

[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.700]
And that business about getting, I get, you know, I don't care what anybody says.

[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.980]
That's a contrived thing getting those call it.

[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.860]
We mentioned the call it is a zillion times.

[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.480]
In fact, every time you give the phone number out, which we give them a lot.

[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.240]
We have the phone numbers as part of WIO Day.

[00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.460]
Do you understand what I'm saying?

[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.180]
So rather than saying, thanks for calling 610 to be, oh, I hate that.

[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.200]
I hate it.

[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.000]
It makes my skin crawl.

[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.660]
Not just on this station.

[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.560]
Any station I'm listening to where they're doing talk.

[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.780]
And they say, thanks for calling WRKO.

[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.160]
Oh, get out of here already.

[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.580]
We know what station we're listening to.

[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.820]
Some asshole consultant told you to keep saying that.

[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.440]
See, I hate to break the news to you, but you can keep saying the call letters a million times an hour.

[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.160]
And if people aren't listening, the ones who aren't listening aren't going to hear the call letters.

[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:29.940]
Oh, no.

[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.600]
You didn't say that, did you?

[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.600]
Let me say it again.

[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.560]
Maybe the ones who are listening don't know what they're listening to.

[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:35.960]
Yeah.

[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.680]
Well, if they're listening to WRKO, I mean, I believe that.

[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.440]
Although my good friend, Jerry Williams is still there.

[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.060]
They pump him up with oxygen every morning and he's still alive.

[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.320]
Jerry is 98 years old this week.

[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.720]
He's still on your Hocken at China.

[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.140]
He still sounds exactly the same as he did 35 years ago and he's still doing a job.

[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.120]
Atta boy, Jerry.

[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.720]
Jerry Williams, man, I'll tell you one thing.

[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.640]
Jerry is a great, great, great legendary talent in the history of talk radio.

[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.900]
But when we worked together at WNWS in 1980, I will say this.

[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.140]
He was one of the few people I ever worked with who made me feel beautiful.

[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.880]
That's how ugly, Jerry.

[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.080]
I mean, he's a great guy, but he's got a face and a body for radio.

[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.100]
I mean, I'm ugly, but believe me, Jerry Williams is just a real strain is looking dude.

[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.300]
Isn't it amazing how all of us ugly people wind up on radio?

[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.520]
I mean, beautiful people like what's a guy and meet the press that I can't stand that asshole.

[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:40.100]
That liberal, a licking, what the hell is his name with the real red complexion where they'll always look like his skin is falling apart.

[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.940]
On meet the press, come on.

[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.640]
Tim, I don't want to show him.

[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.600]
Tim, russard.

[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.960]
Oh, God.

[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.160]
Well, he's no Lawrence Spivak.

[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:49.840]
I'll tell you that.

[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.940]
Now, you're not old enough to remember Lawrence Spivak, are you?

[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.520]
Do you remember Bill Monroe who used to say a bastion because he was from New England on the meet the press?

[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.520]
See, that shows the, I believe, the longest running show in America on TV.

[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.180]
The longest running show in North America on TV is hockey, night in Canada.

[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.060]
How do you like that?

[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.360]
But anyway, there used to be a guy named Lawrence Spivak who was the first host of each of the press who was on the front.

[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:18.820]
He had these dark, real dark, black rimmed glasses, you know, and was kind of a short, uh, no me look.

[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.820]
I mean, really, really, no me and homely today.

[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.300]
Lawrence Spivak could never get on the air.

[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.680]
He could never, he wouldn't get on the air for two minutes today.

[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.020]
See, back in the early days in television, if you were like a good journalist, you'd be on the air.

[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.740]
They didn't care what you looked like, but today unless you're like a cannon Barbie doll, forget it, you ain't getting on.

[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:44.240]
Unless you look as lovely as like, say, Brian or cross 1014, a W or like, uh, Dwight Lauderdale or else Sunshine or Al Sunshine who's

[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.960]
Hocking with those arms man. He's Hocking with those big who Dave game or Dave game. He's off the air.

[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.140]
He was a little bit too lovely, like in all parts, like two lovely all over the screen.

[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.700]
Now, maybe when we get HDTV since it's been approved now, we get the big wide screen.

[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.420]
I think Dave game is going to make a comeback.

[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.220]
All right, 1015 at W I O D.

[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.700]
610 W I O D.

[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.640]
Uh, I think it's hard to think, see?

[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.540]
I believe we're ready now, though.

[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.260]
Congratulations, Mr. Jackson. Here's your new baby boy.

[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.880]
Would you prefer a paper or a plastic?

[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.580]
That's the clear. I can't wait to get your room, shall we?

[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.800]
And show you your new pants are fine.

[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.940]
You're my big three dish baby.

[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.260]
What a lovely way to perpetuate my dead appeal, ya.

[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.620]
I'm big three dish baby.

[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:49.540]
Shemou, you won't need a grip, cos I'll cut it up close to beauty.

[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.600]
Oh, I want you to hold it.

[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.560]
Oh, to find you and grow up made.

[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.960]
You'll get all you're deserving.

[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.600]
My love will be unswerving.

[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.360]
Until you reach 13, you'll my big three dish baby.

[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.980]
Come on, sit on that is life.

[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.540]
He has a game to play with you.

[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.800]
Daddy wants you to find the magic three.

[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.480]
Oh, Shemou.

[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.100]
10, 19 and W I O D.

[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:26.800]
What a thought, huh?

[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.240]
Anyway, we have two open lines in day six, two, two, nine, four, six, three.

[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:30.840]
All are proud.

[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.760]
It's gonna be a very slim day today and I'm very well prepared for that.

[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.800]
I would like to pass along a message by the way that the packs and people,

[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.000]
including my close personal friend Peter Bulger,

[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.440]
and that is so much paranoia is really quite unnecessary, okay?

[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.140]
We are not gonna be erasing all the stuff out of the DCS.

[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.060]
We're not gonna be spiriting stuff out of here.

[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.400]
We're not gonna be doing anything devious or devious.

[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.520]
Well, maybe devious, but certainly not devious.

[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.120]
And I just continue showing up every day and George does the same.

[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.840]
And we continue doing our damnedest and best and banging our head against the wall

[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.440]
to try to stimulate a couple of calls out here and entertain the troops.

[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.620]
And they'll just do it.

[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.100]
But for some strange reason, there seems to be this lack of trust that exists.

[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.860]
Like, which day are they gonna come in there and we're gonna come in the next day

[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.900]
and the whole place will be empty.

[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.560]
Now, we have had people that we've worked with over the last several years

[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.440]
who were like that.

[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.420]
I don't want to mention anybody by name, but I'm sure you can think of one or two, George,

[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.020]
who, if you like, left on a Friday and came in Monday morning,

[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.540]
maybe everything in the building might be gone, might,

[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.420]
or maybe most of the stuff that was movable and wasn't tied down.

[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.260]
By the way, that is a very nice Sony TV that we have up in the wall.

[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.440]
And that other monitor, that NEC monitor,

[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.060]
is looking pretty damn appealing to me right now too, that you come down to it.

[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.600]
I would love for that to be my home computer.

[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.280]
So when do we have to turn in our card key?

[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.240]
Oh, man, talk about lack of trust.

[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.720]
It just wounds me to the quick as a radio professional of so many years

[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.000]
having worked with some of these people in the past

[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.640]
that their paranoia is so deep that they really believe

[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.780]
that we're gonna come in here and spirit crap out of here.

[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.720]
I mean, what is in here anyway that we would want to spirit out of here?

[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.520]
Like, I think, it's hard to think, see?

[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.720]
Oh, we can't do a show without that.

[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.280]
Yeah.

[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.480]
Oh, let's take that.

[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.100]
What about...

[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.660]
Stake in touch.

[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.960]
The new IoT.

[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.040]
What about that? Should we leave that?

[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:24.960]
How about...

[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.480]
We apologize.

[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:26.280]

[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.660]
We're taking that.

[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.640]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:31.320]
Neil.

[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.580]
Yes, sir. Happy Friday.

[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.480]
Then back to you.

[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.700]
Happy April 4th.

[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.100]
Yeah.

[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.860]
You'll quad-throw the Abriel.

[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.400]
Yep, that's it.

[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.520]
Hey, mainly just calling to thank you for the hockey tickets

[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.840]
that you gave me about a month ago.

[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.580]
Which game was that?

[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.260]
Bruins.

[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:45.880]
Oh.

[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.580]
And the Bruins.

[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.440]
Yeah, we lost the game, but...

[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.600]
That was bad.

[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.520]
Against the girls team, which by the way, the Rangers had a 5-1 lead.

[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.580]
They had a 4-0 and then a 5-1 lead last night against the Bruins.

[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.000]
And the Bruins made it 5-4 and they made it pretty damn nerve-wracking

[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.860]
there in the last couple of minutes for the Rangers who just had a mediocre win last night.

[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.080]
Well, at home.

[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:07.740]
At home.

[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.460]
I was calling about that and I just wanted to give a little message to Paxton

[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.880]
that I listened to QAM up until 10 o'clock.

[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.020]
I listened to you from 10 to 2.

[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:18.460]
Yeah.

[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.360]
And then I flipped back over to QAM.

[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.040]
I'm sorry to say, but...

[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.200]
Mm-hmm.

[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:23.860]
So it...

[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.240]
Oh my God.

[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:24.980]
I'm sorry?

[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.220]
I said...

[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.660]
Oh my God.

[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.780]
Oh my...

[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.780]
If you happen to leave, I don't think I would be listening to IOD anymore

[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.760]
and I have a feeling there's a lot of people who listen the same hours that I do.

[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.180]
Well, we'll pass it along and thanks for listening to 610 W IOD.

[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:39.720]
Okay.

[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.700]
And have a great weekend.

[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.160]
You too.

[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:41.660]
Bye-bye.

[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:42.540]
Okay.

[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.160]
We have an open line in date 622-9463-622-W IOD.

[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.720]
See, when you give those numbers out of many times,

[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.720]
you're getting those call letters in each and every time.

[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.600]
I just mentioned that for all the consultants out there who think they're really sharp.

[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.540]
Instead of doing this very obvious and painfully contrived thing of, oh, you're on 610 W IOD.

[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.420]
And thanks for calling 610 W IOD.

[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.500]
And by the way, this is say, uh, enough already.

[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.420]
I can't stand it.

[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.320]
No matter what the call letters are.

[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.740]
Enough with the crap already, okay?

[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.460]
It's bad.

[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.120]
It's annoying.

[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.580]
And the last thing that we want to do, except on this show, of course,

[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.620]
is annoyed the audience.

[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.520]
The whole purpose of this show is to annoy the audience.

[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.740]
So this show is an exception.

[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.400]
But generally speaking, you would assume that most of the other shows,

[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.500]
one of the things that they would not want to do,

[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.460]
is annoy the crap out of the audience.

[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.840]
When we fail to annoy the audience, we ain't be doing our job.

[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.500]
Here's Palm Beach on a mobile.

[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.140]
Hello.

[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.820]
Hi, Neil.

[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.520]
When you're home, I went up to the second.

[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.180]
Sounds like Woody to me.

[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:37.900]
What's that?

[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.080]
I said, yeah, have a great day.

[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.180]
We have an open line on the mobile one purple line at Palm IOD.

[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.660]
We have one in day at 622-24, wasn't it?

[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.420]
Or may it might not have been.

[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.340]
I don't say you sounded too much like Woody for me.

[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.400]
Yeah, close enough.

[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.580]
And the board goes back.

[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.840]
Two open lines in Broward, 767-9463.

[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.000]
So who did you like best on concentration?

[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]
Hugh Downs or Art James?

[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:01.820]
Who else did concentration?

[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.820]
Who did classic?

[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.600]
Wasn't Alex Trebek, was it?

[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.320]
Classic concentration, which, huh?

[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.080]
He might have.

[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:09.820]
No.

[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.620]
Hugh Downs did it for years.

[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.900]
Then Art James came along.

[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.040]
And he done it and the show too.

[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.740]
And then they brought back classic concentration,

[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.520]
which was like, it might have been Alex Trebek,

[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.280]
who was Canadian by the way,

[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.540]
so he can't be all bad because he's not a frog Canadian.

[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.040]
But on the other hand, it's quite annoying with that jeopardy thing.

[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.580]
Man, people at watch jeopardy should be shot.

[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.720]
Anybody at watch is that show as a pseudo-electual

[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.800]
and a major asshole.

[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:35.880]
Jeopardy.

[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:36.820]
Thank you.

[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.600]
Oh, I hate that.

[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.060]
You just watch it because you can't get any of the answers.

[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.080]
What?

[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:40.940]
Yeah, right.

[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:41.820]
I don't want the answers.

[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.880]
If I know the answers, I know I'm in trouble.

[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.700]
If I watch that show and I knew any of the answers,

[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.500]
I know I'm an asshole.

[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.460]
I do quite well.

[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.320]
So Don's parto, let's see.

[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.240]
Don's parto is the answer.

[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.520]
Now, who, the first one was, uh, uh,

[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.240]
jeopardy was art Fleming.

[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.340]
Was there somebody in between him and Alex Trebek or not?

[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.020]
No.

[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.980]
I think they're bringing back, uh,

[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.960]
what was the little guy that offed himself on, uh, family feud?

[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.480]
Ray Combs.

[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.120]
I think they're bringing back Ray Combs,

[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.540]
and they're going to just sit him in a chair,

[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.740]
and prop open his mouth and have all his teeth sticking out

[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.060]
and see if he can tell the difference between him and Wink Bartondale.

[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.140]
Maybe they'll bring back Jack Berry.

[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.220]
Joker, Joker, Joker.

[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.040]
Oh, God.

[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:21.940]
Poor Jack.

[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.480]
Too much time in a slammer, Jack.

[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.660]
He was never the same after that.

[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.480]
Rest in peace.

[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.160]
Remember Jack Berry?

[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.080]
You don't remember Jack Berry from the Joker's wild even?

[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:32.720]
Oh, okay.

[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.120]
But that was when he was old and feeble,

[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.600]
and guess what?

[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.720]
When he was younger and less feeble,

[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.720]
he still was just as bad and amateurish.

[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.220]
And also was, he was involved in 21.

[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.560]
Didn't you see that movie?

[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.620]
Which I never did get to see, by the way.

[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.340]
And I hear it's very good.

[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.360]
You said it's about Charles Van Doren and Elfriedovon Nardroff.

[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.380]
And the fake show that was, um,

[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.560]
that was Jack Berry and Dan Inwright.

[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.380]
Is that who it was?

[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.440]
Very good.

[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.780]
And it was a fixed show.

[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:56.500]
Yeah.

[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:00.020]
And Charles Van Doren, who came from this very wealthy New England family.

[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.120]
Scholars.

[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.600]
You know, of scholars of brilliant like Blunos people from like, you know,

[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.740]
Boston University and Fordham and MIT and whatever they were from.

[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.020]
They were both college professors.

[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:11.280]
Right.

[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.880]
And Charles Van Doren was on air, taking the big fix.

[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.200]
Taking the big fix.

[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.960]
And I remember one time on the $64,000 question,

[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.500]
which was, and I was with Hal March, which was one of the other shows that was in the scandal that was fixed.

[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.160]
And they had this guy on there.

[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.200]
Oh, they, I also remember they had Winston Churchill's son on Winston Churchill, Jr.

[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.500]
He missed the, let's see, they start with 16.

[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.420]
He missed the second question, the $32 question, which is like, what day of the week it is?

[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.320]
Ah, I, I'm sorry, you're wrong, go.

[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:39.760]
Seriously.

[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.380]
So here, I guess they were, they were too embarrassed to fix it with him.

[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.020]
That would have been bad.

[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.480]
You know, the Queen would have been pithed off.

[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.100]
And the Queen of England too.

[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.980]
But anyway, there was a guy on there one time.

[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.680]
And Hal March blurred it out the answer.

[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.460]
The first name.

[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.240]
And in fact, I'm going to tell you what a memory I've got.

[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.580]
It was a picture for the Cleveland, it was some question about sports.

[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.760]
And the name of the picture was Jim Bagby.

[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.120]
How do I remember this?

[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.140]
This is a hundred years ago.

[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.640]
And the, this is old Farts in the booth.

[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.280]
You know, every line of these is a miracle.

[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.040]
Here wasn't working.

[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.040]
He couldn't hear their coaching him.

[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:12.780]
It's Jim.

[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.520]
He couldn't hear it.

[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.680]
So Hal March said, oh, we know you know it.

[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.720]
It's right on the tip of your tongue.

[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.020]
It's for $16,000.

[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.440]
Come on, you can do it.

[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:19.940]
It's Jim.

[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.540]
Oh, excuse me.

[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.900]
And there was a long pause.

[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.980]
And he said, Jim Bagby.

[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.520]
And Hal March is absolutely right.

[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.320]
I'll take any responsibility about my end.

[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:29.780]
That was it.

[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.640]
Sirius, I'm not, I remember that one like it was yesterday.

[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:33.840]
Jim Bagby.

[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.300]
How could I remember that?

[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.960]
That is, that's frightening the way the human mind works.

[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.460]
A man who is so feeble.

[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.980]
A man who's got such bad Alzheimer's that he can't remember where his house is.

[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.340]
He needs a compass and a roadmap, meaning me every day.

[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.840]
They have to lead me home with it.

[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.300]
With it, leapy Lee shows, brings all the arrows and points him in the right direction.

[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.400]
But I can remember Jim Bagby and Hal March on the $64,000 question a zillion years ago

[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.120]
before almost any of you were born.

[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.080]
That is terrifying.

[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.500]
So the answer is, I hate you, pretty boy.

[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.480]
If you watch, you're pretty man.

[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.260]
You're not a friend of mine.

[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.280]
I'm going to tell you that right now.

[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:08.720]
What?

[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.520]
Oh, here's, here's an old guy.

[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.440]
In fact, there used to be a guy with the same name as this guy before I tell everybody who this is,

[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.460]
who was on the $64,000 challenge.

[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:23.580]
Yeah, he was so bad they had to have experts over at the desk, because he couldn't remember the answer.

[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.360]
Sonny Fox.

[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.060]
Hi there.

[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:26.800]
Remember him?

[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.260]
Hey, by the way, are you going to take my drop with you?

[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.160]
Am I going to take, hi, this is Sonny Fox.

[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:32.840]
You bet.

[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.700]
We want you to keep your, so how are you doing since you did such a good, I guess,

[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.940]
too good of a job filling in there on the morning show.

[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.820]
Yeah, well, it's really amazing radio.

[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.500]
You know, you're lucky, or you're not lucky, you're smart.

[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.880]
You have a good manager and a lawyer.

[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.560]
I've been on my own since mine went to jail.

[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.080]
Yeah.

[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.360]
And I don't know after seven.

[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.540]
I can't imagine who that was.

[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.020]
After 17 years of the top five radio show, I can't get a job.

[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.720]
It's a great, because I don't want to leave time.

[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.300]
I love it here.

[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.580]
Yeah, but the one good thing to notice is that since you left that morning show on magic,

[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.040]
their numbers are tumbling like a brick.

[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:04.880]
Oh, what are they?

[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.380]
I don't even know.

[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.580]
They're just, they just keep going down and down.

[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.200]
I mean, I can't even see that good anymore to see numbers that small.

[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.420]
That's true.

[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.600]
By the way, you talk about game shows.

[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.020]
Yeah.

[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.420]
I don't know if it was Hal March, somebody else, but do you remember another fixed show called Dotto?

[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:20.400]
Sure.

[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.820]
They used to draw the lines.

[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.060]
They have to guess what the picture was.

[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.180]
But who was the host on that?

[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.340]
Um, you said his name a few minutes ago.

[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:27.300]
Not Jack Berry.

[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.960]
No, he was so wrinkled by the time he got done.

[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.520]
He was like an hour.

[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.500]
I always are James.

[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.280]
No, not our James.

[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.520]
No, name out of it.

[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.240]
A few downs.

[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:36.460]
No.

[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.420]
Uh, Ray Comes.

[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.500]
No, that was a little years later.

[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.620]
Uh, Tom Kennedy.

[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:42.500]
No.

[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.160]
Jack Nars.

[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.000]
Maybe he was Jack Nars.

[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:45.900]
Yeah, probably.

[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.200]
Jack Nars was on all those real bogus shows.

[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:48.860]
Right.

[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:49.980]
But sunny Fox.

[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.220]
And Jack, Jack Nars was like Tom Kennedy's brother-in-law or something.

[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:53.960]
Oh, really?

[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200]
And then there was Alan Ludden.

[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.020]
Well, anyway, if you need someone to replace you, let me know.

[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.560]
Oh, for a convey.

[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.400]
Did, uh, classic concentration brother.

[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:01.860]
He's dead.

[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.700]
Also, uh, you know, who else is dead?

[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.400]
Alan Ludden.

[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.900]
And now that he's dead, we can mention he was a fag.

[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.160]
And he was married to Betty White, who's, uh, we think, is something else.

[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.020]
Yeah, I was going to say, you remember who he was married to, right?

[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:12.460]
Betty White.

[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.280]
Yeah.

[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.540]
Does that answer all your questions?

[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.040]
Yeah, I, I, I'll do that.

[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.560]
Let them all do your show for you.

[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:17.960]
Okay.

[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:18.420]
Okay.

[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:18.840]
See you, I.

[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.300]
Good luck.

[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.160]
And back to you.

[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:20.540]
Okay.

[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:21.780]
sunny Fox there.

[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.360]
How do you like that?

[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.340]
I don't know what he's wishing me good luck in, because I'm here every day.

[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.660]
I show up day after day after day after day after day.

[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.320]
And everybody's making all kinds of guesses and coming up with all kinds of dates.

[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:35.020]
I will be here in this chair every day except vacation days and or six days, six days.

[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.340]
I'll be here for a while.

[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.220]
1031 at WIOD.

[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:39.780]
Oh.

[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.880]
16 WIOD.

[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.960]
When the dawn is in town, she's not listening to us.

[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.560]
Oh, Neil, my queen.

[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.140]
God.

[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.980]
Say, boy, let me see your lessons there.

[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.720]
What's the problem, officer?

[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.180]
Go a little fast, won't you?

[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.100]
Say, what's in the back seat?

[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.100]
Uh, nothing.

[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:03.940]
Crack rock.

[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.880]
Sitting in his back seat, I said crack rock.

[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.740]
You can sell on the street, you can smoke it.

[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:19.400]
And you'll catch a good buzz just don't get pulled over by the fuzz gay cop.

[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.360]
Singing with a big band, he's a gay cop.

[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.000]
His nice stick in his hand, he got busted.

[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:34.080]
With three pounds of dope, so bent over and thick of the soap.

[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.360]
The party's over now at J.A.I.L.

[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.680]
You got busted and at J.A.I.L.

[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:49.020]
You were once a big dog, then you made a big switch.

[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.780]
And Jill, you're just a fuzz bitch.

[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.800]
The party's over now at J.A.I.L.

[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.560]
You got busted and at J.A.I.L.

[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.280]
Probably be great radio to follow that up with prison bitch or with...

[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280]
Stop us a night!

[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.220]
We have two open lines in date, 6-2-2-9-463-6-2-2.

[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.520]
Max is in the other room walking around with a big smile on his pulse.

[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.820]
He got a cigar as a size of an elephant's repository in there now.

[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.200]
He's got a big one on a cigar too.

[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.340]
And he's on a way out.

[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.640]
He's leaving. He's to them.

[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.500]
Oh man. When he leaves, I'll tell you all the stuff that he said.

[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.040]
And by the way, I echo those emotions.

[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.080]
Anyway, let's go to Hollywood. Hello.

[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.340]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.340]
God. I hope you... I hope Rick and Suds...

[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.600]
Are they gonna leave, too?

[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.660]
Are they gonna leave, what?

[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.460]
The station.

[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.420]
Why would they do that? They have a contract through the rest of this year.

[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.780]
I know, but after you're gone, man.

[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.460]
I hope they don't have a no-compete cloth because they need to mine.

[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.140]
They're gonna force packs in the fire if you go.

[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.520]
Yeah.

[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.120]
I never looked at it that way.

[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.540]
Hey, if I should leave here, they'd be the big banana on the block.

[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.180]
Yeah, but the...

[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.860]
They'd be the big enchilada.

[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.680]
They're gonna have some bruises on those bananas.

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.840]
Well, sometimes you get a bruise on your banana, but you just keep pushing.

[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.720]
Hey, both. They just don't understand, man.

[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.600]
People listen to talent and not the station.

[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.000]
Right.

[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.800]
Well, they don't... they just don't get it.

[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.640]
How many times have you heard me say that in the last six months?

[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.940]
These people don't get it.

[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.260]
They didn't get it before. They don't get it now. They don't do not get it.

[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:15.940]
They never will.

[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.120]
But I'll tell you, the light bulb stations that have less than a one-shear,

[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.740]
they're great with those.

[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.100]
It's like... they're fodder. It's fodder for their thing.

[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.420]
fodder for their...

[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.040]
Like he said in the Godfather, for your fodder, for your fodder.

[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.100]
And have a great pan. Thanks for listening to 610-W-I-O-Day.

[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.940]
We have an open line a day.

[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.400]
It's 622. I love your brook, but God, if I ever hear you say that again,

[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.940]
I would never hit a woman, but I will come in here with a rusty 2x4

[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.200]
and at least hit something in here, not you, but...

[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.460]
Oh, man, it gives me the willies. It makes my skin crawl.

[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.060]
I get chills and fever and...

[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:49.980]
Oh!

[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.300]
And start thinking about Bubonic, Plague, and Leoporcy and everything when I hear that.

[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.740]
It's just... I don't know what there is.

[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.960]
Open line and Broward, 7679-463.

[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.320]
Anybody see that Pengwood's Hartford game last night?

[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.420]
Like I said, what a game that was. Oh, sorry. I don't want to talk about Honky.

[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.000]
Anybody see that Marlon Gidden? See one second of that.

[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.160]
Was that on? I guess it was.

[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.080]
Did not see one second of Alex Fernandez,

[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.680]
even with a 300-pound ass, he still beat the crap out of the Cubs.

[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.560]
And I understand I had a frantic call from a Norman Kent,

[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.900]
and I thought this must be something important about all his crap,

[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.760]
and all Mark Grace just pulled it.

[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.820]
And I said, God, I wish I would have seen that.

[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.340]
He pulled us something or other poor Mark Grace and then Sandberg made two errors on opening day.

[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.840]
The Cubs, as usually, have liked that big, big black albatross hanging over their necks.

[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.060]
Even Stanley Dancer can't save him with albatross.

[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.200]
Even Bert James from Windsor, Ontario.

[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.620]
Even Harry Harvey couldn't save albatross and his net of shame.

[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.720]
By the way, Nia Tross is going to make an appearance at the Pompato Park in December.

[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.740]
I just thought I would mention that.

[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.960]
Just thought I'd tossed it in there, okay?

[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.400]
And by the way, Fat Rich's horse came in fifth last night,

[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.300]

18M old lady she got her pissed.

[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:24.760]
Yeah.

[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.260]
And a plunge of her brains out.

[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.440]
But you had a good time though right?

[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:27.840]
Yeah.

[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:28.420]
There you go.

[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.260]
That's all that counts.

[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.280]
You only live once man.

[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:30.880]
Yeah.

[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:31.540]
It's only money.

[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.780]
It's great and too.

[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.460]
I wouldn't get one of them small dishes.

[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.040]
Right.

[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.620]
And the cable come to give it some hard time.

[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.520]
I ripped the cable on them.

[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.000]
I've opened the door and slung it in there.

[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.180]
I'm going to stick it up for fun.

[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:40.780]
All right.

[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:41.460]
Excellent.

[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.640]
They sure will try to get some.

[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.160]
All right.

[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.380]
But I cannot do a shameless request.

[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:45.960]
Yes sir.

[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.720]
If you still got that one where my friend, Klim,

[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.020]
who lives in a big double wide,

[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.540]
remember that one?

[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.140]
It's been a while.

[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.360]
My friend, Klim lives in a big double wide.

[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:54.680]
Yeah.

[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.120]
Because my friend, Klim, lives in a big double wide.

[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.040]
It's not a...

[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.180]
Sure.

[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.060]
Whatever you say.

[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.300]
I think you just sung it.

[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.360]
You do done it.

[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:04.640]
Yeah.

[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.040]
It's not that one that I've just been circumcised.

[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.540]
But I know you got that one.

[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.700]
I've just been circumcised.

[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.040]
Yeah.

[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.940]
We have such a thing as that.

[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:14.480]
Yeah.

[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.440]
We don't have that.

[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.060]
We're talking about a leg like Tina Turner.

[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.680]
Oh, just been circumcised.

[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.060]
Yeah.

[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.600]
You've got to get the names right.

[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.660]
Okay pal.

[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:21.940]
Okay.

[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:22.520]
Let's do this.

[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:22.940]
See ya.

[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.600]
Yeah.

[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.460]
Yeah.

[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:23.600]
Yeah.

[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.560]
Yeah.

[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:32.700]

[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:37.560]
Yeah.

[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:38.860]

[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:38.860]

[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:38.860]

[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:38.860]

[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:39.240]
Yeah.

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.300]

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.300]

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.300]

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.300]

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.300]

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.300]

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.300]

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.300]

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.300]

[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.300]

[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:45.780]

[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:48.420]
Yeah.

[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.800]
Okay.

[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:02.600]

[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:02.600]

[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:02.720]
Okay.

[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:02.720]

[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:02.720]

[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:02.720]

[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:02.720]

[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.600]
You had that bass for me.

[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:08.600]

[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:08.600]

[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.360]
Is it the bass, Em?

[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:11.920]
Oh okay.

[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.060]
These music triplets,白...

[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.060]

[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.060]

[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.820]
I like it.

[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.020]
Try.

[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:18.400]

[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:18.400]

[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:18.400]

[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:18.400]

[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.600]
Wow. 1042 at WIOD. I wanted it. And I guess we better do the break, okay? Because it's

[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.500]
an all-request Friday. We got a lot of pressure here. Come up with stuff that we never heard

[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:39.480]
of before, like Clemen the Double Y. We have an open line in Broward, 7679463, 7677WIOD.

[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.380]
And thanks for listening, by the way, to whatever this is. So anyway, if you want to put a

[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.780]
big round run in your post like Max has got right now in the other room, he's got a big,

[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:55.960]
dark round run in his post. 610 WIOD. I can have an orgasm just driving down I-95.

[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:13.740]
We got what you need. It's the morning show. You're waking musically. Can you believe this?

[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:20.420]
When the daylight's breaking, your radio is making. I went into this, you know, the thing you got here,

[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:25.080]
the book for the rock comedy stuff. And I had something specific that I wanted to play and I looked

[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.520]
it up and I thought, hey, here it is. I found it. And I put my finger on it and it's not the right thing.

[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:36.300]
How do you like that? It's number 180 and I got 180 on the thing. I'm like, what's this? What's

[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:45.540]
this? This number 180? Week of 11695. Oh, it's the wrong week. Uh-oh. What does that mean?

[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:52.480]
But it still says 180. Yeah, but I got what it's 180 on the sheet for 116 and 1113. This is 1113

[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:59.540]
and 1120. Oh my God. Wow. It's probably another part of our plot that we got to screw this whole

[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:04.620]
library up, isn't it? Which I had nothing to do with that. I don't- boy, that is a frightening thing.

[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:09.960]
Now, what about this other one? Should I try the other one? Because this one says, oh, God.

[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:15.940]
Oh, you know something? Somebody screwed up because this is a contemporary comedy network disc.

[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:22.020]
Not the rock. This is a contemporary stinking. It's a CC and- oh, and it's a CC and like I said,

[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:26.280]
I screwed up. I didn't realize you put that crap in there. Did you- did you know that you put

[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:32.020]
this crap in here? Yeah, sure. Yeah, they, you know, we want that crap. Nobody wants to hear that.

[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.560]
Just hanging around in envelopes and stuff. In fact, let's leave that stuff. Nobody wants that.

[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.480]
Of course, we're leaving that stuff. Oh, Jesus. I was going to clean it up the clutter and get

[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.660]
everything out of those, uh, see, see, and I would wish that on a light bulb. They wouldn't play

[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:49.020]
that crap. But did you hear that thing? Two discs in each slot. Oh, good. Golly Miss Molly.

[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:53.100]
And look what I just did. I'm so nervous now. I'm taking the disc out of the thing which you already

[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:58.400]
got it in. That's how panicky I am because these things are mislabeled and they're going to start

[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.240]
getting all paranoid. Oh, we know it. It's a plot. We do. You couldn't trust that son of a bitch.

[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.880]
Don't trust that little lost pick either. How much for a kiss? Thank God. How much for a kiss?

[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.600]
Could I get it for an equal could I get it for a quarter in cost

[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:19.120]
for money that I'll miss? How much for one? How much for a

[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:37.840]
good deal? No, can I touch your

[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:43.820]
I need can I touch your I need good attention for a nickel could I touch it for a

[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:53.000]

[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.640]

[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.880]
hung up on them it's this this concept it's a Walter Sable thing I don't care

[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.340]
anybody denies it because we had a seminar way back in October and Walter

[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.540]
Sable went up there and told us that the the shorter you keep the calls the younger

[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.760]
the listeners which of course is ridiculous right on the face of it because you

[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.780]
can keep the short calls to two seconds and if you're not talking about something

[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.420]
that young people on here about they're not going to listen anyway so what is

[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:04.680]
that head you know but you're talking about not to be a yet calling yeah not to be

[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:09.300]

worthy yeah who was that new chick they got on I'm forced to turn over to

[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.660]
somebody else yeah I don't blame him and they had Tom jicca was on last night

[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:26.140]
you're talking about how Neil's doing this and Neil's doing that yeah guess who

[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:31.180]

[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.160]
this Neil and you're just was he serious when he was saying that you know I

[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:02.920]
believe he was he's being keen on this station he keeps saying that again like if

[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.740]
they don't like Neil the Jew they're gonna like Steve did you yeah yeah but I do

[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.660]
got to say one thing for you Neil I think if I think someone else had said it I

[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.540]
think everybody who listens to a that's not listening to your show is listening

[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:18.660]
to the clam probably yeah so it's just gonna be a double killing if you leave

[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.020]

[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.720]
idiots who call up and say you're not friendly at the games and that's that's a

[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:41.200]
bunch of B.S. B.S. bunch of bull crap I came over to you with my kids during the

[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:45.500]
pantheist Toronto game and you could not have been more gracious that's right I

[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:49.240]
mean it was it was fantastic oh now I'm getting beat it's probably one of the

[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:53.180]
solicitors that call your house uh-huh so you're not home for the call in me yeah

[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:59.400]
and um second thing you were talking about the game shows um we think over here

[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.740]
that Robert C. Lewis did concentration after he was down Robert C. Lewis

[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.960]
Robert C. Lewis was dead by for a hundred years by that time well then this Robert

[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:14.680]
C. Lewis what show is he on way way way way back I loved Robert C. Lewis I liked

[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:19.020]
him he was a professional panelist he did to tell the truth with with Tom Poston

[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:23.800]
and Colin right right Peggy Cass and Orthon Bean right he had black glasses and a

[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:28.640]
list he had a list Robert C. Lewis had a list kind of like a speech him

[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.680]
pet of it I know remember that I'll tell you show I really loved was Panamom quiz

[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:38.020]
with Mike Stooky oh that's before my time Stooky Stooky Stooky and Hans Connryd was

[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:43.020]
on there I remember him and uh and who was the little guy that used to be on

[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:48.460]
uh the tonight show the first one the a little of a short guy more Amsterdam oh

[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:54.380]
yeah he was always on Panamom quiz am I any ginkgold and uh-hans Connryd I remember them

[00:46:54.380 --> 00:47:01.120]
yeah um and now we of course have stuck with art Fleming who we hate we like we like

[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:06.300]
art Fleming though well what's art Fleming on well he did uh- jeopardy the original

[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.640]

[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:21.720]

some of the stuff in there nice going George like I said so we might do that because I love Larry

[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:22.820]
Lou Jack back in the days when he was lucid and when he was on the air underlining the lucid part

[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:29.500]
it's eleven thirteen at w i o d ten w i o d it's not your radio

[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.620]
it's just real staticie

[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:39.140]
and now you are with our vaginous cell for my feminine itching I depend on vaginous cell

[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:44.000]
cream to stop it instantly and for a painful burning itch I get maximum strength vaginous cell

[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.420]
for even stronger relief excuse me yes speaking as someone who doesn't have a vagina I have what

[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:53.980]
may seem like a silly question uh yeah what exactly would be wrong with you that you would have

[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:58.980]
all this itching oh well many number of things uh uh general irritation for example yes I

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:03.200]
understand that but I guess it's the painful burning part you mentioned that alarms me oh I mean

[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.880]
this constant burning and itching would seem to indicate some kind of problem that might actually

[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:11.200]
require like legitimate medical attention vaginous cell can stop the burning and itching yes but what

[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:15.400]
I'm asking is does it cure whatever's causing all the burning and itching what do you mean causing

[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.020]
I mean sure you might not be actively burning and itching anymore but you can still be a carrier

[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:23.720]
carry or you know some kind of typhoid Mary of sexual disease oh come on admit it you've been

[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:27.380]
sleeping around you think I'm stupid you think I don't know a painful burning itch being

cross they really don't have a sense of humor that's right and you two uptight they're too

[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:22.140]
uptight they're humorless like all these women that pretend they don't listen to the show because

[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:26.360]
if they admit that they listen to what they think that makes them something yeah like sick and

[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:31.780]
perverted which they probably are anyway well I really like you personally because the world is

[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:36.320]
gone mad no matter what what color we are I mean we all face in a lot of problems in this world

[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:40.460]
today you have to have a sense of humor that's right it's the only way to get by especially when you

[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:44.620]
work for these people you have a great sense of humor you've got to laugh your ass off that's

[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:50.060]
right well keep up the good work and now can I have a request if it's something that I might find

[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:54.340]
because people are asking for some real off the wall crap today well I don't know I don't remember

[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:59.880]
the song exactly oh but it's about this one we're saying that our brother's a corn I think is

[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:07.560]
elders something she would bother the corn but it's not a song no it's a it's a bit it's a thing

[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:15.160]
I got it okay have a right day pal you too and put the butter away so yeah we have an open line

[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:24.300]

[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:28.500]
quickly now oh they're not doing that aren't they are they really doing that that would be so

[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:35.240]
hi this is Jocelyn elders and I'm mad mad at those right wing sons of bitches that force Bill

[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:40.900]
Clinton to fire me just who do the hell they think they are all I was trying to do was deal with

[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:46.880]
the reality of sex and teenagers maybe if Jesse Helms at Buffett the champ or Newt Gingrich had

[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:52.220]
butters of corn a little more there wouldn't be so uptight vlogging the dog never hurt anybody

[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:57.540]
and if people did a little more of it we might save some lives hell if Clinton just stayed home

[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:03.220]
and spanked the monkey he'd even be in less hot water teaching kids about masturbation would be no

[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:09.040]
big deal we could even take some standard teaching tools and just twist them around a little bit like

[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:15.500]
C-Dick run when you see dick run get to the doctor because you picked up a bad case of

[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:21.420]
crouch crickets folks we got to get real about the realities of the world we live in there are too

[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:26.960]
many kids out there taking a baloney ride and parking there y'all in hair harbor now if we just

[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:33.840]
teach them to stay home and paddle the pickle pump the python walk the door wax the carrot or

[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:39.920]
tickle the taco we'd all be better off and that's all I have to say now I'm going home now and see if

[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:50.340]
mr. elders wants to pop it in the toaster and hail oyster and buzz the rillow it's 1121 a W

[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:54.120]
I would do its jingles it's request it's a fun Friday at the end of the holiday week which

[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.540]
everybody is gone which good ridden's to him because there's very little traffic

[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:03.500]
boy that was a miracle this morning I thought man I'm whipping in my brand new 97 corvette about 165

[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:08.540]
miles an hour right east do east on 595 and there ain't nobody inside and I'm loving every second of it

[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:16.040]
that is by the way a very very very fast car I mean a frighteningly I finally punched it yesterday

[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:21.000]
just for the hell of it I'm tired of babying that car it's got like 400 miles on it now and I'm

[01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:25.330]
going to sit there and baby that thing and drive it like 110 you know I got to get up to 160 anyway

[01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:31.130]
and I really punched that thing and it is it's does it very quietly though it's a very bizarre

[01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:37.570]
a kind of a ride very quietly and very subtly it just about a bing smokes down a road and leaves

[01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:43.750]
everybody behind like what the hell just happened like a rocket ship that's right unlike the 96

[01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:48.790]
which as it leaves everybody way back up the road you feel it in your foot and the car too you can

[01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:53.670]
feel it it's got that real a little heavier not like the old vets where it felt like so heavy like

[01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:58.950]
your ass was scraping on the road which is a real bad sports car ride so the good part of it is I

[01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:03.890]
got two corvettes but I'm like in the past they're different cars isn't that a great way to look at

[01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:12.190]
it I think it's a brilliant way to look at it here's a Fort Lauderdale hello no yes sir I'm calling to

[01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:19.030]
take a little issue with you on this David Halberstrand thing I agree with you who is this Michael

[01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:29.750]
Mayo doing a voice now take issue with me about what well I agree with you that yeah he has a

[01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:36.370]
right to say what he said and and I I agree with you he should not have been fine and so what so what

[01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:42.550]
he took sides with Mark shot when she said what she said because March shot is a well-known bigot

[01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:46.490]
and racist and anybody who knows if you read jikas column in a paper which you probably didn't

[01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:51.310]
last Saturday he points out that people in no David Halberstrand know that he's a real liberal guy

[01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:56.150]
and he's done a lot of things for liberal causes and racial harmony and so on and he's a real

[01:03:56.150 --> 01:04:00.130]
a good guy he's not a bigot he doesn't have an ounce of bigotry in his body he didn't mean it that

[01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:05.130]
way whereas March shot when she says it she means it well now I'm saying is it everybody you hear

[01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:09.370]
what I just said though did you hear what I just said everybody has a right to express himself

[01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:14.650]
their opinion I mean maybe you don't agree with it yeah but you know what nobody should be fine for

[01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:20.230]
expressing their opinion yeah and that that's the only thing I you know I'm but that was not an

[01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:24.210]
opinion that's what I'm trying to tell you there was there was what what kind of opinion is that to

[01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:28.270]
say that they would have made those slaves might have made good basketball players it was just a

[01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:34.290]
funny was just a play on the night it was nothing well obviously people did not take it that way

[01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:38.290]
I think most people did there wasn't one complaint nobody called this station nobody called the

[01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:43.010]
heat and until Channel 7 made a big song a dance about it nobody gave a crap about it at all right

[01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:47.450]
like I say I don't disagree with your you know you know you're a March shot is a lunatic she's a

[01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:53.050]
bigot she's a racist she's an anti-Semite she's an anti-human March shot is a piece of turd right

[01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:58.470]
and and you know what no she has every right I don't like her no she has every right to say it

[01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.950]
and the people in Major League baseball have also got every right to say you're not fit to own the

[01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:05.870]
team and be a part of our thing and goodbye that's right all right well that's where you feel

[01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:11.650]
that's exactly the way I feel I think you know Major League sporting organizations have got a

[01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:16.730]
responsibility to a police who they led into their thing and their fraternity okay I mean

[01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:21.910]
next you're going to say that David Duke should you know on a sports franchise well I think he's

[01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:26.170]
going on the new Atlanta have had to be having enough money he can do it you know I think the new

[01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:32.250]
hockey team Atlanta okay pal thanks for listening to 610 w i o d we have an open line at

[01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:37.110]
Broward 7 6 7 9 4 6 3 that Halberstead thing is that is a doornale and we could close the book on it

[01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:41.630]
if Michael Mayo would just develop a small pair and write one sentence in one of his columns and say

[01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:46.110]

[01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:05.890]

time I went January 17 between the airplane with the among on the plane and then going out there

[01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:09.730]
my lips are still all dried up and it's very slowly that they're coming back I mean real slow

[01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:13.870]
my lips are as dry like the skin was scraped off of them somebody told me like they're getting

[01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:19.370]
nosebleeds it was so dry like that and it is very dry really so if you got huh can you adjust to it

[01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:23.590]
though after a time if you're there for a while I don't know I never live there I mean I don't have a

[01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:27.950]
problem with myself I it is very very dry though and if you got an allergy problem I'd hop out of

[01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:31.490]
plane go out there for a weekend and see how you like it I would wait till like the middle of July

[01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:35.570]
look into papers see when it's going to be like sweltering hot would you will be go out there check

[01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:40.990]
we were all with interest uh told uh about some of the comments made by uh mr. King to don shul

[01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:56.250]
getting ready to go to Los Angeles yeah the snow stopped uh after two and a half days of being

[01:09:56.250 --> 01:10:00.490]
trapped it is all blue skies now but we got about three feet on the ground which is I think

[01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:06.030]
guys a snow absolutely snow yeah every time I try do it in the midwest a lot every time I try to travel

[01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:09.270]
up there it's like every time New York is shut down it rest the country gets shut down

[01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:13.130]
yeah well everything is shy I mean if anyone's listening in Miami and they're flying to the northeast

[01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:19.710]
Larry how you doing hi Larry Bob Green Bob how are you how you doing today fine um I wanted to take over

[01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:25.210]
a little segment here of Phil show if I could sure because we were and and I mentioned this to you

[01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:30.990]
when I called you originally um first of all Henry Barrow sends his regards not that I've talked to

[01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:35.730]
Henry since I'm Henry Henry says is sends regards Cheryl sends her regards to you that's great

[01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:40.990]
shells to work in there yes she is like god she'll be she'll get our social security there I'm not

[01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:46.570]
gonna tell her that okay I'm not gonna tell her that god uh we uh frankly Larry we're a little bit

[01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:53.810]
taken aback I guess is the is the best way to put it by comments you made to coach Shula on your

[01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:58.470]
program I understand it was it was Friday evening well I was taking aback when I had two different

[01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:04.450]
friends call me mm-hmm on uh I think it was one cold Thursday night one cold Friday when it was

[01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:10.870]
learned that Don was gonna retire and they both said boy have you heard your old radio station I

[01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:15.750]
said no I worked there 20 years with the only station ever to do the dolphins and uh they said

[01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:20.450]
they're screaming them to death screaming over there at the site he's called maniacs a colon in

[01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:25.590]
in the same personal things about them and they're vilifying them and there's a guy in the morning

[01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:30.290]
looking at Nakamoto he should be out of coaching and he's too old and another guy criticizing the way

[01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:36.510]
he looks so when I heard that uh-huh two different people what I said to Don was I heard that the station

[01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:41.530]
I worked at and you worked at because Don and I did a show together every day on W.I.O.D. for right

[01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:47.010]
was wrapping you and he said he had already said well I'm just finishing I'm sorry then he said he

[01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:55.150]
hadn't listened to talk radio in uh in two years but that he'd heard about well um so if I'm wrong

[01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:59.310]
tell me where I'm wrong well first of all we were not uh personally attacking coach Shula

[01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:06.390]
we certainly we do a talk show here as you do we have several uh what we did do and any talk show

[01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:11.650]
would do certainly uh relative to a story of this kind of local import was invite our listeners to call

[01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:17.630]
and voice their opinions the host had no personal opinions about Neil Rogers uh quite frankly if

[01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:22.350]
you're speaking of Neil Rogers or uh or Rick and SUDs or any of the shows here had nothing but the

[01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:27.090]
most glowing things to say about coach Shula in his retirement now while he's uh-huh

[01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:32.570]
Neil Rogers has something glowing to say about someone. Neil was on the daily retirement was announced

[01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:36.810]
Neil said I'm talking about before to retirement I'm gonna tell you about after retirement the whole

[01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:40.870]
city of Florida I'm I can assure you this what about before to retirement all right I can assure you

[01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:46.370]
there was nothing personal in any negative statement made by Neil Rogers. What kind of criticisms were

[01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:52.730]
that he was that he had his coaching ability had begun to slump that the game perhaps was passing

[01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:58.310]
him by that it was time to make room for a coach and as you know the the popularity of Jimmy Johnson

[01:12:58.310 --> 01:13:03.010]
here is is well known. Well I was I wrote him my column three years ago Jimmy was kind of coming

[01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:07.550]
to coach Miami and Jimmy told me that in Dallas. Phil costume just says hi too he's in the other studio.

[01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:12.250]
But just let me say this uh there's a way you can do it in a way you cannot do it now you can

[01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:18.050]
encourage callers to vilify I've been doing this a long time I am standing I started I know

[01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:22.410]
you were with our radio station for many years yeah and uh so I know how to do a talk show. Daisy

[01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:29.510]
pumper next and I know I know how you can storm up a crowd and the people who told me I have faith

[01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:34.770]
in so you're telling me that Neil Rogers praised him I would shock I would not even bother you I

[01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:38.790]
wouldn't even bother you with a phone call we're I'm gonna talk about after retirement everybody

[01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:44.750]
jenna back and that's below I'm talking about before coachula announces your callers personal

[01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:49.290]
are insightful the callers some of the callers may have been some may not they were what did you

[01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:53.310]
say to them we we got rid of them very quickly to be to be perfectly honest with you you know

[01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:57.670]
as they know you're you're inciting calls were off the air right away they were off the air right

[01:13:57.670 --> 01:14:03.990]
away and I apologize to mr. Rogers for his fairness thank you the rest of the staff and that the

[01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:09.390]
two people who told me because of inherent things I gotta tell you Larry I I I take what I do very

[01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:18.110]

[01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:38.530]
the wd the words you see it's comments like that that I think are very unfair you want an opinion or not

[01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:45.330]
okay do you think Neil Rogers is a good talk show host I think he's the best in the pistol I think

[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:31.380]
one one forty nine man it's almost time to get out of here this thing is moving like

[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:35.200]
grease lighting we just do in the clock I had two hours and even Saturday night yet Sunday morning

[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:39.500]
I love those people to buy the way who set their alarm clock to get up to a clock in the morning

[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:46.020]
near laughing but there are people who do that instead of putting the clock ahead an hour you know

[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:50.180]
when they go to bed they set the alarm for two in the morning so that they're doing the right

[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:54.820]
thing I guess so they won't go to purgatory or even worse burn in hell you will burn in hell by

[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:58.420]

everybody got hungry right now and ran out to get food why not run out to the pizza lot Jeff can

[01:40:58.910 --> 01:41:02.550]
use the money they're doing great but he can always use a little bit more go over there and get

[01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:08.730]
yourself about 20 or 30 pizzas and a bunch of lasagna and a bunch of the pasta which is better than

[01:41:08.730 --> 01:41:12.290]
ever by the way very very good pasta when you get the spaghetti by the way get it with the big

[01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:16.830]
cheese on top because they insist on that that it is much better and guess what it is much better

[01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:20.010]
and then when you get to bake cheese you won't realize there's about 20 pounds of food underneath it

[01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:24.010]
anyone feels so guilty about eating all that food nice free plug there for Jeff Cohen

So what are you saying? I'm supposed to be listening to the channel 4 for some where's there in the middle of the weather right now?

[01:42:56.710 --> 01:42:57.790]
Which is what it's going to be.

[01:42:58.070 --> 01:43:00.310]
A couple people call to say they're going to be talking about you.

[01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.990]
About me?

[01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:03.590]
Well, more rumors on channel 4 come up in a second here.

[01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:04.370]
Okay, big deal.

[01:43:04.710 --> 01:43:05.650]
We have an open line over here.

[01:43:05.650 --> 01:43:08.910]
Uh, calling around the building this morning trying to get a hold of the room.

[01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:09.590]
Who is calling around?

[01:43:09.610 --> 01:43:10.250]
On channel 4.

[01:43:10.490 --> 01:43:15.590]
And like I'm going to talk to them, those Ray Roberts and channel 4 that screwed over our good friend, uh, uh, Barbara Sloan.

[01:43:15.650 --> 01:43:15.970]
That's right.

[01:43:16.130 --> 01:43:16.850]
No chance.

[01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:18.610]
We love Barbara Sloan, okay?

[01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:22.050]

A few of radio personalities has resigned his job at W-I-O-D.

[01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.470]
Huh?

[01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:34.350]

[01:43:34.530 --> 01:43:39.450]
Rogers is reportedly moving down the aisle to W-Q-A-M and all sports station.

[01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:41.150]
Former CBS news anchor.

[01:43:41.250 --> 01:43:42.930]
That's it right next to Walter Cronkite.

[01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:44.010]
He got a quadruple bypass.

[01:43:45.690 --> 01:43:47.690]
Okay. So I made it on there with what's your name?

[01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:48.350]

Nice going. Thanks, Ilyana.

[01:43:49.570 --> 01:43:49.990]
She's okay.

[01:43:50.090 --> 01:43:50.970]
She never stole her freight train.

[01:43:50.970 --> 01:43:51.550]
She's a sweetheart.

[01:43:51.730 --> 01:43:56.050]

[01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:59.650]
As the rumors persist that I'm leaving here September 30th of this year.

[01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:00.190]
Do you believe it?

[01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:00.990]
We do.

[01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:02.730]

[01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.950]
Cooper City.

[01:44:05.410 --> 01:44:05.910]
Hey, Neil.

[01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:07.050]
You like cigars, don't you?

[01:44:07.150 --> 01:44:07.630]
Yes, I do.

[01:44:08.290 --> 01:44:09.590]
I've got a seven inch chrono.

[01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:10.170]
Stick it up your...

[01:44:10.170 --> 01:44:10.830]
Yeah, okay, good.

[01:44:11.410 --> 01:44:12.790]

[01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:13.110]
Right, go.

[01:44:13.190 --> 01:44:13.910]
...and see how it comes out.

[01:44:14.050 --> 01:44:14.870]
Okay, good luck to you, pal.

[01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:16.530]
Be sure and light it first.

[01:44:17.190 --> 01:44:20.250]
We have an open line at day 622-9463-622.

[01:44:20.610 --> 01:44:22.470]
If you forgot to decimal point by the way on your 7.

[01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:24.630]
We have an open line at Broward.

[01:44:24.690 --> 01:44:25.870]
He's more like a light bulb guy.

[01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:27.250]
He's got a decimal in front of his 7.

[01:44:27.250 --> 01:44:30.690]
7.679463 and Broward at W.I.D.

[01:44:30.730 --> 01:44:32.150]
Boy, this chicken couch at Torrey.

[01:44:33.090 --> 01:44:33.490]
Outstanding.

[01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:34.910]
Outstanding, man.

[01:44:35.230 --> 01:44:35.990]
From the pizza loft.

[01:44:36.250 --> 01:44:37.570]
It was feeding the entire building today.

[01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:39.550]
It's kind of the least we can do for them, right?

[01:44:41.110 --> 01:44:41.750]
Here's Miami.

[01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:42.130]
Hello.

[01:44:43.690 --> 01:44:44.090]
Miami.

[01:44:44.410 --> 01:44:44.710]
Neil.

[01:44:44.890 --> 01:44:45.470]
Boy and his deas.

[01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:46.090]
You're the best.

[01:44:46.290 --> 01:44:46.450]
Yeah.

[01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:47.510]
Hey, listen.

[01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:50.010]
I thought I got father again.

[01:44:50.410 --> 01:44:51.250]
Yeah, again.

[01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:52.830]
Still the best.

[01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.490]
You know what I mean?

[01:44:53.610 --> 01:44:54.150]
Yeah, it's the best.

[01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:55.310]
You know when I'm the best.

[01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:57.230]
I'm the best.

[01:44:57.230 --> 01:44:58.730]
You know the best part about that.

[01:44:58.830 --> 01:44:59.290]
The one?

[01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:02.570]
When he gets caught and he likes to make it a time.

[01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:04.110]
How about getting me a break?

[01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:05.550]
Tom does a break.

[01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:06.290]
Can't do it, Sally.

[01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:07.030]
No.

[01:45:07.290 --> 01:45:09.270]
He says, can you give me off the hook, Tom.

[01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:10.450]
For all time's sake.

[01:45:10.810 --> 01:45:13.710]
And he says, you look like I'm like, can't do it, Sally.

[01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:14.490]
Can't do it, Sally.

[01:45:14.610 --> 01:45:15.410]
I don't think so.

[01:45:15.630 --> 01:45:16.330]
Can't do it, Sally.

[01:45:16.690 --> 01:45:17.010]
Yeah.

[01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:18.270]
And a drag.

[01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:19.070]
One thing real quick.

[01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.670]
What is it?

[01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:20.250]
Donald Duck.

[01:45:20.710 --> 01:45:20.930]
Yeah.

[01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:22.610]
Can you send that to me?

[01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:23.650]
I hope it's hilarious.

[01:45:24.150 --> 01:45:25.290]
What do you mean, could I send it to you?

[01:45:25.290 --> 01:45:25.350]
Yeah.

[01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:27.150]
Can you send that out?

[01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:28.170]
Or can I...

[01:45:28.170 --> 01:45:29.190]
You mean, can I play it?

[01:45:29.290 --> 01:45:29.470]
Yeah.

[01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:30.530]
I'm not going to send it to you.

[01:45:30.810 --> 01:45:31.690]
Get your own duck.

[01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.990]
Have a great weekend, pal.

[01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.970]
Thanks, Larry.

[01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:35.370]
Oh, my God.

[01:45:35.890 --> 01:45:36.930]
You're so great.

[01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:37.550]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:38.330 --> 01:45:39.050]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:40.130 --> 01:45:40.710]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.410]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:41.410 --> 01:45:41.470]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:41.810]
Oh, you're dead.

[01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:45.590]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.650]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:46.230 --> 01:45:46.870]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.910]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:47.090]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.090]

[01:45:47.230 --> 01:45:47.410]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:47.410 --> 01:45:47.470]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:47.650]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:48.470]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:49.930 --> 01:45:50.890]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:52.810 --> 01:45:53.310]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.770]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:00.250]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:00.970 --> 01:46:01.430]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:02.190 --> 01:46:02.910]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:04.190]

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:04.190]

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:04.190]

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:04.190]

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:04.190]

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:04.190]

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:04.190]

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:04.190]

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:04.190]

[01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:04.610]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:04.930 --> 01:46:05.730]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:09.050]
Oh, yeah.

[01:46:09.170 --> 01:46:11.950]
1223, a W-I-O-D, two open lines and dead.

[01:46:12.090 --> 01:46:14.610]
622, W-I-O-D, and one and brown.

[01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:16.690]
7679, 463.

[01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:18.670]
Let's do Miami Lakes.

[01:46:18.850 --> 01:46:19.010]
Hello.

[01:46:19.570 --> 01:46:20.270]
Dear God.

[01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.830]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:21.010 --> 01:46:21.470]
How you doing?

[01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.930]
Great.

[01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:24.170]
Can you please play something for me?

[01:46:24.850 --> 01:46:25.370]
Please.

[01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:27.390]
New.

[01:46:28.290 --> 01:46:28.810]
Yeah.

[01:46:29.610 --> 01:46:30.130]
Maybe.

[01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:33.870]
Is this new OJ song that you have?

[01:46:34.270 --> 01:46:35.810]
I don't have no new OJ song.

[01:46:36.110 --> 01:46:37.210]
But this lady singing it.

[01:46:37.570 --> 01:46:37.970]
Yeah.

[01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:39.810]
What says what?

[01:46:40.690 --> 01:46:43.370]
It goes O-O-J-A.

[01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:46.470]
That's how it goes?

[01:46:46.930 --> 01:46:47.110]
Yeah.

[01:46:47.230 --> 01:46:48.650]
You don't mean OJ is going to get you, do you?

[01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:50.170]
Is that what you mean?

[01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:52.410]
Yeah, OJ is going to get you, yeah.

[01:46:52.730 --> 01:46:53.370]
Is this one?

[01:46:53.530 --> 01:46:56.070]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.390]
No, no, no, no.

[01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.490]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:56.890]
No, it's not that one.

[01:46:57.070 --> 01:46:57.210]
No.

[01:46:58.150 --> 01:46:59.330]
It's a father one.

[01:46:59.470 --> 01:47:00.090]
It's a woman?

[01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:01.730]
Yeah, you get the woman singing it.

[01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:03.990]
I haven't got no idea.

[01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:06.950]
You played it one time.

[01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.630]
Yeah.

[01:47:08.190 --> 01:47:09.350]
Oh, you mean...

[01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:11.610]
You mean velvet nails?

[01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:14.890]
Do this be sounded like it?

[01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.430]
Huh?

[01:47:18.170 --> 01:47:18.410]
Yeah.

[01:47:18.410 --> 01:47:19.270]
That's it.

[01:47:19.690 --> 01:47:20.250]
Okay, pal.

[01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.710]
Thanks a lot.

[01:47:20.770 --> 01:47:21.730]
Must decay your meaties.

[01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:22.090]
All right.

[01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:22.590]
Okay.

[01:47:22.810 --> 01:47:23.450]
Bye-bye.

[01:47:23.710 --> 01:47:26.750]
And thanks for calling 610-W-I-O-D.

[01:47:27.110 --> 01:47:29.790]
O-O-O-O-J.

[01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:31.870]
Why do you yield it?

[01:47:32.230 --> 01:47:34.350]
O-O-O-O-J.

[01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:38.850]
I'll throw it into O-O-O-J.

[01:47:38.850 --> 01:47:45.570]
A brother, a mouse, a wolf, a wolf, a wolf, a wolf.

[01:47:45.930 --> 01:47:50.450]
Gator, pale and free in your house, house, house.

[01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:53.490]
And the firm and head is eye on your head.

[01:47:53.770 --> 01:47:54.810]
Two hours, bounce, bounce.

[01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:56.630]
You were a superstar.

[01:47:57.410 --> 01:48:01.730]
Behind the monkey's fur, a new fur, a tearful.

[01:48:02.170 --> 01:48:04.330]
I want now you killed a goat.

[01:48:04.330 --> 01:48:06.410]
O-O-O-O-J.

[01:48:06.970 --> 01:48:10.950]
Just how she was up for O-O-O-O-O-J.

[01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:15.310]
I'll tell you something, Sam, O-O-O-O-O-J.

[01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:17.390]
Don't share it with me.

[01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:26.670]
She just had been in jerrys in the tongue, tongue, tongue.

[01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:28.970]
Were you jealous of them?

[01:48:29.170 --> 01:48:31.330]
Do you see you fit for fun, fun?

[01:48:31.690 --> 01:48:33.510]
Was it the cold fries and shakes?

[01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:35.850]
That's it from you, baby.

[01:48:36.370 --> 01:48:37.910]
You're the first hero.

[01:48:38.650 --> 01:48:40.950]
I want now you killed a goat.

[01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:43.050]
O-O-O-J.

[01:48:43.570 --> 01:48:45.250]
What, you killed a goat?

[01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:47.390]
O-O-O-J.

[01:48:47.890 --> 01:48:52.070]
Just how she was up for O-O-O-O-J.

[01:48:52.590 --> 01:48:54.230]
You're throwing it out.

[01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:54.930]
Oh, no.

[01:48:55.610 --> 01:48:57.490]
No way.

[01:48:58.950 --> 01:49:00.770]
O-O-O-O-O-O-O-J.

[01:49:01.110 --> 01:49:02.710]
Why did you do it anyway?

[01:49:02.710 --> 01:49:05.350]
In the bumblebee ran from the man.

[01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:08.490]
But they caught your butt and we were the kids.

[01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:24.210]
O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-J.

[01:49:24.850 --> 01:49:26.770]
I don't know meant to.

[01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:28.710]
O-O-O-O-O-O-J.

[01:49:29.290 --> 01:49:30.890]
A brother without...

[01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:31.750]
Get out of here already.

[01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:33.850]
William Jeff Cohen, I said, here, toss this out.

[01:49:33.930 --> 01:49:35.270]
It was great, but get it out of here.

[01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:36.490]
Get this crap out of here.

[01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:38.510]
I'm trying to do a Make Believe Radio show here.

[01:49:38.810 --> 01:49:39.710]
And he's stealing my newspapers.

[01:49:40.630 --> 01:49:42.350]
My business must be really slow over there.

[01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:44.090]
It's a lot of people who can't even afford to buy his own newspapers.

[01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:45.370]
What does that tell you folks?

[01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:46.570]
Does that tell you what you need?

[01:49:46.650 --> 01:49:47.110]
No or not.

[01:49:48.710 --> 01:49:49.010]
Exactly.

[01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:52.190]
Anyway, it's 1227 at WIOD already.

[01:49:52.190 --> 01:49:53.330]
We have two open lines in date.

[01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:55.610]
Once we get the lines all filled up, we might talk to you again.

[01:49:55.970 --> 01:49:56.670]
Boy, look at this.

[01:49:56.730 --> 01:49:58.150]
You've got mung all over the counter here.

[01:49:58.150 --> 01:49:58.990]
We don't have Tommy Kramer.

[01:49:58.990 --> 01:50:00.210]
No more to clean off the counter.

[01:50:00.210 --> 01:50:05.850]
By the way, speaking of Tommy Kramer, there's rumors flying around the building that there was a very, very, very serious

[01:50:05.850 --> 01:50:08.370]
contortompos up there after the Ron and Ron show this morning.

[01:50:09.010 --> 01:50:10.670]
That's the rumor around the building.

[01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:12.710]
It's so embarrassingly true.

[01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:15.450]
Yeah, between Ron and B and Tommy Kramer.

[01:50:15.690 --> 01:50:17.290]
Do we have to think really hard who's side?

[01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.930]
We have to have this...

[01:50:18.930 --> 01:50:21.050]
Oh, geez, you bring me a dry cloth, okay?

[01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:26.750]
Ask a man with silly fingernails to do a real man's job and he brings you a dry cloth.

[01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:31.870]
Anyways, I was starting to say, is there any doubt as to whose side we take when there's a contortompos

[01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:33.490]
between Ron and B and Tommy Kramer?

[01:50:35.010 --> 01:50:39.690]
In fact, is there any doubt as which side we take when there's a contortompos between fill in the blank and Tommy Kramer?

[01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:41.010]
Exactly, that's my point.

[01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:45.270]
You're okay in our book, Ron and B. You're all right with us.

[01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:46.670]
Neil Rogers is my lover.

[01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:47.950]
Exactly, and good luck to you, man.

[01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.810]
You'll need it with these, go ahead.

[01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:51.170]
1228 at WIOD.

[01:50:51.170 --> 01:50:53.530]
1610 WIOD.

[01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:54.910]
Paranoid.

[01:50:55.170 --> 01:50:55.730]
hormonal.

[01:50:56.130 --> 01:50:56.810]
neurotic.

[01:50:57.170 --> 01:50:58.250]
Welcome home.

[01:50:59.210 --> 01:51:01.290]
This is the Neil Rogers shell.

[01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:04.090]
This is your brain.

[01:51:05.670 --> 01:51:06.970]
Any question?

[01:51:11.770 --> 01:51:12.090]
Amaphenid.

[01:51:12.170 --> 01:51:14.910]
Let me see how long it takes before Max gets the drift of that, okay?

[01:51:14.970 --> 01:51:17.310]
Did you hear that? Did anybody hear that?

[01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:18.010]
Is anybody listening?

[01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:19.190]
Do you have the monitor turned down?

[01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.630]
What?

[01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.970]
Oh, okay.

[01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.970]
Don't worry about it.

[01:51:21.970 --> 01:51:23.530]
The fact that you absolutely turned out.

[01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:24.190]
Oh, okay.

[01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:25.230]
So I'm not going to talk about it.

[01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:26.690]
The fact that that machine just repeated the beginning.

[01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:28.690]
It's not working at all.

[01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:29.450]
Played against him.

[01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:30.510]
Played against him.

[01:51:30.570 --> 01:51:30.590]
What?

[01:51:30.690 --> 01:51:31.530]
It won't queue up now.

[01:51:31.670 --> 01:51:32.810]
This machine over here.

[01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:34.210]
This one has always been broken.

[01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:35.070]
But hey, don't worry about it.

[01:51:35.070 --> 01:51:35.550]
We know you're leaving.

[01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:36.370]
That's okay.

[01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:38.790]
We're not worried about looking on the back of the disc.

[01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.810]
Is there a mong on my disc?

[01:51:39.970 --> 01:51:41.150]
No, there is not mong on my disc.

[01:51:41.290 --> 01:51:42.090]
It looks just fine to me.

[01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:43.690]
Let's try it one more time, okay?

[01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:45.290]
Let's put it in there very gently.

[01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:47.050]
Let's watch that thing start spinning around.

[01:51:47.170 --> 01:51:48.390]
Let's queue up cut number 13.

[01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:50.010]
And let's see if this thing is going to work.

[01:51:50.110 --> 01:51:51.910]
If we have to fire Max before he leaves on his own.

[01:51:52.110 --> 01:51:53.850]
Van Biele-Fluhr eats a fleece.

[01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:54.690]
He's being a buttercup.

[01:51:54.690 --> 01:51:56.390]
I like that.

[01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:58.030]
I don't like that, but that's not the cut I wanted to play.

[01:51:58.810 --> 01:51:59.750]
Let's see if the other one.

[01:51:59.870 --> 01:52:00.990]
I just want to see if it was going to work.

[01:52:01.230 --> 01:52:02.070]
Let's see if this one works.

[01:52:03.130 --> 01:52:06.110]
It's time once again for the adventures of Jimmy Maha.

[01:52:06.510 --> 01:52:07.510]
Teenage Lap Track.

[01:52:07.890 --> 01:52:11.150]
When we last left Jimmy, he was being chewed out by the police commissioner.

[01:52:11.970 --> 01:52:13.530]
Damn it, you're way out of line on this one.

[01:52:14.490 --> 01:52:14.850]
What?

[01:52:15.230 --> 01:52:16.170]
What are you laughing at?

[01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:18.030]
Oh, you think this is stunning, huh?

[01:52:18.490 --> 01:52:19.210]
Do you think I'm a comedian?

[01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:21.050]
Well, here's a choke for you.

[01:52:21.550 --> 01:52:22.270]
You're fired!

[01:52:22.690 --> 01:52:24.010]
This is my gun against your ass.

[01:52:24.010 --> 01:52:24.690]
Come here!

[01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:26.070]
I'll show you what's wrong.

[01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:28.590]
You like being tickled with a gun barrel up your ass.

[01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:30.590]
Yes, that does it for today.

[01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:34.910]
Let's be sure to join us next time for another thrilling adventure with Jimmy Maha.

[01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:36.490]
Teenage Lap Track.

[01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:39.530]
Okay, that should be easy for them.

[01:52:40.130 --> 01:52:42.150]
12-34 WYODC.

[01:52:42.270 --> 01:52:43.750]
I'm choking out my canole.

[01:52:44.450 --> 01:52:48.050]
God is punishing me once and for all, okay, for my evil ways.

[01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.910]
You two, Max.

[01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.250]
You're next.

[01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:50.630]
Wait till you start choking on it, cigar.

[01:52:51.190 --> 01:52:52.750]
We have two open lines in date.

[01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:54.670]
622-9463.

[01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:57.630]
Where is Max going to get all the free cigars when he goes to work next, huh?

[01:52:57.930 --> 01:52:58.730]
Like he was getting here.

[01:53:00.630 --> 01:53:03.630]
Like he was breaking into that cabinet late at night, getting all those free cigars.

[01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:04.970]
Well, he just liked them a lot, okay?

[01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:09.290]
If you find something you like, sometimes you've got to bust into it to get into it.

[01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:11.410]
Here's Weston on a mobile.

[01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:11.730]
Hello?

[01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.990]
Hey, Neil.

[01:53:13.210 --> 01:53:13.570]
Yes, sir.

[01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:14.950]
Hi, I heard you the other day.

[01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:19.090]
I think Monday mentioned a guy that you heard on Channel 10.

[01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:21.190]
Bow, Steinberg?

[01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:23.290]
No, I didn't hear him on Channel 10.

[01:53:23.290 --> 01:53:27.730]
He was on our station one with Watson's name, Duan Sports Talk last weekend.

[01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:31.850]
I think he was on with Duan Sports Talk.

[01:53:32.190 --> 01:53:36.490]
He's the assistant sports Hansho Schmendrick at Channel 10.

[01:53:36.730 --> 01:53:39.310]
He's the assistant sports director to Jimmy Seppelis.

[01:53:39.450 --> 01:53:40.230]
Yeah, he's another Jew.

[01:53:40.410 --> 01:53:42.110]
I had a run in with this guy.

[01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.570]
Really?

[01:53:42.810 --> 01:53:45.450]
He is the biggest asshole you ever want to meet in your life.

[01:53:45.550 --> 01:53:45.810]
Really?

[01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.810]
My wife?

[01:53:46.810 --> 01:53:47.670]
Now, are you talking about...

[01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:48.010]
Your wife?

[01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:49.070]
Or Saul Steinberg.

[01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.830]
No, Steinberg.

[01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:50.190]
Okay.

[01:53:50.610 --> 01:53:53.310]
Went down to Channel 10 to show him a videotape.

[01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:54.990]
My son's involved in amateur boxing.

[01:53:55.230 --> 01:53:55.410]
Yeah.

[01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:58.430]
This guy knows absolutely nothing about sports.

[01:53:58.690 --> 01:53:58.890]
Uh-huh.

[01:53:59.450 --> 01:54:00.930]
Why do you think he works on Channel 10?

[01:54:01.050 --> 01:54:01.630]
I guess so.

[01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:03.650]
So he looks at the tape and...

[01:54:03.650 --> 01:54:06.590]
The only thing you could say about Channel 10 sports is Frank Ford.

[01:54:06.810 --> 01:54:08.070]
Finally got that thing off his forehead.

[01:54:08.230 --> 01:54:09.410]
That's the only good thing you can say.

[01:54:09.690 --> 01:54:10.430]
I've never watched him.

[01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:10.770]
Good.

[01:54:11.070 --> 01:54:11.530]
He's either the one.

[01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:13.550]
So this guy didn't see what he wanted on the tape.

[01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:15.430]
He's getting a real bad attitude.

[01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:18.450]
My wife says to him, you know, you're really an asshole.

[01:54:18.730 --> 01:54:19.650]
Yeah, and he said...

[01:54:19.650 --> 01:54:20.870]
Oh, he went ballistic.

[01:54:21.090 --> 01:54:21.290]
Really?

[01:54:21.450 --> 01:54:22.910]
You cursed me in my house.

[01:54:23.010 --> 01:54:25.710]
I invite you to come into my house and you talk to me that way.

[01:54:25.950 --> 01:54:26.850]
Get out of here.

[01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:28.950]
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, I can act.

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:30.690]
So as we're leaving the...

[01:54:30.690 --> 01:54:32.250]
We picked our stuff up and left.

[01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:36.670]
And as we're leaving the building, he waits until we get to the lobby.

[01:54:37.190 --> 01:54:41.870]
Sticks his head out and Hollers and don't ever come back to my house again.

[01:54:42.210 --> 01:54:42.590]
All right.

[01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:45.250]
Our paths will cross again and off.

[01:54:46.330 --> 01:54:47.910]
Our paths will cross again.

[01:54:48.010 --> 01:54:49.970]
Did you believe that's my wife said our paths are gonna cross again?

[01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:50.910]
Well, that's pretty melodramatic.

[01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.790]
I wonder if his path is ever gonna cross with...

[01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:53.130]
You're right.

[01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:53.670]
...again.

[01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:55.530]
So I just want to call...

[01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:56.870]
...South Steinberg.

[01:54:57.250 --> 01:54:57.930]
A big douchebag.

[01:54:58.030 --> 01:54:58.970]
Okay. Thanks for having me.

[01:54:58.970 --> 01:54:59.330]
Thanks, pal.

[01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:02.330]
Good news there about Channel 10 Sports Ace Saul Steinberg,

[01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:03.510]
who sounds awfully Jewish to me.

[01:55:03.610 --> 01:55:05.910]
We have an open line on the Mobile and Purple line, pound IOD.

[01:55:06.250 --> 01:55:08.650]
We have one at day, 622-9463.

[01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:10.070]
622-2WID.

[01:55:10.190 --> 01:55:11.630]
Pretty damn good lunch from pizza loft today.

[01:55:11.630 --> 01:55:12.310]
Would you say, George?

[01:55:12.570 --> 01:55:14.650]
I don't know what you got fed in there, but like I said, pretty damn good lunch.

[01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:15.770]
Thank you so much, Jeff.

[01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:18.250]
And could be in such a yenta.

[01:55:18.810 --> 01:55:19.730]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[01:55:19.730 --> 01:55:20.010]
Hello.

[01:55:20.930 --> 01:55:21.270]
Hello.

[01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.850]
Yes, sir.

[01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.910]
Greetings, Mr. Rogers.

[01:55:23.050 --> 01:55:23.650]
And back to you.

[01:55:23.850 --> 01:55:25.170]
Please tell me this is not true.

[01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:25.730]
What's that?

[01:55:26.690 --> 01:55:28.390]
Channel 4, just broadcasted.

[01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:30.630]
You are leaving as at the sem or correction.

[01:55:31.770 --> 01:55:32.450]
September 30th.

[01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.590]
Yeah.

[01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:33.810]
The WQAM?

[01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.890]
Is that what they said?

[01:55:35.150 --> 01:55:35.410]
Yeah.

[01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.370]
Yeah.

[01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:37.110]
Is this true?

[01:55:37.450 --> 01:55:39.070]
Do you want me to tell you an answer to that question?

[01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:40.730]
Well, sort of yeah.

[01:55:41.290 --> 01:55:42.350]
I don't know.

[01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:43.590]
Oh, no.

[01:55:44.710 --> 01:55:45.350]
Media propaganda.

[01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:46.490]
I didn't say that.

[01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:46.890]
Yeah.

[01:55:47.070 --> 01:55:48.030]
Well, that's probably what it is.

[01:55:48.110 --> 01:55:48.430]
Could be.

[01:55:50.050 --> 01:55:51.110]
It's very well-could be true.

[01:55:51.590 --> 01:55:52.110]
Yeah, it is.

[01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:53.510]
Well, let me ask you this question first.

[01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:55.490]
What difference does it make what station I'm on?

[01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:57.250]
Well, it really doesn't, but there you go.

[01:55:57.610 --> 01:55:59.950]
My radio station only gets 610.

[01:56:00.130 --> 01:56:00.370]
Yeah.

[01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:01.490]
Well, you'll have to get a new radio.

[01:56:01.690 --> 01:56:01.810]
I know.

[01:56:01.810 --> 01:56:03.130]
We'll ship it and maybe we'll buy you one.

[01:56:03.150 --> 01:56:03.870]
I'm going to get a new car.

[01:56:04.130 --> 01:56:04.470]
There you go.

[01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:05.010]
Okay.

[01:56:05.610 --> 01:56:07.870]
You know seriously, your car already gets 610 on a radio?

[01:56:07.970 --> 01:56:08.210]
Yeah.

[01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:09.690]
That's probably the only reason you're listening anyway.

[01:56:09.810 --> 01:56:10.050]
I know.

[01:56:10.050 --> 01:56:10.790]
No, no, actually.

[01:56:10.810 --> 01:56:11.370]
I believe it.

[01:56:11.410 --> 01:56:13.110]
Actually, you're somewhat...

[01:56:13.110 --> 01:56:13.570]
I'm using.

[01:56:13.810 --> 01:56:14.670]
You're knowledgeable, yeah.

[01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:15.330]
I'm knowledgeable.

[01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:16.090]
Yeah.

[01:56:16.290 --> 01:56:16.730]
And full of it.

[01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:18.170]
Okay, the request is...

[01:56:18.170 --> 01:56:19.550]
But that Caron K girl's got to go.

[01:56:19.870 --> 01:56:20.090]
Who?

[01:56:20.590 --> 01:56:21.210]
Who is that?

[01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.850]
Aaron K.

[01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.490]
Aaron K.

[01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.710]
Oh.

[01:56:25.930 --> 01:56:26.150]
Oh.

[01:56:26.290 --> 01:56:26.290]

[01:56:26.510 --> 01:56:28.770]
Man, every time she does that, I think she just swallowed something.

[01:56:29.230 --> 01:56:29.790]
Hey, Neil.

[01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:31.250]
Were you at the airport yesterday?

[01:56:31.610 --> 01:56:32.110]
No, I was not.

[01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.570]
Okay.

[01:56:32.710 --> 01:56:34.590]
But if it'll make you happy, yeah, that was me waving to you.

[01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.950]
Anyway, what's the request?

[01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:38.650]
Because we want to thank you very much for calling 610WI.

[01:56:38.650 --> 01:56:39.790]
Oh, do me this call, get a little bit long.

[01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.070]

[01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.750]
Let's see your request.

[01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:41.850]
I want to hear the...

[01:56:41.850 --> 01:56:43.970]
I took a course in the Ibonics.

[01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:45.070]
Ibonics graduate.

[01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.350]

[01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:46.350]
And also in close.

[01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:47.450]
Excellent choice, yes, sir.

[01:56:47.670 --> 01:56:50.070]
Mike Quinn, your douchebag.

[01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:51.210]
Okay, the mighty Quinn.

[01:56:51.390 --> 01:56:51.550]
Yeah.

[01:56:51.650 --> 01:56:52.250]
And have a great day.

[01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:53.050]
And Sally Quinn, too.

[01:56:53.110 --> 01:56:55.430]
Thanks for calling 610WIOD.

[01:56:55.850 --> 01:57:02.170]
We have an open-line in Broward, 7679463, 767WIOD on a great Friday.

[01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:02.550]
Look at him.

[01:57:02.670 --> 01:57:03.670]
Oh, my God.

[01:57:04.190 --> 01:57:05.990]
Oh, he didn't just keep pouring in there.

[01:57:06.150 --> 01:57:06.630]
Pouring in there.

[01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:07.370]
I can't believe it.

[01:57:08.170 --> 01:57:10.210]
Oh, Jesus, look at that.

[01:57:10.210 --> 01:57:11.370]
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

[01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:14.510]
Oh, and even Johnny Dolan's in there.

[01:57:14.730 --> 01:57:16.210]
Oh, right after I ate lunch, too.

[01:57:16.290 --> 01:57:17.390]
What a conspiracy this is.

[01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:20.490]
An anemory is on George's lap.

[01:57:20.670 --> 01:57:23.790]
Look at that anemory and George are joined like clones.

[01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:29.030]
The entire gang, the Coxalhoist gang, is here with big smiles on their face.

[01:57:29.450 --> 01:57:31.370]
And they figure, well, he's probably in a pretty good mood today.

[01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:33.050]
We'll come over and try it out.

[01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:35.310]
Johnny Dark, how are you doing, Johnny?

[01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:39.770]
By the way, I wonder if Johnny and Johnny Dolan left me in a good graffiti over there at KISS.

[01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:40.610]
Oh, it's just a joke.

[01:57:40.670 --> 01:57:41.310]
And just getting...

[01:57:42.210 --> 01:57:43.830]
Probably left a few messages on a wall.

[01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:44.670]
They're probably kissing it.

[01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:46.210]
There's Mitch Show-Win looking like a...

[01:57:46.210 --> 01:57:47.650]
Hey, take a look around here at this.

[01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:48.370]
I'm pretty impressive.

[01:57:48.490 --> 01:57:49.150]
None of it works, Mitch.

[01:57:49.330 --> 01:57:50.430]
But hey, it's dynamite.

[01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:51.470]
That's because you're a good friend.

[01:57:51.630 --> 01:57:51.830]
Bro!

[01:57:52.090 --> 01:57:52.730]
What's his name there?

[01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:53.370]
Real asshole.

[01:57:54.230 --> 01:57:56.150]
So anyway, the Coxalhoist gang is here.

[01:57:56.230 --> 01:57:58.710]
There's my good friend Tim Beon, who wishes we were back.

[01:57:58.770 --> 01:57:59.970]
So we'd have a little excitement in the building.

[01:58:00.450 --> 01:58:02.990]
And Greg Fadek is in there with a big smile on his face.

[01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:04.150]
Look at these goyem.

[01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:04.630]
Look at that.

[01:58:05.290 --> 01:58:08.550]
And Johnny Darker's standing there doing what he does best, holding up the wall.

[01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:10.530]
Hold and man, oh man.

[01:58:10.770 --> 01:58:13.630]
Look at the frustration in the Cox building since we left George.

[01:58:13.690 --> 01:58:15.170]
He's got a puppet the size of Montana.

[01:58:15.310 --> 01:58:16.670]
And I'm not talking about Joe.

[01:58:17.370 --> 01:58:18.590]
Man, is he getting fat?

[01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.630]
Gigantic and humongous.

[01:58:20.430 --> 01:58:21.290]
Not getting too much action.

[01:58:21.290 --> 01:58:21.650]
No, Johnny.

[01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:22.450]
That's the way it goes.

[01:58:23.490 --> 01:58:24.270]
So there they are.

[01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:25.670]
When you guys move it over here, by the way.

[01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:27.890]
What is it?

[01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.770]
To live fourth.

[01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:30.450]
That's why I'm leaving.

[01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:34.370]
So anyway, the Cox people are moving into the new building.

[01:58:34.370 --> 01:58:36.090]
We'll be neighbors for a short time.

[01:58:36.230 --> 01:58:36.890]
Okay, won't that be great.

[01:58:36.890 --> 01:58:38.770]
We'll come over and invite you for food every day, huh?

[01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:40.630]
Because these people, they don't know.

[01:58:40.770 --> 01:58:41.310]
They don't know what's going on.

[01:58:41.410 --> 01:58:42.270]
They're busy having meetings.

[01:58:42.730 --> 01:58:45.070]
We understand they're having very big meetings down there in the

[01:58:45.070 --> 01:58:47.930]
a Paxen building down to 207th and the 441.

[01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:49.930]
They're having real big meetings.

[01:58:49.930 --> 01:58:50.990]
They're down there holding their meat.

[01:58:51.130 --> 01:58:52.110]
All the big head haunches.

[01:58:52.110 --> 01:58:54.590]
All the people with titles which they'll building can't hold that many.

[01:58:55.650 --> 01:58:56.770]
This is quite a treat.

[01:58:56.930 --> 01:58:58.230]
Where's my good friend's Bob and Cheryl?

[01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:59.010]
Where the hell are they today?

[01:58:59.570 --> 01:59:00.530]
Oh, they've already been here once.

[01:59:00.650 --> 01:59:01.130]
They've seen enough.

[01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:02.630]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:02.890]
Hello.

[01:59:03.250 --> 01:59:03.550]
Hello.

[01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:03.550]

[01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:04.330]
Hello.

[01:59:04.330 --> 01:59:04.330]

[01:59:04.730 --> 01:59:09.010]
Hey, listen, I have a tape of an ascended to if you want it.

[01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:16.610]
But the Jerry Williams back, oh, in the 60s, when he got into a fifth fight with local politician

[01:59:16.610 --> 01:59:17.090]
on the...

[01:59:17.090 --> 01:59:17.990]
Oh, no, I've seen that.

[01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:18.590]
That was on TV.

[01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:19.590]
I saw that.

[01:59:19.650 --> 01:59:20.170]
That was great.

[01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:21.090]
It was dynamite.

[01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:22.610]
It was on T television.

[01:59:23.090 --> 01:59:23.270]
Huh?

[01:59:23.490 --> 01:59:24.090]
It was on TV.

[01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.590]
Yes.

[01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.550]
When was this?

[01:59:25.850 --> 01:59:26.530]
Oh, years ago.

[01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:27.350]
Oh, really?

[01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:28.070]
I have an audio.

[01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:30.090]
Would you like me to send you a copy of the tape?

[01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:32.090]
Or maybe I'm getting confused.

[01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:33.770]
I'm positive I saw that.

[01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:35.010]
Or else I heard it.

[01:59:35.110 --> 01:59:35.990]
Maybe I'm confusing the audio.

[01:59:36.150 --> 01:59:37.590]
But I definitely heard it.

[01:59:37.590 --> 01:59:40.010]
What's Jerry Williams who's on the old MEX with the tape?

[01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.690]
Right, exactly.

[01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:41.730]
With Arnie Ginsburg.

[01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:43.970]
Remember those days Melvin X Melvin and Mel Miller?

[01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:45.410]
Oh, those were the days, man.

[01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:45.710]
Are we in a track?

[01:59:46.490 --> 01:59:46.830]
Yeah.

[01:59:47.230 --> 01:59:49.310]
How about Adventure Car Hop in Saga's Man?

[01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:50.810]
In Saga's Man, or whatever it is?

[01:59:50.830 --> 01:59:51.850]
Oh, Adventure Car Hoppe.

[01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:52.950]
It's a place to go for the song.

[01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:53.150]
Right.

[01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.750]
That's right.

[01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:55.450]
Arnie Wool Ginsburg yet at Horn.

[01:59:55.530 --> 01:59:56.590]
No, those were the days, man.

[01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:58.210]
Oh, we need now his car to fuse.

[01:59:58.530 --> 01:59:58.730]
Right.

[01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:59.430]
Bring him back.

[01:59:59.430 --> 02:00:00.530]
Hey, I got a request.

[02:00:00.650 --> 02:00:02.850]
Tell me, please tell me Dave Maynard's still in on a year on BZ.

[02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.790]
I think he's still on there.

[02:00:03.930 --> 02:00:06.370]
No, Dave Maynard is living up in Hernando.

[02:00:06.590 --> 02:00:07.170]
Oh, thank God.

[02:00:07.170 --> 02:00:08.270]
He's 140 years old.

[02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:09.410]
He was still on the year very recently.

[02:00:09.590 --> 02:00:10.090]
Get him out of there.

[02:00:10.330 --> 02:00:13.290]
You know who I used to love on WBZ in those days was Jefferson K.

[02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:14.670]
Great, great man.

[02:00:14.810 --> 02:00:14.850]
Great.

[02:00:14.850 --> 02:00:15.530]
He was great.

[02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:16.770]
What a great DJ he was.

[02:00:16.930 --> 02:00:18.350]
He's doing some for NFL now.

[02:00:18.490 --> 02:00:18.570]
Not sure.

[02:00:18.570 --> 02:00:18.970]
Good for him.

[02:00:19.090 --> 02:00:19.910]
He's Jewish, too, by the way.

[02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.110]
Yes?

[02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.850]
Yeah.

[02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:22.550]
Do you have my girls, pussy?

[02:00:23.650 --> 02:00:24.090]
In the well.

[02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:25.750]
In the well.

[02:00:27.170 --> 02:00:27.970]
Good luck to you, pal.

[02:00:28.150 --> 02:00:28.670]
All right, man.

[02:00:28.670 --> 02:00:29.410]
Have a great day.

[02:00:29.490 --> 02:00:29.630]
Bye.

[02:00:29.790 --> 02:00:30.190]
Okay.

[02:00:31.070 --> 02:00:32.190]
What do you just say?

[02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:37.430]
I woke up this morning with a feeling of dissaid.

[02:00:37.690 --> 02:00:42.050]
I looked for my pussy, but my pussy wasn't there.

[02:00:42.810 --> 02:00:46.410]
Well, well, well, my cat fell in the well.

[02:00:47.110 --> 02:00:48.850]
Oh, first, first, first, poor kid.

[02:00:48.970 --> 02:00:51.170]
Kid, kid, kid, my cat fell in the well.

[02:00:51.870 --> 02:00:55.930]
I got a ladder and I climbed down to my fence.

[02:00:56.730 --> 02:01:01.210]
I saw your energy, me, that my pussy was soaking wet.

[02:01:01.690 --> 02:01:05.290]
Well, well, well, my cat fell in the well.

[02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:07.770]
Oh, first, first, poor kid.

[02:01:07.850 --> 02:01:10.070]
Kid, kid, my cat fell in the well.

[02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:13.070]
A dog on home by the bump.

[02:01:13.570 --> 02:01:15.390]
Why she pushed and it she jumped.

[02:01:15.890 --> 02:01:19.570]
Then Emma was a kiddie half-ass, pretty as pussy that fell in the well.

[02:01:20.450 --> 02:01:24.450]
Then Emma was a pussy that could quite compare with her.

[02:01:25.070 --> 02:01:28.950]
Pretty as a picture with her long and silky fur.

[02:01:29.970 --> 02:01:33.610]
Well, well, well, well, my cat fell in the well.

[02:01:34.130 --> 02:01:35.450]
Oh, oh, if you're a pussy, pussy, pussy,

[02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:38.210]
Kid, kid, kid, my cat fell in the well.

[02:01:38.890 --> 02:01:42.890]
If you have a pussy that you wouldn't tread on cell.

[02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:47.650]
Never let her wander or she might fall in the well.

[02:01:48.450 --> 02:01:52.030]
Well, well, well, my cat fell in the well.

[02:01:52.610 --> 02:01:54.470]
Oh, first, first, first, first, poor kid.

[02:01:54.570 --> 02:01:56.710]
Kid, kid, my cat fell in the well.

[02:01:59.170 --> 02:02:00.150]
Oh, well, well.

[02:02:00.690 --> 02:02:04.010]
1243 at WIOD on a momentous Friday, April 4th,

[02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:05.710]
one of the greatest days in the history of our lives.

[02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:07.910]
I'm not exactly sure I can put my finger on it, but I'll try.

[02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:11.010]
We have an open line at day, at 622-9463.

[02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:13.870]
But we never be, see, I shouldn't say it while they're still in the building.

[02:02:14.210 --> 02:02:15.650]
God, I was sure great over there at Cox.

[02:02:18.670 --> 02:02:19.390]
Oh, man.

[02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:23.390]
Somebody told me everybody thinks the grass is greener on the other side,

[02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:26.010]
but until you meet the real farthest of the gory, I mean, never gonna be sure.

[02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:26.510]
And they were right.

[02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:28.370]
You were right, Bob Greener.

[02:02:29.590 --> 02:02:31.930]
By the way, speaking of Bobby Green, I should play that, shouldn't I?

[02:02:32.010 --> 02:02:34.810]
Just as a, just as kind of a token of our affection.

[02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:38.150]
You were right.

[02:02:39.130 --> 02:02:40.950]
By the way, Bob, don't come into work tomorrow, please.

[02:02:41.650 --> 02:02:46.090]
Buses are in Miami, walking downstairs.

[02:02:47.090 --> 02:02:51.150]
It didn't see hangs like a stick and out.

[02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:58.410]
By the grab the handrail, but Gary greased it good.

[02:02:59.730 --> 02:03:02.870]
He won't be signing anybody out.

[02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:10.350]
Oh, feeling pain is typical and working in this place.

[02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:15.490]
Nothing, you ain't worth nothing less you're working for free.

[02:03:17.050 --> 02:03:22.470]
Oh, bust your ass or bust your arm, it's all the same to me.

[02:03:23.770 --> 02:03:27.130]
Bustin' it is good enough for me.

[02:03:29.250 --> 02:03:33.410]
It's good enough for me and Bob, and Green.

[02:03:34.710 --> 02:03:37.430]
1245, by the way, we owe them a big, you vote a thanks, George,

[02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:39.090]
because you realize if they wouldn't have sold a station

[02:03:39.090 --> 02:03:41.930]
and if all of this wouldn't have gone down, that you know what follow what I'm saying?

[02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:42.690]
You following my logic?

[02:03:43.290 --> 02:03:44.150]
Thanks, Bobby Green.

[02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:45.910]
There you go, and don't come into work tomorrow.

[02:03:50.130 --> 02:03:52.350]
It's Friday, you bastards.

[02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:54.750]
Well, congratulations, get alive.

[02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:58.770]
Today on ET, Paul McCartney talks about his recent nighthood.

[02:03:59.050 --> 02:04:01.430]
How, Mr. McCartney, when did you get knighted?

[02:04:01.630 --> 02:04:03.990]
Yesterday, and how was the queen?

[02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:07.630]
Imagine he's pretty nice girl, but she doesn't have a long to say.

[02:04:07.930 --> 02:04:09.870]
Really? Did you ask you to do anything?

[02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:11.990]
She said...

[02:04:12.630 --> 02:04:15.050]
Why don't we do head in the road?

[02:04:15.590 --> 02:04:17.210]
Gross! So what did you say?

[02:04:17.490 --> 02:04:21.710]
Maybe you can drive my car, and maybe I'll lose it.

[02:04:21.710 --> 02:04:25.410]
No, no, no, not I want to hear that please, please be quiet.

[02:04:26.130 --> 02:04:29.150]
Yes, he's the Hard Day's Night-Hus, please, please, and the queen.

[02:04:29.650 --> 02:04:32.550]
He's Paul McCartney, and you can see him later today on ET.

[02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:35.130]
1250, a W-I-D, you know those brits?

[02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:36.750]
Sooner or later, they all please the queen.

[02:04:36.970 --> 02:04:39.210]
We have two open lines, and they'd 6-2-2-9-4.

[02:04:39.530 --> 02:04:39.910]
Do you hear that?

[02:04:40.530 --> 02:04:43.610]
That thing is queuing up like real or up, like on the next cut there.

[02:04:43.730 --> 02:04:44.250]
I like it a lot.

[02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:45.230]
Hey, we don't care.

[02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:47.550]
I mean, we're trying to do the best we can under impossible circumstances,

[02:04:48.370 --> 02:04:50.650]
with marginal equipment, which somebody will repair someday.

[02:04:50.970 --> 02:04:51.470]
It won't be max.

[02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:54.690]
Anyway, here's Miami. Hello?

[02:04:55.770 --> 02:04:56.130]
Hello?

[02:04:56.350 --> 02:04:56.710]
Yes, sir.

[02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.250]
Yes?

[02:04:58.810 --> 02:04:59.130]
Yes?

[02:04:59.950 --> 02:05:02.690]
Yeah, first time call in a long time, unrolled.

[02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.430]
I'll bet.

[02:05:03.810 --> 02:05:04.890]
It's enough to put you into a coma.

[02:05:05.090 --> 02:05:05.910]
Sorry about that, sir.

[02:05:06.490 --> 02:05:07.030]
Yeah, we'll listen.

[02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:10.970]
I was calling to see if you work with the people off the lot, I guess, right?

[02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:11.330]
Yeah.

[02:05:12.130 --> 02:05:15.230]
I got a buddy money you used to work there prior to a burning down.

[02:05:15.670 --> 02:05:15.890]
Yeah.

[02:05:16.570 --> 02:05:17.190]
Okay, we're great.

[02:05:17.290 --> 02:05:18.310]
I hope he has a great life.

[02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:20.930]
Here we go, somebody with another story, another fictitious story.

[02:05:21.190 --> 02:05:23.410]
Got a two-bite, he had to wait there long because he didn't get on here,

[02:05:23.490 --> 02:05:24.990]
or whatever your bullcrap story was anyway.

[02:05:25.670 --> 02:05:29.310]
Daylines all open, 622-946-3622-WIOD.

[02:05:30.370 --> 02:05:34.850]
Don't you find it interesting to note that Brooke is getting all the crap about saying,

[02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:39.250]
thank you for calling WIOD, while that new valley girl, Karen Waterer,

[02:05:39.410 --> 02:05:41.190]
is saying that a thousand times, well, I don't know,

[02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:42.770]
because I don't listen to that, what her name's show.

[02:05:44.050 --> 02:05:46.210]
And she says, rude as a nursing home bathroom.

[02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:47.010]
How do you like that?

[02:05:47.310 --> 02:05:48.850]
Rude as a nursing home bathroom.

[02:05:49.670 --> 02:05:52.110]
Could have anything to do with the fact that Brooke hasn't buoyed

[02:05:52.110 --> 02:05:53.290]
and if the upper management says,

[02:05:53.290 --> 02:05:55.170]
what kind of a disgusting thing is that?

[02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:57.350]
Lay off Brooke, she's a dollar.

[02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:58.130]
I mean, I love Brooke.

[02:05:58.570 --> 02:06:00.770]
I just don't like that thing.

[02:06:01.010 --> 02:06:01.970]
You know what I'm saying? You know that thing.

[02:06:02.410 --> 02:06:03.130]
Don't like that thing.

[02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:05.530]
Let's see what else we got.

[02:06:05.650 --> 02:06:07.270]
Here we got, oh, that Rick guy again.

[02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:08.230]
Don't read your facts, Rick.

[02:06:08.230 --> 02:06:09.010]
Sorry, you're a chronic.

[02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:12.690]
My first blood test, after starting the Atkins diet, is in today.

[02:06:12.810 --> 02:06:15.510]
Dr. says my cholesterol is better, still room for improvement.

[02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:18.270]
I exercise moderately, only had 15 pounds to lose,

[02:06:18.330 --> 02:06:19.030]
I've lost eight already.

[02:06:19.450 --> 02:06:21.470]
Everyone told me my cholesterol was going to skyrocket,

[02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.870]
and they're full of crap.

[02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:23.990]
All right, nice going, John.

[02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:26.270]
Let's see, here's what it says.

[02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:27.250]
I like your A. Sheffield.

[02:06:27.250 --> 02:06:29.750]
It was smart to take the money and et cetera and so on.

[02:06:29.890 --> 02:06:31.670]
I can't feel about the real good comparison here.

[02:06:31.690 --> 02:06:33.610]
I guarantee you the athletes making that kind of money

[02:06:33.610 --> 02:06:36.310]
would not dig in their own pockets and dig out $50,000

[02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:37.590]
for three hours of anything.

[02:06:38.890 --> 02:06:39.870]
What does that mean?

[02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:41.490]
What does that mean?

[02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:42.030]
Oh, the ball game.

[02:06:42.110 --> 02:06:44.010]
Okay, whatever you say.

[02:06:45.630 --> 02:06:47.850]
The letter is in regard to the recent 60-minute,

[02:06:47.950 --> 02:06:48.750]
okay, that's it, we don't care.

[02:06:49.130 --> 02:06:49.970]
Here's Michael Mayo.

[02:06:50.330 --> 02:06:50.610]
That's right.

[02:06:50.610 --> 02:06:53.070]
Another day, Rick from PLA, okay, we finally read it

[02:06:53.070 --> 02:06:55.110]
when your faxes, because it's got a picture of Michael Mayo.

[02:06:55.190 --> 02:06:57.050]
Another day without the apology, Dave Halberstrand.

[02:06:57.310 --> 02:06:59.910]
I'm Michael Mayo from the, I got news for you, Michael.

[02:07:00.230 --> 02:07:01.590]
You're being de-dewed as of today.

[02:07:01.670 --> 02:07:02.270]
We're throwing you out.

[02:07:03.070 --> 02:07:04.550]
You're no longer with you, all right?

[02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:06.610]
No more Jew for Michael Mayo.

[02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:08.550]
Hold the Mayo.

[02:07:09.370 --> 02:07:11.970]
He probably eats Mayo like on his ham and cheese sandwich.

[02:07:12.710 --> 02:07:13.650]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:07:13.730 --> 02:07:13.910]
Hello.

[02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:15.090]
Yes, sir.

[02:07:15.370 --> 02:07:15.750]
What a beat.

[02:07:16.590 --> 02:07:20.110]
I got a, I sent you a fact yesterday of a picture.

[02:07:20.630 --> 02:07:25.210]
With, with, he's just in the manger and instead of the three wise men,

[02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:27.870]
it had the three wise guys, one guy holding a pizza,

[02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:29.730]
one guy holding a briefcase full of money.

[02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:30.170]
Yeah.

[02:07:30.650 --> 02:07:32.770]
And again, we're like holding a gun in his jacket.

[02:07:32.770 --> 02:07:33.630]
I wonder if he got that.

[02:07:33.630 --> 02:07:34.130]
No, he did not.

[02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:35.010]
Oh, he didn't get that.

[02:07:35.130 --> 02:07:35.590]
Damn it.

[02:07:35.650 --> 02:07:36.630]
I'll resend it to you.

[02:07:36.630 --> 02:07:36.890]
Okay.

[02:07:37.110 --> 02:07:37.890]
But I got a request.

[02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:39.470]
This is how long I've been listening to you.

[02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.750]
Okay.

[02:07:39.850 --> 02:07:40.650]
It was like a banana.

[02:07:41.930 --> 02:07:42.530]
No God.

[02:07:42.930 --> 02:07:44.010]
No God.

[02:07:44.150 --> 02:07:45.990]
Have to ask permission from Bob Green to play that.

[02:07:46.490 --> 02:07:48.750]
Should've called five minutes ago when the guys were in the building.

[02:07:49.250 --> 02:07:49.770]
All right.

[02:07:49.890 --> 02:07:50.890]
Now, thanks for having us.

[02:07:50.890 --> 02:07:51.230]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:07:51.650 --> 02:07:52.690]
610 W I O D.

[02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:55.130]
And thanks for recalling you 610 W I O D.

[02:07:55.450 --> 02:08:00.650]
We have an open line at Broward 767 9463 767 W I O D.

[02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:01.970]
Oh, I can't stop doing it.

[02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.750]
It's killing me, man.

[02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:04.130]
Don't do it no more, bro.

[02:08:04.570 --> 02:08:05.170]
Don't do it.

[02:08:05.170 --> 02:08:05.550]
I love you.

[02:08:05.610 --> 02:08:06.630]
But don't stop doing that.

[02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:09.470]
We have an open line in the mobile one line, pound I O D.

[02:08:09.570 --> 02:08:10.370]
Oh, my God.

[02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:11.070]
Look who it is.

[02:08:11.190 --> 02:08:12.930]
It's my newfound friend with her heart hat.

[02:08:13.230 --> 02:08:14.610]
You, they're making you wear a heart hat.

[02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:16.230]
Yeah.

[02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:17.950]
It's the first thing she's seen heart in a long time.

[02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:19.610]
But anyway, Cheryl is here.

[02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:20.250]
How do you like that?

[02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:22.710]
Cheryl Riftkin formerly Ava Brown, but now she's our friend again.

[02:08:23.570 --> 02:08:24.770]
Well, you know how it goes in life.

[02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:25.630]
You can't be friendly forever.

[02:08:25.790 --> 02:08:26.210]
It gets boring.

[02:08:26.650 --> 02:08:27.650]
It gets monotonous.

[02:08:27.670 --> 02:08:29.150]
And by the way, I bet you wait a lot of make-believe

[02:08:29.150 --> 02:08:30.690]
Homin Toshnin' for him time too, Cheryl.

[02:08:31.090 --> 02:08:34.290]
So the whole of the Gonsa Mishbuchas here today, how do you like that?

[02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:37.090]
We just had everybody in here with their heart hat.

[02:08:37.170 --> 02:08:38.570]
Oh, you look so masculine today.

[02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:39.790]
With that thing in your hand.

[02:08:40.490 --> 02:08:41.090]
I love you, Cheryl.

[02:08:41.250 --> 02:08:41.770]
A lot of weight.

[02:08:41.890 --> 02:08:42.430]
Where did you ask her?

[02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:43.130]
Her bad herpes.

[02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:45.070]
I just kiss Cheryl on lips and I have bad herpes.

[02:08:45.250 --> 02:08:45.750]
No, I don't.

[02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:47.370]
They're like, well, they're not too bad.

[02:08:48.610 --> 02:08:50.950]
So anyway, welcome to 610WIOD.

[02:08:51.330 --> 02:08:53.410]
For the moment, open line at dates.

[02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:54.750]
And by the way, you want to say a few prayers.

[02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:56.490]
Leave your rosemary beads and check it to the door.

[02:08:58.270 --> 02:08:59.190]
So everybody's here today.

[02:08:59.290 --> 02:09:00.090]
What is this a sign of?

[02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:00.870]
Are you in?

[02:09:01.130 --> 02:09:01.370]
What?

[02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:02.170]
No, there's nothing here.

[02:09:02.170 --> 02:09:03.050]
We didn't get her to feed you now.

[02:09:03.250 --> 02:09:04.730]
You have to be a little more friendly than this to get fed.

[02:09:05.010 --> 02:09:05.670]
Jeff is gone.

[02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:08.770]
He's back to make Zillian some more dollars over there at the Apeatsalop.

[02:09:09.550 --> 02:09:10.710]
You look lovely.

[02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:12.830]
You look, you look, you do.

[02:09:13.330 --> 02:09:14.730]
Doesn't, okay, you look like crap.

[02:09:14.730 --> 02:09:16.170]
I feel like a walkie-talkie.

[02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.690]
You're a walkie-talkie.

[02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.670]
You look great.

[02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:19.650]
I didn't like the hair the other way.

[02:09:19.770 --> 02:09:21.010]
The hair the other way you look like a witch.

[02:09:22.250 --> 02:09:24.970]
And look at how much nicer you act now, too, that you're hair is straightened out.

[02:09:25.050 --> 02:09:25.670]
I think it was the hair.

[02:09:25.870 --> 02:09:27.250]
It's like Samson, it's the same kind of thing.

[02:09:27.490 --> 02:09:28.910]
So as Bob Green, is he still the same?

[02:09:29.190 --> 02:09:29.710]
It's still the same.

[02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:31.250]
Where is he, by the way?

[02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:32.530]
Speak for myself, please.

[02:09:32.530 --> 02:09:33.290]
Is he still the same?

[02:09:33.490 --> 02:09:33.710]
Yeah.

[02:09:33.850 --> 02:09:34.550]
He's still the same.

[02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:36.090]
That tells me all I need to know.

[02:09:36.430 --> 02:09:40.510]
But tell him, thank you so much, by the way, because if things wouldn't have worked out for whatever happened here.

[02:09:40.930 --> 02:09:43.090]
Call up the sisters and say, thanks a lot.

[02:09:44.010 --> 02:09:46.270]
Because you do know they sold a station to get rid of me.

[02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:53.650]
Everybody's lining up to go back to work for Cox, okay?

[02:09:53.770 --> 02:09:54.410]
What does that tell you?

[02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:56.610]
That tells you we love the Paxing People, baby.

[02:09:57.290 --> 02:10:00.050]
In fact, I think just an honor of today being a special day.

[02:10:05.930 --> 02:10:08.890]
They sold this radio station.

[02:10:09.250 --> 02:10:11.830]
Now the future is in town.

[02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:15.850]
We've been talking about Paxing.

[02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:20.210]
Ever since Cox pulled out, now we'll work for Paxing.

[02:10:21.410 --> 02:10:22.810]
The man's a millionaire.

[02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:26.790]
He's gone to work for Paxing.

[02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:30.390]
He's like Wayne with more hair.

[02:10:32.630 --> 02:10:38.190]
He's got a thing that is a bummer when Phil and Riz gone.

[02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:42.470]
Say goodbye to Aaron and someers.

[02:10:42.970 --> 02:10:46.550]
Say hi to Ron and Ron, they're gone on work for Paxing.

[02:10:47.710 --> 02:10:49.870]
And that's a matter of fact.

[02:10:50.910 --> 02:10:53.150]
They're gone on work for Paxing.

[02:10:54.150 --> 02:10:57.210]
But Neil ain't changing his act.

[02:10:59.210 --> 02:11:01.390]
Paxing's a born again Christian.

[02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:04.450]
Rides his as he can be.

[02:11:05.630 --> 02:11:10.730]
He wants to change the stations, letters, the WGOT.

[02:11:10.730 --> 02:11:12.930]
Now we'll work for Paxing.

[02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:15.430]
Paxing, Paxing, Paxing, Paxing.

[02:11:17.150 --> 02:11:20.390]
Paxing, Paxing, Paxing, Paxing.

[02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:22.110]
Paxing, Paxing, Paxing, Paxing.

[02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:23.170]
Paxing, Paxing, Paxing.

[02:11:30.490 --> 02:11:30.810]
Paxing, Paxing, Paxing.

[02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:32.730]
Okay, 1258 at WIOD.

[02:11:32.970 --> 02:11:35.990]
He told us that three separate times, not even like that, Cheryl.

[02:11:36.590 --> 02:11:37.390]
That is absurd.

[02:11:37.610 --> 02:11:39.290]
Okay, we have it right here on first-hand experiments.

[02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:39.830]
That's absurd.

[02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:40.750]
I know it's absurd.

[02:11:41.050 --> 02:11:42.750]
But that's kind of like a bargaining point.

[02:11:42.850 --> 02:11:44.170]
Don't you know, in other words, your piece of crap.

[02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:46.610]
And they wanted to get ready, which is why they sold me the station.

[02:11:46.810 --> 02:11:48.690]
But we don't want to talk about that on the air, because that's bad.

[02:11:50.630 --> 02:11:51.990]
Yeah, I missed this great place.

[02:11:52.090 --> 02:11:54.630]
Well, I'll tell you, it is a better location than the old one.

[02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:56.270]
I mean, I'm sure you'll miss that one, too.

[02:11:56.410 --> 02:11:57.210]
Yeah, like hemorrhoids.

[02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:59.950]
And you got Wolfies right up the street here, too, by the way.

[02:11:59.970 --> 02:12:00.450]
I know, baby.

[02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:01.990]
Where they have a real homeontage.

[02:12:02.650 --> 02:12:03.170]
Uh-huh.

[02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:04.670]
You don't know about real.

[02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:05.670]
Yours is the same.

[02:12:05.770 --> 02:12:06.530]
Okay, whatever you say.

[02:12:06.570 --> 02:12:07.290]
How about the homeontage?

[02:12:07.650 --> 02:12:09.570]
Two minutes till 1 at WIOD.

[02:12:09.970 --> 02:12:11.030]
50% talk.

[02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:12.370]
50% entertainment.

[02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:15.770]
And 50% pure damn luck.

[02:12:16.770 --> 02:12:18.210]
610 WIOD.

[02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:18.970]
Miami.

[02:12:19.410 --> 02:12:20.010]
Fort Lauderdale.

[02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:22.250]
It's the one to two hour.

[02:12:29.770 --> 02:12:30.630]
Ten, ten.

[02:12:31.110 --> 02:12:32.850]
You're a bum, you're a drain.

[02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:34.010]
Ten, ten.

[02:12:34.150 --> 02:12:35.630]
You're a bum, you're a drain.

[02:12:35.630 --> 02:12:38.090]
She said I was two of these.

[02:12:38.370 --> 02:12:40.930]
Ten, some pen, pen, or a leaf.

[02:12:41.610 --> 02:12:44.010]
Now she's got me hooked on these.

[02:12:44.010 --> 02:12:46.770]
I got him from Linda Energy.

[02:12:47.190 --> 02:12:51.610]
My mouth is up, down, my head's spinning, down, and down.

[02:12:52.070 --> 02:12:54.710]
I've been slept for three days now.

[02:12:55.130 --> 02:12:59.350]
Whoo, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

[02:12:59.410 --> 02:13:02.010]
Some weight program, give me a break.

[02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:04.770]
How many drugs do I have today?

[02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:07.930]
My hair's hollering out, and it's been hard to pee.

[02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:10.010]
Since I saw Linda Energy.

[02:13:11.110 --> 02:13:13.890]
You know that my heart's been going wild.

[02:13:13.890 --> 02:13:17.130]
I'll feel like I want to die

[02:13:17.130 --> 02:13:19.750]
Gills that kill and concentration

[02:13:20.410 --> 02:13:21.610]
Not to mention

[02:13:21.610 --> 02:13:23.650]
I'll pretend you're crazy

[02:13:23.650 --> 02:13:25.950]
Outfiddling, drugs all day

[02:13:25.950 --> 02:13:28.970]
That drops away, but who in your brain

[02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:31.870]
Production husband says it's okay

[02:13:32.410 --> 02:13:34.770]
A physician is his name

[02:13:34.770 --> 02:13:36.390]
My pulse is up, down

[02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:39.450]
My hips spinning all round and round

[02:13:39.450 --> 02:13:42.550]
Haven't slept for three days now

[02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:07.690]
Woooga, woo

[02:14:07.690 --> 02:14:09.870]

[02:14:21.090 --> 02:14:21.650]

and the kind of hard for me to figure out isn't it now even her all those

[02:14:26.010 --> 02:14:26.550]

[02:14:27.130 --> 02:14:29.610]

[02:14:30.150 --> 02:14:33.550]

[02:15:16.450 --> 02:15:20.070]

and

[02:15:56.570 --> 02:15:58.610]
You're a rock hunt funny man.

[02:15:58.870 --> 02:16:05.430]
Fudge back is a big white truck where you can weigh your lifter.

[02:16:07.590 --> 02:16:09.370]
Fudge back baby.

[02:16:11.050 --> 02:16:12.490]
The fudge back, but baby.

[02:16:12.710 --> 02:16:13.090]
I'm sorry.

[02:16:13.570 --> 02:16:14.790]
I couldn't have you wetting the watch.

[02:16:15.390 --> 02:16:17.190]
Wait, let me get bent over here a second.

[02:16:17.710 --> 02:16:18.810]
Oh, sure.

[02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:19.710]
We have that.

[02:16:20.050 --> 02:16:21.450]
Just come on around back.

[02:16:22.050 --> 02:16:23.330]
I'll be having a third wheel.

[02:16:23.490 --> 02:16:23.970]
Be easier.

[02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:25.690]
Fudge back.

[02:16:26.250 --> 02:16:26.810]
Fudge back.

[02:16:28.650 --> 02:16:29.210]
Fudge back.

[02:16:29.950 --> 02:16:30.230]
Fudge back.

[02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:30.590]
Fudge back.

[02:16:30.630 --> 02:16:30.650]
Fudge back.

[02:16:30.650 --> 02:16:31.530]
No money here.

[02:16:31.670 --> 02:16:32.870]
I haven't written nothing on it.

[02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:34.930]
There's Georgians account and just brought him a gigantic check.

[02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.770]
A gigantic something.

[02:16:36.090 --> 02:16:38.430]
That's the guy that brings the fake home in touch in two, by the way, Cheryl.

[02:16:38.510 --> 02:16:39.450]
This is for you, actually.

[02:16:39.550 --> 02:16:39.890]
What is it?

[02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:40.230]
You're like it.

[02:16:41.170 --> 02:16:42.330]
What is it, a real home in touch?

[02:16:42.550 --> 02:16:44.130]
He wouldn't know what if it hit him in the Yarmulka.

[02:16:44.730 --> 02:16:48.090]
Anyway, it's 1-0-8 at WIOD on a tremendous Friday.

[02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:50.230]
All our old good friends from the Cox people are here today.

[02:16:50.550 --> 02:16:52.170]
We're having kind of like a little party in our pants.

[02:16:52.850 --> 02:16:53.230]
What is it?

[02:16:53.350 --> 02:16:54.390]
Something really Jewish, no doubt?

[02:16:55.130 --> 02:16:55.890]
Good stuff.

[02:16:56.090 --> 02:17:00.510]
It says critics claim diet clinics misuse obesity drugs from the Wall Street Journal.

[02:17:00.550 --> 02:17:01.990]
Thank you so much, my Yiddish friend.

[02:17:02.130 --> 02:17:03.690]
And good job, it's still you too, by the way.

[02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:05.010]
And the same to you.

[02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:09.930]
It says on a pale Saturday morning in Santa Monica, California, while much of the town is still

[02:17:09.930 --> 02:17:13.470]
waking up, the waiting room of the Manhattan Weight Control Medical Center is already packed

[02:17:13.470 --> 02:17:14.030]
with patients.

[02:17:14.290 --> 02:17:17.310]
And it goes on about all these people that are waiting for their fenn-fenn.

[02:17:17.690 --> 02:17:18.250]
That's right.

[02:17:18.890 --> 02:17:22.290]
The pills are American home products corpse, hot selling redux.

[02:17:22.290 --> 02:17:28.250]
An obesity drug, a combination of two other obesity drugs, fenn-fenn, etc., etc., etc.,

[02:17:28.250 --> 02:17:28.650]
so on.

[02:17:28.890 --> 02:17:32.850]
And it goes on to talk about the risk to the drugs and on and on and on.

[02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.390]
It goes.

[02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:38.830]
Sometimes there's a doctor, talks about a doctor in Tyler Texas who had met sometimes

[02:17:38.830 --> 02:17:41.770]
for the scraps of drugs to people who need only to lose a few pounds, right?

[02:17:41.970 --> 02:17:42.230]
Exactly.

[02:17:42.650 --> 02:17:43.930]
And some of them don't need to lose any weight.

[02:17:44.190 --> 02:17:45.350]
Some of them are skinny as a rail.

[02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:47.410]
Not that they're addictive or that they're bad for you.

[02:17:48.190 --> 02:17:51.530]
Let me just tell you again, if you want to try that fenn-fenn man, good luck to you.

[02:17:51.530 --> 02:17:52.270]
And we'll bring your flowers.

[02:17:52.550 --> 02:17:53.870]
That's just my personal advice.

[02:17:54.010 --> 02:17:57.590]
Not being a physician, not being an expert, we know a lot of other people who are not experts

[02:17:57.590 --> 02:18:00.790]
either, and know nothing about it who never even been fat and they're peddling it.

[02:18:00.930 --> 02:18:02.190]
So just keep that in mind, okay?

[02:18:02.610 --> 02:18:03.730]
Governing yourselves accordingly.

[02:18:05.290 --> 02:18:06.370]
Here's Boka on a mobile.

[02:18:06.470 --> 02:18:06.710]
Hello.

[02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.910]
Hello, Nell.

[02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:08.330]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:08.470 --> 02:18:08.970]
How are you doing?

[02:18:09.050 --> 02:18:09.270]
Great.

[02:18:09.850 --> 02:18:13.470]
Neil, it's the clown reading the news that really upset me this morning.

[02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:14.050]
Yeah.

[02:18:14.190 --> 02:18:17.670]
I mean, is he a newsreader or is he a clown or is he part of your show?

[02:18:17.770 --> 02:18:18.710]
Is he a newsreader?

[02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:19.130]
No.

[02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:20.290]
Is he a clown?

[02:18:20.710 --> 02:18:21.070]
Yeah.

[02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:22.010]
Really a clown.

[02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:23.530]
He's just not funny.

[02:18:23.810 --> 02:18:24.630]
He just doesn't cut it.

[02:18:24.730 --> 02:18:27.550]
Yeah, I was going to say the only difference being that clowns usually are pretty funny.

[02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.610]
Yeah, right.

[02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:30.910]
Well, none of all the pecs and people they're having a party.

[02:18:30.910 --> 02:18:32.430]
Perhaps they can listen to him and think about the party.

[02:18:32.430 --> 02:18:35.090]
No, these are not the pecs and people having a party.

[02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:38.610]
These are the cocks people from the previous regime.

[02:18:39.550 --> 02:18:40.130]
Oh, no.

[02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:43.510]
They're busy down having a big clandestine meeting down in the pecs and bowling.

[02:18:43.810 --> 02:18:46.530]
Oh, well, they won't get to hear this clown, but he should be removed.

[02:18:46.730 --> 02:18:48.930]
He doesn't add anything to the track.

[02:18:48.930 --> 02:18:50.870]
By the way, I'll sure pass that along.

[02:18:51.470 --> 02:18:55.670]
By the way, on the turn pack this morning, there is a car heading north called a border patrol.

[02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:57.650]
It's not the first time I've seen it, nor the second.

[02:18:58.030 --> 02:18:58.190]
Yeah.

[02:18:58.350 --> 02:19:02.550]
He's obviously patrolling the border between Palm Beach and the Broward looking for aliens.

[02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:03.190]
Okay.

[02:19:03.370 --> 02:19:04.290]
Do a lot of that locally.

[02:19:04.590 --> 02:19:05.190]
Is he serious?

[02:19:05.730 --> 02:19:06.330]
He's serious.

[02:19:06.570 --> 02:19:06.810]
Okay.

[02:19:07.570 --> 02:19:08.610]
Tell him I'll see him there.

[02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.630]
I'll see him there.

[02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:10.050]
Okay.

[02:19:10.490 --> 02:19:14.550]
And Tata, we have an open line in the mobile one, a pound line at pound IOD.

[02:19:14.730 --> 02:19:16.270]
By the way, don't forget the yellow pudding pops.

[02:19:16.690 --> 02:19:17.470]
That's what we're going to do.

[02:19:17.550 --> 02:19:21.630]
We're going to take our amphetamines with yellow pudding pops, not phenobarbital, not

[02:19:21.630 --> 02:19:24.250]
barb-bitcherids for taking amphetamines to all ourselves.

[02:19:24.250 --> 02:19:25.470]
We want to do it the right way.

[02:19:25.710 --> 02:19:27.490]
So at least when we die, we'll be like ultra skinny.

[02:19:27.930 --> 02:19:28.890]
I want to die fast.

[02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:35.230]
Yeah.

[02:19:35.710 --> 02:19:36.750]
Any special reason?

[02:19:37.890 --> 02:19:38.150]
Okay.

[02:19:38.170 --> 02:19:39.710]
Let's go to a pompe-toe beach.

[02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:39.910]
Hello.

[02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:42.190]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:42.330 --> 02:19:43.010]
Hey, how are you?

[02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:43.390]
Great.

[02:19:44.010 --> 02:19:44.710]
Sensational, sir.

[02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:45.970]
Happy Friday to you.

[02:19:46.110 --> 02:19:46.250]
Happy Friday.

[02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.250]

[02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.250]

[02:19:46.810 --> 02:19:48.590]
You're saying you sound very happy.

[02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:49.210]
Yes, I do.

[02:19:49.470 --> 02:19:50.510]
Hey, let me ask you a question now.

[02:19:50.650 --> 02:19:52.990]
Now don't get out of shape and hang up on it.

[02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:53.290]
Okay.

[02:19:53.610 --> 02:19:54.490]
I want to know.

[02:19:56.090 --> 02:19:56.710]
I'm listening.

[02:19:56.990 --> 02:20:01.850]
I want to know what is Rick O'Rally going to do if you go to QAN?

[02:20:02.330 --> 02:20:03.850]
Probably show up every day by 130.

[02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:06.350]
Go on here at 2 into a four hour show with suds like he always does.

[02:20:06.930 --> 02:20:08.130]
I was thinking I had to.

[02:20:08.390 --> 02:20:11.570]
See, I hate to break the news to you, sir, but we all have this desire of survival.

[02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:13.990]
You know, self-preservation, putting some food on the table.

[02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:15.370]
You've got to make a living, man.

[02:20:15.490 --> 02:20:16.310]
That's what it's all about.

[02:20:16.410 --> 02:20:18.270]
No, but I wish them nothing but the best.

[02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:20.870]
I had an idea for a program for him for Rick.

[02:20:21.530 --> 02:20:23.550]
Rick in Paxon, the Religious Hour.

[02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.950]
Yeah.

[02:20:24.490 --> 02:20:25.210]
How does that sound?

[02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:26.590]
Well, it's got possibilities.

[02:20:26.910 --> 02:20:27.070]
Okay.

[02:20:27.150 --> 02:20:27.790]
Now, let me take something.

[02:20:27.890 --> 02:20:30.210]
When you get to QAN, I got an idea for programming.

[02:20:30.390 --> 02:20:32.510]
The first thing, the first thing you'll have the worst scene,

[02:20:32.930 --> 02:20:36.070]
you'll have the cream, which is you, and then Hank will be over-stuffed.

[02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:37.230]
Gene, how does that sound?

[02:20:37.350 --> 02:20:37.950]
Sounds okay.

[02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.510]
All right.

[02:20:38.770 --> 02:20:40.070]
Okay, I said he'll take the slop over.

[02:20:41.650 --> 02:20:45.450]
They'll take care, and if you go to QAN, I will never have to turn to 610 again.

[02:20:45.630 --> 02:20:45.850]
Okay.

[02:20:46.130 --> 02:20:46.610]
Take care, everybody.

[02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:47.030]
See ya.

[02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:49.290]
If I go, if I go, what do you think?

[02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:53.490]
We have an open line in Broward, 7679-463-767-WID.

[02:20:53.550 --> 02:20:55.910]
We managed to keep it almost completely quiet for a week.

[02:20:56.010 --> 02:20:57.990]
It was very, very, a lot of speculation, of course.

[02:20:58.330 --> 02:21:01.130]
And then, for some reason, that it just busted wide open.

[02:21:01.310 --> 02:21:04.330]
That's not bad in this market, though, keeping anything quiet for more than a half an hour.

[02:21:05.170 --> 02:21:05.950]
For like a week.

[02:21:06.430 --> 02:21:09.510]
And I'm going to continue like I told them last week, a week you go today.

[02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:11.970]
I told Peter Bulls, your eye intended show up every day.

[02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:13.550]
And I don't do my best to do my duty.

[02:21:14.050 --> 02:21:16.010]
And he said, duty my ass.

[02:21:16.250 --> 02:21:17.070]
I said, no thanks.

[02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:19.850]
And that's the way it is.

[02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:21.950]
It's just, you know, you do your thing to be a professional,

[02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:24.090]
and you just show up and you do the best you can.

[02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:25.790]
And then life moves on, and we all continue.

[02:21:26.050 --> 02:21:27.090]
Because we all got to eat.

[02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:27.590]
That's all.

[02:21:27.930 --> 02:21:31.770]
Not most of us have got big multi-gillion dollar yachts over there in Italy

[02:21:31.770 --> 02:21:34.310]
with those goddamn Italians yanking us all around.

[02:21:35.250 --> 02:21:37.630]
Some of us would like to be yanked around by some of those Italians,

[02:21:37.630 --> 02:21:39.130]
but sometimes it works out.

[02:21:39.390 --> 02:21:41.070]
Sometimes it don't.

[02:21:41.070 --> 02:21:41.790]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[02:21:42.670 --> 02:21:45.070]
As comma, say, dushbag in Italian.

[02:21:46.150 --> 02:21:48.750]
Oh, that's right. Italian class tomorrow with their professori.

[02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:50.590]
I can't wait for that. God is here. Good guy.

[02:21:50.610 --> 02:21:52.210]
Does he tell us some great stories or what?

[02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:55.070]
Do I know my Italian yet fluently or what?

[02:21:55.250 --> 02:21:55.450]
No.

[02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:56.630]
No, I really don't.

[02:21:57.330 --> 02:21:58.950]
Oh, no, do a...

[02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:59.890]
See, that's pretty good.

[02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:01.930]
You can count to two in Italian. You got it made.

[02:22:02.350 --> 02:22:03.250]
And then of course, quadro.

[02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:05.490]
They don't know whether you're speaking Spanish or Italian in this joint.

[02:22:05.690 --> 02:22:07.510]
So they look at you like, oh, okay, where's this one?

[02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.970]
What are you coming from?

[02:22:09.330 --> 02:22:10.850]
113 at WIOD.

[02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:16.890]
WIOD. When the dawn is in town, she's not listening to us.

[02:22:17.210 --> 02:22:18.990]
Oh, what are you thinking about?

[02:22:19.070 --> 02:22:20.370]
What are you thinking about?

[02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:23.270]
I believe we're ready now, though.

[02:22:26.450 --> 02:22:28.030]
Congratulations, Mr. Jackson.

[02:22:28.350 --> 02:22:30.030]
Here's your new baby boy.

[02:22:30.830 --> 02:22:32.570]
Would you prefer paper or plastic?

[02:22:33.130 --> 02:22:34.110]
That's pretty clear.

[02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:38.590]
I can't wait to get you home, Shimon, and show you your new pacifier.

[02:22:39.090 --> 02:22:40.790]
You're my baby, three-dish baby.

[02:22:41.810 --> 02:22:42.410]
Oh!

[02:22:43.330 --> 02:22:47.750]
What a lovely way to perpetuate my dead of failure.

[02:22:49.390 --> 02:22:51.410]
I'm a baby, three-dish baby.

[02:22:52.890 --> 02:22:55.250]
Shimon, you won't need a grip,

[02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:58.410]
because I've got a up close to failure.

[02:22:59.370 --> 02:23:01.950]
Oh, I want you to hold it.

[02:23:02.610 --> 02:23:05.430]
Oh, the pond will then grow up, mate.

[02:23:06.730 --> 02:23:08.770]
You'll get all you're deserving.

[02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:12.410]
My love will be unswerving.

[02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:16.110]
Until you reach 13,

[02:23:17.450 --> 02:23:19.190]
you're my three-dish baby.

[02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:23.810]
Come on, sit on daddy's lap.

[02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:26.390]
He has a game to play with you.

[02:23:27.090 --> 02:23:29.770]
Daddy wants you to find some magic springs.

[02:23:31.390 --> 02:23:32.190]
Oh, Shimon!

[02:23:33.250 --> 02:23:34.890]
118 at W-I-O-D.

[02:23:35.130 --> 02:23:37.090]
Happy Friday, happy day before the weekend.

[02:23:37.310 --> 02:23:39.050]
Happy three days after April Fool's Day.

[02:23:39.390 --> 02:23:40.670]
Happy, etc., okay?

[02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:41.310]
We're happy.

[02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:43.590]
Happy, a good job, a good yonthiff, etc.

[02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:45.850]
Here's plantation. Hello.

[02:23:46.310 --> 02:23:46.890]
Hello, Neil.

[02:23:47.010 --> 02:23:47.830]
Yes, sir. Happy Friday.

[02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.590]
And back to you.

[02:23:49.330 --> 02:23:50.810]
Listen, I wanted to ask you.

[02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:52.910]
I've seen the story on Channel 4,

[02:23:53.050 --> 02:23:54.430]
but I didn't read the article on the paper.

[02:23:54.730 --> 02:23:54.910]
Yeah.

[02:23:55.050 --> 02:23:55.710]
Did the thing...

[02:23:55.710 --> 02:24:00.730]
I mean, you've made my 22 years here worth living.

[02:24:00.890 --> 02:24:01.550]
Let's put it that way.

[02:24:01.690 --> 02:24:01.890]
Really?

[02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:03.630]
I wish you were on 12 hours a day.

[02:24:03.770 --> 02:24:04.130]
Oh, sure.

[02:24:04.510 --> 02:24:06.790]
But, you know, I realize you don't want to work 12 hours a day.

[02:24:07.490 --> 02:24:08.590]
But my car sounds good.

[02:24:08.930 --> 02:24:09.550]
My question is,

[02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:10.590]
if you go to QAM,

[02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:12.490]
they kept emphasizing on Channel 4,

[02:24:12.490 --> 02:24:13.710]
how it's a sports station.

[02:24:13.810 --> 02:24:13.990]
Yeah.

[02:24:15.090 --> 02:24:16.170]
Let me just...

[02:24:16.170 --> 02:24:16.430]
Let me just...

[02:24:16.430 --> 02:24:17.230]
Let me just cut the game.

[02:24:17.790 --> 02:24:18.130]
Oh, no.

[02:24:18.410 --> 02:24:20.130]
Let me just cut it off at the pass, saying this.

[02:24:20.310 --> 02:24:21.750]
Wherever I go, wherever I will be,

[02:24:21.870 --> 02:24:24.170]
I will continue to be doing the Neil Rogers show, period.

[02:24:24.170 --> 02:24:25.210]
So, it would be...

[02:24:25.210 --> 02:24:26.350]
Well, not be doing a sports show.

[02:24:26.490 --> 02:24:27.890]
I will not be doing any other kind of a show.

[02:24:28.010 --> 02:24:29.170]
I will not be doing a hockey games.

[02:24:29.430 --> 02:24:32.050]
I will not be doing standing on my head and doing summer assaults.

[02:24:32.110 --> 02:24:33.610]
I'll be doing the Neil Rogers show, period.

[02:24:33.870 --> 02:24:34.130]
All right.

[02:24:34.430 --> 02:24:34.970]
How do you like that?

[02:24:35.170 --> 02:24:35.490]
Okay.

[02:24:35.690 --> 02:24:36.130]
I like it.

[02:24:36.410 --> 02:24:37.650]
Okay, just as long as you're here.

[02:24:37.770 --> 02:24:38.350]
That's all I care.

[02:24:38.450 --> 02:24:38.710]
I'm here.

[02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.870]
Okay, thanks Neil.

[02:24:39.970 --> 02:24:40.370]
Okay, pal.

[02:24:40.490 --> 02:24:40.790]
Bye-bye.

[02:24:40.970 --> 02:24:41.430]
Have a great day.

[02:24:42.090 --> 02:24:42.950]
Open line in Broward,

[02:24:44.490 --> 02:24:46.690]
7679463-767-W-I-O-D.

[02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:48.630]
Suds missed all the excitement here.

[02:24:49.570 --> 02:24:51.590]
And Rick is on a way probably missing bonding

[02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:53.510]
with all of his good close personal friends.

[02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:55.550]
Cheryl was just here with a little tongue action

[02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:56.630]
giving kisses to all.

[02:24:57.290 --> 02:24:58.650]
And with that new hair to us,

[02:24:58.750 --> 02:24:59.730]
she's got a new boyfriend, huh?

[02:25:00.090 --> 02:25:00.770]
Under the age of 100.

[02:25:00.890 --> 02:25:01.530]
Nice going, sweetheart.

[02:25:03.150 --> 02:25:04.630]
And we had Greg Fadek,

[02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:06.890]
and we had like Mitch Lewis,

[02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:09.310]
and we had all kinds of people.

[02:25:10.930 --> 02:25:11.530]
Johnny Dark.

[02:25:11.790 --> 02:25:13.090]
I don't want to mention Johnny Dolan.

[02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.990]
He was even in here.

[02:25:15.310 --> 02:25:16.230]
What does that tell you?

[02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:17.410]
Here's Virginia Key.

[02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:17.730]
Hello.

[02:25:18.170 --> 02:25:18.610]
Hey, Neil.

[02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:19.110]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:20.230]
Hey, how you doing today?

[02:25:20.370 --> 02:25:20.570]
Great.

[02:25:21.070 --> 02:25:22.310]
Hey, I want to do something different.

[02:25:22.470 --> 02:25:25.050]
I want to instead of having some verb on the course with you,

[02:25:25.130 --> 02:25:25.750]
making a request.

[02:25:26.010 --> 02:25:26.230]
Yes.

[02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:28.930]
I want to make the request first and sing a song for you.

[02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.290]
Okay.

[02:25:29.490 --> 02:25:29.970]
Is that okay?

[02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.410]
Please.

[02:25:30.810 --> 02:25:31.930]
Okay, can I hear ball-spot?

[02:25:32.410 --> 02:25:32.770]
Yeah.

[02:25:33.050 --> 02:25:33.970]
I don't have a ball-spot.

[02:25:34.170 --> 02:25:34.410]
Okay.

[02:25:34.730 --> 02:25:35.630]
Here's my song. You ready?

[02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:36.550]
You mean the whole bit?

[02:25:37.290 --> 02:25:37.790]
Yeah, please.

[02:25:37.930 --> 02:25:38.190]
Okay.

[02:25:38.330 --> 02:25:38.950]
Let me sing my song.

[02:25:39.170 --> 02:25:39.430]
Okay.

[02:25:39.870 --> 02:25:40.870]
We will follow Neil.

[02:25:41.970 --> 02:25:44.290]
Follow Neil wherever he may go.

[02:25:45.210 --> 02:25:47.670]
There is an invitation too big.

[02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:50.850]
I still want to hear about Larry King's wig.

[02:25:51.490 --> 02:25:52.510]
Sometimes today.

[02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:55.450]
I hope K.A.M pays you one million.

[02:25:56.330 --> 02:25:57.470]
And yes, we think,

[02:25:57.630 --> 02:25:58.670]
brook, he's great.

[02:25:59.730 --> 02:26:01.730]
The new news guy here is okay.

[02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:03.470]
We miss one.

[02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:04.710]
Mindy at our ears.

[02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:04.910]
You're okay.

[02:26:06.250 --> 02:26:07.230]
Don't see any girl.

[02:26:07.810 --> 02:26:08.710]
No, don't go up here.

[02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.610]
I'm a punter.

[02:26:11.790 --> 02:26:12.490]
I know.

[02:26:13.270 --> 02:26:13.670]
Okay.

[02:26:14.310 --> 02:26:15.510]
Oh, God.

[02:26:16.110 --> 02:26:17.110]
Give us strength.

[02:26:18.050 --> 02:26:19.470]
Like I said, give us strength.

[02:26:19.770 --> 02:26:23.390]
I just noticed something that in one of your interviews with John Candy,

[02:26:23.550 --> 02:26:25.130]
I believe it looked like an older interview.

[02:26:25.290 --> 02:26:26.710]
You had less hair than you have today.

[02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:28.030]
How do you explain that?

[02:26:28.410 --> 02:26:29.770]
I don't wear a wig, sir.

[02:26:30.050 --> 02:26:30.910]
Paint your ball-spot?

[02:26:31.310 --> 02:26:32.070]
What ball-spot?

[02:26:32.430 --> 02:26:33.550]
You paint your ball-spot?

[02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:36.050]
I don't know what you're talking about, sir.

[02:26:36.130 --> 02:26:36.810]
My hair grows.

[02:26:37.410 --> 02:26:38.530]
You paint your ball-spot.

[02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:39.850]
I don't have a ball-spot.

[02:26:40.170 --> 02:26:41.990]
How come you had less hair on the tape?

[02:26:42.570 --> 02:26:43.730]
Maybe my hair grew.

[02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:45.630]
Maybe I had a bad haircut that day.

[02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:46.970]
By the way, something.

[02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:48.150]
What do you care?

[02:26:49.250 --> 02:26:50.110]
Paint your ball-spot?

[02:26:50.170 --> 02:26:50.750]
I don't.

[02:26:50.890 --> 02:26:52.130]
Do you paint your ball-spot?

[02:26:52.250 --> 02:26:53.390]
Paint your ball-spot?

[02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:54.590]
You sick of that.

[02:26:54.910 --> 02:26:55.570]
It's great radio.

[02:26:55.710 --> 02:26:55.930]
Amen.

[02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:57.970]
121 at WIOD.

[02:26:58.170 --> 02:26:59.050]
We have an open line in date.

[02:27:00.570 --> 02:27:00.970]
6229463.

[02:27:01.290 --> 02:27:02.150]
We got one in Broward.

[02:27:03.970 --> 02:27:04.370]
767WIOD.

[02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:05.590]
Here's North Lauderdale.

[02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.850]
Hello.

[02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:07.010]
Paint your ball-spot?

[02:27:07.210 --> 02:27:07.470]
Exactly.

[02:27:07.890 --> 02:27:08.690]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[02:27:08.770 --> 02:27:08.970]
Great.

[02:27:08.970 --> 02:27:12.470]
I want to wish you happy Friday to all you fine people at WIOD.

[02:27:12.730 --> 02:27:12.950]
Yes.

[02:27:14.370 --> 02:27:14.770]
610WIOD.

[02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:17.130]
Congratulations on your move wherever to help you go.

[02:27:17.290 --> 02:27:17.510]
Thanks.

[02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:19.630]
Smart enough to actually flip the dial.

[02:27:19.890 --> 02:27:21.270]
Uh-huh.

[02:27:21.350 --> 02:27:24.450]
I give you a call once a year to talk about hockey.

[02:27:24.730 --> 02:27:24.890]
Yeah.

[02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:27.030]
How do my devils look this year?

[02:27:27.390 --> 02:27:27.970]
How do they look?

[02:27:28.250 --> 02:27:28.410]
Yeah.

[02:27:28.610 --> 02:27:28.930]
Awesome.

[02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:30.270]
You think we could take the whole thing?

[02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:31.050]
Could be.

[02:27:31.170 --> 02:27:32.370]
And how old is Dougie Gilmore?

[02:27:32.670 --> 02:27:34.210]
34, I believe.

[02:27:34.450 --> 02:27:34.810]
34?

[02:27:35.070 --> 02:27:35.270]
Yeah.

[02:27:35.410 --> 02:27:36.610]
Still looking at him for a couple of years.

[02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:37.810]
Yeah, he'll be useful.

[02:27:37.810 --> 02:27:39.190]
Very excited to see him.

[02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:40.890]
Sure been useful so far, hasn't he?

[02:27:41.730 --> 02:27:42.090]
Tremendous.

[02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.550]
And great.

[02:27:42.670 --> 02:27:43.070]
Team around.

[02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.810]
In L.It's plain really good.

[02:27:43.810 --> 02:27:45.810]
Thank God that the Panthers didn't get Doug Gilmore.

[02:27:45.930 --> 02:27:48.690]
And we got that stalwart, Kirk Mueller, who looks like an old man

[02:27:48.690 --> 02:27:49.890]
ready to go out to see.

[02:27:50.030 --> 02:27:50.730]
Yeah, you can have him.

[02:27:50.770 --> 02:27:51.970]
We had him and life is good.

[02:27:52.170 --> 02:27:52.310]
Right.

[02:27:52.530 --> 02:27:52.750]
Uh-uh.

[02:27:52.850 --> 02:27:53.590]
Roshameless request.

[02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:54.050]
Okay.

[02:27:54.190 --> 02:27:56.430]
Being a Zom Italian, you want to be Italian.

[02:27:56.670 --> 02:27:57.450]
You want to go to Italy.

[02:27:57.790 --> 02:27:59.170]
Can you play Baffongula for me?

[02:27:59.670 --> 02:28:00.030]
Baffongula.

[02:28:00.270 --> 02:28:00.470]
Yeah.

[02:28:00.870 --> 02:28:01.810]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:28:01.950 --> 02:28:02.230]
Thank you.

[02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:02.910]
I'll read it there, Chi.

[02:28:03.150 --> 02:28:03.430]
Ciao.

[02:28:03.430 --> 02:28:04.190]
It's Santa Ra.

[02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:05.330]

[02:28:14.210 --> 02:28:14.210]

[02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:14.510]

[02:28:15.610 --> 02:28:15.610]

[02:28:17.430 --> 02:28:18.030]
Yeah.

[02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:21.610]
Yeah.

[02:28:21.610 --> 02:28:21.610]

[02:28:21.610 --> 02:28:21.610]

[02:28:21.610 --> 02:28:21.610]

[02:28:21.610 --> 02:28:21.670]
Yeah.

[02:28:21.950 --> 02:28:22.310]
Yeah.

[02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:22.310]

[02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:22.350]
Yeah.

[02:28:22.350 --> 02:28:22.590]
Yeah.

[02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:23.210]

[02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:23.210]

[02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:25.730]
Yeah.

[02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:25.730]

[02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:25.730]

[02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:25.730]

[02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:27.030]
Yeah.

[02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.030]

[02:28:29.810 --> 02:28:30.910]
Yeah.

[02:28:32.370 --> 02:28:32.370]

[02:28:32.370 --> 02:28:32.370]

[02:28:32.370 --> 02:28:32.370]

[02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:32.930]
Yeah.

[02:28:33.410 --> 02:28:33.410]

[02:28:37.730 --> 02:28:38.630]
Yeah.

[02:28:40.270 --> 02:28:41.170]
Yeah.

[02:28:42.130 --> 02:28:42.930]
Yeah.

[02:28:43.130 --> 02:28:43.130]

[02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:43.930]
Yeah.

[02:28:44.370 --> 02:28:44.550]
Yeah.

[02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:44.550]

[02:28:45.850 --> 02:28:46.350]
Yeah.

[02:28:49.290 --> 02:28:49.750]
Yeah.

[02:28:50.090 --> 02:28:50.170]
Yeah.

[02:28:51.330 --> 02:28:51.450]
Yeah.

[02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:52.050]
Yeah.

[02:28:52.330 --> 02:28:52.650]
Yeah.

[02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.270]

[02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.270]

[02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.270]

[02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.270]

[02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.270]

[02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.270]

[02:28:53.570 --> 02:28:53.810]
Yeah.

[02:28:53.810 --> 02:28:53.810]

[02:28:53.810 --> 02:28:53.810]

[02:28:53.970 --> 02:28:54.730]
Yeah.

[02:28:56.050 --> 02:28:56.050]

[02:28:56.050 --> 02:28:56.050]

[02:28:56.050 --> 02:28:56.170]
Yeah.

[02:28:56.170 --> 02:28:56.170]

[02:29:03.150 --> 02:29:03.250]
Yeah.

[02:29:03.390 --> 02:29:03.390]

[02:29:03.390 --> 02:29:03.470]
Yeah.

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.470]

[02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:03.490]
Somebody raise their car slowly.

[02:29:03.490 --> 02:29:03.490]

[02:29:03.490 --> 02:29:03.490]

[02:29:03.490 --> 02:29:04.590]
Be victorious in as far as they actually

[02:29:04.590 --> 02:29:08.070]
ach sunny in the Jusias, not how to find us,

[02:29:08.070 --> 02:29:10.730]
and fact they don't really see no mind us.

[02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:12.870]
Remember Roy Meng operating for all the money that he has spent.

[02:29:12.870 --> 02:29:14.950]
And the best I've ever been was back, we didn't see his end.

[02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:21.390]
Now he's working for the metal ants holding up some man. Hey, Bapangula. Bapangula, Bapangula, Bapangula.

[02:29:22.370 --> 02:29:26.010]
Bapangula, Bapangula, Bapangula, Bapangula. Bapangula, Bapangula, Bapangula.

[02:29:26.350 --> 02:29:26.910]
Are we on the air?

[02:29:28.610 --> 02:29:31.670]
First, you have a light in there, not just pretend you have a light in there, damn it.

[02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:39.610]
Anyway, it is Kosa Nostra, not Kosta Nostra, and it's also not Kasa. Kasa Nostra would be our house.

[02:29:39.610 --> 02:29:40.850]
I know. In Spanish.

[02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:46.030]
Yeah. In both languages, but he says Kosta Nostra in the song. Well, it was my point.

We're celebrating the fact that it's Friday. We're celebrating the fact that it was... And by the way,

[02:30:48.090 --> 02:30:52.290]
you know, that story about the cox sisters. I know for a fact it was wrong. It's an asshole celebration.

[02:30:52.410 --> 02:30:59.430]
It was a lie. And they're all out on the street. See them on the sidewalk. Oh, hear them shuffling feet.

[02:30:59.430 --> 02:31:09.250]
That's 20,000 assholes doing assholes from the native. Step aside, good people. There's the assholes on parades.

[02:31:17.330 --> 02:31:27.730]
We got the assholes for freedom. The assholes for fun. The assholes for Jesus. The assholes for guns.

[02:32:15.170 --> 02:32:26.090]
Oh, teach you won't you tell me how that really made the grade. Am I held my quest or am I just another asshole on me?

[02:32:26.090 --> 02:32:53.470]
I'm afraid.

[02:32:53.470 --> 02:33:02.290]
The assholes get the orders. And assholes grow the boat. The assholes get elected. The assholes get the boat.

[02:33:03.010 --> 02:33:11.370]
I once heard it said that all the assholes never died. They just lay in bed in a small fly.

[02:33:12.370 --> 02:33:21.150]
The assholes in the morning. The assholes every night. The assholes are landing. The assholes are the right.

[02:33:21.890 --> 02:33:31.030]
There's 20,000 assholes. The assholes are the right. Step aside, good people. There's the assholes on parades.

[02:33:36.050 --> 02:33:43.790]

[02:34:00.730 --> 02:34:08.710]
Because they're getting their tour. They're brand new building right up the street. The old Y100 building up here. How do you like that? They say they're still skeletons of built tanorin that building. And I believe it.

[02:34:09.530 --> 02:34:20.270]

WLS. No. Did you get the tape? I dropped off to you with the old WLS tingles on them. No. What was that? Probably about six or seven months ago.

Probably not. Can I ask a request of lightning round of some jingles? Jim played in well. Some jingles? Some old ones? Okay. You got it. See I told you we're doing requests in jingles today. And it took all the way to 130 before somebody with some taste called it and said, how about some old jingles?

[02:36:49.190 --> 02:37:18.770]

The one I talked to his teeth and just shev'n to shev'n to shev'n to five. Yeah, that was months ago. I heard that. Yeah. So what do you want me to talk about now? More the same. The guy.

We have an open line at Broward 7 6 7 W I would ease right Eric Reed talks through his teeth. Actually, there was once upon a time. I think it was either a year or two ago. He stopped doing that.

[02:37:18.770 --> 02:37:48.690]
He stopped doing that for like two games and I came on and I said, you know something I saw a little bit of the heat game on TV. And Eric Reed actually was pretty good. And then he started to go back to an out of gas. Shev'n to shev'n and I saw God get rid of that guy. And then I met him on Mandisen show that one. It was last year. One Sunday that he was on there with the man which and boy talk about an ask us. God almighty. And I said to Mandisen, you could do better than that on the show. You might even have on the show being improvement. And he looked at me in last.

Because of the Ibonics. They say the future be brought for me. Now I can't get snow job. Cause I don't got no little. I was talking like an old league.

[02:38:30.810 --> 02:38:44.410]
Roll. Ibonics taught me how this way. Now I can't do nothing. But my heritage say that's okay. Change my name to shoot. Roll. Drive a douce and a quarter. Ain't a Cadillac.

[02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:54.750]
I remember when I was stealing all the white men's cars hanging outside the building there.

[02:38:54.870 --> 02:39:00.810]
Bob. Grind the blues about poverty. White devil's got snow job for the end.

[02:39:01.110 --> 02:39:01.810]
Hi. Hi.

[02:39:32.890 --> 02:39:37.910]
I got nothing to do with literacy. Now I got to make more money.

[02:39:38.710 --> 02:39:43.410]
Labor food sounds good to me. I got plenty of nothing.

[02:39:44.050 --> 02:39:51.570]
Ibonics ain't getting me anywhere. Maybe I'll mug an old white bitch steal a bus and pull her hair.

[02:39:52.090 --> 02:39:56.930]
Then I gonna take some money. I was very old and a frigid dad.

[02:39:56.930 --> 02:40:07.030]
I remember when I was stealing all the white men's cars hanging outside the building there.

[02:40:07.170 --> 02:40:12.970]
Bob. Grind the blues about poverty. White devil's got snow job for the end.

[02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:14.150]
Hi. Hi.

[02:40:14.930 --> 02:40:17.950]
But Ibonics would get my life to change now.

[02:40:18.370 --> 02:40:19.310]
Hi. Hi.

[02:40:19.310 --> 02:40:22.550]
Got to go in, sell more crack cocaine.

[02:40:23.250 --> 02:40:23.710]
Crack cocaine.

[02:40:24.270 --> 02:40:24.870]
Crack cocaine.

[02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:27.250]
Crack cocaine.

[02:40:28.050 --> 02:40:28.710]
Crack cocaine.

[02:40:30.290 --> 02:40:31.110]
Crack cocaine.

[02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:32.090]
Crack cocaine.

[02:40:32.750 --> 02:40:32.750]

[02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:33.590]
Crack cocaine.

[02:40:35.270 --> 02:40:36.030]
Crack cocaine.

[02:40:40.370 --> 02:40:44.010]
That point, woolly goes cross-ranking it's right back to center.

[02:40:44.930 --> 02:40:46.070]
He's set it up again.

[02:40:46.310 --> 02:40:46.850]
All these pants.

[02:40:47.010 --> 02:40:48.350]
It's up to by Carter, Yager.

[02:40:48.930 --> 02:40:50.430]
That on the back gets a pass for the French.

[02:40:50.530 --> 02:40:51.470]
Now I love you right here.

[02:40:52.970 --> 02:40:54.790]
He's set it up again.

[02:40:54.790 --> 02:40:56.410]
He has been this work time.

[02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:57.270]
We know the ice.

[02:40:57.730 --> 02:41:00.430]
And he beats him like a run-in view on the penguins' lane.

[02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:01.630]
For the two.

[02:41:01.810 --> 02:41:02.710]
Very old, I love you.

[02:41:03.210 --> 02:41:05.230]
21 till two at W-I-O-D.

[02:41:05.450 --> 02:41:06.370]
Happy Friday to all.

[02:41:06.490 --> 02:41:07.870]
Why are we also happy around here today?

[02:41:07.950 --> 02:41:10.010]
Everybody seems to be in a really great mood today.

[02:41:10.310 --> 02:41:11.850]
Except Adam, who looks all pissed off.

[02:41:11.850 --> 02:41:13.130]
What's he pissed off about, huh?

[02:41:14.090 --> 02:41:15.210]
What'd you be pissed off about?

[02:41:15.930 --> 02:41:18.330]
He just pissed because when Steve Cain comes over here,

[02:41:18.410 --> 02:41:20.070]
they're probably going to make Nick Lawrence the executive producer

[02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:20.970]
and he's not going to get it.

[02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:21.570]
Oh, damn.

[02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:27.730]
If I was him, I'd be spending lots of time outside getting a good tan.

[02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:29.510]
Here's Halendale.

[02:41:30.110 --> 02:41:30.750]
Uncle Neil.

[02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:31.430]
Yes, sir.

[02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.970]
How you doing?

[02:41:32.130 --> 02:41:32.350]
Great.

[02:41:32.450 --> 02:41:34.470]
I just wanted to wish you the best of luck on Q-I-M.

[02:41:34.470 --> 02:41:35.830]
I need you to do a fine job.

[02:41:36.190 --> 02:41:36.550]
Yes, sir.

[02:41:36.650 --> 02:41:38.210]
And shameless request, please.

[02:41:38.270 --> 02:41:38.510]
Okay.

[02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:40.950]
Prison bitch from my friend Scott Dona,

[02:41:40.990 --> 02:41:41.650]
you and Halendale,

[02:41:41.950 --> 02:41:43.590]
is thinking about coming out of the closet.

[02:41:43.890 --> 02:41:44.230]
All right.

[02:41:44.930 --> 02:41:45.890]
Congratulations, Scott.

[02:41:46.050 --> 02:41:46.890]
We knew you could do it, pal.

[02:41:47.050 --> 02:41:47.550]
The man.

[02:41:47.850 --> 02:41:48.710]
And Tom, to hang out of that,

[02:41:48.770 --> 02:41:49.750]
so put a handle on it.

[02:41:49.970 --> 02:41:50.890]
That's the luck to you, Neil.

[02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:51.470]
Okay, thanks.

[02:41:52.450 --> 02:41:54.630]
They say I love his tapoo.

[02:41:56.650 --> 02:41:58.570]
They're what we're doing is wrong.

[02:42:00.190 --> 02:42:02.190]
But I don't care what they say.

[02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:06.310]
Because my love is so strong.

[02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:10.570]
They tell us we should be ashamed.

[02:42:11.610 --> 02:42:13.950]
We're not husband and wife.

[02:42:15.390 --> 02:42:18.250]
But I cherished each moment with you.

[02:42:19.410 --> 02:42:22.510]
I'm so glad you're in my life.

[02:42:33.450 --> 02:42:35.290]
You're my prison bitch.

[02:42:35.390 --> 02:42:36.570]
My prison bitch.

[02:42:37.090 --> 02:42:39.130]
You're not a light of the men.

[02:42:39.270 --> 02:42:42.230]
I'm glad we share a prison cell.

[02:42:42.610 --> 02:42:44.730]
We're lights go out at 10.

[02:42:45.210 --> 02:42:47.690]
I can't escape the way I feel.

[02:42:48.090 --> 02:42:50.190]
Now that would be a pride.

[02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:52.490]
As long as I am my friend.

[02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:52.490]

[02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:52.490]

[02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:52.490]

[02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:52.490]

[02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:56.570]
I don't mind doing time.

[02:42:57.010 --> 02:42:59.990]
Cause you're my prison bitch.

[02:43:00.330 --> 02:43:01.530]
My prison bitch.

[02:43:01.970 --> 02:43:03.730]
And I have no regrets.

[02:43:04.390 --> 02:43:06.950]
I got you for a candy bar.

[02:43:07.330 --> 02:43:09.350]
And a pack of cigarettes.

[02:43:10.250 --> 02:43:12.110]
At first you were resistant.

[02:43:12.850 --> 02:43:15.050]
But now you are my friend.

[02:43:15.770 --> 02:43:19.290]
I knew that I would get you in the end.

[02:43:19.290 --> 02:43:22.530]
Oh, prison bitch.

[02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:25.370]
Prison bitch.

[02:43:26.110 --> 02:43:30.130]
I guess that you were sent from up above.

[02:43:31.250 --> 02:43:33.630]
Yeah, prison bitch.

[02:43:34.970 --> 02:43:36.410]
Prison bitch.

[02:43:37.150 --> 02:43:39.910]
And now you are my prisoner.

[02:43:40.690 --> 02:43:41.850]
Oh, wow.

[02:43:43.290 --> 02:43:44.350]
And your prison bitch.

[02:43:44.830 --> 02:43:45.810]
Your prison bitch.

[02:43:46.190 --> 02:43:47.910]
And you're a sex machine.

[02:43:47.910 --> 02:43:51.150]
Oh, only have a request.

[02:43:51.630 --> 02:43:53.550]
How about some gasoline?

[02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:53.990]
Sure.

[02:43:54.550 --> 02:43:56.830]
I'm tired of this prison cell.

[02:43:57.330 --> 02:43:59.190]
I'm here to get away.

[02:44:00.010 --> 02:44:02.450]
They sentenced me to seven years.

[02:44:02.810 --> 02:44:04.870]
Now seven times a day.

[02:44:05.450 --> 02:44:06.450]
I'm your prison bitch.

[02:44:06.930 --> 02:44:07.910]
Your prison bitch.

[02:44:08.330 --> 02:44:10.070]
You're an infall maniac.

[02:44:10.450 --> 02:44:10.670]
Jimmy.

[02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:13.110]
I really hate these markers.

[02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:16.110]
That you tattooed on my back.

[02:44:16.110 --> 02:44:19.210]
I thought that I could break away.

[02:44:19.530 --> 02:44:21.570]
But now I'm losing hope.

[02:44:22.090 --> 02:44:25.610]
God, I'm bored of picking up the sound.

[02:44:25.930 --> 02:44:29.010]
And over prison bitch.

[02:44:29.430 --> 02:44:29.650]
What?

[02:44:30.510 --> 02:44:31.770]
Prison bitch.

[02:44:32.590 --> 02:44:37.250]
Burn up the lights because I can hardly wait.

[02:44:37.870 --> 02:44:40.090]
Prison bitch.

[02:44:41.210 --> 02:44:42.870]
Prison bitch.

[02:44:43.710 --> 02:44:47.770]
When I get out, I'm ready to go straight.

[02:44:48.310 --> 02:44:48.670]
Welcome.

[02:44:49.310 --> 02:44:50.790]
You're my prison bitch.

[02:44:51.110 --> 02:44:52.190]
My prison bitch.

[02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:54.710]
I'll never say goodbye.

[02:44:55.390 --> 02:44:57.710]
You're not like all the others.

[02:44:58.310 --> 02:45:00.930]
Too bad they had to die.

[02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:04.950]
On the second thought I'd live I'll stay.

[02:45:05.570 --> 02:45:07.630]
If you want me to.

[02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:10.170]
Your prison bitch.

[02:45:10.170 --> 02:45:16.210]
Is never leaving you.

[02:45:19.310 --> 02:45:21.130]
I hurt you when I sold me.

[02:45:21.490 --> 02:45:22.730]
But now you're my soulmate.

[02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.970]
So come here, baby.

[02:45:24.250 --> 02:45:24.830]
Come here.

[02:45:24.930 --> 02:45:25.870]
I know, don't go.

[02:45:26.250 --> 02:45:27.970]
Now I know what they call you.

[02:45:28.490 --> 02:45:29.430]
Heart criminal.

[02:45:29.830 --> 02:45:33.530]
You want to find out when you call this the polkae?

[02:45:42.110 --> 02:45:43.290]
You don't want to go.

[02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:47.650]
I've learned in the short time that we've been here in this building is that real serious born-again Christians.

[02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:49.530]
Number one, they don't ever swear.

[02:45:49.710 --> 02:45:50.290]
That's number one.

[02:45:50.410 --> 02:45:53.190]
And number two, they would never ever make up stories in life.

[02:45:56.530 --> 02:45:57.370]
144 WIOD.

[02:45:58.790 --> 02:46:00.590]
WIOD is not your radio.

[02:46:01.650 --> 02:46:03.590]
It's just real static.

[02:46:06.990 --> 02:46:08.390]
New York.

[02:46:12.890 --> 02:46:16.230]
Last week I did the craziest thing.

[02:46:16.510 --> 02:46:19.130]
I flew to Oakland to learn and eat bonnets.

[02:46:19.610 --> 02:46:23.230]
And then I hit the streets to go check out my stuff.

[02:46:23.550 --> 02:46:25.590]
And what happened was quite ironic.

[02:46:26.830 --> 02:46:29.510]
There was a black guy standing on the corner.

[02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:31.990]
I said to him, buzz out.

[02:46:32.130 --> 02:46:33.750]
And your blood, what's going down?

[02:46:34.090 --> 02:46:37.190]
Well, he looked at me as if I was some kind of brain.

[02:46:37.650 --> 02:46:40.710]
And you won't believe what he called me.

[02:46:40.950 --> 02:46:42.530]
Check a book, check a book.

[02:46:42.970 --> 02:46:44.450]
Now how do you like it?

[02:46:44.570 --> 02:46:46.030]
Check a book, check a book.

[02:46:46.350 --> 02:46:47.990]
But you don't like it.

[02:46:48.130 --> 02:46:49.610]
Check a book, check a book.

[02:46:50.050 --> 02:46:51.470]
The honky don't like it.

[02:46:51.610 --> 02:46:53.650]
Check a book, check a book, book, book.

[02:46:54.590 --> 02:46:56.470]
He said he bought an X- for you.

[02:46:56.910 --> 02:46:58.070]
And he pulled out a gun.

[02:46:58.070 --> 02:47:01.510]
I said, hey man, I'm just learning ebonyx 101.

[02:47:02.070 --> 02:47:05.290]
Then he named that B and said, here's lesson what old you.

[02:47:05.630 --> 02:47:08.630]
A rock, pop, a loop, pop, a rock, Sample.

[02:47:09.050 --> 02:47:11.510]
As I lay there, I thought I was dying.

[02:47:12.310 --> 02:47:14.190]
Someone called the paramedics.

[02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:15.570]
I presume.

[02:47:16.010 --> 02:47:19.210]
Then another dude said, man, you pathetic honky bull.

[02:47:19.530 --> 02:47:22.770]
To the ebonyx again, it will be this and you.

[02:47:23.010 --> 02:47:24.550]
Check a book, check a book.

[02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:26.570]
Now how do you like it?

[02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:28.230]
Check a book, check a book.

[02:47:28.470 --> 02:47:30.210]
That's you don't like it.

[02:47:30.290 --> 02:47:31.830]
Check a book, check a book.

[02:47:32.070 --> 02:47:33.590]
The honky don't like it.

[02:47:33.750 --> 02:47:35.470]
Check a book, check a book, book.

[02:47:36.090 --> 02:47:36.510]
I like it.

[02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:38.670]
Check a book, check a book.

[02:47:39.330 --> 02:47:42.290]
149 and W-I-O-D. Let's do dear field V.

[02:47:42.450 --> 02:47:42.630]
Hello?

[02:47:43.290 --> 02:47:43.730]
Hey Neil.

[02:47:43.950 --> 02:47:44.290]
Yes sir.

[02:47:44.530 --> 02:47:46.190]
Can you please play Pope Smokes Dove?

[02:47:46.530 --> 02:47:47.790]
The Pope Smokes Dove.

[02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:48.390]
Yeah.

[02:47:48.670 --> 02:47:49.130]
Are you sure?

[02:47:49.410 --> 02:47:49.630]
Yeah.

[02:47:49.830 --> 02:47:50.410]
That's what I heard.

[02:47:50.650 --> 02:47:52.930]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:47:52.930 --> 02:47:55.070]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:56.570]
God gave him the grass.

[02:47:57.050 --> 02:47:58.330]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:47:58.350 --> 02:47:58.590]
Yeah.

[02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.070]

[02:48:02.310 --> 02:48:04.050]
He's a good head there.

[02:48:04.270 --> 02:48:05.470]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:48:05.470 --> 02:48:05.990]
Oh my God.

[02:48:06.290 --> 02:48:07.750]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:48:08.110 --> 02:48:09.230]
Oh yeah.

[02:48:13.270 --> 02:48:14.830]
Oh yeah.

[02:48:15.770 --> 02:48:19.050]
Guys, I am the skill in chasing my effect.

[02:48:19.750 --> 02:48:21.290]
Homes in Wom get thrown on bread.

[02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:22.610]
Jesus breaks out back.

[02:48:22.610 --> 02:48:24.930]
Jesus Christ is super happy.

[02:48:25.170 --> 02:48:26.830]
Never stop chugging.

[02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:28.410]
Pope's invoked you stone a lot.

[02:48:28.750 --> 02:48:29.810]
He's the chastisest right.

[02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:30.350]
Oh.

[02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.610]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:48:32.130 --> 02:48:33.370]
God gave him the grass.

[02:48:33.970 --> 02:48:35.490]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:48:35.610 --> 02:48:36.930]
He likes you spaghamads.

[02:48:37.530 --> 02:48:39.150]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:48:39.310 --> 02:48:40.830]
He's a good head there.

[02:48:41.170 --> 02:48:42.790]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:48:42.870 --> 02:48:44.630]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:48:45.050 --> 02:48:46.410]
Oh yeah.

[02:48:47.390 --> 02:48:48.170]
Oh yeah.

[02:48:49.050 --> 02:48:49.910]
Oh yeah.

[02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.910]

[02:48:50.710 --> 02:48:50.870]
Oh yeah.

[02:48:52.670 --> 02:48:54.850]
They're checking to line up the hill.

[02:48:54.990 --> 02:48:56.370]
Two fudgees, paleo water.

[02:48:56.730 --> 02:48:58.490]
Two forgets and take a pill.

[02:48:58.690 --> 02:49:00.030]
Nice and scoured in juicet.

[02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:02.070]
Taking pills and not a joke.

[02:49:02.290 --> 02:49:03.510]
Four ain't proven both.

[02:49:04.050 --> 02:49:06.970]
First and second, do it took a narrow one and spoke.

[02:49:07.630 --> 02:49:09.230]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:49:09.450 --> 02:49:10.750]
He gave him the grass.

[02:49:11.290 --> 02:49:12.750]

[02:49:12.990 --> 02:49:14.310]
He likes you spaghamads.

[02:49:14.770 --> 02:49:16.490]

[02:49:16.490 --> 02:49:18.390]
He's a good head there.

[02:49:18.830 --> 02:49:20.390]
The pubsmokes Dove.

[02:49:20.390 --> 02:49:22.670]
They're coming down the electric channel.

[02:49:22.670 --> 02:49:23.890]
Oh yeah.

[02:49:24.890 --> 02:49:25.570]
Oh yeah.

[02:49:26.770 --> 02:49:27.390]
Yeah.

[02:49:30.350 --> 02:49:31.930]
The pub is getting higher.

[02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:34.070]
It's not going to be too slow.

[02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:35.470]
The pub is getting higher.

[02:49:37.230 --> 02:49:39.010]
the pub is getting higher.

[02:49:39.890 --> 02:49:42.630]
The pub is getting higher.

[02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:48.330]
The pop star's dove, got keepin' the grass.

[02:49:48.770 --> 02:49:51.870]
The pop's dove's dove, he likes his stoke mass.

[02:49:52.430 --> 02:49:55.230]
The pop's dove's dove, he's a cruiser.

[02:49:55.930 --> 02:49:59.330]
The pop's dove, the pop's dove's dove.

[02:49:59.670 --> 02:50:02.770]
The pop's dove, the pop's dove's dove.

[02:50:02.770 --> 02:50:05.630]
Smokes, dove, ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

[02:50:06.530 --> 02:50:33.790]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[02:50:53.510 --> 02:51:03.770]
heißtig calm, is be heard a pyj거든요illes, you know if you were... zeggen

[02:51:03.770 --> 02:51:05.270]
because Michael won't help a mountain. He says,

[02:51:05.410 --> 02:51:05.990]
Cheach, Abort.

[02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:08.970]
I wonder which your professor would think of that.

[02:51:09.330 --> 02:51:09.790]
Which means?

[02:51:10.410 --> 02:51:13.610]
Well, Chi Chi, which is a bad pronunciation of Chechi,

[02:51:13.710 --> 02:51:15.230]
which is the Garbanzo beans, you know.

[02:51:15.630 --> 02:51:16.630]
Oh, Chi Chi.

[02:51:17.150 --> 02:51:20.150]
It's a Cheach, which is a bad pronunciation.

[02:51:20.410 --> 02:51:21.750]
Abort, you know, that's the door.

[02:51:22.290 --> 02:51:22.610]
A port.

[02:51:22.850 --> 02:51:23.650]
Oh, port, that?

[02:51:23.770 --> 02:51:23.950]
Yeah.

[02:51:24.290 --> 02:51:26.550]
I think that's about the worst example of it.

[02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:27.410]
Oh my God.

[02:51:27.890 --> 02:51:29.170]
And the Cheach Abort.

[02:51:29.970 --> 02:51:30.090]
Huh.

[02:51:30.550 --> 02:51:31.130]
Very lovely.

[02:51:31.230 --> 02:51:31.930]
Well, let me ask you this.

[02:51:31.930 --> 02:51:33.950]
The Sicilians, though, don't speak the same.

[02:51:34.090 --> 02:51:35.870]
They speak Sicilian.

[02:51:36.210 --> 02:51:36.750]
That's correct.

[02:51:37.090 --> 02:51:37.230]
Right.

[02:51:38.070 --> 02:51:40.990]
And as I, because people tell me that not only Sicilians,

[02:51:40.990 --> 02:51:43.870]
but also the Napalatanos, I'm not talking about the horse

[02:51:43.870 --> 02:51:45.710]
people in Papano, but the people from Naples.

[02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:46.530]
They're not with us.

[02:51:46.770 --> 02:51:48.290]
Right. They also speak a different dialect

[02:51:48.290 --> 02:51:51.270]
that is so different that it's, if you knew like real Italian,

[02:51:51.390 --> 02:51:52.630]
you wouldn't know what they're like we're talking about.

[02:51:52.730 --> 02:51:52.930]
Exactly.

[02:51:53.210 --> 02:51:54.590]
That's where my people came from.

[02:51:54.690 --> 02:51:57.310]
And that's where I heard the worst examples of Italian.

[02:51:57.310 --> 02:51:57.450]
Right.

[02:51:58.370 --> 02:51:59.330]
But I was a kid in Brooklyn.

[02:51:59.910 --> 02:52:02.170]
Only if you pretend you don't understand the Sicilians,

[02:52:02.170 --> 02:52:03.410]
they're making offer you can't refuse.

[02:52:03.770 --> 02:52:06.070]
So you just smile and say, see, see.

[02:52:06.350 --> 02:52:07.950]
But the Napalatanos look down on us.

[02:52:08.050 --> 02:52:10.570]
And my mother always said, oh, those Indians, you know, they.

[02:52:10.970 --> 02:52:12.330]
See, if I ban you, whatever you say.

[02:52:13.010 --> 02:52:14.330]
Anyway, love the show.

[02:52:14.490 --> 02:52:15.290]
Follow you wherever you go.

[02:52:15.410 --> 02:52:15.790]
Thanks, pal.

[02:52:16.050 --> 02:52:16.270]
All right.

[02:52:16.350 --> 02:52:16.930]
I'll read the air, Chi.

[02:52:17.290 --> 02:52:17.590]
Ciao.

[02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:18.010]
Ciao.

[02:52:19.690 --> 02:52:20.090]
Bonacere.

[02:52:20.430 --> 02:52:21.730]
It's almost time for Bonacere.

[02:52:22.110 --> 02:52:23.750]
Thanks to the state of California,

[02:52:24.010 --> 02:52:25.910]
Ibanix has become an official language.

[02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:27.750]
But on the east coast in Brooklyn,

[02:52:28.110 --> 02:52:29.910]
Pizanix is ruling the street.

[02:52:30.130 --> 02:52:30.890]
Use guys.

[02:52:31.090 --> 02:52:33.990]
Check out the **** and bambenos on that broad

[02:52:33.990 --> 02:52:35.710]
and get a load of her poop.

[02:52:35.970 --> 02:52:38.750]
English translation, I really enjoy her company.

[02:52:39.170 --> 02:52:42.250]
So last night, I banged the hell out of this chicken,

[02:52:42.410 --> 02:52:43.710]
this real classy joint.

[02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:45.810]
English translation, I made love to her

[02:52:45.810 --> 02:52:46.990]
in the back of my Camara.

[02:52:47.410 --> 02:52:48.330]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:52:48.690 --> 02:52:50.550]
I'm the main tenon's director.

[02:52:50.770 --> 02:52:52.170]
We're all the youth hangouts.

[02:52:52.270 --> 02:52:55.290]
English translation, I'm a janitor at the elementary school.

[02:52:55.290 --> 02:52:58.110]
If you'd like to get your copy of hook-don Pizanix,

[02:52:58.290 --> 02:53:00.450]
just stuff some money in a plain brown envelope

[02:53:00.450 --> 02:53:02.750]
and shove it under the back door of Mario's

[02:53:02.750 --> 02:53:05.050]
over on the west side and will be in touch.

[02:53:05.450 --> 02:53:06.090]
Gras yameele.

[02:53:07.030 --> 02:53:09.190]
155 at W-I-O-D. Here's Sunrise.

[02:53:09.430 --> 02:53:09.610]
Hello.

[02:53:09.950 --> 02:53:10.690]
How you doing, El?

[02:53:10.830 --> 02:53:11.090]
Great.

[02:53:11.710 --> 02:53:14.710]
Hey, listen, Alex Hernandez getting any more money

[02:53:14.710 --> 02:53:16.490]
since they've named the team after him.

[02:53:16.830 --> 02:53:17.630]
Alex Fernandez?

[02:53:18.250 --> 02:53:18.290]
Yeah.

[02:53:18.710 --> 02:53:19.930]
They've named the team after him.

[02:53:20.210 --> 02:53:22.110]
Every time you hear the news, Alex Hernandez

[02:53:22.590 --> 02:53:23.990]
and the Marlin, right?

[02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.110]
Right.

[02:53:24.970 --> 02:53:25.330]
Yeah.

[02:53:25.590 --> 02:53:27.250]
Well, no, they're paying them by the pound.

[02:53:27.270 --> 02:53:28.410]
That's why he owes the team now.

[02:53:28.650 --> 02:53:28.850]
OK.

[02:53:29.010 --> 02:53:29.530]
Yeah, really?

[02:53:29.630 --> 02:53:29.990]
That's right.

[02:53:31.290 --> 02:53:32.630]
Listen, can you play something for me?

[02:53:32.730 --> 02:53:33.010]
I might.

[02:53:34.810 --> 02:53:37.070]
Courtney Lobb does the Shakespeare?

[02:53:37.550 --> 02:53:37.790]
OK.

[02:53:38.090 --> 02:53:38.630]
Thank you, sir.

[02:53:39.350 --> 02:53:40.270]
Courtney Lobb does Shakespeare?

[02:53:41.010 --> 02:53:41.430]
Oh, yeah.

[02:53:42.290 --> 02:53:43.210]
Is that what that's called?

[02:53:44.530 --> 02:53:44.690]
George?

[02:53:45.470 --> 02:53:45.830]
I guess.

[02:53:46.590 --> 02:53:47.250]
You guess?

[02:53:47.470 --> 02:53:49.090]
Well, I never actually saw the title of it

[02:53:49.090 --> 02:53:50.150]
since it's on one of the other things.

[02:53:50.170 --> 02:53:51.990]
Oh, it's on one of these things that I got in here.

[02:53:51.990 --> 02:53:54.410]
And am I going to find that before we have time to get out of here?

[02:53:54.710 --> 02:53:55.710]
Because if I don't, he's going to be.

[02:53:55.750 --> 02:53:56.610]
It's going to ruin his weekend.

[02:53:57.090 --> 02:53:58.430]
I don't want to ruin that guy's weekend.

[02:53:59.070 --> 02:53:59.570]
Do I?

[02:53:59.890 --> 02:54:00.230]
Does I?

[02:54:00.990 --> 02:54:01.910]
Oh, where's number 51?

[02:54:01.910 --> 02:54:03.230]
I can't find number 51.

[02:54:03.230 --> 02:54:04.090]
This is so depressing.

[02:54:04.570 --> 02:54:05.330]
And so on.

[02:54:05.430 --> 02:54:07.750]
You know, and I'm going to feel bad.

[02:54:07.950 --> 02:54:08.570]
I'm going to tell you what.

[02:54:08.590 --> 02:54:10.090]
If we go 10 minutes over and the Rick and Suds,

[02:54:10.090 --> 02:54:11.690]
I'm going to find that stupid damn thing.

[02:54:11.850 --> 02:54:13.870]
And then I don't think it's the one he's talking about anyway.

[02:54:15.230 --> 02:54:16.070]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:54:16.610 --> 02:54:17.270]
Where is it?

[02:54:18.010 --> 02:54:18.910]
Where the hell it be?

[02:54:19.150 --> 02:54:19.830]
Where do it be?

[02:54:20.130 --> 02:54:20.730]
There's 50?

[02:54:21.350 --> 02:54:22.150]
There's 52.

[02:54:22.830 --> 02:54:25.110]
Where the hell is this number 51 for Quenna?

[02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:25.990]
Are you hiding it?

[02:54:26.570 --> 02:54:27.430]
Are you sitting on it?

[02:54:28.350 --> 02:54:29.730]
Are you like squeezing it?

[02:54:30.590 --> 02:54:31.830]
Oh my God.

[02:54:32.450 --> 02:54:33.390]
Manajalam is area.

[02:54:34.050 --> 02:54:34.470]
No God.

[02:54:35.210 --> 02:54:37.270]
Like I said, it's around somewhere, but forget it.

[02:54:37.570 --> 02:54:38.570]
So anyway, I tried like hell.

[02:54:38.650 --> 02:54:39.310]
Tonight you saw me.

[02:54:39.390 --> 02:54:39.790]
You were witness.

[02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:40.270]
I tried.

[02:54:40.390 --> 02:54:41.010]
Too bad he loses.

[02:54:41.810 --> 02:54:43.130]
156 at WIOD.

[02:54:43.270 --> 02:54:45.090]
Noble prices.

[02:54:45.330 --> 02:54:47.430]
That's what they say at University Dodge in Davy.
