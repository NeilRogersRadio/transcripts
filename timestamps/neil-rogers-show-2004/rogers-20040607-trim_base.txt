I am not a Nazi sure whatever you say 10 oh one at five sixty

[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.620]
I guess I'm not supposed to sound too enthusiastic. I was supposed to be a little modeling today

[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.020]
a little bit

[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.160]
Do we have to be?

[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.000]
I mean, I'm not like jumping up and down with glee, but you know the guy was dying for 10 years

[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.620]
Why is it that we have to be in mourning? We are like Nancy said even Nancy Reagan said the it's a sense of relief

[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.540]
She's like holy crap, but you know enough is enough already isn't exactly what she said right now

[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.340]
They've got to be what she was feeling, huh if they just had those stem cells in time

[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.860]
Yeah, we did just had those stem cells president bush

[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.280]
Just a little bit of that stem cell research which he sure turned around on that instead of just saying

[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.240]
To stem cell research that was one thing she was starting to say weird a little bit too late like about many years

[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.740]
I mean, I just I don't know if I can stand much more this. It's all Ronnie Reagan all day

[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.240]
Well anyway first let's get to the bad news. Oh, here's the good news though first. Let's start out on the upbeat note

[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.640]

Anyway, here's the bad news

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.940]
A car bomb exploded yesterday near the gate to a us run based north of Baghdad killing six people and drink 20 others

[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.200]
Including two us soldiers the west military said also yesterday the west military freed more detainees from the notorious

[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:44.480]
Prison the center of the scandal involving abusive inmates by american soldiers the release was the fourth major one from the facility since the scandal broke in April

[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.420]
And I guess most of the detainees probably will be going to get their back down not to make sure they're okay

[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.040]
Wouldn't you think maybe their first stop?

[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.940]
I would think one would think so Ursula and rest in a state of undress on our behind-to-be

So at any rate. She was in 80 trillion movies how many trillion was she in?

[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.920]
I said I exaggerate 30 trillion movies. There she is behind the beard curtain

[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.380]
I love that part where John Ascroft is singing in the movie there. They had that clip. Oh brother really him

[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.120]

You can go to michaelmore.com right now and view the trailer now was on there last week

[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.420]
But it was almost impossible to get on there because in fact they had to take it down

[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.680]
For a while because they were getting so many hits that it was overloading the site and they were just going nuts

[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.100]
So it's on there this morning and we were both able to view it and I taped the

[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.000]
Audio part therefore to kind of like spice it up a little right as opposed to sitting here for the next several days

[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.460]
Morning about Ronnie Reagan Michaelmore.com

[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.200]
It reminds me like Jimmy Carter when he goes to that big peanut farm in the sky

[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.480]
I mean do we have to say oh he was such a wonderful man and look at all the great things

[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.240]
He did after he was the president and look at how he ran around the world sticking his now

[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.980]
Too many couldn't and great things while he was the president because we had that

[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.940]
Running across the country and we had those hostages in our ran that we didn't do all that well in capturing with those

[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:59.320]
Smash helicopters and dead people on the ground by the way sort of a problem with Jimmy Carter just awarding yes thundering

[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.360]
Hey, that listen, it's the sun is shining here man. It's gonna be about 80 today

[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.140]
And it's just beautiful, okay? So there anything again as usual any malfunction at the junction is gonna be on your

[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.820]
Back to end any minute now I expect a direct hit power outage all that

[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.420]
Which means we can go home right well I am home all right all right excellent really

[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.860]
Well, this is supposed to be hurricane season. It's supposed to be like the end of the world the building is shaking

[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.820]
Is it really well maybe fat boy just came in

[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:28.940]
I

[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.120]
Yeah, either we're gonna have a big storm or maybe

[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.560]
Fat boy just waddled in where was mock this morning didn't have our usual confabulation, huh

[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.560]
Maybe he's off to the a proctologist again. He seems to spend an awful lot of time over there hanging it out

[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.300]
All the way to get clearance into this morning clearance is running around like a busy beaver taking care of business

[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.480]
He's probably a little bit down because his friend the beast is

[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.660]
Little off his feet after that big baseball. What kind of crap was that?

[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.300]
I've never seen anybody as insignificant as the beast

[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.260]
Get more airtime and more uh get his finger in more different places clearance

[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.960]
And then of course we had the horse race on Saturday and everybody and I wonder everybody's done

[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.720]
I wasn't just Ronnie Reagan done over the weekend, but there was poor

[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.160]
Smarty Jones kind of dying in the stretch

[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.860]
I didn't like the whole concept of that race there were too many horses in there in the first place

[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.480]
Nine or should have been like five or six in a bell month which they're usually are by attrition and all these jackasses

[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:32.020]
Oh, well, I'm gonna put in master or whatever that one horse was and uh purge he's purge and all right as we speak

[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.880]
There were too many horses in here and then they were race running the race

[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.200]
It's a mile and a half like they were gonna press him all the way like if we can't beat him

[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.220]
We're gonna make sure somebody else does not that they should just seed him the triple crown

[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.640]
But what the hell were they doing up there early in a race you clowns you idiots Alex Solis and Jerry Bailey

[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.340]
Pox on you people

[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.680]
But Joe had to write it. I've never in my life

[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.840]
It would be like if the lightning wouldn't stand like up tonight

[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.740]
They said oh, we're so sorry that was really a gold the other day and you people in Calgary deserve it

[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.700]
And we want to apologize for winning well whoever heard us such a thing right

[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:03.700]
Right

[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.660]
Huh?

[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.820]
Right right now you watch the race don't give me that crap you didn't watch smarty Jones get beat by no

[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:17.360]
You kidding them between uh, you know Reagan dying and Jail getting married. Oh, this is before Reagan died, huh? Huh

[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.500]
This was before Reagan died. Oh, we have the Jailo marriage then. Oh, we got that coming

[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.280]
Anyway, here is it but I just didn't love but it's another it proves again the Thurber Racing is in big trouble

[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.060]
You know, we thought this was a super horse. He's a very good horse and we love smarty Jones and yada

[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.500]
But he's not a super horse

[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.500]
Because a super horse. I mean they weren't going like lightning fractions early

[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.160]
Uh, when you got that lead at the top of the stretch you would have drawn off in one in hand like secretary

[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.800]
Maybe not by 31 lives, but he's not a super horse

[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.560]
Thurber Racing's got real tourists, which is why we have an out of triple crown winner in 27 years and probably won for another 25 years

[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.780]
It's very sad, but at any rate, you don't care about that and it's sad too all those tears of oh

[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.860]
So sorry that we beat him in America loves party, but we'll take the money. Thank you

[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.820]
All those rich you know horse racing is very much like golf. It's for snobbs rich snobbs

[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.260]
Although anybody can go out and play golf even that'll president take like I said it's for rich snobbs

[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.060]
12 minutes after 10 we'll give it a result of the pull from the other day

[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.760]
We'll take that we got a couple of pulls today one now and one at noon same thing kind of like twisted ass backward

[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.800]
All the pulls all the time and then we'll let the people call in and uh

[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.020]
We can eulogize Ronnie Reagan for four hours. What do you say come on

[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.140]
Did the show I get the show rises here? Are you gonna start with at you polished crap again?

[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.700]
Shame on you. It was greasy kid stuff

[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.300]
Let me tell you right now about balance for life. All you fat people out there

[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:44.260]
We know a big issue for most of you is should you do the five-day plan or seven-day plan a lot of you have been arguing about that for weeks

[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.840]
Now the five-day plan does not include the weekends

[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.240]
But if you just want a few meals on Saturday and Sunday well, there's a problem there at Delima

[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.700]
The seven-day plans got all the meals, but what if you have dinner plans on a weekend

[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.280]
It's all or nothing but now balance for life for those of you who are confused has the six-day plan

[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.740]
As if you're not confused enough already on Friday night you'll get one sack to keep you going for the entire weekend

[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:10.440]
So you can pick out what meals you want to eat and when the best part of this plan is since balance for life is the only meal

[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.960]
The delivery service that all these you choices you can choose meals from either the Saturday or Sunday menu

[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.700]
And added this plan if you tell the wonderful people at balance for life

[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.600]
And they wrote this of course the wonderful folks at balance for life where you're gonna eat out

[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.040]
They'll tell you which items on the menu are balanced for life approved

[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:31.620]
What a complete service what's not to like and balance for life is working exclusively with a few local restaurants to label menu items

[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.860]
Balance for life approved so move over over atkins and watch your step. Please the zone is the way to go

[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:42.080]
And that's what the basis is of course for balance for life is dr. Barry Sears no relation to Brian Sears

[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.580]
That's the way to go by the way nice going Brian here at the Mohawk given night boys. He greater what Brian Sears

[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:38.420]
The agreement okay. Don't leave them out. What the hell do we want to talk about mayor of penis pecania anyway

[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.180]
We don't want to talk about him. Do we know?

After all every man wants his woman to have

[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.520]
Jellos

[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:04.860]
Oh

[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:10.020]
Oh, Jennifer Lopez is very air and the confidence counter of a fine story area. We'll get through in a minute

[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:15.860]
Anyway, here's a this reminds me this uh fax you just sent me yeah, got a tombstone. It's his RIP

[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:20.220]
Supplied side trickle down food and economics reminds me that Frank X Locando song

[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.100]
I had back in the I&Z days. I think that was the name of it supply side trickle down

[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:29.880]
Where economics I wish you still had that but then again if I play that people be oh, that's important taste

[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.080]
Neal that's sacrilegious that's disrespectful. Yeah, too bad can't handle the truth

[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:40.060]
See this is another part of the crap that the media keeps appendling on the public and that is that every time somebody dies

[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:44.800]
We have to immediately like you will judge them with the greatest of reverence even if we didn't like him

[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.300]
Or if they were like media occur or hated them like poison all of quite frankly was a hell of a lot better than what we got now right top

[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.400]
Had Reagan look what we got

[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.260]
Anyway, the tombstone says supply side trickle down food oregonomics

[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:01.760]
Wasteful spending on a massive nuclear arsenal creation of the largest detonation in history declaration of ketchup as events

[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:08.360]
Well, that was a Nancy's idea by the way in fact every idea had was Nancy's idea come to find out Nancy probably got it from a recycling

[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.340]
An astrologer

[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:16.100]
Leaving us to legacy a bush one and two contributing to an unstable at least an increasing global terrorism and resting pieces

[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.980]
It's so on

[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:23.160]
I mean, it should be a blessed event when somebody has got all-time as especially who's been deteriorating the way he has and

[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:28.280]
Keeping her like on the pins and needles for 10 years when somebody like that finally let's go you should say a right

[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.980]
British in 93 how old is old enough 90

[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.560]
That was bad

[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.820]
What I don't know anybody man yet ahead you don't you're picking on my mother now

[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:45.080]
It's not that not not to pick on your mother now you're picking on my mom, but you have a good point

[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.460]
And is jaylo ever gonna marry a heterosexual?

[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.400]
Oh, let me come on. Yeah, huh?

[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.900]
What a dick who is she kidding and what did I always tell you about Mark Anthony? It takes one to know one man

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.900]
He looks like a scrimmer to me, okay

[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:05.220]
Yeah, I always thought he looked like skeletor first. She had that dancer return that belly dancer who made Ron Reagan

[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:11.100]
Oh, do we need to see Ron Reagan Jr anymore? Oh god, honey. Just please go back in and shut the door behind you

[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:16.320]
There's one thing that's starting to really bug me. It's all these fake marriages and all the I can't stand it

[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.840]
If you want to stay in the closet, okay do whatever you want

[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:24.580]
But all these phony romances and phony I mean the rock Hudson thing was back in the air and

[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.760]
When I was like in the 70s maybe

[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.280]
60s or 70s when they had him hooked up and actually married him off there for a little while that poor girl

[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.200]
But why do we have to keep doing this? I mean especially in this gay and they in age

[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.100]
Jennifer Lopez reportedly married Mark Anthony

[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.400]
And a rather small ceremony at her home

[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.720]
And how come they didn't have to have a big timmis about this like with the Ben Affleck?

[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.660]
So I guess they didn't do publicity and of course he already did have a wife supposedly

[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.660]
Less than six months after she had her high profile engagement to Ben Affleck

[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.540]
So we had the ballet dancer we had P. Diddy who we know as a screamer

[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:03.680]
We had Ben Affleck who we know is doing math Damon and now we got Mark Anthony. I'm telling you right now. I'm out of Cone Grande

[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.220]
Well if you was weekly in people magazines reported Saturday's nuptials

[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.360]
Folks been Rob Shooter told the AP Sunday that he had no immediate comment

[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.860]
And neither magazine published comment for me their shooter or I represented it for Anthony

[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:22.880]
For Lopez 34 the marriage were marker third the first was to waiter O'Johnny Noah that we oh

[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.760]
I forgot about that when I was another body Cone O'Johnny

[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.780]
O'Johnny the second to dancer Chris Judd in 2001

[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.740]
Who actually now is out of the closet? I guess uh in Noah lasted a little more than a year Judd for nine months

[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.560]
Anthony the Latin singing sensation just divorced former Miss Universe

[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.680]
Diana Torre's last week in the La Te Pugica de Minicana

[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:49.560]
The pair went in 2000. They have two young sons. He has a daughter from a previous relationship. Right Madicone

[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.940]
Lopez the singer actress fashionista more famously known as JLo has kept her romance with Anthony 34

[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:03.640]
Decidely more low key than a engagement to Ben Affleck which was a magnet for a magnet for tabloid attention a faggot magnet

[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.720]
as

[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.500]
Junior Say I would say

[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.480]
The 18 month benefit romance featured near wedding but was scuttled at the last minute with a couple

[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.160]
Diving excessive media attention how many times did they scuttled it

[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:20.640]
Lopez also famously dated Sean p. Diddy Cone is back when he was still puffy for two years before the couple broke up in

[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.080]
February 2001 but since he was puffy he got the shot and he got that thing fixed it's gone back down the normal size

[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.360]
It was unclear when Anthony and Lopez were engaged the two first dated

[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.460]
1999 have been seated together since Lopez's split from Affleck

[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:38.940]
Lopez reportedly been wearing a dazzling new diamond engagement ring for several weeks. Well what did you do?

[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:45.020]
Okay, thank god we didn't have to have a big simmison song at an answer about that because quite frankly nobody cares JLo

[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.600]
Nobody cares. Okay. Here's the first pull better get to it because we got to today. Don't do it all

[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.400]
Huh? Don't do it all

[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:59.680]
Pull one since 1960 who do you think was our best president and of course it's up there already so we got some votes

[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.580]
Let's take a peek

[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.660]
Clinton 53

[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.840]
JFK 16 Reagan a dozen

[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.200]
Nixon five Carter five LBJ two Ford one

[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.240]
Bush two one and Bush one has got oh

[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:21.820]
You got two bushes on there between the two of them. They got one. That's like a half a vote of peace out of the first 95 votes

[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:27.140]
That's not too simple anything what I would say. That's pretty weak, huh? Well the creepers haven't gotten on there yet

[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.400]
They're just for the first creepers forget about the creepers. Okay. Don't be making excuses now

[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.920]
And you know as well as I do that Reagan's holding out a dozen for one reason. What is that? He's dead

[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.960]
He's dead. He's just quote and everywhere you look here

[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:45.300]
Here you go over time and this outpouring of support that you mentioned from Democrats with Democrats like Senator Edward Kennedy says that while they

[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.420]
Disagree with a lot of president Reagan's policy he never stole a freight train

[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:53.300]
That's what they said. He stole a couple of horses out there in Hollywood the great communicator

[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.860]
And while some of the other actors were busy like really in combat during WW2

[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:03.040]
He was busy acting to be in combat right? Well, that's almost like being in combat. Yeah, it's close enough

[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.300]
Well, we'll get to those skating stories and then you'll say oh you faster

[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.800]
How can you do that everybody else is paying their respects? Because I don't have any respect for him

[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:15.800]
None zero zippity do not in fact he was the one who planted the seeds the people behind him and him

[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.020]
They planted the seeds for this fascism that we have today. This was the beginning of the end

[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.860]
For what we used to know as America

[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:29.180]
This was the beginning of this grotesque experiment toward the far right which we thought at the moment was just an aberration but come to find out

[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.760]
When it couldn't hang on what you know last time around they just decided to steal it

[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.680]
Because there was too much your money up for grabs 20 before 11 at 560 wqm

[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.140]
We got Kim Bo camper from Adog at two. Well, I can't stand those people at home work every day, you know

[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.780]
Hank Goldberg the hopper will be a chula steak two and Miami Lakes

[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:04.800]
Landu Al's a giri who knows nothing about any sport. He'll be on at 7 any K at 10 and ice clean the slate there as the marlins are going to be a move it on to Cleveland

[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:12.040]
To tackle those Indians and you know what the president said Abu Garret is nothing like tackling in does he learn that from Teddy Roosevelt

Here's a fact that says from one of our weekly chronic factors

[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:34.160]
I'm about a sympathetic to Reagan's passing as he was to the tens of thousands of sinners who died from AIDS during his term

[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.600]
They were just bags anyway

[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:41.620]
Of course not of the news models who've been masturbating furiously since Saturday will have nothing good to say about Bubba when his time comes

Letterman's been showing the clip of ascroft singing let the eagle sewer song written by the attorney general himself for the past three years

[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.620]
It takes nothing away from Michael Moore. I'm for anyone who sticks it to the right wing

[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.500]
But good. Well, actually I was wrong about the abelmont

[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.880]
Let's see Reagan died at 409 Saturday and the bell ma was at 645 there about

[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:06.840]
So I apologize. Let's get it right. Okay. Let's not be like the big oh, but I can't wait for smarty Jones to come back as an eight-year-old and run on the adurbi again

[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:12.560]
Man see if you don't know anything about hockey horse racing any of these other things if you just a typical football

[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.840]
And then just stick to what you know up a little bit about and I do mean a little bit. Oh, you know what I'm saying?

[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.860]
Speaking of ash crop. Yeah, and that facts you got it right

[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.160]
Where you can go and watch the whole thing right? I'm watching it during the break

[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.120]
Scariest thing I've ever seen in my life not even close really

[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:36.780]
Oh, yeah, even scarier than the a beheading video Nick Berg. Uh, yeah. Wow. Yeah

[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.660]
See we have a audio end video here at the site

[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.680]
Oh my god

[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:56.540]
Wow

[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:02.040]
Since 1960 who do you think was our best president? We'll turn it around and do the worst starting in noon our second pull

[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.780]
You know we were gonna do that didn't you? Sure. Oh, yeah

[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:12.560]
166 votes on us already Clinton 96. We love you. Bob. Come on back his book comes out June 22 by the way. I will read it

[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:19.160]
As a point I still got Hillary sitting here. Remember the pages are right on the ear a few. Yeah, that's all that's all I read. Oh, man

[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:19.420]
God

[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:27.460]
You don't have a fireplace do you? No Reagan 24 but I can throw off my balcony Reagan 24

[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.940]
Nixon 6 Carter 5 Bush 2 is got four now. All right. He's making a move

[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.680]
Like this drive

[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.920]
LBJ 2 4 1 and Bush 1 is got

[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:44.120]
Oh, almost 200 votes. Oh, that is scary

[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.720]
He was the first big. Oh, I do like that none

[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.320]
I'm sure we're gonna get a lot of calls you will judging president Reagan today because he was a great American a great communicator

[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.200]
A wonderful spokesman for general electric that was back in his liberal days when he was the president of the

[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:05.040]
American screen actors gildon was very pro union was involved with right up to his earlobes and then all of a sudden

[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:11.220]
He uh got into a cab one day and somebody said to him. Hey, how about being a Republican and becoming a right-wing fanatic?

[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.740]
He said sure no problem. He said you just write the script non-memorize it like he wouldn't believe to come out of my lips like butter

[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:25.000]
And sure enough it did and all of a sudden became virulently anti-labor. I wonder how the air traffic controllers are viewing his passing

[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.900]
In fact, I wonder how all of between him and Carter all that deregulation sure does a lot of good and oh yeah

[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.880]
Nothing like it. Uh-huh

[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.480]
I was he's your airline's doing by the way

[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.720]
Oh, they're up and flying just fine. Aren't they doing well? Oh, we're fine. Yeah

[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.180]
Somebody cue me him. Hello

[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.260]
Uncle Neil. Yes, sir

[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.440]
You're so right about the get

[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.720]
Yeah, how many scummy things that this guy did even before he did the switch

[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.020]
He was actually during the McCarthy era

[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:58.140]
He was one of the actors that was actually snitching or or finger in

[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.420]
A lot of people are forgetting he was pointing the finger and a lot of the other actors

[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.600]
He was working for the man as far back as then right

[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.280]
And all these media that over the weekend in this entire week in this coverage

[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:17.400]
This is the same media that rolled over and played dead when they were bumping around the Reagan movie off the television

[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.840]
I'll see it is right and they had to firm it up to a

[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.120]
Combo whatever nobody watched right exactly public can't help the truth man

[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:29.240]
We don't want the truth getting out there and if anything is too close to the truth the right wingers get together

[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.400]
We're gonna boycott. We're gonna do you know and they make sure they don't put it on

[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:38.660]
They'll crush you. They'll crush you also the factors told some of my thunder this guy wouldn't even mention the word aid

[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:43.820]
Robert TV. Oh, yeah, you know when he finally broke down when his good friend rock Hudson died

[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:49.140]
Then all of a sudden he took a turn and he developed a different altitude even though of course he had this

[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.580]
Our closet queen son, right

[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:56.760]
I didn't feel how they actually had some bozos today saying that this guy was so charismatic

[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:03.880]
So attractive. He said the only person he thinks you might be able to hold a candle was JFK and I almost drove off the road

[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.880]
Good luck to Westpally give it up. Neal later. Have a great day

[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.920]
Here's Steve Gilear right. It's on our website today

[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:17.040]
The real legacy of Ronald Reagan. This is the first of three of these I have and if you think it's disrespectful

[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.740]
That's too a freaking bad, okay

[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:24.960]
It's about time that somebody as usual. We try to give you a little alternative viewpoint about the reality of life on his show

[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.060]
As opposed to just hopping on the bandwagon and jumping

[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:36.020]
Oh, yes, he was the greatest he was the great communicator and he was so wonderful and he had the star wars and all of a sudden crap right

[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.580]
That trickle down. Yeah, really trickle right down everybody's pants

[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.760]
Steve Gilear writes the Haggiatrophy started as soon as they announced Reagan's death

[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:50.880]
How he ended the Cold War how he was a decisive leader all this nonsense about Reagan, which is just ridiculous

[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:56.280]
The British have a tradition when someone dies their newspaper, but you already tells the truth

[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.000]
Americans like to say something kind about the dead no matter how scummy they were

[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.560]
Even Nixon got a halo in death were only 100 times and reminded people of exactly who he was

[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.660]
And how the honors given him were well wrong

[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.200]
This deification brigand began as soon as Clinton took office

[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.960]
There's been pressure to name everything but rest stop toilets after this man

[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.600]
Some right wing cranks wanted to add him to Mount Rushmore as if FDR didn't exist

[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:23.600]
They forced his name on an unhappy Washington DC by renaming the airports still called by many national

[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.580]
So let's get past all the Maulden Bolschmitt discuss what Reagan really did

[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.460]
And don't forget the attempt to put him on the dime and get FDR off of there

[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.300]
Even though the march of dimes was all about an FDR thing for polio

[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.920]
I mean at any rate goes on to say

[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.540]
Huh

[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.340]
Which you didn't even know about that because it was before your time the march of dimes

[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.080]
But nevertheless I heard about it

[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:46.280]
First Reagan rode to power in a wave of reaction to the civil rights struggle

[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.940]
California state with a deep well of racial resentment supported Reagan

[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.340]
Who would protect the establishment and call for students to be murdered on their campuses

[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.060]
Reagan was regarded as a crank by many on the left

[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:57.800]
But his appeal to middle America was strong

[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.860]
It wasn't that Reagan was erasist as far as his known

[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:05.060]
He wasn't but he sure could pander them as he did in 1984 Philadelphia, Mississippi

[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.420]
For those of you unaware that's the place three civil rights workers are murdered by the clan

[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.420]
It would be like a British prime ministerial candidate going to arm

[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:18.580]
Emmerstar to talk about the glory of the British army the set of a 1921 massacre of peaceful Indian protesters

[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:25.020]
Reagan panned into the racist right with ease even as very goldwater the man he's imported in 1964 with a convention speech

[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.500]
Slowly back the way from any of his reactionary views

[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.480]
Instead Reagan depicted blacks as welfare queens

[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.160]
Leaching off the society while in reality white women are the largest recipients of AFDC

[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.280]
Reagan used race like a club to hammer minorities and pander to the racist right

[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:44.200]
We need to ask what hath Reagan wrought his economic policies crippled this country

[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.360]
Preventingly kind of long-term structural changes which are still needed

[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.660]
How long will American business have to put the bill for health insurance?

[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.160]
How long will unequal funding for schools exist?

[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.840]
How long will the right of women to control their bodies be subject to restrictions?

[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:04.380]
This is the real domestic legacy of Ronald Reagan his breaking of the Patco strike began the road to anti-union policies across business

[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:09.180]
Once businesses wanted labor peace after Reagan strike making was permitted he encouraged

[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.020]
Reagan began the road of crippling America's ability to care for Americans now

[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:21.460]
We have this failed trickle-down economic policy pushed by yet another present one that leaves Americans in record debt and record bankruptcies instead of tax rates

[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.720]
Which fairly distribute the burden of American funding?

[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:31.300]
The rich have been encouraged to avoid their fair share Ronald Reagan began the bankrupting of America in the creation of a super wealthy CEO class

[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:35.280]
One where their great grandchildren will never have to work and a aristocracy of

[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.440]
first-eferians

[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.880]
Under Reagan hypocrisy and selfishness became the rule of the road not just in public life

[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.260]
Where his staff routinely lied eventually leading to a random contra

[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.760]
But if Reagan started to ruin America his foreign policy left the debt around like fallen leaves

[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:56.220]
His foreign policy was a disaster by any standard dead nuns and El Salvador murdered schoolteachers Nicaragua

[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.800]
The tortured in Argentina the seizure of Grenada

[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:05.140]
The failed invention in Lebanon the aerial assassination attempt on Kenopi which led to the bombing of Pan Am flight 103

[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:08.520]
Reagan's policies left the trial of failure and disaster at every turn

[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.000]
How to explain funding the deeply corrupt countries?

[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:18.220]
Former some of some of cease the generals who funded their way by the drug trade who murdered the innocent or the Warren Quattamal

[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:24.160]
On the genocide of the Indian population or the Warren El Salvador where American nuns among many others were raped and murdered a government

[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.660]
So callous that it murdered an archbishop in his church

[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.480]
Reagan's foreign policy left the trail of death and fear wherever it touched

[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.820]
But Iran's country was the defining moment

[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.620]
Despite a congressional prohibition on aid of the countries a group inside the White House decided to circumvent the law

[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.760]
So in Epley and so completely we wound up arming Iran and getting a few hostages held another unreleased

[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.500]
We also sold chemical and biological weapons to Iraq while

[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:52.660]
Sodom murdered thousands the US government was his ally even after 34 sailors were murdered by an Iraqi exosad missile

[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:58.920]
We still backed Sodom no governmental outrage no demands on Sodom like the liberty incident. We turned our backs and hope for the best

[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.340]
Reagan and his conservative hagiographers have wanted to claim his massive defense build up broke their Soviet

[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:10.160]
The broke the Soviets which ripped the braviant courage of the Czechs and East Germans who finally overthrew their dictatorial governments

[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:15.760]
Reagan also embraced Angolan you need the leader Jonas Savinby the puppet of the racist South African regime

[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:21.160]
He repeatedly refused to back away from despite South Africa's notorious and later turned out mad racial policies

[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:27.760]
Not until 1988 when the Cuban army decisively defeated the SADF at quitter kind of volume and golden to the war end

[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.720]
The US turned its back as the South African sponsored Ranamo massacre their way across Mozambique

[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.640]
No one knows how many Africans died in the wars of South Africa

[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:42.040]
But US complicity with the racist regime of South Africa helped extend their lifespan at no point in Reagan to do anything to stop this

[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:49.360]
Silent complicity with the hallmark of Reagan's policy toward dictatorships from Indonesia to El Salvador where the innocent died in the US said nothing

[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.260]
Did nothing except make their lives worse

[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:56.240]
We back the guerrilla groups in Afghanistan funding the most radical ones and then leaving the country in this array

[00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:01.020]
Reagan's legacy is a dark one one of backing murderers and robbing Americans of a ferocious future

[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.160]
It wasn't that he was an evil man or a bad one

[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:08.820]
It's what he believed in what he supported caused so much pain in misery for so many people who had to live with the result of his policy

[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.480]
I think that says it pretty well

[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.660]
Didn't over got lost more hair

[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:18.260]
They didn't say nothing about his hairdo and about that great star wars program. We had gone

[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.360]
They just wouldn't have messed it all up

[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:25.180]
Particle beam weaponry and of course those uh psychics man if weren't for those psychics and psychics

[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.980]

[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.640]
You

[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:09.960]
Be

[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.280]
Show

[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:20.100]
I'm gonna change the face of sports radio

[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.160]
Because now I'm the voice of the

[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:28.720]
Pants and an elephant of moderate radio oh boy

[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:30.720]
Yeah

[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.180]
I get likes to do here like

[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:39.480]
Talked to the same three colors about sports and sports and

[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.260]
Sports I even got lots of hilarious comedy

[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:45.440]
Coach

[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.500]
I'm the culprit

[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:49.840]
I

[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.280]
Take that

[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.640]
I

[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.020]
I

[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:57.500]
Now

[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.280]
I was a spy

[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:04.900]
Now you're the bomb you can hit me no

[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:05.860]
You

[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.040]
Maybe I was a little

[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.080]
The things I said

[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:16.880]
And you

[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:18.420]
Like that

[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.700]
And I'm not

[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:27.520]
I know it in an all fairness that big fat old guy they stuck me with kisses me like they used to do

[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.140]
But he's not you

[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:33.740]
That's so sweet you make me almost want to come back with you

[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:34.420]
guilty

[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.000]
Yes, but they my life was filled with joy

[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.080]
You know

[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:46.880]
And now what's that when I go on a loving

[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:55.820]
Boy you're my best side pick and foil. I miss how you talk like the girl

[00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:00.800]
L.D. Yes, for hold you. I miss you

[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.480]
Oh

[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.340]
No!

[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:53.660]
No!

[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:54.520]
No!

[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:54.760]
No!

[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.220]
No!

[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:55.220]

[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:55.360]
No!

[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:55.800]
No!

[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:55.800]

[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:55.800]

[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:55.800]

[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.600]
No!

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.600]

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.600]

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.600]

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.600]

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.600]

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.600]

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.600]

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.600]

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.600]

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.600]

[00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:58.880]

[00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:58.880]

[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:01.860]

[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:03.600]

[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:03.600]

[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:03.600]

[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:03.600]

[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:20.880]
No!

[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:21.880]
No!

[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:21.920]
No!

[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:21.940]

[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:21.940]

[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:21.940]

[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:21.940]

[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:21.940]

[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:21.940]

[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:22.040]
No!

[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:22.040]

[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:22.040]

[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:22.820]
No!

[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:23.180]

[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:23.180]

[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:23.180]

[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:23.340]
No!

[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:24.340]
No!

[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:25.120]
No!

[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.260]
No!

[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:26.320]
No!

[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:26.400]

[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:26.400]

[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:26.980]
No!

[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:27.360]

[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:27.360]

[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:27.480]

[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:27.480]

[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:27.940]
No!

[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:27.940]

[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:32.700]
I think the attributes are all hanger of these workforms.

[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.500]
I think it makes me sick, is that Peggy Noon.

[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.540]
And I guess she used to do each fighter or something.

[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:38.320]
Speechwriter right?

[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:39.320]
Oh God!

[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.980]
You know, sassy, talking.

[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.100]
He did.

[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:45.160]
He said, turn the channel.

[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.060]
Okay.

[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:46.640]
Thank you.

[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.020]
Yeah, it's really nauseating.

[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.020]
I haven't bring it back.

[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:50.060]
James Watt.

[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.980]
All of these all hangers on from those nasty right wing days.

[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.920]
In fact, that would be a great opportunity to bring back that picture from 83 again.

[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.860]
where Rumsfeld over there shinghannes with Sodom, the one that we had on our website,

[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.580]
which is probably still near any archives somewhere.

[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.020]
Right. Yeah.

[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:09.240]
While he was, you know, now we're lamenting, oh, and Sodom gasped the curds with chemicals,

[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:10.720]
of course, that we sold room.

[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.800]
And of course, we stood by and said nothing.

[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.160]
Zero zippity doodah while he was gasping his own people and gasping the Iranians,

[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.880]
which of course we were delighted because that's why we sold them the chemicals in the first place,

[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.640]
is to hello stink at Iranians.

[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.620]
Wasn't that like a 93 or something the curd day?

[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.200]
The curds?

[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:26.740]
The curds the word.

[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.940]
The 93, whatever it was.

[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.660]
Yeah, nobody said anything about it while it was happening.

[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:34.400]
Right.

[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.260]
Wouldn't care then.

[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.700]
Reagan was the original forest gump who struck lucky.

[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:40.820]
Right.

[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:46.400]
Trevor Royal in the Sunday herald in Scotland, even the Scottish, he got the kilts in an upper

[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.180]
about this sign.

[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:47.940]
Their knickers too.

[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:52.580]
And their panties that they're probably wearing under their kilts, but who the hell wants to find out?

[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.200]
Oh, man.

[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:57.380]
Trevor Royal writes it was fitting perhaps that Ronald Reagan died on the eve of the

[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:01.200]
D-Day celebrations, unlike other Hollywood actors such as Jimmy Stewart, who gave up

[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.080]
tinseltown to fly for the US Army Air Force.

[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.240]
Reagan remained an actor, not a doer.

[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.880]
Later in life before Alzheimer's disease cruelly fell to him, he called the

[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.240]
affliction writing into the sunset.

[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.260]
Another Hollywood cliche.

[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:14.820]
He would tell Israeli politicians that he remembered seeing the liberated

[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.080]
concentration camps at the end of the Second World War.

[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.660]
It sounded good, but too bad that he wasn't wearing uniform at the time, but was

[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.940]
working for a documentary unit.

[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.320]
He wasn't there.

[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:26.920]
In that sense, there was always more than a touch of vaudeville about Reagan.

[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.960]
He was a bad actor who knew his limitations, not for him, Gary Cooper's heroic

[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.180]
sheriff, Roland Haaynune, a White House favorite for successive presidents, and not for

[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.620]
him, the youthful John Wayne and John Ford stage coach, two movies which helped

[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.180]
to define 20th century America.

[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.480]
He was always on the outside looking in the minor bit player who was always small

[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.120]
town America.

[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:49.900]
Perhaps because he saw himself as a patriot, a fourth company for his time, he

[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:53.160]
allied himself with the McCarthy facts and enjoy those Hollywood bigots who

[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.120]
lined themselves up against anything that's back to communism and the

[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.040]
pearls of the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War in the early 50s.

[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.740]
It was unworthy of him and unworthy of the country at the time, but it marked

[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:03.960]
him and he had not entered politics.

[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.160]
He had not entered politics.

[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.680]
He could have ended up a bad actor who chose bad politics.

[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.460]
What propelled him into the arena was a mixture of hubris and necessity.

[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:15.700]
From the governorship of California, he found himself in a White House in 1981.

[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.120]
The Cold War was in full swing and for the Republicans, he was the man or

[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:22.400]
cipher to fight their last long battle against the forces of evil.

[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.040]
In Water Reagan's first public appearances, he forgot that the

[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.520]
microphone was live and announced to his astonished audience that the missiles

[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.540]
were about to be fired.

[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.260]
Yet out of that fellow-cocity, the lion learned to live with the lambs with

[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.140]
Macau Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, who was committed to

[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.540]
Rara Poshmont, he forged an unlikely friendship.

[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.060]
Out of their discussions in Iceland in 1986, the Cold War gradually

[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.620]
thought and iced the ice turned to lukewarm water.

[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.720]
He was a man of contradictions who was easy to mock.

[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:52.880]
Famously, he addressed Prince's Diana as Prince David, and there were times

[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.580]
when he believed that the Middle East was close to Minnesota in the Midwest.

[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:59.080]
But this much-maligned president was not just the buffoon which his enemies

[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.300]
painted him, true he dirtyed himself with the Iran Compreh scandal in his foreign

[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:05.640]
policies, owed more to the nationations of the Pentagon than any person

[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.740]
law, but in that sense, he was probably no worse than the president incumbent.

[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.380]
That's a hell of a shot.

[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:12.920]
A shot.

[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.080]
I'd say it again, I like that.

[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.300]
Ronald Reagan knew how to keep a hands-off approach to the administration

[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:21.580]
for good and for ill, but whatever else his critics might say about him, he knew how to meet the moment.

[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.220]
When the space shuttle challenger crashed in 1986,

[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.140]
taking the lives of seven astronauts, he turned not the platitudes, but the poetry.

[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.980]
There's only one problem with the story.

[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.820]
If you forget when it happened, he turned to his press circuit, he said,

[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.420]
oh, is that the moment the school teacher ran it?

[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.260]
Not that he was out of touch, you understand.

[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.340]
Was that the one with the school teacher ran it?

[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:40.580]
Oh yeah, that's the one.

[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.260]
Wow.

[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.560]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.300]
It's tribute Ronnie Reagan day here on the Nearajar Show.

[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:50.640]
Oh!

[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.320]
Since 1960, who do you think was our best president?

[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.920]
We've got two, three hundred and five votes, and Clinton's got a hundred ninety-one.

[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:58.560]
How do you like that?

[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.120]
Kamalista, Kamalista, Kamalista.

[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:01.820]
Clinton's got a hundred ninety-one.

[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.100]
JFK 44, Reagan 41, and the only reason Reagan's got 41 is well, he's dead.

[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.800]
I mean, they got Reagan coming out of every part of their body now,

[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.820]
after this weekend, man, you can't go anywhere.

[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.120]
Oh, they're talking about the G8 summit, Reagan won't be there.

[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:16.600]
There's something.

[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.200]
We get a momentary reprieve.

[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:25.960]
Reagan 41, Nixon 8, Bush 28, that's W, Carter 7.

[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:28.080]
LBJ has got a pair.

[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:33.240]
Bush 1 has got a pair in Gerald Ford 2, who's not right, just as we speak,

[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.360]
trying to chew gum and walk at the same time.

[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.680]
Oh, there's Lauren W.

[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:39.440]
You're with Arab leaders from Iraq.

[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.720]
Look at that at the G8 economic summit.

[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:42.700]
Isn't that something?

[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:43.720]
Just take a look at that.

[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.880]
Lost in the headlights to look at his push, huh?

[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.780]
You may not be good, but at least he's consistent, Mr. Rottel,

[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.440]
right now.

[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:51.740]
You heathen bastard.

[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:53.860]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:56.560]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:57:58.820 --> 00:57:59.260]
QAM.

[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:01.620]
Ronnie Reagan line.

[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:03.440]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.320]
You can't stop at this point.

[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.320]
Oh, I.

[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:09.180]
Yeah, you guys have to figure out how about that.

[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:09.940]
Okay, thank you.

[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:10.700]
Thank you very much.

[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:11.620]
Back at you.

[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.400]
That was you.

[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:12.720]
Yeah, Jr.

[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.280]
Say, I'd recognize that voice anywhere.

[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.640]
5 6 7 0 5 6 E pound 5 6 D on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:21.920]
WQAM, hello.

[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:23.720]
Hey, Neil.

[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:24.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:26.460]
Hey, how about Eisenhower?

[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.280]
He had one year in 1960.

[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.220]
And what we're talking about after the 60-year life, you know what we're talking about?

[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:32.820]
Get out of here.

[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:33.940]
Quit and quit nitpicking.

[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:34.240]
Okay.

[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:35.480]
How about Eisenhower?

[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:37.680]
We're talking about since 1960 election.

[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.080]
I mean, if we have to rephrase the poll,

[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.160]
which we won't, you know exactly what we're talking about.

[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.100]
Okay, we're talking about since after Eisenhower,

[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:48.800]
since after I like Kike and all of that crap, get with it.

[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:50.380]
There was another rocket scientist for you.

[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.220]
There Eisenhower, man.

[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.060]
Wow.

[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.100]
Couldn't even speak the language.

[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:55.280]
But then again,

[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:59.220]
when you're in South Florida, you have a lot of company

[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:00.140]
when you can't speak language.

[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.660]
You probably was very popular in South Florida.

[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.460]
General Eisenhower.

[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.060]
General Eisenhower.

[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:07.880]
Look what a great job he did there in, for example, in Korea, right?

[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:09.180]
I'm sorry.

[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.160]
And what about Douglas MacArthur?

[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.520]
There's another great general who shall not return, right?

[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:14.740]
Or will he return?

[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.160]
Or did he return?

[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:16.920]
Yeah, he returned.

[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.220]
No, he just got like what's his name on the MTA, poor Charlie on the MTA.

[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:20.960]
He never returned.

[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.300]
That's what the Kingston Trio said.

[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:27.980]
11 past 11 at 560, WQA was your company suffering from regulations

[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.140]
and increased labor costs.

[01:00:53.480 --> 01:01:09.220]
I'm I'm there I'm I'm there I'm a reaching dumbass. I'm

[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:20.540]
Sort of like that I'm loван to out-breatured

[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.800]
Oh my god, I can't believe it!

[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.720]
There are even an fear of what come our show!

[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.120]
It started years ago with Ellen DeGeneres.

[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.160]
Now it's a homophobic event of global proportions.

[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:37.720]
It's the epic saga of one man's desperate struggle to prevent the whole world from becoming gay,

[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.800]
or tolerating anyone who is.

[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.360]
George W. Bush stars in the biggest blackbuster of the summer,

[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.380]
gay after tomorrow.

[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.220]
Be there when it comes out and theaters this summer.

[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.580]
You're gay!

[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:55.060]
11-16 at 5-60. You see that last call to the same thing?

[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.520]
Oh well, since 1960, you left an hour, you're off our eyes an hour.

[01:01:58.940 --> 01:01:59.380]
See what I mean?

[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:00.000]
Yeah.

[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.380]
Knit pickers. You made a mistake!

[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.020]
No, we didn't.

[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.860]
Everybody knows exactly what we're talking about.

[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.680]
Since the end of 1960, since January 21st or whatever that date was,

[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.820]
1961 when Kennedy was inaugurated, okay?

[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.120]
Knit picker, nose picker.

[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.880]
Go pick this, all right?

[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:13.360]
Racko!

[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:13.840]
Get out of here!

[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.320]
Oh, and you know what I wanted to play again?

[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:19.520]
In fact, I think I'm going to play to VR, the trailer from Fahrenheit 9-11.

[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.540]
You couldn't make people do anything if they were afraid.

[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.760]
The day is taking actions close.

[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.820]
All of the airports in the United States.

[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.940]
All commercial airline traffic was around it.

[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.240]
But we had some airplanes that authorized at the highest levels of our government

[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.660]
to pick up the summer bin Laden's family members to transport the motor to the country.

[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:47.800]
Middle of the war, corporations decided to hold the time for us to figure out how much money to be made.

[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.500]
Once that oil start flowing, it's going to be lots of money.

[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.200]
Whatever it costs, the government would date.

[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.760]
It's going to be a good business, bad for the people.

[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.260]
Congressman, kind of getting members of Congress,

[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:04.820]
they're getting their kids to a Muslim party and go over to Iraq.

[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.120]
The USA Patriot Act allows researchers of medical and financial records.

[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.660]
It gives law enforcement almost unlimited power.

[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.220]
The way to the middle of the night is printed in the middle of the night

[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.980]
how the Congress passed this Patriot Act,

[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.240]
so that I'll even read it.

[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.420]
It's shook out myself.

[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.780]
We don't read most of the bills.

[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:27.860]
No one read.

[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.780]
Members of Congress, this is Michael Hor.

[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.540]
It likes to read, too, the USA Patriot Act.

[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:40.980]
The USA Patriot Act

[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.340]
From the poor to the poor,

[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.920]
Congressman, to the streets of small town America,

[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.680]
to the front lines.

[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.460]
It's an impressive crowd to have,

[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.340]
and to have more.

[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.860]
Some people call you Billy, I call you my base.

[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:03.980]
It comes the true story that will make you the temperature rise.

[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:13.300]
I call upon all nations to do everything they can

[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.700]
to stop these terrorists killers.

[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.140]
Thank you.

[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.140]
Now watch this drive.

[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.200]
Come on up!

[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.760]
Come on to a theater near you on Friday, June 25th.

[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.880]
Two weeks from this Friday, Fahrenheit 9-11.

[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:31.740]
Can't wait.

[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.480]
One of the saddest things that I've ever seen in my life was the way they booed him

[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.460]
when he accepted the Academy Award for Best Documentary for Boeing for Columbine.

[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.180]
Phranjik, there's one guy who had a ball that had a big pair.

[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.940]
Over the years, how many different people,

[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.360]
a zillion of them have gotten up and made some kind of a speech

[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.720]
that had nothing to do with Hollywood or the award, right?

[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.620]
All the time.

[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.360]
But it was about the Indians and little princes, summer, flower,

[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.460]
all the time it happens.

[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.540]
But here's a guy that gets up there for a crying out loud.

[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.320]
I mean, right in line with the documentary,

[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.180]
what was all about, what America's become.

[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.880]
And they're booing and they're like, yeah, I mean, there were some people cheering,

[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.520]
but there was this loud caverny of booing because here's a guy that got up

[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:15.160]
and said something that was pee-eye, politically incorrect.

[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.080]
Howard Kerch writes, 15 years later, I don't like Howard Kerch,

[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.360]
but nevertheless, it's a good column.

[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.100]
15 years later, they're making of a president.

[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:25.740]
He's got a stomach right on this one.

[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.040]
The uplifting tone with which journalists are utilizing Ronald Reagan

[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.060]
is obscuring a central fact at his presidency.

[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.620]
He had a very contentious relationship with the press.

[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.920]
Most reporters like to give her personally.

[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.020]
It was hard not to, but often depicted him as detached,

[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.360]
out of touch, a stubborn ideologue.

[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.620]
Sam Donaldson, Helen Thomasson Company,

[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.960]
would do battle in those prime time Eastern news conferences

[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.660]
that Reagan relished, and he would deflect their toughest questions

[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.020]
with an aw-shock's grin and a shake of the head.

[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.540]
Major newspapers would run stories on all the facts he had mangled,

[01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:00.300]
a practice that faded as it became clear that most Americans were not terribly concerned.

[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:04.420]
The media dubbed him the Teflon president was not meant as a compliment either.

[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.740]
Reagan was quite simply a far more controversial figure in his time

[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.660]
than the largely gushing orbits on television would suggest.

[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.980]
He took a pounding in the press after his first task cut

[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.440]
when a deep recession pushed unemployment to 10 percent

[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.380]
and drowned the budget in red ink.

[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.280]
He was widely portrayed as uninformed and uninterested in details,

[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.280]
the man who said trees cause pollution

[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.740]
and once failed to recognize his own housing secretary.

[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.880]
He was often described as lazy, just an actor,

[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.560]
a man who'd rather be clearing brush at his California ranch

[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.920]
and love the good midday nap.

[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.920]
His 1983 invasion of Grenada was not universally applauded,

[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.720]
especially after his spokesman told the press today before that

[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.180]
that the idea was preposterous

[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:46.740]
and as withdrawal of the Marines from Lebanon after 241 were killed in a bombing

[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.420]
brought blistering editorials.

[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.200]
He was often depicted as a rich man's president

[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.780]
with a little feeling for the poor

[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.860]
as symbolized by the administration's ketchup

[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.540]
as a vegetable school lunch debacle.

[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.740]
The tractor said he was presiding over the greed decade.

[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.520]
During the 1984 campaign Reagan stood in front of a senior citizen's project

[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.120]
built under a program he tried to kill,

[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.340]
but his age didn't care,

[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.720]
concluding that the pictures were more important than the reporter's contrary words.

[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.460]
Journalists had a field day digging into administration corruption,

[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.120]
senior officials in the EPA and housing and urban development department

[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.100]
along with ex-white house eight Michael Dever

[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:22.360]
and national security adviser Robert McFarlane

[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.640]
were convicted various offenses,

[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:26.320]
defense secretary Casper Weinberger was indicted,

[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.500]
but later pardoned by the first president Bush.

[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:31.900]
Reagan's siding with the Nicaraguan rebels

[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.180]
was enormously divisive,

[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.180]
and negative coverage of the Rancunters scandal

[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.640]
devoured much of a second term.

[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.500]
Crisis plumishing president's hands-off style

[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.340]
said in 1986 Washington Post article by Luke Cannon,

[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.520]
Reagan's biographer.

[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.620]
His triumphs of course were extensively chronicled as well.

[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.800]
They left office at 877 on a renewed wave of popularity.

[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:53.600]
What the great communicator quickly figured out was that he could deliver his message

[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.180]
over the heads of the Washington Press Corps,

[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.680]
often decried at the time as medium manipulation,

[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.600]
but now an accepted staple of spin-laden politics.

[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.800]
Why was much of the coverage of Reagan so different

[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.200]
from the way he's being revered today?

[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.820]
Is it because many journalists were liberals appalled by his conservative philosophy

[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.640]
that may have been effective at something more fundamental as it worked,

[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.580]
something also on display in the days after Richard Nixon's death

[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:17.060]
when Watergate was relegated to sidebar status.

[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:21.340]
There's an actual tendency in the media to say nice things after someone's died,

[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.900]
but more important to president's legacy looks very different

[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:25.540]
15 years after he leaves the White House,

[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:28.480]
and following a long illness that took him out of the political wars.

[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.760]
No one knew when Reagan stepped down that his military build-up

[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.600]
would ultimately play a role in the demise of the evil empire he reeled against,

[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.620]
critics announced his legacy of record-shattering budget deficits,

[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:41.560]
but the resulting economic boom such shortfalls came to be viewed as less dramatic,

[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.200]
another sign of how Reagan redefined the political debate.

[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.700]
The press by its nature tends to get down in the weeds of day-to-day controversies

[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.680]
that involve any president, but when a protagonist is off the stage

[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.680]
and the camera pulls back, a brighter picture emerges in the setbacks

[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.840]
tend to fade from memory.

[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.040]
What is left are the big accomplishments and the inspirational qualities

[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.180]
that Reagan brought to office.

[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.320]
Bill Clinton is unlikely to benefit from such a cultural ceasefire

[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.780]
when his memoirs are published this month,

[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:08.060]
if only because not enough time his presence is turbulent presidency.

[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.120]
In his 1988 book, Unbended Knee,

[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:15.060]
author Mark Hurgestad complied that news accounts generally fail to make clear

[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.780]
the real world implications of Reagan's inability or unwillingness

[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.800]
to distinguish back from fiction.

[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.280]
That so many journalists seem to have changed their view in 2004

[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.060]
may represent Reagan's final triumph over the press.

[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:29.200]
Pretty good article for Howard Kurtz, who's generally kind of wishy-washing

[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.860]
Namby-Kamby, that sell all these things.

[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:31.820]
Well, you go, Howie.

[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:32.860]
You go, Howie.

[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.060]
You go till it hurts, Howie Kurtz.

[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:37.980]
Is what he blurtz.

[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.040]
Well, you know, you guys are all about your faggots anyway, so what do you know?

[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.720]
Since 1960, of course, that's on your sports station.

[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:46.860]
That's what Junior Seyau would tell you.

[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.240]
You're all about your faggots.

[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:50.940]
He's not, but you're all about your faggots.

[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.380]
He's screaming with God of the old kind and tealing with people of old times.

[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.440]
Yeah, he's got that belly dancer's son,

[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.260]
but he couldn't under the word AIDS because,

[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.440]
oh, that was a fagg thing.

[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.360]
Little of, you know.

[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.860]
I wonder what the hell he thought when Rock Hudson got AIDS.

[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.200]
What was going through his mind?

[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:07.940]
Probably not much.

[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.720]
Probably what, when, when's that time, Mommy?

[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:11.400]
What's that time?

[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.100]
I'm right out of my head, Kelly.

[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:12.380]
Yeah.

[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.360]
Oh, there's Mommy, but I read Dress.

[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.100]
Just say,

[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:15.700]
No.

[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:16.220]
Financy.

[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:20.100]
See, I guess Bush, W.Gudd, even with her when he said,

[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:20.760]
No.

[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:22.280]
To this stem cell research,

[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.120]
that'll teach you a thing or two, Nancy,

[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.340]
when you're just say no to drugs,

[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:27.580]
just say no to sex, just say no to anything.

[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.560]
And now they're making her like a big deal.

[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.680]
And I, you know, I have to feel for it

[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.500]
that she had to go through the 10 years of taking care

[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.580]
of this daughtering old dying guy with Alzheimer's.

[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.600]
That was tragic, but other than that, she was an idiot.

[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:37.680]
A bubble head.

[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.440]
A simple thing.

[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:40.140]
Pathetic.

[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:42.580]
Am I leaving anything out?

[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:43.380]
Bad person.

[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:44.860]
That's what her psychic told me.

[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:47.620]
She said she was pathetic.

[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:49.440]
How's that pull coming?

[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.620]
We'll change it at noon.

[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:51.960]
We'll change it to the worst.

[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:55.080]
Maybe we got a word of different just to make that one color happy.

[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:55.480]
What do you think?

[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:55.600]
No.

[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:56.860]
No, they know what we're talking about.

[01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.160]
Oh, you looked out the last year of Ike.

[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.380]
You know, Ike had a good bubble.

[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.680]
I think that's a second heart attack.

[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.280]
Man, I mean, I don't want to go into it now.

[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.240]
I'm just thinking that people we select

[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.080]
as our leaders.

[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.400]
Well, inarticulate goofballs, people couldn't put

[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.340]
it together with good sentence.

[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.920]
That's why Kennedy and Reagan and Clinton

[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.240]
stand out above all of these others' heads and shoulders

[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.500]
because if nothing else, at least they could speak.

[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:24.000]
Yep.

[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.220]
They were articulate.

[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.660]
They could actually speak the language.

[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:30.160]
I mean, Nixon could speak too, but generally speaking,

[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.080]
you don't want to hear it.

[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:32.440]
Evil.

[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.360]
Yet evil like written all over the dark faces, you know,

[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.300]
the dark shadows.

[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.240]
Well, he's not a good one.

[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.120]
418 votes.

[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.580]
Since 1960, who do you think was our best president?

[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.500]
Clinton, 257.

[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.120]
Oh, Adam Boyd, Bubba.

[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:45.860]
Reagan, 66.

[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:46.820]
Oh, look at that.

[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.040]
He's moving to the second place now.

[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.240]
Just to get even with me.

[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:50.980]
JFK 57.

[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:52.840]
Bush, 2.

[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:53.440]
That's W.

[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.040]
He's got 11.

[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.140]
Nixon, 10.

[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:55.960]
Carter, 7.

[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:56.860]
LBJ 5.

[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.640]
Bush, 1, 3, and 4, 2.

[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.600]
Boy, Bush, 1, he didn't like that too much today.

[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:01.140]
Huh?

[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:01.660]
No.

[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:01.960]
No.

[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.100]
He'd my lips.

[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:04.820]
I'm a wimp.

[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:08.600]
Only the Democrats could have come up with Michael Dukakis, baby.

[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.500]
Only the Democrats could have outwimped in Wimped Bush 1.

[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:15.460]
27 after 11 at 5, 60 W.

Tonight, on Fox, it's the long-awaited conclusion of American Idol.

[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.980]
The vote's been tallied. America's spoken.

[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.780]
Yes, star. George Bush sings the hoon.

[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:44.000]
We will try to put us.

[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:44.900]
Talking about...

[01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:45.000]
Right?

[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:45.440]
Yes.

[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:47.840]
Talking about...

[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:47.940]
Right?

[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.200]
Yes, yes, generation.

[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:50.520]
About...

[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.380]
Talking about...

[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.280]
My generation.

[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.780]
Before we grow old, talking about...

[01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.850]
My generation.

[01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:00.350]
About...

[01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:01.030]
My generation.

[01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:02.830]
What do you think of me?

[01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:03.990]
It just was terrible, dude.

[01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.910]
Terrible.

[01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:06.950]
You are the worst singer in the world.

[01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.470]
Nice voice.

[01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:07.990]
Thanks.

[01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:08.490]
Very nice.

[01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:10.590]
A conclusion of American Idol.

[01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:11.110]
Congratulations.

[01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:13.630]
You're now as intelligence at the peak.

[01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:14.490]
That's a fact.

[01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:15.830]
Tonight, on Fox.

[01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:20.050]
11-32-20-28 till now at 5-60 WDQM

[01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:21.750]
Kimba Bull Camprofer at Man Dog at 2.

[01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:23.070]
Now, there will be those who would say,

[01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:24.970]
What you're ripping up Reagan because he was a Republican.

[01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:28.330]
and you don't like any Republicans. Well, that's not true. I love Abe Lincoln.

[01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:32.690]
Yeah. Teddy Roosevelt. Like him a lot. They were Republicans. Any other

[01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:37.370]
Republicans we like? No. McCain ate so bad. I'm talking about presidents. Oh. He had

[01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:41.130]
president. Yeah. Probably won't be especially with that thing on his face. But

[01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:43.930]
at any rate, I mean, look at all the great Republican presidents. He had Warren G.

[01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:54.190]
Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Ike, Dick Nixon, right? Gerald Ford.

[01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:58.970]
Right. George Bush the one. And of course, look what we got now. Popped

[01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:02.750]
Reagan. We got look what we got. Vita, the hell in the hell with kind of a

[01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:07.230]
cute factory says, dear Mr. Insensinute, it's just like you to mock America as we

[01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:11.350]
mourn our loss. These sopranos is over. We may not see a new episode for a year.

[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:15.910]
So show some compassion for God's sake. I don't get how many take-off you need.

[01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:19.310]
What grease ball? Goombas come out of the woodware. There you go. You tell them.

[01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:28.330]
Damn it. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Yeah. I was talking

[01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:31.830]
to start into that thing. There's no point going in. What about the kind of people that we...

[01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:37.050]
Well, first of all, the choices are usually bad. But yet, Eisenhower was a war hero against

[01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:41.690]
Adley Stevenson. He was just an egghead and he was a divorce and he was a bald, you know,

[01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:47.930]
all of these things. He was an intellectual. The days of that, I think, are long since gone.

[01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:52.710]
I mean, Woodrow Wilson, if he was running right now, he'd have two chances, none, and much less than

[01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:58.810]
none. We like bozos now. We like dummies because most of us can relate to that. Speaking of dummies.

[01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:04.010]
Everybody now understands. There's kind of Lisa. Oh, I got to play that. Kind of Lisa. Kind of

[01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:13.970]
I remember the words we can karaoke it. Yeah. That old Chevron deal. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T

[01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:18.010]
and Verizon. See, that was just the beginning. Little did we realize that was just the old cute

[01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:23.530]
tip of the iceberg with that kind of Lisa crap and kiss a good morning, all that stuff.

[01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:35.670]
Somebody QA him. Hello. Yes. Okay. What was that? That must have been her call waiting. Okay. Let's

[01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:40.570]
be generous in the sum. What was her call waiting? Now, what did sound like to you? No. What did it sound like?

[01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:46.170]
Hang up. Now, was not a hang up? You're wrong on that. Well, you are just a hard ass and wasn't

[01:16:46.170 --> 01:16:52.230]
ever in Jones. No. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. It was a lady actually called back. Please,

[01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:55.990]
we'd ask your phone to work in or maybe there was a big man with you $10 million, which if that's

[01:16:55.990 --> 01:17:02.970]
the case, you won't call back. Damn it. WQ. Wham. Hello. Yeah. Talk to Neil speaking. Neil. What's up,

[01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:09.130]
Ralph? How you doing, Pally? Good. Well, hey, you were talking about President Reagan and they all

[01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:16.970]
said like John Kerry, they are like the challenger accident, whatever. He classed people to have that

[01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:25.490]
shuttle go up with that school teacher. Right. Because he had a speech on education. The inaugural

[01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:32.650]
address was coming right. Exactly. He had a speech on education to press that. Right. And when it

[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:39.180]
blew up, student and all of a sudden. No, not the one with school teacher. It's balls on my plans,

[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:45.900]
right? Exactly. And then the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, my brother and I was a marine in Lebanon.

[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:54.480]
In the early 80s. When they blew up those 200 and something, Marines, Ralph, he was, yeah, he was

[01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:01.580]
there. He pulled them out. He pulled them out, which proved to me that he's a coward, which

[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:08.000]
proved to me that he pulled them out because, you know, we get blown up, you get pulled out. Now,

[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.980]
you see it in Iraq, you see, oh, we're going to blow up these people. Everyone in the United

[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:19.340]
States going to see their young sons and daughters getting murdered. They're going to pull them out.

[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:26.240]
So he ain't no hair on me, Ralph. Okay. All right. See you at the, okay, you two. See you at the

[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:30.820]
funeral, Pally. And what about Morgan, D. She'll be kind of like pulled out of there real quick,

[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:35.680]
too, then we. Yeah. Turned down right now. Huh? Shouldn't have been there in the first. Well,

[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.540]
that's, well, we should have been in Iraq in the first place either, but that's beside the point.

[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.600]
We should be a lot of places, but we tend to be in places that we don't belong all the time,

[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:48.480]
especially now lately. If there's like a lot of oil there and things like that, 5, 6, 7,

[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:53.800]
0, 5, 60, don't forget, mark it on your calendar or two weeks from Friday, June 25th,

[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.500]
Fahrenheit 9, 11. Go watch it 3, 4, and 5 times. Drag a whole bunch of people. Take some

[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.360]
born again, Christians with you. They'll be pissed off and fired up. Huh? I know right where to get

[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:09.680]
soon. Do you know how that you got a whole bunch done by you? Oh, look at this Ronald Reagan,

[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:16.820]
the body lying in repose today. President Ronald Reagan. Oh, my God. On and on and on. I mean,

[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:21.800]
he's been dying for 10 years already. You think that this was one of the great shocks in the

[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.080]
history. You think that like maybe all of a sudden Truman died, but that's right here where he did.

[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:29.960]
Now what's going to happen when Gerald Ford dies? Don't think that there'll be this kind of,

[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:35.580]
first of all, Gerald Ford never got elected president. He was in Congress for 25 years from Michigan,

[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:40.980]
never introduced one piece of meaningful legislation in 25 years. He was a moron. See,

[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.200]
this goes back to what I was starting to examine before, but I interrupted myself because what's

[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:55.060]
the use. I mean, you know, we had FDR. Kennedy was a great speaker. We even know he was a

[01:19:55.060 --> 01:20:04.740]
we have. Seriously, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, FDR. I mean, FDR was just dynamic those speeches.

[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:10.020]
I mean, just from a guy in a wheelchair, no less. Wasn't he the penguin? Yeah, he was the penguin

[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:15.440]
until he was just near the stole apart. And then we had, of course, Truman wasn't a good speaker

[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.140]
either. Now, I would say Truman was a ballsy president. He'd write. He showed them Japs the

[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:27.100]
finger to man. Yeah, he had some lines. Yeah, he had that one line. Do he beats Truman? He's

[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:31.820]
holding up the Chicago Tribune. Do he beats Truman? He liked that. Now, he gave him, how hairy?

[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:35.580]
He was he was okay in his own bizarre way. Doug McCartney didn't like him too much.

[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:40.200]
What's he doing? But he was huh? That's too bad on Dougie's part. Yeah, well, he should have

[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.700]
understood the chain of command. He's dead too now. McCartney, see, it goes to Sherry. What comes

[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:49.160]
around? Goes around. But we've had so many like bumbling, fumbling in our ticket. I mean,

[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.740]
we can do better than that. We're talking about the best and the brightest. This is the best we

[01:20:52.740 --> 01:21:02.140]
got. What we got now. Al Gore against George W. Bush. John Kerry. My God. Herman,

[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:08.480]
mustard, junior. I say Clinton and, uh, and Howard Dean for vice president. Let's, let's,

[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:19.140]
tell him about a constitution. Okay. Yeah, Bush can keep disregarding law. But I don't

[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:25.540]
Judy has to stay home since 19 or at least keep her in the broom closet somewhere. Don't let

[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:30.380]
anybody see her. Although we have, like I said, had a string of very ugly first ladies. Man,

[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:34.420]
so many of them since Jackie Kennedy and she was ugly too come right down with. Yeah, she really was.

[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:39.080]
She had like a prune face. She would like, like, not highly overrated.

[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.320]
All over again, when you consider that she followed maybe Eisenhower and best Truman,

[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.540]
she had a lot of good will coming in. You know what I'm saying? Because best Truman, she looked like

[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:54.740]
she dressed in a butter outfit at goodwill. Since 1960, who do you think was our best president?

[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.360]
We're going to turn this baby around and do the worst with the same bunch of, uh, goyum.

[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:06.380]
Clinton 295. He wins 61% for a bubble. Oh, yeah. The election right now, bubble against George W. Bush,

[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:11.180]
if he could run again, he'd get 90% of all of that. I'll tell you right now. America is pining and

[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:15.240]
longing for the day. Even those people who's goody, two shoes, hypocrite screaming about that stain on

[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:19.940]
a blue dress. Yeah, they only wish to take a leave one. Clinton 295, although,

[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:23.800]
hopefully somebody looked better in her. Yeah, not a very. Reagan 82. Look at his Reagan pulling

[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.300]
away from JFK. All or JFK was only president for like less than three years. Reagan had two full

[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:35.340]
terms in there to forget everything he did. Reagan 84 JFK 67. And then it's a precipitous drop

[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:41.040]
way down. Nixon 11, George W. Bush 11. That's quite an accomplishment to be tied with Richard Nixon.

[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:51.420]
He's tied with Dick Carter 9, LVJ 6, Bush 1, W. George Herbert Walker 3. Don't forget Daddy was

[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:54.540]
a Nazi. And Gerald Ford has only got a small pair.

[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:59.580]
I'm going to be a little more. We're sports radio 5cc.

[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:00.820]
2AM.

[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:10.300]
Is the next inside the porn actor studio hosted by James Linton. Today, my guest is

[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:18.300]
Belinda Loon. Back in May of this year, you made a palpitatingly,

[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:24.080]
brilliant piece of straight to video cinema. The landmark to which I refer, of course, is

[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:30.800]
sorority, skankfest, volume, and everything. Watch pseudo-actresses discuss their crack on

[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:37.060]
inside the porn actor's studio. Based on your work in nothing nurses of NAMTucket,

[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:45.700]
you consider yourself a genuine thespian. Yeah, I guess I just have a girl on girl's feet in that.

[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:53.120]
Absolutely, and thrilling. Whether you're a aspiring triple-ex performer or just a fan of the art form,

[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:59.620]
you'll be self-gratified by watching inside the porn actor's studio. Hey, want to check out my new tattoo?

[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:09.320]
Absolutely magnificent. So good, you'll only see it on Bravo. All right. 14-till-noon at 560 WDQM. I've got

[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.520]
something long I'm going to read that's bad, isn't it? No. Too much reading today, man, but that's

[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.580]
okay, because I'm going on vacation pretty soon anyway, and then of course it'll be that summertime,

[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:22.180]
and then you'll be on it. You don't read articles on here because it's bad. Right. But reading's good

[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:27.480]
today because we're also bereaved. Oh, well, I mean, here's the best thing you can do if you want to

[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.480]
celebrate the memory of President Reagan, whether you like him a lot or maybe, you know, not all that much,

[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:38.080]
but go on and buy some jelly beans would be good. I got some here. Do you? Jelly belly jelly beans.

[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:42.840]
Now, just to go to show you what a bastard I am, what a heartless piece of crap I am,

[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.440]
I don't even like jelly beans. Being the old fat diabetic that I'm in, if I'm going to go out and

[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.720]
get some candy, jelly beans, that would be so far down on my list. If you had them, if I was sitting

[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.380]
right there across me, I wouldn't be the least bit interested in that crap because you have it

[01:24:55.380 --> 01:25:00.200]
had jelly belly jelly beans. I don't care about it. I've had jelly belly all my life. Yeah, but

[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:09.540]
these come in spinach flavor. No dirt. Vomit. Yeah. Your wax. Oh, great. Booger. No. I'm going to try that.

[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:14.160]
All right. I'll save you. If you're my own. Anyway, the headline in this article, I don't know if

[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.460]
I'm going to finish the whole thing. It's long and I'm not going to apologize anyway. I like it.

[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:26.220]
Did Al Qaeda trainee warn FBI before 9-11? It's NBC News. Says he told agents of terrorist

[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:33.320]
plan to hijack passenger planes more than a year before 9-11. A Pakistani British man told the FBI

[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:37.940]
an incredible tale that he had been trained by been Laden's followers to hijack airplanes and he

[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:42.520]
was now in America to carry out an attack. The FBI questioned him for weeks, but then let him go

[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:49.160]
home and never followed up. Now the former Al Qaeda insider is talking. Let him go home and never

[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:56.080]
followed up. Just like all those guys that were taking the flying lessons to fly only just to fly

[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:02.720]
straight, not take off or land. Yeah. In March 2000, Niaz Khan said he was down and out waiting

[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:08.360]
tables in a curry house north of London, overwhelmed by gambling debts and increasingly drawn to the

[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.820]
message of radical local, a radical local Imam. The Imam extraught Osama bin Laden and the

[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:18.540]
rewards for dying for jihad. Then one night outside of Casino and Manchester, England,

[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:24.000]
Khan said to mysterious men approach them. First they say we can help you recalls Khan. I say how

[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.160]
can you help me? Say okay, come sit in the car. Said do you hear do you hear Osama's name?

[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:36.540]
Khan now the grammar is not the best, but then again he probably don't speak. And Khan now 30.

[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:40.580]
30 men said the men told them they were working on behalf of Osama bin Laden. New all about

[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:44.720]
his background and gambling debts, information presumably gleaned from his fellow mosque members

[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:49.980]
and offered to teach him the ways of jihad. They gave Khan several thousand dollars and flew him

[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:54.840]
to Lahore, Pakistan, where he waited for instructions at a local hotel. He says that bin Laden's

[01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:00.300]
followers then drove him blindfolded to a nearby safe house. Khan told NBC News that for the next few

[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:04.560]
weeks he was trained by al-Qaeda, the hijack passenger planes, and then sent to the US.

[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:09.960]
But when he told the FBI headquarters was skeptical and after several weeks, senior FBI

[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.300]
officials ordered him released to the custody of British intelligence. Khan said I told them before

[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:18.680]
9.11 about more than a year before about hijacking an American on an American airline.

[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:23.140]
Khan said that at the Lahore training compound he and up to 30 other men.

[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.720]
We're taught hijacking basics including how to smuggle guns and other weapons through airport

[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.760]
security, techniques to overpower passengers and crew, and how to get into a cockpit.

[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.780]
Khan says he didn't think about all the other people he might have killed and at the time

[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:39.540]
didn't care. Not at that time he said if I die it doesn't matter because this life anyway,

[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.960]
it's no good. After about a week of training, Khan said he was given money to fly a circuit

[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:48.620]
cutest route from Pakistan to Doha cutter to London to Zurich, Switzerland, back to London,

[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:53.060]
and then off to New York. The purpose he said was to allow him to observe flight operations

[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:57.920]
and onboard security measures. Upon landing at JFK airport, Khan said he was supposed to go to

[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:03.500]
a taxi stand, find a man in a white prayer cap and use a code. He said you're named Babu Khan,

[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:09.440]
said Khan, and you'll be saying yes, my name Babu Khan or Babuwi. But Khan claims he got

[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:13.360]
cold feet. Instead of meeting his contract, he slipped away, retreated in New York,

[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.480]
and then took a bus to Atlantic City, and gambled away almost all his money.

[01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:20.400]
Fearful that he had blown out his cash and read that his terrorist trainers had

[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:23.520]
copied his passport information and easily knew how to find him,

[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:27.840]
Khan turned himself in and confessed, I've been to Pakistan. He said I know about this hijacking,

[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:33.320]
something's going on. Khan said his trainers never told him exactly what his terrorist mission in

[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.920]
the US would be. He said he was told he would learn more details from a half-dozen other

[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:42.440]
trained terrorist who he was told already were in the US. For three weeks the FBI counter-terror

[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:46.800]
agents in Newark, New Jersey, interrogated Khan, created composite drawings of his terrorist

[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.320]
trainer and a fellow student and then wired Khan up and took him back to JFK airport, hoping to

[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.580]
smoke out other conspirators, but they had no luck. Congress's 9-11 report confirms that an

[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:01.200]
April of 2000, an unnamed walk-in told the FBI he was to meet five or six persons,

[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:05.680]
some of them pilots, who would take over a plane in flight to Afghanistan or blow the plane up.

[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:10.800]
The report adds that the walk-in passed the lie detector test. NBC News has learned that

[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.900]
Khan passed out one but two FBI polygraphs. A former FBI official says Newark agents believe

[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:19.840]
Khan and try to aggressively follow every lead in the case. The work came from headquarters saying

[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.840]
return him to London and forget about it, which critics say is exactly what the FBI did. How do

[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:29.620]
you like that? Return him to London and... Oh, God about it! Right. But the FBI insisted

[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:34.000]
investigated Khan's allegations thoroughly to not confirm them and had no legal grounds to hold

[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.440]
him. Federal prosecutors agreed. FBI officials say they did the right thing and turn

[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:42.520]
him kind over to British authorities and assumed they would carefully investigate. But NBC News has

[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:46.800]
learned that New Scotland yard only interviewed Khan for about two hours and then released him.

[01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:51.960]
spokesman for Scotland yard in MI5, the British intelligence agency, would not comment their mom.

[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:57.100]
Khan said he watched the 9-11 attacks on television. It was horrified. He said he was

[01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:01.300]
sad for the victims and relieved that he hadn't carried out any attacks of his own to him the 9-11

[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:04.700]
plot rang for mid-year. Maybe same plan, he said, maybe same training.

[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.460]
There was no evidence that Khan was part of the 9-11 plot, but lawyers for 9-11 families urged

[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:15.880]
him to tell his story, arguing it reveals a major, missed clue. Khan says the British tabloids offered

[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:19.800]
a payment to tell his story, but he declined. He wants it known that he's not accepted any money for

[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:24.740]
any interview. He is fearful for his life and at first was reluctant to talk to NBC. He changed

[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:28.860]
his mind after a British newspaper published his name and he says surreptitiously took his

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:32.900]
photograph. Once it was published, he agreed to go on camera to talk about what he sees as a

[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:39.340]
missed opportunity. Khan remains surprised that to this day, the FBI, CIA and Scotland Yard have

[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:43.520]
never asked for his help and identifying the street address of the Lahore safe house where he

[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:47.960]
and dozens of other men were trained. He says he saw some identifying signs and might be able to

[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:52.400]
locate it today. I'm just surprised because they never came back to ask more things. He said the

[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:56.580]
FBI believed me, but maybe not didn't take it seriously enough. Now that he's told his story,

[01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:01.800]
Khan plans to go back into the shadows branded by some a terrorist by there's a traitor to the

[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:08.220]
cause. He's going into hiding. He's going to big fat mustangs. We're one of them bookers and

[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:12.780]
whatever. Some of Rushdie has a few hiding places picked out. There you go. They have a club.

[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:18.260]
Here's our first poll of the day. Since night and we're going to turn it around and no,

[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:23.040]
we're going to turn it right around. You can stare at... Right. Well, speaking of staring, don't

[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:28.900]
forget Ursula and Russ in the state of undress behind the beaten curtain today. Since 1960, who do you

[01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:33.000]
think was our best president? Of course, a lot of you don't care. We should put that under two, right?

[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:36.740]
Right. Well, we don't... You know what? If you don't care, we don't care either. I'm not putting

[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:40.720]
that on there. That's the easy way out for a lung heads, which we have so many about there.

[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:46.420]
Lung heads, idiots, morons. How's it that affect my life? I don't care. That's nothing to do with

[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:51.420]
where I'm going to be in late tonight or not. Oh, okay. And of course, in the case of most of those

[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:58.220]
people, they aren't. 570 votes. Not too shabby here. Start of this poll kind of late today because

[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:05.200]
I was a confedulating about poor President Ronnie Reagan and Nancy and her psychic and her astrologer.

[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:10.200]
He never did anything without consulting Nancy, mommy. They were popping jelly beans. He was taking

[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:15.080]
long naps. But now, of course, they got... You know, they got the whole deal all built up here. He was

[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:19.540]
the great communicator. He was a great leader. And like I said, everything is relative. So, you look

[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:28.200]
at what we got now and you look back at him and you say, hey, bring him back again, okay? Even in

[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:36.780]
the past. Clinton, look at this. 353 votes out of 570. 62% for Baja. Oh, yeah. They're long

[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:42.560]
for the day, man. And I think those right wing hypocritical slime holes man dragged us through two

[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:49.680]
years of penis gate and stain gate and Monica gate and you lied about it. Yeah. I wonder what

[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:57.640]
Miss Fudge is lying about these days, huh? You faggot. Clinton, 353. Reagan, 97. See, Reagan pulled

[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:01.240]
away the second place because it's all Reagan all the time now for day and Fridays and

[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:04.560]
National Day of Morning. Do you see that? Yeah. I'm taking off Friday because of that. I'm going to

[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:11.060]
go to the ceremony. You're bastard. No, I am. I'm taking off Friday because it's a National Day of

[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:14.720]
Morning for President Reagan. I don't want to be totally disrespectful. I'll put some bastard

[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:18.140]
like you on Friday to be disrespectful. How do you like? And you'll probably say bad things about

[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:26.300]
him yourself. I might. Bastard. Just about his hair, though. Clinton, 353. Reagan, 97. You worked

[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:32.320]
with me. You've been around people with worse hair than that. Absolutely. J. K. 73. By the way,

[01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:35.800]
if Aaron Brown don't do something about that muskrat, people are going to start confusing him and

[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:41.760]
mo that red that thing like it looked like a like a mint coat on his head last night with the legs.

[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:50.620]
J. K. 73, then it's way down. Only those three get any positive Nixon 16. Bush two has got 11.

[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:56.760]
Look at Nixon 17. George W. Bush has got only 11. Even the Bush Apollo is out there. I don't think

[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:02.400]
he's all that great. Carter 9. Peanut man. LBJ 7 with that big ego and adjuvant.

[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:08.280]
A gigantic war. 58,000 kids came back in body bags. Mr. Great Society. You hard-ass crook.

[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:14.660]
Bush 1, 3 and Gerald Ford still stuck with two out of nearly 600 votes. Now, what we'll do at

[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:19.820]
noon when you're not even looking. We'll turn it around and we'll say since 1960, who do you think

[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:25.800]
was our worst president will have the same list? Won't that be fun? Okay. Huh? I know who way.

[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:32.600]
Now don't be prejudging. You always have this habit of prejudging. Okay. Don't pre-judge the pubic

[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:36.580]
out there. They might shock you, but I doubt it. Hey, I've talked about dry concepts for a long time.

[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:40.200]
You can pre-judge this because I guarantee I'll bet George's life on it. They'll do for you a job.

[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.120]
The likes of what you've seldom seen, which you couldn't even believe because they dry clean your

[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:47.720]
carpets. They're the only people in the world who do this. It's an exclusive patented method.

[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:52.600]
Sucks out the deep-down dirt way in there in a fiber'sier carpeting, which makes them look like brand

[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.560]
new smell. I'm a new fresher, dry in a couple of hours. They last longer. They stay cleaner longer.

[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:00.980]
What's not to like? I've been using it in my house for over 20 years and you want to start doing

[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:06.180]
the same. They've been around in town since 1979. So beware those 595 per-room scams and all those

[01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:10.080]
other carpet cleaners who like to rip you off. No surprises at the end would dry concepts because

[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:15.040]

[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:50.080]
This is Jennifer Lopez. I have to take my hormones every day to keep the hair from going back

[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.760]
around my nipples. And that's when I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.

[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:54.060]
Rock and Troll, do you job? By order of the president, no more troops in that town.

[01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:00.280]
Get a ceasefire underway. Was something sense in the world?

[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:09.680]
So push, set enough of this. Boys I think were done. Let the FPA do the job of shooting off our guns.

[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:15.580]
This way it won't look like our job failed than my real actions now.

[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:24.680]
But we kind of like this. Rock and Troll, do you job? Rock and Troll, do you job?

[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:32.140]
But we kind of like this. Rock and Troll, do you job? Rock and Troll, do you job?

[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:40.320]
Probably at 5.60 WM we took that first pole between 10 and noon or 10.30 whenever we started.

[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.940]
Actually we only had to pull on there for an hour and a half. We had over 600 votes.

[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:47.440]
You see that? I saw it. Pretty impressive considering how many people are left in town this time

[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:51.740]
of the year. Right and once the kids are off the school, which will be completely I guess the end

[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:56.100]
of this week or the next week. Something like that this week. Pretty soon. There'll be about five.

[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:04.660]
Josh, George, Mo, absolutely. And that's about it. Your mama. Since then your mama. Since 1960,

[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:08.880]
who do you think was our best person? We can change that right now, Eric. Any second, any

[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.580]
moment when you're ready. Because I printed this out. Actually there were a bunch more, but they're all

[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:16.420]
piling on that Clinton thing. Let's not get too carried away. Okay as much as I like them. I certainly

[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:19.140]
voted for him. And I'm sure you did too. I voted for Jeff Kay.

[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:19.380]
Okay.

[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:30.540]
I know. I know. There was before you were born. Never the last. I read. I saw a documentary. That's

[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:35.480]
what I did. Oh, I'm not knocking JFK. He was a great inspirational leader. He was certainly a

[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:40.220]
better speaker than Bubba. And he was doing more than his share of screwing around. I had much

[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:44.000]
better taste than Bubba too as a matter of fact in that department. But back in the day,

[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.100]
maybe you just didn't talk about that kind of stuff. And anyway, well, it's not a bad choice.

[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:54.620]
I'm just kind of shocked and amazed while somebody had to. Since 1960, who do you think was our

[01:38:54.620 --> 01:39:02.200]
best president? Clinton 375 over 62%. Ronnie Reagan 103 getting a heavy sympathy vote there today.

[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:10.000]
17% but then again, he had some pretty marginal competition. JFK 74. Then it's way on down, boy,

[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:13.540]
you got the six real losers in there. No wonder we're in the problems that we're in today, man.

[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:20.600]
I wonder the world is going to hell on a hand casket. Nix and 18 George W. Bush 12. That really

[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:29.620]
says it all right there. Don't it? It's a certain boy. Nix and 18 and Bush 212. Jimmy Carter 9 for

[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:34.660]
those people like guys that had a brother that used to pee in the street. LBJ 7. In fact, you know,

[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:41.020]
who would like Jimmy Carter? Josh Beckett. Hey, Billy, can I give you a hand? I'll give you two hands.

[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:47.300]
That's that's sure. Well, I think Josh made that up. That whole thing about Josh Beckett. He must have. Yeah.

[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:55.920]
Carter 9. LBJ 7. Bush 1. 3 for George Herbert Walker Bush, former director of the CIA. And

[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:01.100]
certainly a big businessman with all of his Saudi friends. Carlau Group, all of these things.

[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.240]
Carlau lateral commission. The builder burgers. And Gerald Ford has only got two. Well, he didn't

[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.980]
get elected anyway. He just kind of liked, okay. After this and said bye bye. And then he made

[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:14.560]
that kind of little deal. I beg your pardon. He said, okay. What did you say? Pardon Nixon. I

[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:20.380]
would Nixon should have died in jail. You know what? Like Al Capold. Right. Like Louis Lepke in the

[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:24.980]
lecture chair. Actually, by the way, Chandler with the weekend, they had another one of those

[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:30.240]
every now and then they get carried away with the mob stories. So we had Louis Lepke and John

[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:38.980]
Gotti and all a whole bunch of these, all these people. Thomas Luccazi. Because another thing Reagan's

[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:44.620]
legacy that the idea I did here mentioned briefly over the weekend is he would, he and his right wing

[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:48.880]
fanatics. They succeeded in something that even Jimmy Carter couldn't do. And as they made the word

[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:55.540]
liberal, a dirty word. Right. I mean, liberal used to be fine. Liberals were, oh, everybody thought

[01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:59.660]
liberal was great. That means progressive. That means you're for social change for the better,

[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.540]
for equality, for all these good things. And then the Reagan people, that crowd made liberal

[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:09.040]
a dirty word, they're unclean, you know. But Katrina Vanden who will write in the

[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.320]
United Nation today, it's on our website. Love the stuff's on our website. But most of you people

[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:18.000]
are too busy getting fried. Is it still raining? Haven't checked lately. Well, have somebody do a

[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.880]
little, have somebody stick their neck out the window. In fact, maybe the beast could do it if

[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:26.920]
you could find his neck. Thursday's Wall Street Journal reports as Katrina that the American left

[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:32.120]
is seeing signs of political revival as Bush's economic and foreign policies alienate growing

[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:37.380]
numbers of Americans. More people are identifying themselves as liberals. While fewer are willing to

[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:42.080]
call themselves conservatives, the term many believe is lost meaning since the fiscal excesses

[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:46.260]
and extremist policies of the Bush administration have replaced traditional conservatism.

[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:50.660]
As the anxious Papu candidate would probably be happy to tell you, although he makes me sick too.

[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:55.020]
The journal Sird reports that the shift in America's political identity is also reflected in

[01:41:55.020 --> 01:42:00.220]
the country's reading habits. As John Howard writes, the flag, the flag of flagship publication

[01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:04.560]
of Love the Nation claims to have captured the highest circulation of any weekly political magazine.

[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:10.900]
The article continues, the nation has seen its circulation grow to 160,000 from nearly 140,000

[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:17.420]
amid 2003 and just over 102,000 in June 2001. The latest figure exceeds the circulation of

[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:23.600]
longstanding conservatist stalwart National Review, which is down to roughly 155,500 down for 159,000

[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:29.640]
amid 2001. How do you like that? The word liberals making a comeback. So maybe George W. Bush,

[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:33.800]
that's what he's going to do for us. Just like Reagan started a deal here, making the word

[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:37.700]
little dirty word. Maybe George W. Bush is going to make it like a breath of fresh air again.

[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.740]
Now let's see, it's my turn to vote over here on my thing. Let me think about this one real hard,

[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:51.320]
okay? Oh, I just voted. I just voted there. Just, I don't know, it was tough.

[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:58.660]
You're right, he's off to the start. 5, 6, 7, 5, 6, you come on. Let's hear about, let's see if

[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:04.640]
smarty Jones can come back and defend his crown. The big, oh, I can't believe he's really that stupid.

[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:07.900]
Anybody really thinks that as a four-year-old, he's going to run in a triple crown, which is again

[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:11.360]
that are for three-year-olds. What's wrong with you, Orlando? Are you some kind of a goofball,

[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:17.240]
some kind of an idiot that you get it? Some kind of a banana boat found? Yeah. Man, he's weak.

[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:23.000]
And one of the Humper hates him like poison. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, and an unpersonal. It's not personal. He's

[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.800]
a good guy. Just business. You know, it's like Tom Jicke. I don't have anything personal against

[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:32.200]
little Tom. He's a good guy. He's, you know, fun at the track. The business, oh my god, what a disaster.

[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:37.740]
Master a disaster, buddy Gilmore in the third race at Yonkers is Bob Meyer has to call.

[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:44.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. I mentioned what a great job

[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:50.180]
Brian Sears did here at Mohawk Saturday. Yes. Nice going, Brian. WQA, hello. Yeah, Neil.

[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:54.520]
Yes, sir. I just want to say this weekend was a bunch of crap with all that Reagan stuff. I mean,

[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:59.080]
I mean, I mean, it's still going on, man. But you know, I don't remember him that way. I remember

[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:03.940]
high unemployment. He didn't care about no poor people. He didn't, he wasn't for age research.

[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:08.620]
Right. The rich got richer. The poor middle class got poor. Right. Right. All of those things.

[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:14.720]
High deficits. Unconnected upstairs. He was a mental midget. I don't remember him being this

[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.260]
great leader that they're making him out. He took a lot of good naps though. Well, I mean, they're

[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:23.180]
trying to rewrite history. He's not that close. That's right there. And you're absolutely right.

[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:26.980]
They're trying to make him into the the only thing we keep here is the great communicator. He was

[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:31.680]
the Teflon president. He could do no wrong. And of course, because of the fact that he was a movie

[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:36.380]
actor, we had to glib, you know, that style. And he just talked above all of this crap. You know,

[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:40.060]
Rush Limbaugh's there, but they were talking about how he's the greatest president of the 20th century.

[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:42.640]
Oh my god. Well, let me expect from a drug induced pill.

[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.580]
Give up. I mean, expect. Neil, any clothes and what are we going to do without the Gipper?

[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:53.420]
Neil, the Gipper God. Oh, get a grip around yourself, pal.

[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:58.800]
Or not. Better not. They might be watching. Here's the fact that says I know you've seen the

[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.340]
Michael Moore trailer for the great. Yeah, I've seen it. That's why we keep playing the audio

[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:06.380]
on here, pal. For the great movie, Fair night 9 11, I keep watching it. It's just great.

[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:10.480]
Can't wait for it to come out with that now. Watch this drive and let the Eagles or

[01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:16.140]
see what the border it says. We'll be waiting for you. We'll wait in the casino Niagara.

[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:19.380]
Oh, that's another thing. We got all kinds of casinos here in Ontario.

[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.820]
Do you know, even the racetracks have casinos here. What a concept with slots. Yeah,

[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:28.600]
we're talking real casinos. I may believe the show here. Here's I don't want to get diverted on

[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:33.980]
this, but I will anyway. Everybody I talked to tells me the same thing. The hard rock casino in

[01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:39.780]
what is that? Hellen, that's Hollywood. Hollywood. Hollywood. Hollywood. Hollywood.

[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:46.220]
On the red. That place is packed. They're doing a business man. The likes of which you can't believe.

[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:50.200]
Why are they doing a business is a great casino? No, no, I mean, I haven't been inside.

[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:54.240]
I'm talking about the reports I get. They're not even like real regular slot machines,

[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:59.780]
but they're doing a laid off as business because the public is desperate for some action for

[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:03.380]
some fun. People want to go someplace where they have a good time. Governor Bush.

[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:10.640]
Reverend Bush. Are Reverend and thief? Here's the guy that's so pious. He's worried about the

[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.480]
Terry Shivoh's keeping that bitch alive. And the main time he off this brother steel election.

[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:18.400]
Him and his girlfriend Catherine Harris. How do you like that? Talk about a bunch of

[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:23.660]
hypocrites. Talk about how much they're freaking liars. Here's another one of those people.

[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:27.660]
Very quietly sitting back there with his P-neck buddies. Here's another one of the most

[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:31.080]
dangerous people out of globe today is your governor, Jeb Bush. And let me say it again,

[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:34.260]
how the people of Florida elected him again. Somebody ought to look in a bad election.

[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:38.600]
We keep having all these stories about rig voting machines and so on. I think it was kind of like

[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:42.840]
three for me and one for you. One of those deals, you know what I mean? How could anybody be that stupid

[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:50.520]
about for this sucker again, huh? From it's past. See, this is good because I can use that for

[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:56.220]
anything now. It's fantastic. Even like bag. Yeah. Being idiot. Things like that.

[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:02.320]
How's Muff doing? Seeing her at all today or maybe she's her. Maybe she's on vacation, but of

[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.160]
course he always comes in and gives us a breathless announcement when he's been on vacation.

[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.280]
What's the deal there? Maybe one fact that is. Back home. Recheck that for a rough weekend.

[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:14.900]

[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:24.540]
I'm Alphore. Another game must have chosen sweating.

[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:31.820]
We'd like to see. Do you John Kerry take Ted Kennedy to be your lawfully-witted husband?

[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:39.920]
Well he's filthy rich. That meets my criteria. I do. Do you Ted Kennedy take John Kerry to be your

[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:45.400]
lawfully-witted husband? You may now kiss the rich white liberal.

[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:48.860]
Hey back, come here, Joe. Bring it on.

[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.280]
1217-560-2M. Here's some good news for Martha Sensing delayed.

[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:08.780]
Okay. The federal judge overseeing Martha Stewart's legal cases later since

[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:11.940]
in hearing till July the 8th, your lawyer said, well it's good to do this for you because

[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:16.300]
it'll give you something to talk about in July. Okay. Well that's right.

[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:20.620]
She wasn't going to be sent in Stainville in June 17. Well like I said, Stewart has convicted

[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:24.900]
March 5 of obstructing justice during a government probe into some of her personal stock sales

[01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:29.300]
was due to be sent in June 17. Legal experts have said she faces a year in prison or Moe.

[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:33.660]
The delayed hearing comes more than two weeks after government prosecutors charge a key witness

[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:37.280]
with lying while testifying her to trial. And like the inquire nurses, they were out to get her

[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.960]
and make an example of that bitch. How do you like that? Yeah. Now Dave the cop who I told you

[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:45.800]
don't send any more of faxes but this is a good fax so I got to read it because he signs a

[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:49.000]
Dave the liberal. We know it's you Dave the cop you're not fooling anybody. Go out and make some

[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.660]
coffee and get some donuts. Hopefully not Dunkin' Donuts. God they suck.

[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:59.780]
I mean I hate to keep saying that but it's just my opinion. I just don't like Dunkin' Donuts.

[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:03.600]
I can't eat donuts anyway but the idea that if there was a choice in other words if there

[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:07.740]
like a dozen crispy cream and doesn't Dunkin' Donuts sitting on that counter out there by a

[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:13.400]
clearance his desk. I mean is there any choice? Well wait first of all you can leave all the

[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:18.100]
Dunkin' Donuts for Josh. I'll take them. No but you will and I'll tell you a little later what

[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:23.640]
you can do with them. But I mean Dunkin' Donuts is just so dry and tasty yeah?

[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:29.260]
Kind of like Dave Ann boring's hair piece. Anyway I don't want to get you into trouble.

[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:33.360]
Right winged Tovcho yeah I do. Right winged Tovcho hosts such as Schnitt and Glenn Bex's

[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.600]
that Dave the liberal are already warning and preparing their audience for the release

[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.700]
of Michael Morris movie which I'm glad the next good reason that he sent me this

[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:44.800]
fax because it reminded me to play that trailer one more time. You can make people do anything

[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:52.780]
if they're afraid. If they have picked the action clothes all of the airports in the United States.

[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:58.960]
All commercial airline traffic was grounded. But we have some airplanes that authorize

[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:01.820]
the highest levels of our government to pick up the sun. We've been live in Spanley

[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:06.680]
members to transport the motor to Spanley. In the middle of the war corporations

[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:10.760]
decided to hold the crown to figure out how much money could be made.

[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:16.140]
One step the oil starts flowing. It's got to be lots of money. Whatever it calls the government would be.

[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:19.700]
It's going to be good for business, bad for the people.

[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:25.580]
Charmander's going to get members of the crown. We're going to get the ships from the

[01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:33.580]
Army and go over to Iraq. The USA Patriot Act allows researchers of medical and financial

[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:38.440]
research. It gets law enforcement almost unlimited power. It went till the middle of the night.

[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:43.160]
It's printed in the middle of the night how the Congress asked the Patriot Act to

[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:51.320]
without even reading it. It's a bad night. We don't read most of the bills. No one read it.

[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:56.520]
Remember the Congress? This is my new war. It was re-tuned to USA Patriot Act.

[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:05.880]
Some of the co-agorances call it. Madison.

[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:07.100]
Carrenham.

[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:09.840]
Tudor Streets of small town America.

[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:11.900]
Tudor St.

[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:12.460]
Lions.

[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:20.060]
It's an impressive crowd to have and to have more of some people call you dearly.

[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:21.800]
I call you my base.

[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:26.880]
It comes the true story that will make you a temperature rise.

[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:38.680]
I call for all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorists' killers.

[01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:43.120]
Thank you. Now watch this drive.

[01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:53.120]
All my guys coming to a theater near you Friday June 25th to weeks from this Friday

[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:53.760]
Fahrenheit 9.

[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:56.700]
I'll get back to a day of the cops. I mean, did the Liberals facts?

[01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:01.220]
The right-wingers already are warning and preparing the audience for the release of the movie.

[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:05.300]
They tell them not. Don't see the movie. But if they do, keep in mind that it's all fake.

[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:09.580]
Right. It's so pathetic that right-wingers must always be told what to think and what to do

[01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:12.860]
by those they hold in the high regard. That's one of the reasons why I know that liberal talk

[01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:16.960]
radio won't succeed because liberals usually are better informed and better critical thinkers

[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:20.420]
and don't need to listen to the radio to be told what to think. I try listening to

[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:23.520]
Merkham at the constantly talk about stuff I already know. So what's the point?

[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:28.140]
PS tomatoes are not vegetables but the gipper was for the last 12 years. That's bad,

[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:32.240]
David. That is so insensitive and cruel that I probably shouldn't be that on the air.

[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:36.120]
What is that? Again, tomatoes are not vegetables but the gipper was for the last 12 years.

[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:42.300]
No, it wasn't tomatoes. It was ketchup was a vegetable. When I were arguing about the,

[01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:47.080]
you know, school budgets and school lunches and oh well ketchup satisfies the need for a vegetable.

[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:49.840]
That was Nancy's idea by the way. I'm sure he's cycling toward that.

[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.680]
Kind of like Marie Antoinette and reverse let them eat ketchup.

[01:53:55.300 --> 01:54:00.000]
Only John Provolta said let them eat mayo on their fries like an Amsterdam and let them

[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:07.240]
smoke a big fat one too. 5670560. Count 560 on the AT&T of the rise of wireless land. We have

[01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:12.700]
a troubling number on this second pool here so far. Out of the first 121 votes it's not looking

[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:18.580]
too good for W in this crowd. Since 1960s since after the Eisenhower era,

[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:25.920]
who do you think was our worst president? Bush the tooth George W's got 78 64.4%.

[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:34.740]
Oh my god. Jimmy Carter 14. Jimmy Carter was a disaster. An absolute disaster. He kind of left

[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:38.800]
me with a feeling of malaise, you know. In fact, I think they should have sent his ass to a

[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:45.780]
Malaysia would have been good. Carter 14. Clinton 10. That of course is the staying on a

[01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:53.520]
way on the blue dress crowd. Nixon 6. Reagan 5. JFK 4. We know who those people are. You know what I mean?

[01:54:53.640 --> 01:55:01.080]
Thank you. Yeah, that your people. Ford 2. Bush 1.1. And LBJ 1. See, Bush 1 didn't elicit much

[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:06.920]
sentiment. Good bad. Just a nothing. You know, and I would agree with that. He was pretty weak.

[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:15.520]
Pretty lame. A whim. What's being new going in? He'd lie lips. But dangerous. And quite frankly,

[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:19.600]
I didn't think that this one would be as dangerous as he was, but this one's 10 times more dangerous

[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:24.760]
because this one's stupid. She at least Bush 1 had an intellect. He had IQ larger than his thumbnail.

[01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:30.700]
He always had Martha Washington, you know, keeping calm when things got really tense.

[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:36.320]
Anybody with hair like that? In fact, I when she when they used to be together, I used to think

[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:42.220]
to myself, are you sure that's not his mother? I mean, that's his wife. Yeah, that's disrespect

[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:46.880]
for me. Oh, no, it's just honest. She's an old bag. She was, I think she was an old bag when she

[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:53.460]
was a child. Old Barbara Bush. I keep thinking about that quote. Oh, she doesn't want to have to see

[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:59.760]
all those pictures, all those terrible things of these soldiers and the, yeah, right. Right. Let's

[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:04.080]
protect us from all the unpleasant things of all the carnage and destruction and devastation that

[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:09.440]
your son is causing. Oh, it wasn't Dave the cop. Oh, look at that. Oh, thank goodness.

[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:14.300]
It's somebody else's Dave the liberal because he just factually said it wasn't him. Well, that's

[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:17.280]
even better and they don't fact as anymore, Dave the cop for a while. Think a couple weeks off.

[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:23.640]
Fact your adults. Some are long keeping busy. Robin E. Blumner writes, these are on our website.

[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:27.060]
I think some of these and if not, the most of you aren't going to read them anyways. So I'll read

[01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:33.740]
them anyhow, right? Because what kind of cause are we going to get today? WQAM. Hello? QAM? Yes, sir.

[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:38.680]
That was a great fit you played there. Was that Calvin, you see, and 10 years after? Yeah.

[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:45.760]
Like I told you, WQAM. Hello? Not there, see? Now that line, something's going on with that,

[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:50.620]
isn't there? It might be. That's a weird sound. Yeah, it's a very weird sound. It sounds like Bell

[01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:55.860]
Southigan is poaching around with our phone. WQAM. Hello? Hello, Neil. How you doing? Pretty good, sir.

[01:56:56.520 --> 01:57:02.680]
I'm curious when Nixen was going. Did we have? Spiro didn't screw P Agna.

[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:07.140]
Then what I said was what I'm told. Wasn't there a good key?

[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.200]
That was outstanding. Like I said, let's take a lot of calls. Oh, man. I was hoping you'd let

[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:25.480]
that play out. Oh, yeah. I could smell that one, man. I wanted to see where it was going.

[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:31.780]
I think somebody spiked his Spiro T if he asked me. That was beautiful. See what I mean?

[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:38.080]
Nothing like these phone calls, man. To make my day every day. You guys are about your faggot.

[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:43.280]
Okay, Junior. Thanks a lot. Okay. Now go back and put on your jockstrap or just take a

[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:47.580]
shower with us and make it guys again. Okay. Junior. Get the honey, Junior. Say,

[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:53.720]
26 past noon, speaking of honey, speaking of fat people. Well, Junior, say, I was, he could

[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:57.360]
lose an answer to, and he's got a fat ass. That's what Josh told me.

[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:03.820]
He said he puts pudger on burgers to shame. He's got a big ass doing your sale. Now what you said?

[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:09.580]
That's what you said. No, what? I never, I haven't seen Junior, say, I've since he played for the

[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:13.700]
chargers. That's a long time ago, man. I haven't been around, you know. I'm watching the

[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:17.560]
Patriots. I'm watching Tom Brady. I'm watching the Tampa Bay Lightning. When the Stanley Cup tonight,

[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:21.060]
Brad Richards with a hat rig. Nice going Brad. Stick it in there, baby in the puck too.

[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:26.360]
Hey, speaking of like I was starting to say before the honey and be fat, everybody's fat. If

[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:31.940]
even watching Tom Durkin the other day on a Delmont telecast, I wanted to cry. Tom Durkin's a great guy.

[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:35.440]
He's a great race caller. Him and along with our buddy Dave Johnson and two best in history.

[01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:42.100]
And he's just huge. He's just enormous. Well, if you're one of those people whose fat is a cow and

[01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:45.140]
don't want to die from it, maybe you're doing balance for life. And of course, the big issue for a

[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:49.260]
lot of the balance for life is, should you do the five day or seven day plan? People have fist

[01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:53.200]
fights about that. Well, the five day plan does not include the weekends, but what if you just want

[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:57.700]
a few meals on Saturday and Sunday? The seven day plan has got all the meals, but what if you have

[01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:01.840]
dinner plans for the weekend? It's all or nothing. Well, now balance for life to solve your

[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:06.140]
day Lima has created a six day plan. On Friday night, you'll get one bag for the entire weekend.

[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:10.020]
So you can choose which meals you want to eat and when. The best part about this plan is since

[01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:15.060]
balance for life is the only meal delivery service that offers you choices. You can choose meals from

[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:19.440]
either the Saturday or Sunday menu. What's not to like? And to add to this plan, if you tell the

[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:22.960]
wonderful people that balance for life where you're going to eat out, they'll tell you which items

[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:26.780]
on the menu are balance for life approved. They might even stalk you at the restaurant. What a

[01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:30.480]
complete service and balance for life is working exclusively with a few local restaurants,

[01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:34.640]
label menu items, balance for life approved. And when they find out, well, maybe they'll tell us

[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:40.040]
about which restaurants they are to. Would that be great? Maybe. Be a nice doctor. You're right.

[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:43.980]
Move over atkins because the zone is the way to go. And by the way, price-trade for you really

[01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:48.380]
screwed up, Pompato. It's a good thing that I got a good memory on Friday. You idiot. Plus, keep an

[02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:22.760]
You know when P-A-Y-S-U-C-K-S-O!

[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:30.760]
Newt Gengrich does the hanky-panky. Newt Gengrich has a stanky-wanky.

[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:38.400]
Newt Gengrich does the hanky-panky. Newt Gengrich does the hanky-panky.

[02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:41.680]
We thought he always thought his money.

[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:53.100]
They tease Bill Clinton about it all the time. They call me womanizing low-life slime.

[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:59.620]
But newt Gengrich is on a round with his shirt. That's why his shirt turns out he's

[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:05.760]
on a round with his shirt.

[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:10.980]
All right, here we go on to deck. Let's go.

[02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:16.240]
Oh, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, the committee would like to know

[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:19.340]
how those hanky-wankies sticking out from money to deck.

[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:24.420]
I see. Okay, they're not...

[02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:28.980]
All the committee sees no improv. They'll be no further destiny.

[02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:35.200]
I saw him working on his pick-up lines.

[02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:38.880]
You come here often, baby. Watch your side.

[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:42.940]
I'm pretty and Republican and all alone.

[02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:46.600]
Hey, buddy, baby. Can I give you the phone?

[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:51.040]
Who would have thought I'd ever would have thought that?

[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:53.860]
Come here, baby. You mean that you should be forever.

[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.720]
Newt Gengrich does the hanky-panky.

[02:01:58.760 --> 02:01:59.060]
No!

[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:02.660]
Gengrich does the hanky-panky.

[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:06.220]
Gengrich has his makey-wanky.

[02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:07.040]
That's a looping.

[02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:10.260]
Gengrich does the hanky-panky.

[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:13.560]
We thought he always thought his money.

[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:19.380]
Oh, this does Dan Nancy Wring arrives at funeral hall of Santa Monica.

[02:02:19.380 --> 02:02:21.380]
She'll look at the day of the day to 100 and talk.

[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:24.480]
I actually feel relief for her even though I can't stand it.

[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:26.800]
Look at her. Are you looking at that on CNN?

[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:27.980]
No, I'm looking at this.

[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:30.460]
What? Oh, okay, now I am.

[02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:35.980]
Look at that. She looks like the mascot death is on her face, don't she?

[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:38.060]
I mean, look at it. I mean, is there with her daughter?

[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:39.440]
They're all reconciled now.

[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:42.940]
You mean Maureen? Oh, that's right. She's the dead one.

[02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:46.160]
Yeah. Now, let me figure this out because there's Ron Jr.

[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:48.420]
The ballet dancer.

[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:51.800]
What's the deal now?

[02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:54.820]
Who's Jane Wyman was his first wife, Reagan, right?

[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.880]
Okay. Now, who's by whom?

[02:02:58.240 --> 02:02:58.860]
I don't know.

[02:02:59.240 --> 02:02:59.820]
You don't know?

[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:02.960]
There was Patty Reagan and Maureen Reagan who died of cancer.

[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:06.820]
And you got Ronnie Jr. that the ballet dancing twit.

[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.380]
And who else?

[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:09.560]
Is that Patty there?

[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:10.740]
Patty Davis.

[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:14.020]
Patty Davis with the Nancy Davis, Reagan.

[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:18.000]
Well, that's right. So she's an aunt's, he's daughter by another marriage, right?

[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:21.840]
Okay. And he's somebody's daughter by, I don't know, I don't know,

[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:23.560]
by hooker by crook, I guess, Ronnie Jr.

[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:25.800]
I don't follow the American royalty scene.

[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:27.400]
But you better get with it.

[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:29.100]
Well, what do you mean the American royalty scene?

[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:32.600]
It was only one Reagan president until Ron Reagan gets in there.

[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:34.040]
I don't care about his family.

[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:37.420]
Although I did look at those naked pictures.

[02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:38.500]
Did you really?

[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:38.960]
Sure.

[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:42.960]
All the fear that's fit to print by Robin Blumner,

[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:44.460]
I threatened to read this before tonight.

[02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:48.820]
I just got a sidetrack talking about the big race on Saturday.

[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.940]
Because I know a lot of our people are big racing fans.

[02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:51.860]
Oh, yeah.

[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:52.640]
Right.

[02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:56.020]
The case of Brandon Mayfield, the overgone lawyer,

[02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:58.280]
who was a suspect in the March 11th train bombings in Madrid,

[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:03.040]
because his fingerprint ostensibly matched one found on the bag of explosive detonators,

[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.000]
races a host of troubling questions that someone in Congress should be asking.

[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.700]
How is it possible for a fingerprint match to be inaccurate

[02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:15.060]
after being confirmed as a 100% identification by three FBI experts,

[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:17.000]
as well as a defense hired expert?

[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:20.800]
What does that say about the dependability of fingerprint analization?

[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:24.960]
Why was Mayfield detained under the material witness statue when that law was

[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:28.080]
designed to address the problem of witnesses, not perpetrators of crimes,

[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:29.280]
who are a flight risk?

[02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:33.180]
Why did the FBI have Mayfield's army fingerprints on file,

[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:35.020]
and why could they be searched at will?

[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:40.380]
Mayfield was detained on May 6th and held for nearly two weeks as a material witness,

[02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:43.560]
and the terrorist attack that killed nearly 200 people injured about 2000.

[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:45.940]
It was released with an apology from the FBI.

[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:50.240]
We now know that Mayfield's fingerprint was not the one on the incriminating bag.

[02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:53.920]
Instead, the FBI says the print belongs to Oren,

[02:04:54.020 --> 02:04:57.420]
they doubt an Algerian national, whatever the hell his name is.

[02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:02.000]
Yet according to the FBI, Mayfield fingerprints matched the print lifted by Spanish authorities

[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.220]
at 15 particular ridge points.

[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:05.060]
Remember, River Ridge?

[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:09.740]
This is far more than what is often required in criminal court to assert an

[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:10.780]
absolute match.

[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:14.720]
In the Washington Post last month, Jennifer Mnuchen,

[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:18.780]
law professor at the University of Virginia wrote experts have declared positive fingerprint

[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:21.920]
matches in court even finding after fewer than eight points.

[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:23.880]
And what have a name is Mnuchen?

[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:28.600]
What the Mayfield case suggests is that fingerprint matches may not be the gold standard

[02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:30.380]
proof that law enforcement has held it out to be.

[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:34.160]
Mnuchen said the serious concerns about re-reliability fingerprint analization

[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:35.400]
have been proudly ignored.

[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:38.280]
First, she said we really don't know whether each fingerprint is unique

[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:40.100]
since valid statistics don't exist.

[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:42.360]
It could be that many people at fingerprints so similar

[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:44.640]
has to be virtually indistinguishable.

[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:45.140]
Did you know that?

[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:45.640]
You do now?

[02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:46.080]
Yep.

[02:05:46.660 --> 02:05:47.420]
You didn't know that?

[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:48.180]
Yeah, I didn't.

[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:48.660]
Oh.

[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:52.940]
Another concern identified by Mnuchen is the growth of databases holding fingerprints.

[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:57.440]
The FBI's integrated automated fingerprint identification system contains more than 45

[02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:58.260]
million prints.

[02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:00.540]
The more prints, the more likely there'll be false positive matches

[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:04.080]
implicating someone innocent with what is put forth as unassailable proof.

[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:08.080]
The FBI's mistake was maybe because of the poor quality of the digital image of the

[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:11.260]
Madrid fingerprint, but it also appears there was a rush to judgment against

[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:14.400]
Mnuchen's which match was one of a number spit out by the computer.

[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:18.020]
Mnuchen became the prime suspect because he'd represent a terrorism defendant

[02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:22.240]
a custody matter and he advertised in a Muslim telephone book that was run by a

[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:25.660]
former assistant of Osama Yamama Bin Laden, the kind of associations that many

[02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:27.320]
in the Muslim community could easily have.

[02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:30.620]
Here is religious profiling and work that consequences can be highly

[02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:34.580]
destructive to innocent lives, but of course who in this administration cares about that.

[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:38.760]
Then there's the most distressing aspects of this case, which is the way due process

[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:41.580]
was bypassed with the use of the material witness statute.

[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:44.940]
The law was designed to hold witnesses who were likely to leave the country to avoid

[02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:48.960]
testifying, but has been transformed by John Ascroft's Justice Department as a tool of

[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:49.760]
preventive detention.

[02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:54.720]
Since 9-11, at least 50 individuals have been locked up first investigated later with many

[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.640]
release without being called as witnesses at all.

[02:06:57.080 --> 02:07:00.720]
In Mafield's case, there was insufficient cause to charge him with a crime so the justice

[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:01.940]
department used what was handy.

[02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:06.400]
It is worth noting that, with prior to Mafield's arrest, Spanish authorities had raised

[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:11.020]
questions over the accuracy of the FBI fingerprint match, but FBI officials didn't wipe the arrogance

[02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:13.360]
from their eyes until a more logical suspect emerged.

[02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:18.100]
Mafield's prints were available to the FBI because he had been arrested once as a juvenile

[02:07:18.100 --> 02:07:19.600]
and had been in the US Army.

[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:24.480]
According to Paul Bresson, FBI spokesman, in addition to fingerprints of known criminals and

[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:28.340]
arrestees, the agency maintains the prints of everyone who's held a federal government job

[02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:30.540]
where has been in the Armed Forces since 1924.

[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.660]
The prints are collected so the FBI may conduct a criminal background check,

[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:35.980]
but after the check is complete, the prints are not destroyed.

[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:39.240]
They're kept nearly indefinitely for use when the FBI is looking for suspects.

[02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:43.560]
I bet the men and women of the Armed Forces have little idea that years after they completed

[02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:47.180]
their service, their fingerprints are scanned for any potential criminals and terrorists

[02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:47.760]
among them.

[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:50.280]
Congresses take some interest in Mafield's case.

[02:07:50.660 --> 02:07:54.200]
Members of the Justice Department let us raise questions and the topics explained to come up

[02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:57.020]
when Ascroft appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week.

[02:07:57.020 --> 02:07:58.640]
They should keep on it.

[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.880]
It is up to lawmakers to say limits on how this war on terrorism is fought,

[02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:06.840]
either with respect to due process rights in privacy or not, or not.

[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:09.860]
I think right at the moment I think not would be the operative term.

[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:17.460]
And speak of the Patriot Act and getting an eclipse from the Furniture and High 9-11

[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:19.700]
and the fact that nobody read the bill in Congress, right.

[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:26.500]
The Broward County Commission registered their opposition and declared it unconstitutional

[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:28.880]
on whatever the hell data was.

[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:32.400]
And two minutes till midnight, the Sun sent and put that story on their website

[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:34.860]
and it never appeared in the next day's newspaper, it vanished.

[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:40.980]
All of these things continue disappearing mysteriously in the middle of the night.

[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:43.400]
We're being printed mysteriously in the middle of the night as the case may be.

[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:45.380]
Just the coincidence, I guess, huh?

[02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:46.580]
Must be.

[02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:46.940]
Sure.

[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:53.460]
1241 at 560 WQM, Kimba Bo camper for the Mad Dog at 2, the Humper at 4 from Shula State 2.

[02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:54.500]
Then we got the big.

[02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:58.360]
We just can't wait to see um, smarty Jones in the Derby again next year.

[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:00.380]
And in the bill mod, it probably do better.

[02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:03.240]
Any K at 10 o'clock in an overnight, it's a total loss.

[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.860]
The property is 7 at 560 WQM.

[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:08.680]
259 votes on pool number two.

[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:12.480]
First two hours, we asked who was our best president since the 1960

[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:15.480]
and Clinton wins hands down with over 62% of the vote.

[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:22.080]
Bubba, all his warts and pimples and uh, growing nose, he still wins hands down over 62%.

[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:24.500]
But who was our worst president?

[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:26.560]
259 votes.

[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:31.600]
Uh, the Bushmeister, the tooth, W 166, 64%.

[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:32.660]
Oh my god.

[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:33.220]
Like that.

[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:35.200]
Yeah.

[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:38.100]
Clinton 28, Carter 24.

[02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:40.080]
How is that possible?

[02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:43.360]
Well, it's just, it's because of recent history and because of the Clinton basures.

[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:44.800]
You know, they're just out there salivating.

[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.940]
Ah, you know, I want to send it very worth.

[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:51.080]
They don't like the fact that he was getting a little uh, head of his time.

[02:09:52.660 --> 02:10:02.160]
Carter 24, Reagan 16, Nixon 9, JFK 5, a Gerald Ford 4, LBJ 4, and Bush 1, 3.

[02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:06.120]
He was kind of like, like that porridge, you know, not too hot, not too cool, just the mediocre.

[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:07.300]
Just lukewarm.

[02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:10.860]
Not a whole lot of people like him, not a whole people dislike him.

[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:12.380]
It's just like that.

[02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:13.140]
Come see, come, sah.

[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:14.200]
Come, how?

[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:15.300]
Bush 1.

[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:15.860]
Sa.

[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:18.180]
Oh my god.

[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:19.420]
This, here's LL Cool, Jay.

[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:20.200]
I'm talking about Reagan.

[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:20.540]
People.

[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:25.300]
You know, in different ways like, well, you know, if you do this, you can't do that.

[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:27.020]
And if you do that, you can't do this.

[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:27.620]
Well, guess what?

[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:28.200]
It's Murphy right now.

[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:30.940]
He was a movie star and he became president in the United States.

[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:31.840]
Well, how do you like that?

[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:33.300]
You tell him, LL Cool, Jay.

[02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:33.980]
You tell him.

[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:37.460]
Oh, Tony better.

[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:42.320]
But when he was governor, he had me sing for the boys that came back from Vietnam.

[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:44.080]
And it was unforgettable.

[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:46.520]
It was unforgettable, Tony better.

[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:49.220]
In the day over 110, there's Syracadishica Barker.

[02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:49.500]
Peter?

[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:53.800]
He did a long and very rich life.

[02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:54.680]
War's new, Sarah.

[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:55.500]
There's a lot.

[02:10:55.500 --> 02:11:01.620]
And I think the thing that most of us remember is that he passed away in the loving care of his family,

[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:04.580]
which so many people in this country who have all time.

[02:11:05.620 --> 02:11:07.420]
Yeah, he showed us what a real vegetable is.

[02:11:07.420 --> 02:11:09.320]
Okay, forget about that ketchup crab, Nancy.

[02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:11.360]
I think it was getting even with her, you know what?

[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:13.740]
For coming up with that crab that ketchup is a vegetable,

[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:16.860]
punishing all the children of America go to school and being the

[02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:18.760]
deprived of their real nutrition and health.

[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:21.700]
That's probably why we got a bunch of running around right now.

[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:22.660]
It's probably all a Reagan thing.

[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:24.380]
We have a D-A-D-H-D on him.

[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:25.340]
We're right.

[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:27.220]
And HDTV.

[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:27.900]
Right.

[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:31.500]
And all the other things too, if you ask me.

[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:32.620]
Anything evil.

[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:34.900]
He was always talking about the evil empire.

[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:36.380]
Now we got the one with his evil doers.

[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:38.660]
And Ted Kennedy's drinking at evil doers.

[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:42.200]
5670560, pound 561.

[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:43.460]
And there's spurs a few of your calls.

[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:44.440]
Did I get some of your thoughts?

[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:45.860]
Or not.

[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:47.980]
Has the case maybe?

[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:50.100]
WDQA, hello.

[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:51.480]
It's going to be a new one.

[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:52.060]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:53.920]
Yeah, if I run a quaint book,

[02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:58.140]
when Ronald Reagan was in office and then the the war came down

[02:11:58.140 --> 02:11:59.780]
in Germany and Russia class,

[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:02.540]
he took over 12 up in Francisco.

[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:04.860]
The run a green piece of organization.

[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:06.820]
You know.

[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:09.960]
And then the top of it off, the guy winds up.

[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:12.180]
Dead, yeah.

[02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:16.880]
5670560, pound 5660 on the AT&T in Verizon,

[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:18.760]
wireless, will you follow on that one there?

[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:19.160]
Nope.

[02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:23.120]
Something about what Josh Beckett likes to do on his hands,

[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:23.900]
I think is what he said.

[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:24.680]
Some were in there.

[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:27.600]
5670560, WDQA, hello.

[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:28.340]
Neil.

[02:12:28.780 --> 02:12:29.160]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:32.660]
Hey, talk about Ronald Reagan in the 80s.

[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:34.640]
Yeah, I'm in the medical equipment business.

[02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:38.920]
We used to deal with, you know, when A1 came out,

[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.680]
you do, I don't know.

[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:42.980]
Many people don't know this.

[02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:45.560]
Like 95% of the hemophilia acts.

[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:48.760]
We used to deal with children and they were coming out with AIDS.

[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:51.820]
Then you had all these hate mongers and all these people saying

[02:12:51.820 --> 02:12:54.060]
all these people deserve to die and stuff like that.

[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:55.720]
And then, you know, you're dealing with kids

[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:57.420]
and they didn't do anything

[02:12:57.420 --> 02:12:59.840]
and just because of a condition that's...

[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:01.200]
Yeah, blood transfusion, right?

[02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:02.440]
Because of the bad blood.

[02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:03.240]
Like, right away.

[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:05.120]
You know, 95% of the...

[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:08.300]
So it's really in that whole mentality back then.

[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:10.460]
I had no respect for the guy anyway.

[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:11.880]
And I kind of...

[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:13.020]
You can't see the people dying.

[02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:16.940]
I have no compassion for him.

[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:17.600]
Well said.

[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:18.200]
Thanks.

[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:18.680]
Thank you.

[02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:19.720]
Well said.

[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:22.040]
Oh, it's a fact thing.

[02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:24.520]
You know, he was a heartless right wing fanatic.

[02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:27.460]
And because of the fact he was a movie star,

[02:13:27.580 --> 02:13:30.000]
he talked with a very glibba with that soft toenail.

[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:32.100]
Therefore, it's the cosmetic appearance

[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:33.140]
that counts in a rise in millions,

[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:35.320]
including these jack holes in the immediate now

[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:37.140]
that are making a big song to dance about this.

[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:41.720]
He was a non-compassionate right wing fascist.

[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:43.440]
Kind of just like we got what we got right now,

[02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:44.700]
even though they just changed the name.

[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:45.240]
Because...

[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:45.820]
Watch this drive.

[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:47.760]
Yeah, I've watched this drive.

[02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:48.360]
Oh, brother.

[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:50.060]
If you have a minute,

[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:52.760]
go online on michaelmore.com

[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:53.780]
and just click on where it says,

[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:55.320]
view the trailer of Fahrenheit 9-11.

[02:13:55.440 --> 02:13:56.360]
You really have to see it.

[02:13:57.760 --> 02:13:58.600]
It'll just take...

[02:13:58.600 --> 02:13:59.840]
It's about two minutes long.

[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:00.820]
It's really well worth it.

[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:03.360]
It'll get you salivating for that movie coming up

[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:04.140]
two weeks from Friday.

[02:14:06.020 --> 02:14:07.840]
He's got the hootspace standing there.

[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:08.820]
Of course, you really...

[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:09.580]
When you see that clip,

[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:10.620]
you don't know where he's standing.

[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:12.240]
You don't realize he's on a golf course.

[02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:14.940]
He's standing there and he's a t-shirt,

[02:14:15.220 --> 02:14:16.160]
a striped t-shirt,

[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:17.180]
like going on about,

[02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:18.160]
well, these terrorists,

[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:20.380]
we have to get him wherever they are in the world.

[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:22.140]
He's an evil terrorist and they have to be caught

[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:22.740]
and tracked down.

[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:23.980]
And then all of a sudden,

[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:25.220]
the camera backs away a little bit.

[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:27.340]
You see that he's pulled out a driver,

[02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:28.120]
a golf club,

[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:29.220]
and he starts...

[02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:30.220]
Now watch this drive.

[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:32.220]
And there he goes,

[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:33.380]
whacking the golf ball, man.

[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:34.000]
Just, you know,

[02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:35.180]
so perfect,

[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:36.080]
so outstanding.

[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:37.440]
As you'd expect from michaelmore,

[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:40.980]
see, this is one guy who's not going to sit back.

[02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:42.560]
He already had this experience before

[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:44.240]
when he tried to do bowling for colabines

[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:46.900]
and they tried to bury him deep-sixth before the fact.

[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:48.960]
And then it was that one school librarian.

[02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:49.720]
Remember that story?

[02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:50.140]
Sure.

[02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:51.840]
And then a whole bunch of school librarians

[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:53.480]
got together and put up a fuss.

[02:14:55.540 --> 02:14:57.340]
People that won't sit still for censorship,

[02:14:57.460 --> 02:14:58.900]
they don't believe in this crap, okay?

[02:14:59.220 --> 02:15:00.740]
There was it to people that made the stink

[02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:02.140]
and that's eventually why they're booking

[02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:02.980]
in a movie godmade.

[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:07.320]
But you won't find any guts at Disney.

[02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:07.900]
I'll tell you that.

[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:08.920]
You won't find any guts at

[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:09.880]
the most of the big publishers

[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:11.760]
because they're really busy putting out a problem.

[02:15:12.900 --> 02:15:15.080]
Thank god for the wine-stone brothers there

[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:17.200]
for buying at the Miramar Miramax

[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:18.480]
in Miramar, what a hell I was.

[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:20.280]
Thank god for them.

[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:21.920]
For those good Jewish boys.

[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:22.460]
Hey!

[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:24.240]
See, they're not voting for a bush.

[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:25.360]
I'll guarantee you that.

[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:28.640]
We need to find some Jews for carry, okay?

[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:31.320]
Not just a well-to-do snobbish

[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:32.260]
of Jews for bush,

[02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:34.240]
which I encountered a few of them during my week down.

[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:35.800]
And that was disgusting.

[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:37.400]
That was sickening and nauseating.

[02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:39.420]
Revolting, grotesque.

[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:42.340]
One thing I found is that all the people that,

[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:44.140]
all of them that I've encountered

[02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:46.000]
who have associated with a stock market

[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.320]
with finance, with big bucks,

[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:50.500]
no matter what their religious persuasion,

[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:52.340]
they're always fit to Republican do'sure,

[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:54.480]
whichever fascist do'sure is coming down to pike.

[02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:55.700]
They're all for it.

[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:57.320]
Maybe if Hitler had been good for business.

[02:15:57.720 --> 02:15:59.260]
Hey, listen, I get that some of the Jews

[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:00.340]
in Germany supported him.

[02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:00.720]
Are you kidding?

[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:01.700]
I don't...

[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:03.320]
I saw that in those movies.

[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:04.320]
Well, there you go.

[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:07.840]
567-0560, but we're supposed to like,

[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:09.120]
remember Ronald Reagan,

[02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:10.700]
can he get this crap over with already?

[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:11.480]
Or what?

[02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:12.240]
Oh boy.

[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:13.480]
I'm trying to forget him.

[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:15.820]
I'm trying to develop compartmental Alzheimer's

[02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:17.260]
and just have that one little part of my brain.

[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:19.240]
Forget him and forget that he was ever around.

[02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:24.560]
Couldn't say the word AIDS couldn't articulate,

[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:27.920]
it could not enunciate it for a long, long time.

[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:30.600]
WQA him, hello.

[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:32.460]
QA him, hello.

[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:34.780]
Not there, two in a row, can we go for three?

[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:36.300]
WQA him, hello.

[02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:40.400]
QA him.

[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:42.420]
He articulating, could not even know if he had...

[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:46.460]
WQA him, hello.

[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:47.440]
Hello.

[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:48.320]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:49.480]
I'm on the hill.

[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:50.280]
Speaking.

[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:52.140]
Hey, I got a great bit.

[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:53.200]
I'm going to pull off today.

[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:55.760]
I'm going to go to a costume shop.

[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.640]
I'm going to get me a Ronald Reagan basket.

[02:16:58.160 --> 02:16:59.160]
I'm going to get this trouble.

[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:00.220]
All right.

[02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:04.480]
Sounds good to me.

[02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:07.940]
Sounds like a hell of a good idea.

[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:08.760]
A good way to...

[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:09.420]
Wait for me.

[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:10.100]
Right.

[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:12.960]
A good way to commemorate the passing of our 40th president.

[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:13.560]
There you go.

[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:14.740]
Just get bled.

[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:17.320]
Put on the old Ronnie Reagan mask.

[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:18.100]
Matter of fact.

[02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:18.860]
Yeah.

[02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:19.840]
Know how we have that bit?

[02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:21.620]
And I think we can still play that hot-killed bit.

[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:22.900]
Right.

[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:24.960]
Get your Ronnie Reagan mask and roll you up a big fatty.

[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:28.160]
Hot-kills.

[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:32.020]
Judy Garland, Lenny Bruce, Elvis Presley.

[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:35.080]
They all died while sitting on the toilet.

[02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:35.940]
Remember,

[02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:38.380]
hot-kills.

[02:17:39.940 --> 02:17:40.940]
Stay off the pot.

[02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.180]
I remind you from the home safety console.

[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:45.900]
Just say to that wicked weed, baby,

[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:47.120]
or not as a case, maybe,

[02:17:47.220 --> 02:17:48.920]
all depending on which Jamaican dealer you're doing business.

[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:50.360]
But George's got to list some good names.

[02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:53.160]
How come it is that that Jamaican men

[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:54.220]
tend to be a little bit more?

[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:55.480]
I guess because they got the good crap.

[02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:57.060]
But they're just, I don't know, a different breed.

[02:17:57.060 --> 02:18:00.200]
But they don't have that imperious attitude that the women do.

[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:01.540]
I'd like to definitely.

[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:02.400]
They do?

[02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:03.500]
Although with the exception of Hudson.

[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:06.140]
Yeah, you don't know any Jamaican men.

[02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:07.180]
Oh, who you can, man?

[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:09.440]
We seem to have a dead barber shop over there.

[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:10.080]
You can, me?

[02:18:11.020 --> 02:18:11.340]
Okay.

[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:12.480]
1256.

[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:15.380]
Right, right, kidney corner, a Chuck sub-center over there on a corner.

[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:16.400]
I know where you hang out.

[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:17.160]
Drop on.

[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:19.880]
Right by between a barber shop and at the convenience store.

[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:21.220]
That's where all the good deals go down.

[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:21.740]
Oh, they got baby.

[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:24.900]
You're trying to lose weight by following one of his low-carb diets.

[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:28.600]
The lights away spoke as help thousands of low-carb

[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:30.100]
diners achieve their weight loss goals.

[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:31.980]
Today, shopping for the right low-carb products

[02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:33.660]
has become more and more confusing.

[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:36.220]
Now, most of the so-called low-carb products

[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:37.360]
under the grocery store shelves

[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:40.680]
won't even help you lose weight because they're loaded with carbs.

[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:42.760]
Selecting foods with the right ingredients

[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:44.500]
as well as the lowest carbs is the key.

[02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:45.600]
That's what it's all about.

[02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:48.660]
The lights focus is on over a thousand of the right low-carb

[02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:51.380]
items and products that you can sample before you buy.

[02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:53.180]
I'm anything the store tried before you buy it.

[02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:55.300]

[02:18:55.300 --> 02:18:57.380]

They're open everyone.

[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:09.040]
He was 93.

[02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:10.820]
That's much more than enough.

[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:13.600]
They're open every day, seven days a week from 10 to 10.

[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:15.620]
Delights away spoke is on the northeast corner of blades

Find a local, this is 560.

[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.240]
The radio's on your side.

[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:34.220]
I'm the...

[02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:35.220]
...Cue Man.

[02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:38.760]
This is your president speaking.

[02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:41.360]
Yeah, I got so much time nowadays.

[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:42.780]
I haven't even listened to that.

[02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:45.080]
Neil Rogers won the 2-hour.

[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:45.940]
It's good.

[02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:46.800]
It's good.

[02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:51.260]
How dare they drag the good name

[02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:53.880]
of the United States of America?

[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:58.720]
Here's a mud of Saddam Hussein's torture prison.

[02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:02.820]
Abu Dhabi, great.

[02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:23.700]
I'm on CV as my own private lane.

[02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:27.000]
I didn't say well no, and the turt they should chew.

[02:20:27.260 --> 02:20:29.700]
But I start calling it, no baby.

[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:32.040]
Got that sucks, I suck.

[02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:35.460]
No babies, I don't know, I don't know.

[02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:40.200]
I'm raindsie, I hear that's not 40 soon out of rock.

[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:43.760]
Right through spring, through the factions, through the party.

[02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:45.400]
I suck, I suck.

[02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:48.800]
Oh, baby, I suck, I suck.

[02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:50.300]
Oh, man.

[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:55.480]
I'm telling you that was a very moving thing on Saturday

[02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:58.700]
that they had to show us the flag and half-mast on top of the White House.

[02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:01.780]
They couldn't just report to us that the president ordered the flag lowered.

[02:21:02.100 --> 02:21:03.620]
They had to show it to us breathlessly.

[02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:04.700]
Breaking news!

[02:21:05.220 --> 02:21:07.780]
The flag has been lowered to half-mast at the White House.

[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:08.860]
Aren't you shocked?

[02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:10.760]
Yeah, and it's made.

[02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:12.400]
And then actually see it.

[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:14.100]
It was just a fly-opener to me.

[02:21:15.380 --> 02:21:18.880]
102-560-WQM Kimbobo Campro Fidamad Dog at 2.

[02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:24.160]
Michelle Kotl of CBS NewsRights team bushes on a religious crusade.

[02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:25.100]
Part of these things.

[02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:25.460]
Yeah.

[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:30.660]
A mighty army of religious warriors is being assembled on the president's behalf right, Michelle.

[02:21:31.640 --> 02:21:33.120]
She says Carl Roe is no idiot.

[02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:34.980]
I realize this observation sounds obvious.

[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:36.200]
But it bears repeating.

[02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:38.660]
Often his Democrats and Washington's chattering class

[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:40.820]
become increasingly excited about conservatives

[02:21:40.820 --> 02:21:43.560]
increasing the public criticism of the Bush administration.

[02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:49.460]
Perhaps more than any other field politics embraces the kicker guy when he's down out.

[02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:52.080]
Look, thus with W. Suffering a popularity slumped

[02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:54.360]
due to his breathtakingly mismanaged direct odyssey,

[02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:58.300]
it's unsurprising that many on the right have begun to grouse about other bush moves

[02:21:58.300 --> 02:22:00.620]
that they see as ideologically impure.

[02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:05.200]
Sure, the tax cuts were great, but what about the massive deficits run up on W.

[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:05.620]
is watch.

[02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:09.020]
The White House can draw about the cost of fighting terrorism all at once,

[02:22:09.020 --> 02:22:12.680]
but a budget analysis conducted by of all folks, the Heritage Foundation,

[02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:17.640]
indicates that less than half of the new spending under Bush has been related to defense or homeland security.

[02:22:19.140 --> 02:22:22.980]
Conservatives are less than thrilled about the president's big government prescription drug bill,

[02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:26.900]
not to mention his notches, federally intrusive no-child left behind program.

[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:29.840]
And speaking of intrusive, a colorful mix of right-wingers,

[02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:32.960]
including the leadership of the Eagle Forum, the American Conservative Union,

[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:34.540]
and the Free Congress Foundation,

[02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:36.920]
think the pay-true debt could use some serious tweaking

[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:40.580]
before John Ashcroft starts implanting spy cams and everyone's underpants.

[02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:49.640]
Concerns about Bush's conservative credo won't be eased by the fact that members of his own party have launched legislative crusades and conflict within his administration positions.

[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:53.800]
Georgia, ex-Congressman Bob Barr, in order to womanly be funny little mustache,

[02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:58.460]
is lobbying hard for an overhaul of the pay-true debt by local home of congressman Ernest Ishtook,

[02:22:58.900 --> 02:23:02.800]
keeps pestering majority leader Tom Delay for a vote on a balanced budget amendment.

[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:07.040]
Realistically, such amendments got about as much chance of victory this year as Dennis Kocinich,

[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:11.860]
but a vote on the issue, something Delay reportedly promised Ishtook just before the Memorial Day recess,

[02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:15.820]
could prove uncomfortable both for the White House and congressional conservatives

[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:18.940]
as Democrats begin musing about how that deficit's got so big,

[02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:21.680]
what Dracconian cuts would be needed to achieve a balanced budget,

[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:26.020]
and why exactly so many Republicans spent so many months arguing that deficits don't matter.

[02:23:26.980 --> 02:23:30.860]
The anti-Bush forces are understandably giddy about W's inter-party blues,

[02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:34.540]
for one thing it must come as a tremendous relief to discover that even this president's

[02:23:34.540 --> 02:23:37.220]
Teflon coating will get sticky if enough mud is splashed on it.

[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:40.980]
Who could have predicted that Chalabi would turn out to be this big of a sleazeball?

[02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:44.740]
More broadly, Democrats have grown accustomed to being the party of self-destructive,

[02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:49.180]
inter-nesting bloodliding for them the very idea of Republicans publicly savaging one another

[02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:51.180]
as the political equivalent of free porn.

[02:23:51.740 --> 02:23:55.220]
But this brings us back to my original reality, Czech Karl Rove is no idiot.

[02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:57.800]
The dark wizard is well aware of his president's troubles,

[02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:00.520]
and even as the beltway boys and girls obsess over Iraq,

[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:03.720]
team boosters furiously sucking up to the base on domestic issues.

[02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:07.200]
Just this week, W. Delivert, a Keep the Faith Barnburner,

[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:10.860]
nearly 2,000 religious leaders and social service workers assembled in Washington

[02:24:10.860 --> 02:24:14.000]
for the White House conference on faith-based and community initiatives.

[02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:18.200]
In his best preacher's voice, Bush spoke of souls lost and found,

[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:21.960]
the power of the good book, and the need to surrender one's life to a higher being.

[02:24:23.180 --> 02:24:26.500]
But his larger goal, reminding the audience of what a key friend he's been,

[02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:29.260]
stressing his commitment to government funding of religious groups,

[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:32.240]
Bush noted that when an obstinate Congress tried to block his plans,

[02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:34.560]
he outsmarted them by signing an executive order.

[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:36.360]
Take that, you godless legislators.

[02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:39.520]
The more illuminating speech however came from Jim Toey,

[02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:43.600]
Bush's faith-based czar, who helpedfully focus the crowd on the fierce culture war,

[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:45.020]
still raging in this country.

[02:24:45.540 --> 02:24:47.440]
Iraq may be getting all the press these days, he allowed,

[02:24:47.540 --> 02:24:50.900]
but there's also another war that's going on that really gets to the heart of the questions

[02:24:50.900 --> 02:24:52.880]
about what the role of faith is in the public square.

[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:56.900]
If the anti-boish forces wind up curing the day, Toey reportedly warned,

[02:24:57.200 --> 02:24:59.880]
you could almost wind up creating a godless orthodoxy,

[02:25:00.420 --> 02:25:03.560]
propelling such divisive partisan rhetoric at an official White House event,

[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:06.880]
Toey most likely earned a cookie and a pat on the back from the dark wizard.

[02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:11.160]
But the faith-based concern of the conference revival,

[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:15.600]
let me try it again, but the faith-based conference revival was just one stop on team Bush's crusade.

[02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:18.580]
Lastly, to present him with several members of the religious media,

[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:19.740]
this week during a trip,

[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:24.940]
Westy was scheduled to swing by Colorado Springs to kiss the ring of evangelical power broker James Dobson.

[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:27.940]
Finally, and perhaps most impressively on Thursday,

[02:25:28.060 --> 02:25:32.940]
the New York Times broke news that the Bush campaign is working to recruit literally thousands of friendly congregations

[02:25:32.940 --> 02:25:37.580]
to aid its reelection efforts by identifying volunteers wanting to distribute campaign materials,

[02:25:38.020 --> 02:25:43.080]
facilitate voter registration, and pray for a plague of frogs to paralyze Blue State voting on election day,

[02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:44.460]
just kidding about that last part,

[02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:47.840]
in Pennsylvania alone, 1600 churches have been contacted.

[02:25:48.660 --> 02:25:52.860]
This move, at least, captured the attention of Democrats who promptly fired off outraged emails

[02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:54.880]
accusing the Bushes of mixing church and state,

[02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:57.360]
the Democrats are right to be furious and terrified.

[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.340]
Rove has long vowed to make sure evangelical voters turn out to see

[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:02.880]
in far greater numbers than in 2000,

[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:07.460]
and every new Iraq failure makes it that much more important for team Bush to remind social conservatives

[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:11.060]
who was with them on hot button issues like gay marriage and partial birth abortion,

[02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:15.180]
homegrown moral atrocities that inflamed the right far more than anything that went down at...

[02:26:16.260 --> 02:26:20.480]
The Bush campaign is unlikely to spread this particular message via nationwide TV Adlets

[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:23.920]
since much aggressive moralizing might give swing voters the willies,

[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:27.520]
but they will spread it through every conservative broadcast of religious publisher

[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:29.140]
and friendly congregation they can find,

[02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:32.680]
a mighty army of religious warriors is being assembled on the President's behalf.

[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:36.520]
When this in mind, the Kerry campaign better not get too wrapped up in Iraq or Vietnam,

[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:38.240]
this is a two-front war,

[02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:43.100]
and team Bush is working hard to convince Americans that as in all battles, God is on its side.

[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:44.880]
How do you like that?

[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:45.960]
Damn God!

[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:47.880]
The Lord wants the Bushmeister.

[02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:49.100]
Yeah.

[02:26:49.180 --> 02:26:50.100]
Oh, there's the aherst...

[02:26:52.380 --> 02:26:56.260]
William Randolph Hearst, there it is with the Ronnie's casket, a Tisket of Tasket,

[02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:57.600]
I think he's in the casket.

[02:26:58.540 --> 02:26:59.340]
Oh boy.

[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:00.120]
Yeah.

[02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:02.280]
Oh yeah, we're gonna see this like around the clock.

[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:04.580]
This makes the OJ thing peel into one significant thing.

[02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:06.460]
Oh, I just thought white Ford Bronco passed by.

[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:08.280]
Yeah, there he goes, there's A-C.

[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:09.460]
V-C.

[02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:13.740]
Guess what is the most popular thing on the Internet?

[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:15.320]
Porn?

[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:16.760]
There you go.

[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:18.400]
Okay.

[02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:20.960]
I thought it was a trick question for a second.

[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:21.440]
No.

[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:24.900]
Porn three times more popular than searches.

[02:27:26.020 --> 02:27:28.960]
What if we often get what we got Ursula and Russ gonna address?

[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:30.300]
They're searching.

[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:35.820]
Tracking firm finds that 18.8% of U.S. web visits were to adult sites,

[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:38.140]
5.5% to top search engines.

[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:40.220]
See, that's why we give you a little of both.

[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:42.880]
Although there's nothing pornographic, I did just a couple of boobies.

[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:43.660]
That's hard.

[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:46.480]
Including the pictures of the president, couple of boobies.

[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:49.160]
It's an appreciation of beauty and Pat Boone, couple of boobies.

[02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:54.020]
Online porn sites get about three times more than the top web search engines,

[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:57.800]
including market leader Google Inc. research firm said last week.

[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:04.340]
Websites categorized as adult accounted for 18.8% of all Internet visits by U.S. users

[02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:06.980]
in the week ending May 29, almost 20%.

[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:10.320]
Meanwhile, the category that contains search engines dominated by Yahoo,

[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:13.880]
MSN and Google accounted for just 5.5% greater hit rising,

[02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:16.160]
a California based company that tracks web use.

[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:19.080]
See, we should be putting more boobies and more porn on there

[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:23.440]
and less of these bedtime stories that we work so feverishly to find in the inform, etc.

[02:28:24.100 --> 02:28:24.680]
That's quicker.

[02:28:26.100 --> 02:28:29.300]
During that time, Google garnered 2.7% of all web visits

[02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:34.140]
while Yahoo's search and MSN search cut 1.7% and 1.1% respectively,

[02:28:34.140 --> 02:28:37.440]
Bill Tanser, no kin to Bill Tanner, who we don't like anymore,

[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:39.740]
VP of research at Hit Wise Told Reuters.

[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:44.400]
Other large hit wise categories included entertainment at 8.0%,

[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:49.140]
business in finance at 7.4%, and shopping in classified at 7.0%.

[02:28:49.780 --> 02:28:53.580]
Google is moving toward an initial public offering that's expected to be a blockbuster.

[02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:57.160]
The three leading search providers fall into a subcategory hit wise call,

[02:28:57.280 --> 02:28:59.100]
search engines at directories, Yahoo, Yahoo.

[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:01.140]
Does it go on any more about the 401 here? No.

[02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:02.640]
Well, that's all we cared about.

[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.300]
Hit Wise also found that fast-growing comparison shopping sites

[02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:11.360]
such as shopping.com, next tag and biz rate are getting fewer referrals

[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:14.940]
from web search providers, meaning that users are either going directly to the niche sites

[02:29:14.940 --> 02:29:16.240]
or finding other routes to them.

[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:19.240]
Thereby cutting search engines out of lucrative shopping clicks.

[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:22.700]
The same appears to be true for top travel sites, Tanser said.

[02:29:23.940 --> 02:29:24.920]
But he liked that.

[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:27.020]
What I'd like to say, that's no bulletin.

[02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:29.860]
And why the hell should it be? Americans are repressed.

[02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:34.520]
Even though they're screwing their brains out 124 times a year, they still want more.

[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:38.400]
Since 1960, who do you think was our worst president?

[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:39.800]
That's our second poll of the day.

[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:41.300]
268 vote.

[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:46.360]
Bush too. George W. Bush has got 65.7%.

[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:47.380]
Oh my God.

[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:49.980]
Oh, there's Cheney.

[02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:50.660]
Playing center.

[02:29:50.940 --> 02:29:54.200]
Wow, wow, he's got to play center for the 49ers this year, Cheney.

[02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:57.100]
Yeah, out there in San Francisco, all in Madakunis.

[02:29:57.380 --> 02:29:58.560]
Well, his daughter, you know, is a dyke.

[02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:01.020]
Let's see, Bush too. 242.

[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:02.940]
65.7%.

[02:30:02.940 --> 02:30:04.260]
Jimmy Carter 38.

[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:05.720]
Week. Week, man.

[02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:06.380]
Terrible.

[02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:06.880]
Awful.

[02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:09.260]
Just go in the pick some peanuts.

[02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:11.020]
Jimmy, get out of our push and tell your brother.

[02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:12.100]
Didn't he die?

[02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:16.340]
Billy Carter's dead, but he won't be doing that anymore in Josh Beckett's hands or anybody else.

[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:19.000]
So that six pack of Billy beer, you've been saving up his worth something.

[02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:20.120]
Oh, I'm right. Crack it out.

[02:30:20.700 --> 02:30:23.940]
And I get your Reagan mask on the staff, known to get out that old Billy beer.

[02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:26.420]
And then go wash your hands.

[02:30:27.540 --> 02:30:28.340]
Carter 38.

[02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:29.420]
Clinton 35.

[02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:30.840]
Reagan 17.

[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:31.920]
Our worst.

[02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:33.580]
Nixon 10.

[02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:36.720]
See, he did unworse than that, but they're not as insensitive as we are.

[02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:38.540]
You know, don't want to hit a man when he's down.

[02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:41.500]
I mean, he has been dying for 10 years.

[02:30:41.820 --> 02:30:42.820]
He was a vegetable.

[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:45.680]
But, oh, the shock.

[02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:47.120]
I just don't get it.

[02:30:47.940 --> 02:30:48.680]
Reagan 17.

[02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:49.740]
Nixon 10.

[02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:50.960]
JFK 8.

[02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:52.520]
I bet you know, those people speak of English.

[02:30:53.180 --> 02:30:53.980]
Bush 17.

[02:30:53.980 --> 02:30:54.200]
Nixon 14.

[02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:56.400]
Jerry Ford couldn't walk in to you.

[02:30:56.440 --> 02:30:57.120]
Come at the same time.

[02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:57.880]
Sixth.

[02:30:57.900 --> 02:30:59.560]
And LBJ 5.

[02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:02.080]
For Lyndon Baines Johnson.

[02:31:02.380 --> 02:31:03.720]
Who was the Bain of many people's existence.

[02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:05.220]
Most of them came back in body bags.

[02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:06.720]
See, he was not all bad though.

[02:31:06.720 --> 02:31:07.860]
We had the great society thing.

[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:08.660]
Civil rights.

[02:31:08.760 --> 02:31:08.920]
Right.

[02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:09.880]
He had some good stuff going.

[02:31:11.020 --> 02:31:11.920]
But he was a hard ass.

[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:13.540]
He just wouldn't give up on the Vietnam thing.

[02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:14.960]
And he was, wouldn't listen to nobody.

[02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:17.120]
I remember, I remember like it was yesterday.

[02:31:17.740 --> 02:31:20.300]
The night he came on TV, he went out to say he would not accept it.

[02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:24.340]
And would not try to get the nomination of his party out for re-election.

[02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:24.760]
I remember that.

[02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:25.840]
Like it was 10 minutes ago.

[02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:26.320]
Yeah.

[02:31:27.120 --> 02:31:27.700]
You don't.

[02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:31.420]
Because you were like, let's see, that's 68, 32, 36 years ago.

[02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:32.460]
You were like a child.

[02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:32.880]
Yes.

[02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:34.200]
And another country.

[02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:38.000]
Oh, and another country where you were busy voting for a Castro.

[02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:38.620]
Right.

[02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:39.940]
At the tender age of three.

[02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:41.280]
And one of those fixed elections.

[02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:46.100]
We are sports radio 560.

[02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:47.760]
We weigh in.

[02:31:49.640 --> 02:31:50.640]
And another thing.

[02:31:50.840 --> 02:31:51.900]
You don't listen to me.

[02:31:52.060 --> 02:31:53.840]
You're a bit of a big star by now.

[02:31:54.100 --> 02:31:55.880]
You're with that little bit sweet voice.

[02:31:56.280 --> 02:31:58.400]
I didn't expect to get anywhere a little beauty-puked.

[02:31:58.660 --> 02:31:58.660]

[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.000]
Please say, Puked.

[02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:01.320]
And I think it's a bit of a ride.

[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:02.120]
I don't know what it is.

[02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:04.280]
I was just a 36, a white guy.

[02:32:04.660 --> 02:32:05.340]
I like you.

[02:32:05.700 --> 02:32:05.700]

[02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:06.500]
I like you.

[02:32:06.620 --> 02:32:06.840]
I like you.

[02:32:08.320 --> 02:32:08.560]
Yeah.

[02:32:09.020 --> 02:32:09.300]
What about?

[02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:11.820]
I like you.

[02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:14.440]
I like you.

[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:14.440]

[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:14.440]

[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:14.440]

[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:14.440]

[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:15.600]
What about?

[02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:19.840]
I want to die.

[02:32:21.100 --> 02:32:23.480]
You're a pectorine.

[02:32:24.240 --> 02:32:28.520]
No toenail, cheese, a romaine.

[02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:31.280]
It's being a home-ass.

[02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:34.760]
And points like that.

[02:32:36.040 --> 02:32:38.520]
Why you, why you're gonna smack you?

[02:32:39.140 --> 02:32:40.000]
Thanks, Steve.

[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:42.620]
I know my smell attracts you.

[02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:44.180]
Thank you.

[02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:51.480]
But unlike Zach, you still can't set your...

[02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:58.240]
I feel just like that you are my dim rudder.

[02:32:59.120 --> 02:33:01.280]
And one year later, another.

[02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:05.100]
That's why you're still not buying.

[02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:05.280]
That's it.

[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:07.120]
That's it.

[02:33:07.980 --> 02:33:07.980]

[02:33:08.240 --> 02:33:08.420]
That's it.

[02:33:09.020 --> 02:33:09.020]

[02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:09.540]
That's it.

[02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:10.220]
That's it.

[02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:11.380]
That's it.

[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:12.040]
That's it.

[02:33:12.260 --> 02:33:12.580]
That's it.

[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:12.580]

[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:12.580]

[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:12.580]

[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:12.820]
That's it.

[02:33:13.220 --> 02:33:14.080]
That's it.

[02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:14.080]

[02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:18.240]
That's it.

[02:33:20.700 --> 02:33:21.000]
That's it.

[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:21.620]
That's it.

[02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:25.980]
That's it.

[02:33:26.580 --> 02:33:28.260]
That's it.

[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:31.680]
That's it.

[02:33:32.020 --> 02:33:34.560]
That's it.

[02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:36.920]
That's it.

[02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:38.960]
119-560.

[02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:40.480]
That's it.

[02:33:40.620 --> 02:33:40.680]
That's it.

[02:33:40.900 --> 02:33:42.780]
Here's another nitpicker and other facts.

[02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:44.400]
Neil, I don't like correcting God.

[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:47.860]
But what half mast is when the flag is at sea.

[02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:51.300]
Half-staff is when the flag is unlanded.

[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:52.560]
Now I wouldn't afford a dead along.

[02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:54.660]
But nitpickers such it is.

[02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:58.480]
But I think that you need to go into great detail about flying your flag at half-staff.

[02:33:59.460 --> 02:34:01.400]
Hey, when my flag is at half-mask.

[02:34:01.500 --> 02:34:01.900]
Yeah.

[02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:05.800]
Half-staff is on land.

[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:07.340]
Half-mask is at sea.

[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:08.620]
Who gives a fly in?

[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:09.780]
I'm saying who cares?

[02:34:10.060 --> 02:34:12.720]
I think I heard you want to say half-staff is better than none anyway.

[02:34:12.820 --> 02:34:13.020]
Right.

[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:13.880]
And half-aloof.

[02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:15.280]
That's what though.

[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:18.160]
And speaking of that, all these spots we got about constipation.

[02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:19.100]
Yeah.

[02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:21.680]
Well, what's going on in this radio station?

[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:22.920]
My God, I know it's the dog.

[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:24.100]
There's a summer coming up here.

[02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:28.400]
Last couple weeks we had the painful defecation spots with mufflinzy.

[02:34:28.740 --> 02:34:31.720]
Now we got the Tommy there to win a constipation spots.

[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:33.740]
We should like to feel relaxed once again.

[02:34:33.800 --> 02:34:35.500]
Oh my God, we're obsessed with...

[02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:35.820]
Reckon!

[02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:36.880]
...ass on this station.

[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:40.980]
I wouldn't be surprised if George starts talking to summertime about sniffing Chinese ass again.

[02:34:41.460 --> 02:34:42.760]
Or whatever it was that you were talking about.

[02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:43.100]
Eating.

[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:44.100]
Ah!

[02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:47.420]
Chinese meals at Emmer Post.

[02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:50.460]
You won't like this news.

[02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:52.200]
Okay.

[02:34:52.580 --> 02:34:57.160]
A statement very al-Qaeda's name warned today that Western airliners will be the terror group's next target.

[02:34:57.260 --> 02:34:58.180]
Oh my God.

[02:34:58.520 --> 02:34:59.080]
What airliners?

[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:01.980]
Western airliners, you know, like from the West?

[02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:02.580]
Yeah.

[02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:07.720]
The statement appeared on an Islamist website known for posting messages from militants including the video,

[02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:10.520]
which a terror group with al-Qaeda links executed Nick Berg.

[02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:16.040]
The statement's authenticity could not immediately be verifying, but it was signed al-Qaeda on the Arabian peninsula.

[02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:18.280]
Oh, hi Al.

[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:19.540]
Al-Qaeda.

[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:23.460]
Like, you know, as in the collective kind of signature.

[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:29.440]
The statement referred Crusaders and warned all that is affiliated with these Crusaders from compounds,

[02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:36.900]
bases, and means of transport, especially Western and American airliners, will be direct targets of our next operations with God's help it says.

[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:44.600]
The statement begins by warning all Muslims to avoid contact with the American and Western Crusaders and all non-believers in the Arabian peninsula.

[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:51.700]
It urges Muslims to ignore Americans and Westerners in their homes, compounds, movements, and means of transport in all shapes and forms.

[02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:54.940]
The statement says the purpose of this warning is to spare Muslim blood.

[02:35:55.140 --> 02:36:01.860]
Well, I've never considered about that before when they made those attacks in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in that part of the world.

[02:36:01.940 --> 02:36:02.900]
Those are the bad ones.

[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:03.420]
Huh?

[02:36:03.620 --> 02:36:06.080]
Oh, that's right. They were supposed to be a blood of the good Muslims.

[02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:08.720]
If they will please stand up so we can identify it.

[02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:11.500]
There is that look at that.

[02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:13.140]
There's that white-forward Bronco.

[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:15.480]
I mean, they have black hers on a freeway.

[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:16.740]
Oh, we're silly.

[02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:17.680]
Yeah.

[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:19.300]
Do you want to refer to this?

[02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:21.160]
She's in the little, oh, now we got her off the screen.

[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:23.080]
Now we got the big picture there.

[02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:23.460]
The hers.

[02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:26.100]
This is mind blowing to me.

[02:36:26.180 --> 02:36:27.120]
I still hate her.

[02:36:27.620 --> 02:36:28.700]
I can't stand her.

[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:29.500]
Religious bitch.

[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:30.840]
Let's see.

[02:36:31.020 --> 02:36:31.820]
Oh, and now look at this.

[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:39.160]
The president was escorted into the chamber where members of the upper and lower houses of parliament had come to hear him outline.

[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:41.780]
They're talking about India, India on the BBC.

[02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:44.460]
Of course, that's part of the old empire in all those people living in a pan.

[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:46.800]
Inhumulation with India's economic expansion.

[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:48.640]
Right, now let's see what they're talking about on the BBC.

[02:36:49.020 --> 02:36:50.620]
The BBC ain't doing Reagan at the moment.

[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:52.680]
I mean, they've done plenty already with the BBC.

[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:55.600]
We'll be celebrating because we'll need that adrenaline.

[02:36:56.120 --> 02:36:58.980]
The Canadian Task Force in Kabul, Afghanistan, they're talking to them.

[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:02.940]
So it's only the American networks that are just fixated nonstop virtually.

[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:07.020]
Once in a while we get a little something else about the G8 summit coming up, but back to this.

[02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:07.340]
Government.

[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:09.800]
They might have agreed with it in...

[02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:10.820]
Oh, brother.

[02:37:11.340 --> 02:37:12.820]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:15.280]
And Nuria, negative words, she'll be heard, okay?

[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:18.480]
Because it's just disrespectful, as the mad dog would say.

[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:19.480]
Disrespectful.

[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:22.240]
Like saying the bad word about Dan Marina, you know, disrespectful.

[02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:25.460]
No, my med.

[02:37:26.540 --> 02:37:27.840]
No, that would be Italian.

[02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:29.360]
I don't know no French.

[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:30.120]
No.

[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:30.900]
Well, my med.

[02:37:31.340 --> 02:37:36.060]
The mayor of Beagles in the Southwest of France, which I'm sure pronounced in that wrong too, I could care less.

[02:37:36.260 --> 02:37:36.980]
Studos frog.

[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:39.940]
It has presided over the country's first game marriage.

[02:37:40.980 --> 02:37:43.360]
Mr. my med, a former television presenter.

[02:37:43.700 --> 02:37:44.520]
What do you know about them?

[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:49.240]
Perform the marriage of a shop worker, Bertrand Chaplin, G831, and a male nurse.

[02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:50.180]
You know about them.

[02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:54.320]
Stephon Chapin, 34 on Saturday, because he said he wanted to fight discrimination in France.

[02:37:55.480 --> 02:37:56.720]
Why had police surrounded...

[02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:03.360]
I don't want to say they're getting a little worked up over there, but just calm down please.

[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:09.240]
Why had police surrounded the town hall where the ceremony took place because of protest by conservative groups?

[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:11.240]
Well, we're not alone, isn't that pleasant here?

[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:14.860]
We got a few of them here in Canada, a few of them right-wingers.

[02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:15.800]
Fought third, a man.

[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:19.820]
The happy couple arrived in a brown-roles-roise and were applauded by gay-wice activists.

[02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:25.020]
Mr. my med said he was proud of having officiated at the wedding and said, I don't consider myself an outlaw.

[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:33.340]
The marriage, which was recorded and shown on French news bulletin, has ignited a fierce debate in France about the legality and morality of gay marriage.

[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:38.720]
The interior ministry Dominique Duvelpan said he'd begun disciplinary proceedings against Mr. my med,

[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:41.380]
and accused him of contributing the French civil code.

[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:45.500]
I intend to make sure the law of the Republican, the authority of the state, or respect that he said,

[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:52.120]
if convicted Mr. my med, could face a suspension and a fine of 1,500 euros, which is close to 2 grand.

[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:56.940]
French law allowed civil unions for homosexual couples, but denies them full tax and inheritance rights.

[02:38:57.340 --> 02:39:01.500]
The Prime Minister has said that French law specifies that marriage can only be between a man and a woman,

[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:06.200]
is indicated he believes the wedding to be invalid, or is that invalid, isn't Robert Reagan.

[02:39:07.140 --> 02:39:09.860]
You're just insensitive man, just a bastard.

[02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:10.440]
Yeah.

[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:11.220]
How?

[02:39:12.060 --> 02:39:12.660]
Too bad.

[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:18.320]
I'm not going to feign sympathy or anything like that because I don't feel it.

[02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:20.380]
I'm not going to come on here and tell her.

[02:39:20.380 --> 02:39:20.380]

[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:21.900]
Yeah, I feel it.

[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:27.140]
No, seriously, I don't feel any sympathy about this thing, even if I liked Reagan, which I didn't at all,

[02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:31.420]
but even if I would have thought he was a hell of a great president, a good guy, never still afraid to train,

[02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:33.520]
he's been dying for 10 years.

[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:39.940]
This has been an unbelievable burden on the whole family, a special little pinhead Nancy, with her little red dress.

[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:41.480]
She don't even wear the red dress anymore.

[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:42.720]
She's so far blundered from this.

[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:45.620]
So why aren't people saying, oh, what?

[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:47.480]
No, seriously, why don't they say, oh, it's a relief.

[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:48.640]
It's a blessing already.

[02:39:48.940 --> 02:39:49.380]
Oh, what?

[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:53.340]
America has got this obsession about dying.

[02:39:53.540 --> 02:39:54.500]
They just can't handle it.

[02:39:54.620 --> 02:39:56.260]
It's always a morbid thing.

[02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:57.520]
Sometimes it's a blessing.

[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:03.740]
It would seem to me that once you get to about 90, you know, you start thinking very seriously about that kind of thing, right?

[02:40:03.980 --> 02:40:04.700]
For blundered?

[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:06.280]
What's wrong with that?

[02:40:06.380 --> 02:40:07.220]
Is that how you say it?

[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:08.020]
For blundered.

[02:40:08.100 --> 02:40:08.940]
You never heard that before?

[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:09.240]
No.

[02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:12.500]
Confused like messed up in the head like for blundered.

[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:13.520]
Yeah, come on.

[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:16.160]
Are you reverting to your old Goyezha ways again?

[02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:16.920]
For blundered.

[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:17.940]
For blundered.

[02:40:18.020 --> 02:40:18.660]
You heard that.

[02:40:18.820 --> 02:40:20.760]
Even a Goyem know that for blundered.

[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:21.240]
Come on.

[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:21.840]
They do know.

[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:23.660]
Yeah, it's Josh likes it.

[02:40:24.060 --> 02:40:25.860]
In fact, don't isn't he pitching him off for the marlins?

[02:40:26.180 --> 02:40:27.040]
I'm going to use that every day.

[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:27.640]
You're going to have a blundered.

[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:27.760]
Yeah.

[02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:30.240]
Have any rate?

[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:31.920]
Oh, man.

[02:40:32.940 --> 02:40:37.300]
Like Alan Finkelson, my late great friend from Pompa Department of Park used to say there's only one trouble in the world.

[02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:38.240]
Too many Goyem.

[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:39.560]
Well said, Alan.

[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:43.540]

This is Port 20 on FICE-IT.

[02:41:58.480 --> 02:41:59.420]
2 AM.

[02:42:01.220 --> 02:42:03.320]
The Guilier is an ambassador.

[02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:08.140]
It's my grandma's birthday and I have no idea what you get her.

We're gonna give you this Christmas and a special somebody in your life.

Be the old, or be the old.

Happy birthday, clearly.

[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:45.140]
We got you a Pimp name.

[02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:47.640]
Yay, now I'm little kid, dog.

[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:49.640]
Now back up off my grill, yo.

[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:51.720]
Oh, that's so sweet.

[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:53.840]
Everybody on your Pimp Name give me.

[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:54.780]
You can't receive a certificate.

[02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:57.040]
It's a great birthday new Pimp name.

[02:42:57.540 --> 02:42:59.660]
And they get a fur hat and go to it too.

[02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:02.720]
Grandma already had the Cadillac.

[02:43:02.980 --> 02:43:04.760]
Now she's got the name to go along with it.

[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:07.020]
Thanks to the National Pimp Name Registry.

[02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:11.720]
My Jesus, my Pimp Candid Drone, my Desert Team!

[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:16.660]
Well, that's for Sizzles, 131 and 560.

[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:17.880]
I got mine, you got yours.

[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:20.960]

[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:25.280]
Huh?

[02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:26.180]
I changed it.

[02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:27.240]
Change what?

[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:32.060]
The Office CNN, off of the live coverage of the Hurst Rule.

[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:33.880]
Oh, well, let's go over to MSNBC.

[02:43:34.620 --> 02:43:36.180]
They must be talking about something else, right?

[02:43:38.020 --> 02:43:39.100]
1820s and 19s.

[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:40.880]
Oh, Pat, you can, oh my God.

[02:43:42.140 --> 02:43:44.480]
Holy cow, Pat, you can and your favorite.

[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:46.320]
It's alive, I am not, but not see.

[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:48.480]
You never know how much he sounds like Rick Shaw every once in a while.

[02:43:48.740 --> 02:43:49.160]
At any rate.

[02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:51.420]
472 votes.

[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:52.300]
How you doing, Ricky Tiki?

[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:54.460]
40 years on the year in South Florida.

[02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:55.560]
Still ain't watched that camp.

[02:43:56.900 --> 02:43:59.200]
Since 1960, who do you think is our worst president?

[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:02.240]
Bush, George W. Bush the tooth, 318.

[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:05.860]
67.3, two turns, you turn.

[02:44:06.100 --> 02:44:08.220]
This audience says the worst in the last 40 years.

[02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:08.820]
44.

[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:10.880]
Jimmy Carter, 46.

[02:44:11.140 --> 02:44:11.900]
Bill Clinton, 45.

[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:13.320]
Got a good house rights going on there.

[02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:15.460]
Arkansas, Georgia.

[02:44:16.020 --> 02:44:18.200]
Reagan 18, that would be disrespectful.

[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:19.460]
I have a lot of votes on their worst.

[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:20.020]
That would be bad.

[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:21.180]
That's right.

[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:21.880]
They're still doing this.

[02:44:22.300 --> 02:44:23.600]
What's the BBC doing now?

[02:44:23.660 --> 02:44:25.180]
Maybe like something exciting like the weather?

[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:26.140]
A world business.

[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:27.880]
Let's see a big shake up in the industry.

[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:31.020]
What's likely to happen is some of the smaller low-clothed airlines will go bankrupt.

[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:32.660]
Oh, I just can't stand that accident.

[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:36.320]
Reagan 18, Nixon 14, Bush the one that's got nine.

[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:40.740]
JFK 9, four, we know all those people most speaking in English.

[02:44:40.740 --> 02:44:45.040]
Four days, four days, seven and LBJ6 out of 472 votes.

[02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:47.180]
Now, wait to hear this.

[02:44:48.300 --> 02:44:49.360]
Good news and bad news.

[02:44:50.660 --> 02:44:54.260]
The good news is that they carry people of narrow down their choice for running made for John.

[02:44:54.380 --> 02:44:55.180]
Carry to three people.

[02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:55.980]
That's the good news.

[02:44:56.200 --> 02:44:56.340]
Okay.

[02:44:56.880 --> 02:44:58.640]
The bad news is the name of the leader.

[02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:01.100]
Oh no.

[02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:07.020]
If I gave you, in fact, if I took 6,000 calls between now and two o'clock and gave you a guess

[02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:10.180]
as to who the name of the leader would be, you'd never guess it.

[02:45:10.180 --> 02:45:10.840]
Do you want to know why?

[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:12.660]
Because we never heard of them.

[02:45:12.740 --> 02:45:13.360]
You never heard of them.

[02:45:14.100 --> 02:45:14.800]
There you go.

[02:45:15.140 --> 02:45:19.100]
Even I, Mr. Politically, has still wasted a lot of my time reading this crap.

[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:20.700]
Even I never heard of this guy.

[02:45:20.900 --> 02:45:23.140]
I was going to say Lyndon LaRouche, but now I better rethink it.

[02:45:23.660 --> 02:45:23.980]
Worst.

[02:45:25.340 --> 02:45:25.820]
All right.

[02:45:26.820 --> 02:45:29.920]
Well, John, John Edward is one of the three, but he's not the top of the list.

[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:31.140]
The other, the third, we don't know.

[02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:31.960]
We don't know the third.

[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:32.640]
You turn.

[02:45:32.980 --> 02:45:36.800]
But the leading choice right at the moment, Iowa Governor Tom Hilsack.

[02:45:41.460 --> 02:45:42.960]
I.O. has a governor.

[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:43.760]
I guess.

[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:48.780]
Well, maybe he figures they can deliver those key electoral votes from Iowa.

[02:45:50.620 --> 02:45:51.880]
And that might swing it.

[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:52.760]
You think?

[02:45:53.980 --> 02:45:54.460]
No.

[02:45:54.460 --> 02:45:58.440]
Or maybe he figures that we already got these preconceived notions about some of the other possible

[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:03.240]
former runners and he doesn't want to taint the, or maybe.

[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:07.240]
Yeah.

[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:08.920]
Tom Vilsack.

[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:09.880]
I'd never heard of that.

[02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:11.200]
I'm sure I was got a governor.

[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:13.660]
I'm sure I was not as bad as you think it might be.

[02:46:13.980 --> 02:46:14.880]
I didn't see the record.

[02:46:15.180 --> 02:46:15.720]
No matter what.

[02:46:16.300 --> 02:46:18.140]
He needs somebody bright and cheery and famous.

[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:20.500]
Well, maybe Tom Vilsack is bright, cheery and famous.

[02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:23.100]
And doesn't look like he has the mask of death all over his face.

[02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:24.620]
Huh?

[02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:26.800]
Well, this will cheer you up.

[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:27.780]
Here's a little bit better story.

[02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:28.740]
Hillsborough, North Carolina.

[02:46:28.780 --> 02:46:29.500]
Your neck of the woods.

[02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:30.360]
Now where's Hillsborough?

[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:31.500]
Oh, we're younger.

[02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:33.720]
You're not near where you hang out?

[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.420]
Ain't nothing near where I hang out.

[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:36.460]
Hillsborough, North Carolina.

[02:46:36.620 --> 02:46:40.200]
Police are searching for a man who was naked when he picked up his fast food order this weekend

[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:41.060]
and drives through window.

[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:46.800]
The custom-read boat jangles restaurant was described as hairy, big, billyed man about

[02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:50.900]
the top third man with short, curly black hair that was receiving at the top of the head.

[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:52.380]
And if he was naked, I guess they know.

[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:53.140]
Yeah.

[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:53.500]
Oh, yeah.

[02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:54.680]
Short, curly black hair.

[02:46:56.600 --> 02:46:59.540]
He picked up an order at the window Monday morning at boat jangles.

[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:02.580]
Maybe it was Mr. Bojangles.

[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:04.280]
I could have been at the boat jangles in Jefferson.

[02:47:04.740 --> 02:47:09.620]
He conducted his business at the drive-through while wearing no clothing and he had to open his door to receive whatever...

[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:15.780]
Whatever they were passing out to the drive-through windows had kept in Ross Frederick of the Hillsborough Police Department.

[02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:20.800]
This is the first time police have been called about him, but the man has patronized the restaurant before on those occasions.

[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:25.640]
He will only as underwear or perhaps shorts that may resemble underwear Frederick said.

[02:47:25.700 --> 02:47:28.320]
I guess he was getting brazen enough.

[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:30.460]
Maybe it was one of them hot days or something north Carolina.

[02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:32.880]
It didn't real tough since the Cerely Planship day.

[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:36.320]
Oh, how do you like that?

[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:38.580]
Or maybe an accident on his way over there.

[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:41.940]
You know I had to remove the shorts because they might have been a little on the stain side.

[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:43.180]
I don't know how to get too graphic there.

[02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:44.580]
Well, it's hot because it's in the back of the room.

[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:48.080]
Some of our constipation spots and painful defecation spots.

[02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:51.520]
This station is going to...

[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:52.080]
This station is going to...

[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:56.480]
Gassaline costs $0.5 a gallon in Iraq thanks to you as taxpayers.

[02:47:56.480 --> 02:47:58.040]
I bet you're real pleased about that.

[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:00.620]
Thank you.

[02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:00.860]

[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:01.800]
$0.5.

[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:05.660]
Well, Americans are showing out record prices for gas.

[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:10.100]
Or Mackey's pay only about a nickel or gallon for gasoline and a benefit of hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies.

[02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:12.280]
Bank rolled by you, the American taxpayer.

[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:13.380]
Aren't you proud?

[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:17.760]
Before the war forecast is predicted that by invading Iraq and hosting Sodom,

[02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:20.500]
Usain, America would benefit from increased exports of oil from Iraq,

[02:48:20.780 --> 02:48:22.940]
which has the world's second largest petroleum reserves.

[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:27.420]
That would mean cheap gas for American motorists and a boost for the oil dependent American economy.

[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:30.840]
More than a year after the invasion, it logic has been flipped on its head.

[02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:35.020]
Now the average price of for gasoline in the U.S. is running at $0.205 a gallon,

[02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:37.500]
$0.50 more than the pre-invasion price.

[02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:41.840]
Instead, the only people getting cheap gas is the result of the invasion of the Iraqis.

[02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:46.800]
Well, that's the least we can do for like killing all their people like that and butchering up all their kids.

[02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:53.780]
Filming a $22 tank and bag dead with low-grade fuel cost $1.10 plus a 50 cent tip for the attendant.

[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:56.140]
A tank full of high-test costs $2.75.

[02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:57.240]
Thanks a lot.

[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:01.100]
In Britain by contrast, gas prices at $5.79 a gallon last week.

[02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:06.780]
A hundred and twenty-seven dollars for a tank full in Britain.

[02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:09.640]
All the Iran's?

[02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:12.960]
No, a hundred and dollars they translated for us down Americans.

[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:15.500]
You better hope it ain't in pounds.

[02:49:15.860 --> 02:49:16.820]
Pound is like a buck seventy.

[02:49:17.740 --> 02:49:20.060]
Although Iraq is the major petroleum producer of the country,

[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:22.000]
has little capacity to refine its own gasoline,

[02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:26.020]
so the U.S. government pays a buck and a half a gallon to buy fuel in neighboring countries

[02:49:26.020 --> 02:49:28.100]
and deliver it to Iraqi stations.

[02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:31.720]
A three-month supply cost American taxpayers more than $500 million,

[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:36.500]
not including the cost of military escorts to fed off attacks by Iraqi insurgents.

[02:49:36.500 --> 02:49:41.240]
The arrangement keeps afloat to $4,200 tanks cost constantly on the move-firing fuel to Iraq.

[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:45.140]
We thank the Americans bag dead taxi driver Osama Hashim said,

[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:47.800]
they risk their lives to liberate us and now they're improving our lives,

[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:51.820]
you said, how seem 26 topping up the tank on his beat up 83 Volkswagen.

[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:57.280]
Iraq's fuel subsidies, which are intended to modify drivers used to low-price fuel under Sodom,

[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:01.360]
have coupled with the opening of the borders to create an anarchic car culture in Baghdad.

[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:04.120]
Cheap used cars, shipping in from Europe and Asia,

[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:08.460]
are flooding into Iraq, a 10-year-old BMW in food condition cost just 5 grand

[02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:11.920]
and because gas is so cheap, anybody with a car can become a taxi driver.

[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:17.060]
Drivers jam the streets offering rise for the little 250 denars about 17 cents.

[02:50:17.780 --> 02:50:21.760]
These say he'll take about the first 200 denars and rumors say he'll take the rest.

[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:25.680]
Analysts say the U.S. gas subsidies can't last forever in Iraq.

[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:27.520]
He's maybe in for an unpleasant shock one day,

[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:31.080]
and in the meantime, the American taxpayer continues to foot the huge bill.

[02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:33.240]
The U.S. taxpayer has the right to be indignant.

[02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:36.160]
Iraqis have to be worried about the long run damages to this,

[02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:41.360]
said Anthony Corgesman on Iraqi analyst with the Washington-based Center for Strategic International Studies.

[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:43.560]
The minute the aid goes out, the party's over.

[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:44.780]
There's going to be a hell of a hangover.

[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:46.600]
How do you like that?

[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:48.320]
I don't.

[02:50:48.660 --> 02:50:53.100]
The U.S. government paid even more last year for Iraqis gasoline between $1.59 and $1.70 a gallon.

[02:50:53.100 --> 02:51:00.960]
When the imports were contracted to Halibut and the Texas oil services giant formally handed by Vice President Dick Cheney.

[02:51:01.460 --> 02:51:01.980]
God.

[02:51:05.020 --> 02:51:08.900]
$5670.560 on the AT&T Infraurizing Wireless Line.

[02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:12.600]
Life is just one big gigantic ripoff.

[02:51:12.760 --> 02:51:13.620]
So this smile, you know.

[02:51:14.480 --> 02:51:17.340]
Just sit back and smile, relax and eat nothing you can do about it.

[02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:18.680]
Just have one big party.

[02:51:21.420 --> 02:51:21.780]
Yeah.

[02:51:21.940 --> 02:51:26.240]
Yeah, just get out your best rubber Ronnie Reagan happy face and have a great day.

[02:51:27.300 --> 02:51:28.940]
Let me tell you right now about your health.

[02:51:29.080 --> 02:51:31.560]
You know, everybody talks about it, but we don't want to talk out loud about it.

[02:51:31.660 --> 02:51:32.240]
We think about it.

[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:32.920]
And out loud.

[02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:35.440]
Cancer, heart disease, all these terrible things.

[02:51:35.560 --> 02:51:37.840]
We think it can always happen to somebody else but never to us.

[02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:38.460]
Well, guess what?

[02:51:39.100 --> 02:51:39.420]
It can.

[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:43.620]
And it's a proven fact that disease responds extremely well to treatment if you detected early.

[02:51:43.800 --> 02:51:45.480]
If you wait too long, forget about it.

[02:51:45.480 --> 02:51:52.220]
Hollywood Diagnostic Center is proud to offer you their virtual colonoscopy, which is so much less intrusive than the traditional one.

[02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:55.760]
Coronary heart scoring and full body screening exams that are like miracles.

[02:51:55.940 --> 02:52:02.200]
It's like a virtual trip right through the inside of your body that can detect cancer out the life threatening diseases in their early stages before it's too late.

[02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:03.860]
Doctors before was never needed.

[02:52:04.220 --> 02:52:07.460]
I had the test the coronary heart scoring full body screening a few weeks ago.

Don't lie.

[02:53:07.800 --> 02:53:09.240]
All the heartburn.

[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:12.260]
Don't don't ever.

[02:53:12.800 --> 02:53:14.640]
Every time I see.

[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:17.220]
Don't don't know.

[02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:20.400]
That three-card is in which.

[02:53:20.660 --> 02:53:21.060]
Absolutely.

[02:53:21.960 --> 02:53:23.020]
Don't don't know.

[02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:25.460]
My TV.

[02:53:25.460 --> 02:53:29.340]
Oh, he's president of the f**k door.

[02:53:29.980 --> 02:53:33.880]
Republican muscle is in an archaic religious.

[02:53:35.140 --> 02:53:39.060]
I don't know why they want this y'all.

[02:53:39.380 --> 02:53:40.700]
But now he's here.

[02:53:41.260 --> 02:53:43.280]
Just wrote a leg for you.

[02:53:43.940 --> 02:53:47.280]
With president of the f**k door.

[02:53:50.840 --> 02:53:52.460]
Oh, what I did too.

[02:53:52.700 --> 02:53:55.240]
Don't go both on small.

[02:53:56.600 --> 02:53:59.860]
And get to we all voted for.

[02:54:03.260 --> 02:54:05.440]
If you want this.

[02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:07.720]
Don't don't know.

[02:54:08.260 --> 02:54:10.860]
It's drumming stupidly.

[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:13.260]
Don't don't know.

[02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.540]
And this drum in which kid.

[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:18.900]
Don't don't know.

[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:22.060]
He's even lumber than me.

[02:54:22.900 --> 02:54:25.400]
He is president of the f**k door.

[02:54:25.980 --> 02:54:28.000]
You don't care what it's up.

[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:30.880]
You got him here by hook or cross.

[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:31.820]
The Christian.

[02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:36.700]
Oh, I know what best you and I have a health home future.

[02:54:37.380 --> 02:54:39.240]
We've got a great leader here.

[02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:42.360]
With president of the f**k door.

[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:45.260]
President of the f**k door.

[02:54:45.940 --> 02:54:49.300]
President of the f**k door.

[02:54:49.300 --> 02:54:51.180]
President of the f**k door.

[02:54:53.120 --> 02:55:04.000]
How dare they drag the good things of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein's torture prison.

[02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:07.500]
Anyway, the hurts is still going up and down the freeway.

[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:10.120]
In case you're lost, personally.

[02:55:10.820 --> 02:55:11.620]
I know you want to.

[02:55:11.980 --> 02:55:17.180]
Thanks again to the f**kers out there because sometimes they alert me to something that I can't that didn't find or should have found.

[02:55:17.460 --> 02:55:18.440]
This is the second one.

[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:19.680]
I didn't know where to find the one.

[02:55:19.740 --> 02:55:21.600]
I probably should have gone just to GreatPolice.com.

[02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:23.020]
Especially since we have a link to it.

[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:25.440]
Working for a change.com.

[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:26.260]
You can find it there too.

[02:55:26.320 --> 02:55:28.180]
And of course, George and Josh can really do that.

[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:28.920]
Working for a change.

[02:55:31.380 --> 02:55:33.540]
Anyway, GreatPolice writes today about Reagan.

[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:39.120]
The headline says, killer, coward, con man, good riddance gipper, more proof only the good die young.

[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:41.880]
He says, you're not going to like this.

[02:55:42.020 --> 02:55:43.080]
You shouldn't speak ill of the dead.

[02:55:43.180 --> 02:55:44.440]
In this case, someone's got to.

[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:48.220]
Ronald Reagan was a con man. Reagan was a coward. Reagan was a killer.

[02:55:49.140 --> 02:55:53.720]
In 1987, I found myself stuck in a crappy little town in Nicaragua named Chagwitio.

[02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:58.480]
The people were kind enough though hungry except for one surly young man, his wife had just died of tuberculosis.

[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:03.260]
People don't die of TB if they get some antibiotics, but Ronald Reagan, big-hearted guy that he was,

[02:56:03.700 --> 02:56:07.980]
had put a lockdown in Vargo on medicine to Nicaragua because he didn't like the government that the people there had elected.

[02:56:08.980 --> 02:56:12.380]
Ronnie Grin and Crack jokes while the young woman's lungs filled up and she stopped breathing.

[02:56:12.900 --> 02:56:15.780]
Ronnie flashed a B movie grin while they buried the mother of three.

[02:56:16.480 --> 02:56:20.320]
And when his beloved terrorist struck and murdered hundreds of American Marines in their sleep in Lebanon,

[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:24.680]
the TV warrior ran away like a whipped dog, then turned around and invaded Grenada.

[02:56:25.380 --> 02:56:30.520]
That little club med war was like a murderous PR stunt Serrani could hold parades for gunning down Cubans building an airport.

[02:56:31.420 --> 02:56:38.440]
I remember Nancy a skull and crossbones, prancing around and designed her dresses, some of the gifts that flowed to the Reagan's from hats to million dollar homes,

[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:42.340]
from cronies well compensated with government loot. It used to be called bribery.

[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:47.220]
And all the while, Grenada, grandpa, grand father who believed that on about family values,

[02:56:47.220 --> 02:56:49.060]
but didn't bother to seize on grandchildren.

[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:55.720]
The New York Times today and it's canned obed, wrote that Reagan projected faith in small town American old time values.

[02:56:56.360 --> 02:57:01.680]
Values my ass. It was union busting and a declaration of war on the poor and anyone who couldn't buy designer dresses.

[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:06.640]
It was the new meanness bringing starvation back to America so that every millionaire could get another million.

[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:12.200]
Small town values, from the movie star of the Pacific Palisades, the Malibu mogul, I want to throw up.

[02:57:12.200 --> 02:57:19.420]
And all the while in the White House basement as his brain boiled away, his last conscious act was to ca donna coup d'etat against the elected Congress.

[02:57:20.340 --> 02:57:27.040]
Reagan's secretary defends Casper the Ghost Wineburger with a crazed colonel Olly North plotted to give guns to the monster of the Minist Iatola Cammany.

[02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:32.940]
Reagan's voice calls him a murderer, a wiener and a voice although Carter wouldn't give an inch to the Iatola,

[02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:38.680]
Reagan with that film fantasy tough guy con in front of the cameras, went begging like a coward cockroach to Cammany,

[02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:42.120]
pleading on vended knee for the release of the blood.

[02:57:42.940 --> 02:57:46.920]
Weirdly was that third great gangster movie brother rats starring Ronald Reagan.

[02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:54.400]
Well my friends you can rest easier tonight the rat is dead killer coward con man Ronald Reagan goodbye and good riddance.

[02:57:54.600 --> 02:58:00.480]
How do you like that? I like as a closing shot from Great Palais you can read it on Great Palais.com we got a link on our website.

[02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:04.680]
You know what else we ought to have a link to? I don't want to start getting air call kinds of work over there.

[02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:09.260]
How's there a coming with Josh on getting that stuff handed over to Josh so coming along pretty good?

[02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:14.980]
Well we probably ought to have a link to a Michael Moore.com when you think I don't think we got one on her.

[02:58:15.080 --> 02:58:19.540]
Do we? He's working on a link to the trailer as well to the trailer right.

[02:58:19.760 --> 02:58:22.040]
Just go to the right now. He's going to be in the trailer.

[02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:27.080]
Is she going to be out to sign autographs? I got a date with her so she bet. Yeah, she's your kind of slut.

[02:58:28.740 --> 02:58:30.640]
151 they all are. Yeah, I know.

[02:58:32.340 --> 02:58:34.660]
Well when you live in North Carolina you're going to be too picky.

[02:58:35.980 --> 02:58:41.300]
151 at 560 WQ I'm speaking to somebody who they all are. How about Jeff Cohen? He don't they too particular.

[02:58:41.880 --> 02:58:43.820]
In fact if there's anybody I don't want to go into that.

[02:58:44.560 --> 02:58:48.880]
Now what an only pizza lot in Davey man are still going strong. Now of course they had that other little mistake.

[02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:55.960]
I tried to tell me wouldn't listen to me but you know this guy. No BS coupons at the pizza lot like the other joints because pizza lot every Thursday

[02:58:55.960 --> 02:59:02.740]
are for the special where you buy one on three and the second was half price every Tuesday when you buy one I climbed into the second one is only five bucks again.

[02:59:03.040 --> 02:59:09.820]
No special coupon. They did it's just a regular deal and every Monday like today you buy one was on the dinner and the second one is only five bucks and guess what?

[02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:18.240]
No coupon necessary bring your own poop on but don't bring no coupon and the formula for success at the pizza lot is consistency and believe me speaking of

[02:59:18.240 --> 02:59:24.460]
the poop on well no microwave in fact it's the only restaurant in the that has no microwave up and everything is either break their

[02:59:24.460 --> 02:59:29.740]
soft taste. They cook it all fresh for you they give you gigantic portions the food is delicious every pasta dish under the

[02:59:29.740 --> 02:59:34.500]
sun the best garlic rules you ever had in your life all of these things and so much more almost 200 seats at the

[02:59:34.500 --> 02:59:39.440]
lofts in every way to the long lines Friday or Saturday night and they deliver the same full menu approximate delivery areas

[02:59:39.440 --> 02:59:43.900]
for Western flamingo road north to sunrise South of Pine Boulevard east of prestigious 441.

[02:59:43.900 --> 02:59:49.180]
So if you want to go out for lunch dinner late night snack this is always the place you can really enjoy us in a pizza lot

[02:59:49.180 --> 02:59:56.300]
plaza right beyond pure one imports beyond university drive between 595 here's that telephone number for catering for

[02:59:56.300 --> 03:00:05.460]
delivery for all of these things maybe for a hot date with Jeff Cohen 954 91688 that's 954 91688 still going strong

[03:00:05.460 --> 03:00:12.780]
after all these years the world famous pizza loft in Davy my life and look all this is for trail by city.

[03:00:12.980 --> 03:00:14.520]
We are in way.

[03:00:16.920 --> 03:00:21.120]
Program I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[03:00:25.340 --> 03:00:27.480]
Oh what's the problem officer?

[03:00:27.780 --> 03:00:28.640]
The floor from the vehicle.

[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:36.300]
If you're caught driving without a seatbelt you will be removed from your car and shot.

[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:41.740]
The police now have the authority to enforce seatbelt safety under the new Patriot Act 2.

[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:50.000]
The new laws in effect now so click it or be shot officers don't like doing this they are only following orders.

[03:00:50.180 --> 03:00:56.300]
It's for your own protection and the never ending fight against terrorism terrorist acts such as mouth noise.

[03:00:57.380 --> 03:01:05.560]
Purpose and fighting but be anoint you others so under Patriot Act 2 eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants.

[03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:10.340]
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot.

[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:12.760]
It's the law.

[03:01:13.500 --> 03:01:26.280]
We like saying that the law the law the law the law the law the law the law the law the law.

[03:01:31.060 --> 03:01:49.260]
I'm going to tell you a very disturbing story as a matter of fact yesterday I go in my little neighborhood 7-11 here.

[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:55.480]
If it's not Pakistanis it's a Chinese okay is very nice well I guess maybe not so nice.

[03:01:56.180 --> 03:02:02.760]
There's a family that runs the convenience store and I go in there get my sodas my newspapers and whatever nothing edible of course got for bit.

[03:02:03.420 --> 03:02:14.620]
But I go in there to get my newspapers and I put the newspapers on a counter the sun and the star and I put them on a counter and there of course was Reagan's picture was on a front cover.

[03:02:14.820 --> 03:02:21.360]
Reagan did 93 what have a headline said and the proprietor the Chinese guy looks at me and he said who I go in there all the time.

[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:25.800]
I mean they know me very well they love me because I spent a lot of money there. He looks at me says all right and they.

[03:02:26.880 --> 03:02:28.520]
I said yeah he died yesterday.

[03:02:29.300 --> 03:02:31.780]
Oh my goodness I'm so sorry I had gravy spent.

[03:02:33.460 --> 03:02:36.160]
And boy that was the wrong thing to say to me.

[03:02:36.700 --> 03:02:38.160]
Yeah got you golden did it.

[03:02:38.360 --> 03:02:41.800]
Not not a whole lot I wasn't in like a fist fight although I could have taken this guy.

[03:02:41.900 --> 03:02:47.100]
I'm limpia Chinese but but seriously I mean the wrong thing to say I mean I come in here and I spend all that money.

[03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:53.420]
Don't don't start talking politics with your customers okay that's my best suggestion for all you business people out there.

[03:02:53.760 --> 03:03:00.060]
Especially you laundry head the people are trying these people are convenience stores just take it a money and give it a tiki and then that's it.

[03:03:01.380 --> 03:03:08.060]
And I just proceeded to go on and I'm probably a little bit too long and he just looked at me like like oh jeez you still going to paper the paper.

[03:03:09.700 --> 03:03:13.440]
Yeah today yes maybe not tomorrow Mr. I can buy papers anywhere hey.

[03:03:14.020 --> 03:03:18.060]
Cut the crap although in his defense what is he know being Canadian and everything.

[03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:27.080]
In other words he never had to endure a Canadian may ask this guy just came off on a Chinese banana vote is probably got started.

[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:35.460]
Yeah since 1960 who do you think was our worst president that's our second poll best president we had Clinton wins by a landslide earlier today.

[03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:42.140]
This one is the worst Bush to George W. Form today vote 68.1% they hate him Carter 57.

[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:49.480]
Clinton 52 Reagan 21 would have been very disrespectful to have a higher number than that okay so just go easy on old Ronnie okay.

[03:03:50.700 --> 03:04:03.680]
On old jelly bean Nixon 17 L.V.J. 13 Bush won the Wimp Meister George Herbert Walker 12 JFK 10 and Jerry Ford who's going to be on Larry Keedomar and I'd be sure to miss that Jerry Ford had 9.

[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:04.720]
Bye bye bye.
