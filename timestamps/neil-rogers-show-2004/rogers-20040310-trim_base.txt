[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]
We are sports ready to fight, since we are a huge arena.

[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.500]
My alien Ford Lutter J.

[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.860]
I'm always broadcasting Morse code, I was at sound.

[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.780]
I'm the man!

[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.140]
The man!

[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.140]
F***!

[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.920]
Hey, we're searching.

[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.560]
Oh yeah, we're searching.

[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.940]
All up for the weapons of this corruption everyday.

[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.000]
Hey, hey, hey, we're gonna keep searching.

[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.340]
All up for the search and atmosphere.

[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.860]
Search and for the new car.

[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.940]
You know where, hey, hey, but I don't think we'll ever find them.

[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.120]
No.

[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.680]
They were in there in the first place.

[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.160]

[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.060]
No, no, no, no.

[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.380]
No, no, no, no.

[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.900]
Yeah, hey, no, no.

[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.320]
From house to house and under every hood.

[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.000]
You validate the spin of all those white house bugs.

[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.840]
If you still need convincing to me, why don't you see an end?

[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.740]
Oh no, no, no, no.

[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.320]
So lying from home.

[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.840]
Oh man, no, no.

[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.720]
But we're keeping on searching.

[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.240]
You know, searching.

[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.860]
Keep looking for proof of all the new things away.

[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.760]
Hey, hey, but you know they're gonna find them.

[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.860]
They never had them in their place.

[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.240]
10 out of 2 at 560 WM, happy Wednesday to you.

[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.820]
Big Marlon game next Tuesday by the way, market on your calendar, George.

[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.560]
Well, they're all big.

[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.580]
Another Marlonized Submission game next Tuesday at 110, which means 1255, it's bye-bye-bye.

[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.280]
Now, I don't want the audience to think that we planned, planned these early exits many days ahead.

[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.760]
If we look forward to those things.

[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.900]
It's almost like looking forward to vacation like Mark and the days off, like being on death row.

[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.700]
But we do.

[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.820]
I mean, why lie about it?

[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.680]
That's a nice thing.

[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.600]
I think three hours is plenty, more than enough.

[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.120]
In fact, there are people listening right now.

[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.600]
I think there are three minutes is more than enough.

[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.340]
Well, that's okay.

[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.000]
You're enjoying it in a very masochistic way.

[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.420]
Too bad.

[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.140]
South Florida TV host named Premiere of Haiti.

[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.820]
Did you know that?

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.400]
No, I didn't.

[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.020]
Well, here we go.

[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.060]
A former Haitian foreign minister and popular South Florida television talk show host was selected yesterday to become Haiti's next prime minister.

[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.980]
To which we say,

[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.740]
the

[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.400]
Laptop,

[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.460]
Laptop,

[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.280]
was that Laptopcher?

[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.920]
A critic of Exile President Jean-Barris Staud, our esteed was chosen after two days of painstaking

[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.020]
deliberations by the U.S.

[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.740]
back Council of Sages.

[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.240]
To fill the power vacuum created in February 29 when Ehrestead resigned.

[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.100]
Well, that's an interesting choice of words when he, uh, VAMMOOZED.

[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.580]
When he went off to Central Africa to seek his fortune.

[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.800]
Laptopcher 2 will lead a transitional government that will pave the way for presidential elections next year.

[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.880]
We can get some of those death squads back in charge again.

[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.140]
Okay?

[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.240]
They'll clean things up.

[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.980]
I'm very excited to be able to do something for my country to bring all Haitians together.

[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.920]
Laptopcher 2 said in a telephone interview with the Herald.

[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.960]
It's time for us to forget our differences and come together for the country in this biosentennial year.

[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.400]
You know how old he is?

[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.860]
I give up about 30.

[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.140]
60.

[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.400]

[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.360]
Well, I can't say 69.

[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.120]
No.

[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.380]
He's 60 something.

[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.300]
Okay, he's an old fart.

[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.400]
He's one year less than 70 years old.

[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.300]
Let's do it again.

[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.820]
He's a new headhandshow in Haiti.

[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.700]
1903 hosts on our point yesterday, which is pretty good considering we had an early exit with that Marlon's game to which we say, oh, let's do it again today.

[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.520]
Let's replay it.

[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.800]
Let's replay the Leafs 5 nothing went over the panthers from last night.

[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.260]
What do you say?

[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.800]
I.

[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.520]
Who should John Kerry pick for his running mate?

[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.540]
That was our poll question.

[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.660]
By the way, before we get into that, we got a real good one on the Beated Curtain today on our website.

[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.380]
Linda Blair.

[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.320]
Now, probably there are some guys out there saying, oh, Linda Blair, who wants to see her?

[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.900]
You know what?

[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.220]
I think when you see that picture.

[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.760]
That's the power of Christ who tells you to look at it again and again.

[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.840]
I don't know if it's straight me.

[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.900]
All that doesn't think she's hot.

[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.800]
Really?

[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.320]
Really?

[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.040]
I just asked all of them.

[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.180]
All of men at building?

[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.420]
Well, it took five minutes.

[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.760]
1903 vote on her.

[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.880]
Do you ask him off in clearance?

[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.900]
Who should John Kerry pick for his running mate?

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.520]
John Edwards 594.

[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.460]
Just dummy up if you know what's good for you.

[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.700]
Okay?

[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.220]
You know what?

[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.640]
You said it.

[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.040]
Yeah, and then you're starting to embellish it.

[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.500]
Just pretending you didn't hear what I said.

[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.300]
Pretend that you were Alzheimer's kicked in.

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.540]
What?

[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.080]
John Edwards 594 wins hands down 31%.

[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.740]
Bill Clinton 363 is legal.

[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.440]
He could do it.

[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.360]
It'll ever happen, but he could do it.

[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.100]
Bob Graham, 336, 17.6%.

[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.080]
That's not a bad idea.

[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.760]
I don't care.

[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.140]
I'm for Bush 187.

[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.820]
9.8% less than 10%.

[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.560]
What happened to that usual 1718% of bush rights that we have in this crowd?

[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.460]
Where'd they go?

[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.200]
Oh, later.

[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.180]
General Wesley Clark 112.

[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.260]
He was the late addition.

[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.180]
So we want to thank profusely, the gentleman had called in suggested that.

[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.040]
General Wes 112.

[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.000]
I don't care a period.

[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.120]
Just don't bother me with this crap 102.

[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.060]
Hillary 101.

[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.840]
Dick M.

[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.580]
Dick M. Heart 46.

[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.280]
Bill Richardson 34, the governor of New Mexico, a good Julio guy.

[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.600]
They figured he'd be real good to get the spitbook going.

[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.780]
Tom Broca 18 and Bill Nelson 10 out of over 1900 votes on yesterday's pool.

[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.420]
Pretty impressive if he asked me.

[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.640]
Well, very jackass has his thumb right on it right now as we speak.

[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.880]
Make no mistake about that.

[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.300]
Because Barry is tuned in the Greg Reed pipeline.

[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.200]
If you want to find out what's going on at QA and don't listen to us,

[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.540]
just read the Harold and the very jackass column.

[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.400]
Don't buy the Harold.

[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.580]
Just pick it up like the 711 and leave through it.

[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.180]
Just pick up the sports section, leave through it, read the column,

[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.800]
and then put it back together neatly or not if you don't want to and just to put it back on the stand.

[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.440]
Don't buy it.

[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.140]
Or when somebody else is buying one of them, Harold's out of the news box.

[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.200]
Just swipe one would be good.

[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.660]
Don't you think?

[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.620]
Sure, why not?

[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.860]
Or run over a speed bump.

[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.820]
I think that when you open up out of those Harold boxes where you buy your newspapers,

[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.880]
maybe take like several and hand them out as freebies because that's basically what it's worth.

[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.260]
But Barry Jackass says Hank Goldberg back on QA and now I don't want to pee on everybody's parade

[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.440]
because Dave Higgins a great guy.

[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.740]
I guess it was partly his idea and part the hump or anything like put this thing together yesterday.

[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.940]
I purposely tuned in after the Marlon game.

[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.540]
I nearly fell asleep because I heard Dave Ann boring for a minute.

[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.160]
But I tuned in after the Marlon's trounce to match.

[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.340]
What was the 9-3, Emily?

[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.080]
I don't know.

[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.080]

[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.620]
It was 9-1 when I heard it.

[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.200]
9-3.

[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.700]
Get it right.

[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.940]
Get it right.

[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.600]
Well, I don't blame you.

[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.600]
Anyway, after the Marlon game, I tuned in and then we hit like about how many minutes of spots?

[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.580]
I thought third man!

[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.860]
Good.

[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.420]
Golly miss Molly and they wonder why we don't have big numbers and we got good.

[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.880]
Oh God!

[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.460]
We had a break that went on from the ass end of the game till the very beginning of Hank showed.

[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.160]
It must have been at least 15 minutes.

[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.680]
I mean, I'm not exaggerating.

[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.480]
Just spot after spot after spot.

[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.560]
Nice going, SCRUAN!

[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.060]
You're sure it's peddling something?

[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.240]
Oh.

[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:37.140]
You know, it's a good thing we have some restrictions now because if in the old days like a couple of weeks ago,

[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.500]
who knows what I might have said right there?

[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.020]
But that bitch is peddling.

[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:45.940]
At any rate, so the hopper comes on and they got Dave Wonsted doing this Cornball thing like he's doing a show

[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.840]
and says we're going to talk about everything excepted all fins and then he was taking allegedly a call.

[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.360]
And of course the color turned out to be Hank.

[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:58.160]
The only problem being it was pretty obvious that it was Wonsted who was on the phone and Hank was doing wherever it was.

[00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.260]
The American Airlines Arena.

[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.280]
Who proceeded to interview Wonsted?

[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.900]
I mean Dave Wonsted, it's got the personality of a dead man, okay?

[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:11.060]
So the concept of the idea might have been fun if Wonsted had any personality and could have pulled it off.

[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.880]
Did he pull it off?

[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.060]
No.

[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.180]
It was just brutal.

[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.600]
But it's good to have the hopper back on here.

[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.340]
That's what counts.

[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.580]
Of course Barry Jackets says in an amusing skit, Dolphins coach Dave Wonsted, open Goldberg show.

[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.280]
It was about as amusing as a fart in a crowded elevator or in a hot July day.

[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.800]
Nothing amusing about it.

[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.480]
Goldberg said on the ear that he was glad to be back.

[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.360]
It was lonely without you while he said it was listeners.

[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.540]
I just want to put the whole thing behind me.

[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.580]
He's thinking about that big behind.

[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.120]
It was something that just got out of hand and shouldn't have.

[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.520]
WQM General manager Greg Reed met with Goldberg yesterday morning and said,

[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.260]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.480]
Everything was resolved.

[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.520]
So that's as much as he wants you to know because if he wanted to say more,

[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.960]
it would have been Barry's column because Barry is the mouthpiece for QAM, for Greg Reed.

[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.280]
Who doesn't speak to anybody who's over the age of 10?

[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.140]
That's why he speaks to Barry.

[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.320]
Stern won't be leaving infinity anytime soon.

[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.620]
Here's our poll question before we get to that.

[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.420]
Did we ever do this before?

[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.140]
I don't think so.

[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.340]
Maybe who cares?

[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:06.940]
No.

[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.060]
We did?

[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.140]
We might have.

[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.820]
Not I don't think this is exact one.

[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.920]
Not this wording, no.

[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:19.520]
Well, do I need to remind you that if we change one word, that's good enough for me.

[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.220]
One letter.

[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.920]
If you had tons of cash, what one city would you choose to live in?

[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.740]
Of course, there are some of us who live all over the place,

[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.640]
but as your home base, what would be the one city you choose anywhere in the world to live in if you were just loaded?

[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.460]
An unlimited amount of funds.

[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.420]
So we made a short list so far, Miami, Toronto, A.

[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.460]
Saudi, it's a beautiful day, man.

[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.880]
It could be five today, 41 degrees Fahrenheit.

[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.000]
It's beautyous.

[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.920]
New York, Amsterdam, Rome, or Honolulu.

[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.260]
You ever been to Honolulu?

[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.100]
No, but I would like to and I would like to have my base there since you mentioned that.

[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.280]
I've been there six times and I'm going to tell you it's one of the most beautiful places.

[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.080]
Why could he be to them in the North Shore?

[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.760]
It's just all fabulous.

[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.900]
I've never been there before.

[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.280]
Besides, oh, wow.

[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.100]
But yeah, why could he is really something else?

[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.880]
Very commercial, very crowded, but then you have to have a lot of money.

[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.560]
I mean, the big box to live there, but it is beautiful.

[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.200]
And the Pacific Ocean is much cleaner.

[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.780]
It's just amazing.

[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.200]
I've seen pictures of the winter.

[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.240]
Cleaner and warmer and the trade winds, even though it's like 86, 87 in the summertime.

[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.480]
It never feels warm because the trade winds are always blowing.

[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.840]
Can I say that?

[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.680]
Oh, sorry.

[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.660]
The trade winds are always moving the ear around.

[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.740]
I don't figure out if it's because I have tons of money.

[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.320]
I can take my yacht to New Zealand, Australia, Japan.

[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:33.600]
Right.

[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.240]
But that could be your home base, Honolulu, which is a great place.

[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.680]
Trust me when I tell you.

[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.580]
Stern won't be leaving infinity anytime soon.

[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.560]
A high level, this is from Radio Business Report.

[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.920]
A high level source that infinity tells us that as much as Howard Stern believes he's going to be pulled off a show,

[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.060]
it won't be happening any time in the near future.

[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.440]
And in addition, infinity will be defending him.

[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.660]
He's not going to satellite.

[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.240]
First of all, he can't.

[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.000]
He's under contract with us for two more years.

[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.680]
So I mean, it's not even an issue.

[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.400]
And we're going to defend them, says their insider.

[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.820]
It also turns out that we're not the only ones hearing the FCC of a cracking down on satellite radio indecency as well.

[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.420]
Oh, brother, what did I tell you?

[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.880]
Continue the infinity source.

[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.540]
And you know what?

[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.160]
The FCC will probably wind up with the satellite guys when this is all said and done.

[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.580]
If there's any change in rules, they're probably going to be regulated under our rules.

[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:27.220]
So if anybody thinks that we can put some of these shows on satellite radio and start doing the old stuff we were doing like two weeks ago, forget about it.

[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.900]
Ain't going to happen.

[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.600]
And they go on to observe.

[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.740]
It says good infinity plants to stand behind Howard no matter what the FCC finds to find Stern.

[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.680]
It will pale in comparison to the money he's made and continues to make for the five-com unit.

[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.800]
When Howard realizes infinity is going to stand behind him after all, he likely focuses Randy Moore on the FCC.

[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.420]
Bush and right wingers and less on traditional radio.

[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:54.480]
Stern said in a show yesterday hopes the show gets pulled so he'd be free to travel around the country with anti-Bush and anti-right wing voting rally.

[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.720]
Said Stern, the source of the FCC tells me that Michael Powell is freaking out right now.

[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.500]
He realizes he still has to find me.

[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.920]
But he knows that I'll cook back for him and the Republicans.

[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.500]
So Stern should have no beef with infinity for or anyone for that matter.

[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.400]
He needed the publicity.

[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:13.480]
He could not have set himself up as the suffer fan king of radio, even if he dressed in drag and gave chairman Powell a dozen roses.

[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:19.900]
We've said it before Zen master Carmeson's first call was probably to clear channel, thanking him for pulling Stern off the air.

[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.360]
Yadi, Yadi, Yadi.

[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.080]
Not at any rate.

[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.360]
So he ain't going anywhere except the question South Florida is he coming back now.

[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.700]
10th, 13th at 560 WDQM.

[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.000]
You go back to Canada, you cute bastard.

[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.380]
I'm sorry.

[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.340]
Well Disney just turned down and offered to sell off their theme parks.

[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.020]
Michael, I was there didn't have to deal with all his green marks.

[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.340]
He sold all the stockholders a Comcast price was low.

[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.680]
Wish the flow ran over him and set up for Pluto.

[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:05.500]
If Disney makes a deal with Comcast at the courtroom table, we'll see Mary Poppins round the clock on late night table.

[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:12.880]
It was it all that long ago and Michael was admired, but if I there was a knee apprentice Trump would say you're fired.

[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.460]
Turning down the offer makes eyes look like a nimrod.

[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.220]
It would be as big as the deal the gangster with a rod.

[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.500]
I could use a bump in my Disney park, all the y'all.

[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.620]
Devot ends with run like the nose of a Tokyo.

[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.160]
The denial forers on the obscene and egregious.

[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.720]
How long can you last when you're depending on four regions?

[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.160]
Eyes that flew his chances to feel like that's some rehearsal.

[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.020]
Maybe he could go cross down his screw of you to rehearsal.

[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.780]
1019 at 560 WQA and we got the mad dog at two.

[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.120]
We got the hunter back on the air and I score a hundred from 4 to 650.

[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.040]
That was right.

[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.760]
It gets 10 minutes off for a good behavior because at 650 we had another Marlon game.

[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.240]
Marlon's on deck at 650.

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.140]
Dodgers at the Marlon's in Jupiter 705 followed by 80K.

[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:10.360]
Now here's the facts from Rick that says the biggest joke of all time was the last.

[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.280]
I can't read this.

[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.320]
The latest, the last night on channel four.

[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.540]
Al sunshine.

[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.460]
What does that say before Al sunshine?

[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.800]
Talk about how overeating is a cow.

[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.960]
That would be like me giving you a lecture about how you're too fat.

[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.300]
About how you're too fat.

[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.040]
Oh yeah, we got that story.

[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.720]
I mean it's just the salad.

[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.300]
The salad McDonald's got more fat than the cheeseburger.

[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.500]
I'll take the cheeseburger thank you with no bun.

[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.380]
Here's Al sunshine.

[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.200]
I've given a lecturing the audience and waving his handharts, his big fat hammocks.

[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.360]
America's too fat and fat is killing us.

[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:53.900]
Yeah, right.

[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.060]
You shove a crap, you foamy baloney.

[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.640]
Can't stand that Al sunshine.

[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.540]
Makes me want to crap.

[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.600]
All I've got to do is think about them.

[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.720]
WQA, hello.

[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.300]
Hey, no, I want to add a pound to your bowl.

[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.500]
How about a pamper?

[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:07.540]
That's pamper.

[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.080]
Stop.

[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.300]
Come Sweden says, David, a Swedish cop.

[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.480]
Stockholm.

[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.320]
Now it's funny because I was looking at Linda Blair picture again.

[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.920]
I never realized that she was so well.

[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.360]
She's in doubt.

[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.380]
In doubt.

[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.860]
She's part of the endowment for the party.

[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.020]
First thing forth with the cow.

[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.320]
I wonder if the spirit of Christ had anything to do with that because he waived that magic one and all of a sudden man.

[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.200]
Wow, speaking of Linda Blair.

[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.040]
Yes, I'd like to say that it's my favorite new thing on the website today, but it's not.

[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.960]
Oh, you want to talk about dancing Bush?

[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:44.520]
Certainly.

[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.900]
We've got El Presidente, the dancing bush, my steer.

[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.900]
It's a beautiful thing.

[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.960]
You can have fun for hours with that, baby.

[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.260]
And the best part of it is you can like create your own ambiance there.

[00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:00.020]
Just crank up the music and you have the disco lights or just the regular four lights.

[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.380]
It's a little disappointed.

[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.980]
They don't have a rave club option.

[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.040]
Yeah, well, let's come the next week, I think.

[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.660]
They're just raving about the dancing bush as he dances his way right out of the White House right out there down Pennsylvania.

[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.240]
I have an inevitable to be seen again right back to Crawford, Texas with his 10 gallon hat.

[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.020]
Bye bye, Bush.

[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.300]
My butt.

[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.300]
And the pacifier will appear on his mouth.

[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:17.500]
Let's see.

[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.100]
What do we got so far here on the list?

[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.700]
Honolulu 16.

[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.660]
Good choice, George.

[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.360]
New York 15.

[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.500]
Miami 5.

[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.560]
Amsterdam 4.

[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.320]
Toronto 3.

[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.080]
I voted for Toronto.

[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.760]
I love it here.

[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.840]
Rome 2.

[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.980]
And Stockholm 0 out of 45.

[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.100]
But we're just getting this list going.

[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.740]
Now I got some very little teeny tiny bit of good news.

[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.560]
Nothing too exciting.

[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.360]
Remember I told you about how spineless the radio industry is?

[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.040]
Yeah, it is.

[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.020]
But KCJJ Iowa City, Iowa.

[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.540]
And expanded band A.M. Station.

[00:16:48.780 --> 00:17:02.080]
In other words, it's like a 1900 mile something like that owned by Steve Bridges will preempt its talk and hot AC programming mix from 5 a.m.

[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.560]
And it's like a

[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:11.860]
New York Times.

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.860]

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.860]

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.860]

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.860]

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.860]

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.860]

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.860]

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.860]

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.860]

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:11.880]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:11.960]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.240]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.300]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.020]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.040]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:17.660]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.780]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.760]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:20.960]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.780]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.800]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.540]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.880]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:41.180]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:41.180]

[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:41.740]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.800]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.760]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.780]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.540]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:45.560]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:45.860]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.500]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:46.780]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.280]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:47.700]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.360]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.280]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.340]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.400]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.960]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.100]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:55.340]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:55.900]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.460]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.020]
It's like a new year.

[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.860]
It's like a new year.

[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.260]
The current climate attack in the fundamental principles of free speech and choice is not acceptable.

[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.240]
And we want you to write to the FCC and set them telegrams and letters.

[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.560]

[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.680]
Hello, Neil.

[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:04.700]

[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.840]
Could you please put NASA or Bahamas on that...

[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.840]
No, part of it is not in Bahamas on that list, please.

[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.080]
NASA or Bahamas.

[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.060]
Okay, you got it, Ron.

[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:14.840]
Yeah, right.

[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:15.260]
Okay.

[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.460]
Have a good time there, because I sure ain't going there.

[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.440]
NASA or Bahamas.

[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:20.860]
Oh, you've vey.

[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.480]
Well, I guess if you're one of those people, you know,

[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.400]
if you're an American and you go there, they'll treat you like crap

[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.780]
and just bleed every dime you got out of your pocket.

[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.700]
They'll squeeze it out of you.

[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.160]
WQA, hello.

[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.700]
They both Florida.

[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.660]
All right, put it on there.

[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.000]
I think that guy might have been serious.

[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.520]
That was one of the beesleaves, I think.

[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.880]
You could tell by the sound of his finger deep inside that right nostril, couldn't you tell?

[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:42.580]
Yeah.

[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.300]
Here's the fact from Ray, one of our regular factors who says,

[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.220]
I've been down here since 1988 from Chicago.

[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.440]
My previous radio god was Larry Lujack.

[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.600]
An excellent choice to rate Larry Lujack,

[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.160]
which too bad we can't play those bits anymore,

[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.160]
especially the one about the squad, you know?

[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.160]
Oh, it's too bad.

[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.000]
What is that under?

[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.280]
Your uncle, Larry, and little Tommy.

[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.420]
Oh, no, we can't play that well.

[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:04.560]
Yep.

[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.020]
And anyway, it says,

[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.080]
but toward the end of his career, one could tell he was tired

[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.160]
and his time on the airwaves was about to end.

[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.800]
You, on the other hand, have never been sharper.

[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.200]
And you're, what a, what's suction coming from this page, Ray?

[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.160]
And your program is very useful as a forum

[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.980]
for thought-provoking ideas, questions and answers.

[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.320]
It makes me think and research what the hell is going on.

[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.900]
I guess I've turned into a news junkie.

[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.420]
We're a little bit too newsy, I think.

[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.340]
Reading papers around the world to get the real perspective

[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.580]
on what the hell is going on here.

[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.480]
It's tough to take things that face value no more.

[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.800]
People seem to think that repression of freedoms

[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.880]
is a good thing if it happens to somebody else,

[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.020]
not realizing that they will be next.

[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.520]
I told my kids to read Animal Farm in 1984

[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.440]
to get an idea of what's happening around them.

[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.920]
Ray, nice going to Ray.

[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:45.900]
Keep it up, sweetheart.

[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.160]
We need more people like you.

[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.580]
Care about things that really matter as opposed to Kaka.

[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.160]
Oh, by the way, I'll tell you something that matters.

[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.560]
Lee Boyd Malvo is going to get zed today.

[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.300]
Just sod.

[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.760]
And the reason why this is even more significant

[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.920]
than John Muhammad who got the death penalty yesterday

[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.520]
is because this, of course, the bleeding hearts

[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.840]
have all been out of shape about, you know,

[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.500]
minors and the death penalty and how this is going to set a bad example.

[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.860]
And they just had kindle coffee on there from CNN

[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.700]
drinking his coffee.

[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:12.940]
And, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.560]
You know, he's going to be the poster child for...

[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:15.760]
I'm sorry.

[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.360]
Are you liberal?

[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.280]
Bleeding heart liberals.

[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.480]
There's much of a liberal as I am.

[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.880]
This is one issue where I separate with you.

[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.500]
The crime has got to fit the punishment

[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.100]
and it's got to fit the society in which it takes place.

[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.100]
And since you're dealing with a barbaric violence society

[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.320]
where life is as cheap as pez,

[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.780]
I think that somebody needs to send a message.

[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.560]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.500]
Like Joey Sazza needs to send a message.

[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.380]
What are you talking about?

[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.280]
Oh, look at this Malvo formally sends to life

[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.400]
in prison no parole, Danny.

[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.020]
He said that he and Mr. Malvo had read all the victim impact statements

[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.200]
and that they were very mindful of the pain of the families

[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.200]
in this case.

[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.100]
He said from our perspective, we see this as an additional tragedy.

[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.680]
Lee knows he has much to face and much...

[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.700]
Also find $100,000 in each of the two counts.

[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.640]
I'm sure he's going to be paying that real soon.

[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.320]
Then Robert Haran spoke.

[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.120]
He is the prosecutor in this case.

[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.680]
He noted that the jury had found aggravating factors

[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.700]
in the case of Lee Malvo, that they had found that he posed future dangerousness.

[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.500]
Life in prison no parole, but the good news is he may be tried

[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.040]
on other sniper shootings.

[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.280]
See, this was just one...

[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:16.500]
Right.

[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.980]
So they might try him again for other other sniper shootings.

[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.180]
Maybe in after a few more convictions they might say,

[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.180]
Finally...

[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.720]
We are supposed to be on 516.

[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.060]
We took a hell of a man to take my hand, but it shouldn't take him long.

[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.300]
I like that, yeah.

[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.560]
She ain't much to see, but she looks good through the bottom of a glass.

[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.340]
Oh, yeah, I heard that one.

[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.460]
That's a good one.

[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.180]
I wouldn't take you to a dogfight, even if I thought you could win.

[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.840]
Don't cry down my back, baby.

[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.400]
You might rust my spurs.

[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.260]
If fingerprints showed up on skin, I wonder who's I'd find on you.

[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.840]
Here's a good one.

[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.980]
If you get the feeling that I don't love you, feel again.

[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.340]
Here's one.

[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:26.180]
Obviously, there's some guy singing this song, and he's in some cheap fluzey's bedroom at the time.

[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.720]
I'm ashamed to be here, but not ashamed enough to leave.

[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.440]
That kind of sums up our situation here at WLS too.

[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.800]
I'm ashamed to be here, but not ashamed enough to leave.

[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.740]
We'll just take the money.

[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.260]
Thank you.

[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.620]
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart.

[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.340]
Oh, I want to hear it.

[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.520]
You really wonder about guys who write lyrics like this.

[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.280]
You know how much drinking they've been doing.

[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.280]
It's the bottle against the Bible and the battle for daddy's soul.

[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.440]
Here's what I really like.

[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.240]
It's commode hug and time in the valley.

[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:42.540]
If you want to keep the beer real cold, put it next to my ex-wife's heart.

[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.760]
My wife ran off with my best friend and I miss him.

[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.660]
26-11 at 560 WQM, good old Larry Lujek.

[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.320]
Boy, he was sure good how many years ago.

[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.280]
3rd man.

[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:00.840]
He was great.

[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.200]
Anyway, somebody suggests as the city if they were loaded with cash that they would live in.

[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.280]
And Dorolavaia.

[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.300]
Give me her that.

[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:07.840]
Sure.

[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:08.700]
You did?

[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.860]
It's right there in Spain and France on the board.

[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.100]
It's the world's smallest country.

[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.300]
That's the only reason I know about it.

[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:15.760]
Right.

[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.100]
You really had heard about it before this Spanish?

[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.020]
Yes, I was a little kid.

[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.100]
What's the world's smallest country?

[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.220]
And Dorolavaia.

[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.840]
It's as I know never heard of it while I didn't.

[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:28.560]
It's a city that's part of the small Pyrenees Mountain country of Andorra situated on the French Spanish border north of Barthalena.

[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.180]
I visited Andorra frequently on business invocation.

[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.220]
Just a beautiful place.

[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:32.740]
No taxes.

[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.620]
Great banking laws.

[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:34.820]
International connections.

[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.620]
Beautiful geography.

[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.460]
Friendly people.

[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.800]
Fantastic restaurants.

[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.400]
Shopping outdoor activity and culture.

[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.040]
And there's even a website they got here to check it out for more.

[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.660]
Population about 65,000 in the entire country.

[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.540]
No airport access.

[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.060]
But rail system connecting the major nearby airports.

[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.540]
Multigale, lingual and cultural.

[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.120]
Spanish, French, English, Catalan.

[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.060]
PS don't tell anybody about it.

[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.080]
That would spoil it for me or you.

[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.220]
And Dorolavaia.

[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.240]
And somebody also says Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.680]
That's a beautiful place.

[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.120]
You ever been there?

[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:02.820]
No.

[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.820]
Well, I would suggest you, Michael, there.

[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:05.820]
One day.

[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.520]
Don't get lost though in the mountains on your drive to California.

[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.820]
I have a GPS.

[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.640]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.320]
Count 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.820]
They're using GPS as I was reading this morning on Yahoo,

[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.180]
which it's not worth talking about it on here in Holland now.

[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:21.560]
An Amsterdam.

[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.740]
They're using GPS systems to track stolen bicycles.

[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.600]
Good.

[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.920]
The executive idea of a lot of bikers there.

[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:30.560]
I'll tell you that.

[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.900]
A lot of biker bars too.

[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.100]
111 votes on a poll so far.

[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.720]
If you had tons of cash, what one city would you choose to live in?

[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.040]
Honolulu 37.

[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.740]
New York 25.

[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:40.900]
Miami 17.

[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.540]
And of course, when we say Miami, we mean South Florida, you know.

[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.120]
It could be Florida.

[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.280]
It could be Sweetwater.

[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.320]
It could be Pemberpodge.

[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.600]
It could be Sunrise.

[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:48.500]
Overtown.

[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.180]
Liberty City.

[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.220]
Opalaka.

[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.300]
Miami 17.

[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.100]
Toronto 12.

[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.700]
Amsterdam 9.

[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.520]
Rolema 6.

[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.380]
Rolema.

[00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.160]
Oh, I love Rolema.

[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.380]
Stockholm 3.

[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.020]
Naples 2.

[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.120]
And NASA out of Bahamas.

[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.940]
Hey, if we're going to put it on here for you, mind you better vote for it.

[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.060]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.960]
Yeah, we're going to put it on the poll.

[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.180]
You better have...

[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:09.580]
Bonnie!

[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.640]
Yeah, go...

[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.440]
Go to the ocean theater or something.

[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.220]
How was that?

[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.820]
Fred, I think.

[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.440]
WQM, hello.

[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.140]
Hey, Neil, how's it going?

[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:20.820]
Pretty good?

[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.700]
Two things.

[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.280]
One, if I could afford it, I'd like to live on Dunn's River in Jamaica.

[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.140]
It's your makeup on, okay?

[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.820]
And second, as far as everything that's going on in the world with our freedoms and everything,

[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:39.240]
I do two important aspects, fascism.

[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:45.940]
But on the big picture, and I'm no conspirator, I can't even talk to you.

[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:46.760]
That's okay.

[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.000]
I think this is all headed for a one-world government.

[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:56.300]
I think that's why we're trying to take a rock because we want to get a stronghold over on that side of the world.

[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.460]
And not now, but sometimes I think it's in the next 300 years.

[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.220]
It's all going to be one big government.

[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.540]
Let's take over the whole damn world.

[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.560]
There you go.

[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.740]
And the big business is because you're going to have a few businesses, one government, one party.

[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.980]
There's only going to be 10 businesses and one government.

[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.160]
I think you got your thumb on it, and thank God we won't be here.

[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.360]
All right, he's so good to hear you, my five.

[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.060]
Good luck to you, Palli.

[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:17.980]
Thank you.

[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.260]
Yeah, we won't be here.

[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.780]
Except, of course, for your real healthy people, it'll be living at 5,600.

[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.160]
I think 90's old enough.

[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.760]
Senators move forward on tougher and decency standards.

[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.200]
This is just makes me, makes my balls twitch.

[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:40.300]
A Senate panel yesterday paved the way for a broad crackdown on offensive radio and television programming, including extending stiff fines to artists,

[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:49.740]
limiting violence and temporarily preventing broadcasters from owning more stations until, at least that's a good part, until potential links between media consolidation and indecency on airwaves can be studied.

[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.580]
See, they're doing that for the wrong reason.

[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.120]
It's not the link between indecency and consolidation.

[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.220]
That's not the problem.

[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.600]
The problem is consolidation and having no choices.

[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.500]
That's the problem.

[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:07.840]
Creating monopolies, destroying the business for those people inside of it, outside of it, and in on top of it.

[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.080]
That's the problem.

[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.760]
But don't confuse the Senate with that.

[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:17.600]
The series of votes by the Senate Commerce Committee could sharply raise the stakes for the entertainment industry.

[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.300]
In the wake of the big Janet and the Justin Flank.

[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:29.180]
The incident sparked swift condemnation and investigations by the FCC, and the bills are rapidly advancing in both the House and Senate, of course.

[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.080]
It also has how fast they move on something like this.

[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.560]
Anything important, man, the budget, I mean, you name it, education.

[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.260]
They argue when they drag their feet and they are dilly, dally, and dick around.

[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.560]
But not here.

[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.140]
They're moving like lightning, like grease, like the Tampa Bay lightning.

[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.780]
In both the House and Senate to strengthen the FCC's hand is the overseer of broadcast licenses.

[00:29:53.260 --> 00:30:06.240]
Following the lead of the House Energy and Commerce Committee earlier this month, the Senate panel approved increasing potential fines for indecency 10 fold from the current $27,500 to a maximum of $275,000 for first time offense by broadcast.

[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:12.520]
The fines can then escalate to $375 grand for a second violation and $500,000 for further incidents.

[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:17.660]
Go with limit of $3 million in any 24-hour period, and that's good.

[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:27.760]
But the Senate panel added several new provisions that pushed well past the House Bill, setting up potentially contentious negotiations between the two bodies.

[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:38.960]
Under provisions passed by the panel, the FCC can double fines for indecent obscene or profane languages or images when the offending program was scripted or planned in advance,

[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.780]
or if the audience was unusually large, such as for national or international sporting or awards event.

[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.920]
That's kind of a hypocritical, it sounds like, to me, because on the one hand, the FCC says,

[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.220]
oh, even if you're number one with a 90-share, that doesn't get you off the hook.

[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.940]
But if we're going to punish you and you've got a big audience, then it just gives us an excuse to stick it to even more.

[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:56.560]
You see what I'm saying?

[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:57.760]
Pala crap.

[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.600]
That would encompass entertainment award shows during which artists have uttered exploatives.

[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:09.200]
The bill approved by the panel also would give the FCC the ability to impose the same fines on artists as it can impose on broadcasters,

[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.560]
if the only-year talent willfully use indecent or profane language or images when they knew it would be broadcas.

[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:20.380]
And the bill would direct the FCC to develop rules for controlling violent program during hours when children likely to be tuned in and hold your breath for that.

[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.960]
I am your wife and your old!

[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.740]
I'm the same age as you!

[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.860]
No, you're old!

[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.620]
Uh-huh, I'm having a heart attack!

[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.360]
The doctor's recommended you to take a break.

[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.360]

[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.360]

[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.360]

[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.360]

[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.360]

[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.360]

[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.360]

[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.820]
You can join yourself to the freaking hospital!

[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.060]
Just your heart to bear!

[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.340]
1045 at 560, so anyway, the people at Radio Business report shame on you.

[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.980]
So, good thing I just continued perusing the rest of the story from Washington Post about the Senate Commerce Committee.

[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:10.400]
Yeah?

[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.400]
You want to know why?

[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:11.680]
Why?

[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.560]
See, this is what the media does.

[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.660]
Even the prestigious or at least used to be prestigious Washington Post.

[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:23.640]
And this story about the Indecency Standards and what the Senate Commerce Committee did yesterday in the very last paragraph, which I hadn't even read yet.

[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.700]
You know, why you moist your time with the last paragraph, right?

[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:26.580]
Sure.

[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.220]
What?

[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:36.560]
It says by a narrow 12-to-11 vote, the Committee defeated a provision that would have extended the FCC oversight provisions of Indecency and Violence to cable and satellite programming,

[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.420]
except for pay-per-view channels such as HB-

[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:39.660]
Oh!

[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.640]
I'm going to read that again.

[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.240]
Could you?

[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:50.300]
See, in the meantime, Radio Business report is, according to their so obsessed with their source-in-side infinity, about, well, how are can't go on satellite?

[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:55.900]
Because first of all, you've got two years left on this contract, and secondly, the FCC is going to regulate the satellite radio coin to our rules.

[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:56.520]
Well, guess what?

[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:56.980]
No!

[00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.380]
Came damn close, though.

[00:32:59.400 --> 00:32:59.960]
It's pretty scary.

[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.000]
Almost as scary as that grotesque hit by Todd Bertuzzi on the Steve Moore.

[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.540]
Todd Bertuzzi, kick him out of the game.

[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.600]
You're pretty upset about that, aren't you?

[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.040]
Todd Bertuzzi's in Toronto today, as a matter of fact, they're holding a hearing.

[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.820]
Out of that tie, don't we have a few swings at him, or maybe Donald Brashear at any rate.

[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:25.600]
By a narrow 12-to-11 vote, the Committee defeated a provision that would have extended the FCC oversight provisions of Indecency and Violence to cable and satellite programming, except for pay-per-view channels such as HB-

[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:25.820]
Oh!

[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.740]
So that's good. That's at least one little bit good news, at least for the time being.

[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.780]
But look at that 12-to-11 vote. Look how close they came.

[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.480]
Is that incredible?

[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.020]
Incredible.

[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:42.060]
So in other words, I think there's some of the channels that they have other than pay-per-view on cable.

[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.680]
That they have, that they use all kinds of language.

[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.580]
They're saying pay-per-view, but HBO is like premium channels.

[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.040]
I think that's what they mean by that.

[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:52.680]
Yeah.

[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.680]
Pay-per-view is those like the Tyson fights and all those.

[00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:00.440]
Well, no, but in other words, you have to pay extra as what they're trying to say.

[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.380]
Whatever you wanted to find out.

[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.180]
How about some that are part of the basic package?

[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:10.080]
MTV, VH1, the Food Network, the Freaking Food Network.

[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.220]
If they would have regulated the Food Network, could Emerald have said,

[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:18.580]
BAM, no more Armady Central where they did say the S word on South Park.

[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.400]
Oh, no.

[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.920]
Comedy Central? You have to be kidding.

[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.000]
Oh, Jesus, are you fucking carrying me?

[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:27.400]
Wow.

[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.300]
That is scary.

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.840]
But anyway, that lost.

[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.040]
5667-0560, let's get a whole bunch more names for our poll here so that it has some meat to it.

[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.340]
Pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.180]
WDQA, hello.

[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.480]
How are you?

[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.360]
Yes.

[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.660]
You know, I know that after I hang up George, he's going to have bad things to say about me.

[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.380]
But I'll tell you what.

[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:49.700]
Okay, good.

[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.360]
Then I'll just hang up on you first.

[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.160]
5667-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon.

[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.880]
When you start a call like that, it's a death wish, right?

[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.320]
It's one of those regular chronics that wants to rip you and ask,

[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.460]
which quite frankly gets really boring after a while.

[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.700]
If you don't like George, don't listen to him.

[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.360]
You know, hate him like poison, get a voodoo doll, do whatever you like.

[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:12.860]
But when you start a call like that, it's like you have nothing to say, basically.

[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.720]
If you had tons of cash, what one city in the world would you choose to live in?

[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.280]
What would be your home base?

[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:26.160]
Honolulu 51, a beautiful place, Magnifico, New York 31, New York.

[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:32.440]
Miami 25, Toronto 15, Amsterdam 12, Rome, at Toronto 17, like I said.

[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:38.440]
Amsterdam 12, Rome 10, Naples 7, at Naples, Florida, which I find most amusing.

[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.320]
Although certainly nobody would voluntarily live in Naples, Italy, would they?

[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.780]
Not from what I'm here, and I never been there, and I'm not going.

[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.320]
I hear it's nothing but shluppers and really nasty.

[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.780]
Stockholm 5, see, let me ask you one thing.

[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.140]
One for NASA, one for Andorra, La Vea, and one for Jamaica.

[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.460]
Stockholm is so far north, you know, the Scandinavian countries.

[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.220]
Now generally, like in Amsterdam, the people are very pasty, very white,

[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.320]
complex, like the Brits and the Irish and the Scottish.

[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:06.920]
Right.

[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.420]
And all those are the very silly people on the British islands.

[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.180]
Very pasty, complex, because they never get into a sunshine.

[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.820]
Except for those rosy red cheeks.

[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:20.300]
But, like in Denmark and in Helsinki, Finland and in Stockholm,

[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.660]
the people aren't complex like that.

[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.460]
They're just beautiful people.

[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.400]
They have magnificent skin colouring, and while you've seen all the Swedish models, of course.

[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:29.700]
Sure.

[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.300]
And I'm not just talking about makeup.

[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.160]
I'm just talking their natural flesh colour.

[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.420]
I do a fin too, and she was pasty.

[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.820]
A pasty fin?

[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:38.300]
Yeah.

[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.740]
WQAM, hello.

[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:40.800]
Hello.

[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:41.720]
Hello.

[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:42.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.640]
Body, gold, hock.

[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:45.880]
WQAM, hello.

[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.540]
Yes, Las Vegas.

[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.460]
Las Vegas, okay.

[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.600]
Nice place to visit, but this guy wants to live there.

[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.260]
We'll put it on there.

[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:52.660]
We'll hum you.

[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.180]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18.

[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.760]
Now, do you say a fin wearing pasties?

[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.720]
I don't think you can f***ing say that in the mole.

[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.940]
Better check with the muffmeister, okay?

[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.900]
For us, see if it's any less.

[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.500]
Nothing more, either.

[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.260]
So, stop it.

[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:08.820]
WQAM, hello.

[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.260]
Hey, how you doing today?

[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:11.900]

[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:12.520]
All right.

[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.580]
Well, just calling to add to the poll and say some nice things to you.

[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.180]
125, I'd love to live St. John's Virgin Islands.

[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.000]
Virgin Islands.

[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:23.840]
You ever been there?

[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:24.500]
No.

[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.800]
Let me tell you something, it's feet.

[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.680]
I have all the places in the Caribbean.

[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.800]
St. John's, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.

[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.520]
How many white people live in St. Thomas?

[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.520]
F***ing man!

[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.640]
There's actually a few.

[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.060]
There's a lot of Americans who are, I mean, it's an American nation.

[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.640]
But there's actually a lot of white people.

[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.760]
A lot of nice people in general.

[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.160]
A lot of the pot George too.

[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:44.960]
All right.

[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.040]
Yeah, so let me answer that one.

[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:47.880]
It's absolutely great.

[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:48.880]
Okay, another thing.

[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.480]
I just wanted to mention.

[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.040]
Oh, yeah, I happen to be a pan that's poor here.

[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:54.800]
Pretty rare, huh?

[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:56.760]
Yeah, it's weird.

[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:57.600]
It's very weird.

[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.060]
Yeah, George was that f***ing...

[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:00.820]
Hello?

[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:01.800]
Go ahead.

[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:02.940]
Your phone's scrapping out.

[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:08.300]
One thing I want to add, amongst all the wonderful things I love that you provide on this program,

[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.460]
is whenever you clear...

[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.460]
Oh, hello?

[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.200]
Yeah.

[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.020]
When you clear your throat on the air, I just love it.

[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:15.200]
Yeah.

[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:15.620]
The...

[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.820]
I love that you don't mute it or you don't cover your mouth.

[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.500]
You just hawk up along right on the air.

[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.220]
Right, that's right.

[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.180]
It's fantastic.

[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.840]
Well, they haven't banned it yet.

[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.120]
Well, wait for the new invite for the new regulations to come on.

[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:26.940]
Have a great life, Pallee.

[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:27.780]
Keep it going, Neil.

[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.520]
Put scenes.

[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:29.600]
Put scenes.

[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:30.300]
Do we?

[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.320]
Oh, let's see.

[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:34.820]
Here's the fact.

[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.320]
Is this please put fan for Francisco on your pole, okay?

[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.260]
I don't like it there, but this particular person does.

[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.780]
I can't stand fan for Francisco.

[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.860]
It's windy and cold and nasty and too many of those clones running around here.

[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.360]
I mean, they all have that same fruity moustache.

[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:49.860]
You would look...

[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.760]
I mean, more power to them.

[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.660]
You know, power to the people.

[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.040]
You know, I don't like it there.

[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.160]
P.S. yesterday, I voted with my heart when I voted for Cousinich.

[00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:00.800]
In November, I'll vote with my head for Kerry when we say Adios, once and for all, to W.

[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:01.940]
Nice job.

[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.180]
I got the numbers here, which I will get to them.

[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.100]
I don't want to spend much time on it because nobody showed up.

[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:13.320]
Anyway, about 17% in Brown and Palm Beach, only 13% showed up to bother to vote in Dave County.

[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.300]
You want to know why that is?

[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:14.940]
Why is that?

[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.920]
There are two busy practicing calling this show going, Maricone!

[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.180]
Look at her own!

[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.320]
That's their thing, you know?

[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.680]
Plus, I'll tell you one thing I would have brought them to the polls.

[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.540]
If that person would have been on the ballot yesterday?

[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.340]
But wasn't...

[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.740]
I'll give you 500 guesses.

[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.920]
I am serious, losing. I am dead now.

[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.460]
If Cedia would have been on there, Dave County would have been...

[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.760]
...the most massive number of show-in-off.

[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.280]
The really three numbers, too.

[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.980]
Right in Cedia Cruz next time, you have an election that you don't want to go to.

[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.820]
13% voted to not in Dave.

[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.060]
Now let's see how did the Kerry had 80.6% in Dave County?

[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:55.280]
Edward 6.3, Sharpton 4.3, Howard Dean 2.6, Jewelie Bremen 1.9%.

[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:55.700]
Hey!

[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:03.220]
Dennis Cousinich 1.4, Wesley Clark 1.3, Carol Mosley Brown 1.2, and Dick Hevhardt only a half a percent.

[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:07.160]
Only 256 people voted for Dick in Dave County.

[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.220]
And Howard...

[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.060]
Howard!

[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.100]
17% voter turnout, a little bit better.

[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.720]
Nothing spectacular, because why?

[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.480]
You know, it's too bad that Edwards had dropped out before the Florida primary.

[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.780]
It would have been interesting to see how many people voted about.

[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:31.080]
In Broward County, Carol Mosley Brown 1%, West Clark 1.3%, Howard Dean 2.3%, John Edwards 6.7%, Dick Hevhardt 0.77%, wow.

[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.500]
Nobody likes Dick.

[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:42.880]
John Kerry 80.89%, Cousinich 1.39, Lieberman 3.13, the most used in sunrise, and I voted for Jewelie Bremen.

[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:50.180]
And Al Sharpton 2.45%, and in Palm Beach County last and certainly least 17.21% voter turnout yesterday.

[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:56.580]
Carol Mosley Brown 1.5%, Wesley Clark 9.10%, small potatoes.

[00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:04.020]
Howard Dean 2.26%, John Edwards 5.62, Dick Hevhardt again, only about 55%.

[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.860]
425 people in Palm Beach, and they probably thought they were voting for Papu Cannon.

[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.160]
John Kerry 85.29%, they were like that!

[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:26.040]
In Palm Beach, as these people don't want to make the same mistake again they did four years ago, Dennis Cousinich 1.33%, Jewelie Bremen 1.74%, and Al Sharpton 1.76.

[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.860]
And there you go.

[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.080]
Don't you think it's kind of a waste of time, Rudy? Why don't they do that?

[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.560]
It's like Bush, like the Republicans, they're having their thing in well. Bush has got it locked up now.

[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.480]
There's nobody running against him. What's the point? What would a QAM Hello?

[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:46.960]
Good morning. You stole my thunder. I was gonna say Papu Cannon somehow got 5,000 votes in Palm Beach.

[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.660]
Wouldn't surprise me at all. Papu is makes perfect.

[00:41:50.300 --> 00:42:00.200]
Listen, I have watched the career Bill Mar for a while, and I still don't care for him, but he made a terrible comment on Friday night.

[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:06.000]
Yeah. Because it's Ash Brown's who's in the hospital, he got infected from wiping his butt with a bill of rights.

[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.620]
That's beautiful. I like that. I think it's very...

[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:14.940]
Oh yeah, Bill Mar says a lot of the right things. I just can't stand him. I just wish somebody else was saying it because he just makes me ill.

[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:20.680]
Exactly. And Carlons is going to... it's the last show for a while. Carlons can be on Friday night, but we're going to have to look forward to that.

[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:21.900]
He's going to be on where?

[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.700]
Carlons can be on March show on Friday night.

[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.900]
Uh oh. Yeah, I'm going to be hearing a lot of those. You're okay with that.

[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.840]
It's B.O. You're not. Oh, that's right. HBO. Thank God for HBO.

[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:38.980]
Isn't it amazing how, you know, for whatever 15 bucks a month, they do everything right on that network.

[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.920]
The movies are better, the news is better, the sports is better.

[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.920]
Right. It's amazing. Well, it's a good...

[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.520]
I get to talk to you. I'm a leave-your-baby and your anniversary is March 1st.

[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.500]
And I consider you a special gift to me every year.

[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.780]
Well, thanks for the sucks, you know. Thank you, Pallee.

[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.840]
Thank you. See you. And happy birthday.

[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:04.120]
10.56 at 5.60 W.D.Q.M. We got the man dog at 2.00. The Humberit 4. Marlins on deck at 6.50.

[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.000]
The Dodgers and the Marlins in Jupiter 705. Any K at 10.00.

[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:08.420]
That's right, then.

[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.060]
Hey, it's Howard. Howard David.

[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.060]
I'm so glad you're here.

[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:46.980]
Talk to show hosts off fine when they show their son on their hands.

[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.580]
That's a bad hand to see.

[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.540]
Thank you, you bet.

[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.680]
Freedom's in, freedom's in, let's marry our hands.

[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:04.960]
Freedom's in, freedom's in, let's marry our hands.

[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.640]
11.15.60 W.D.Q.M. We got 220 votes.

[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.960]
It's pretty weak on our poll, but that's because we haven't added a lot of names on there yet.

[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.940]
We'll get around to it or not. We'll see.

[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.080]
If he had tons of cash, what one city would you choose to be?

[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:28.420]
In Honolulu, 61, New York 43, Miami 29, Toronto 19, Amsterdam 16, Rome 16, Naples.

[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.740]
We should put Naples forward, okay? I guess.

[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.240]
I mean, Eric, you know, he's up there in Orlando. So he's a Florida boy.

[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.620]
So he's familiar with all these little hick-town. I mean, beautiful places in Florida.

[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.500]
But the Naples Florida, because some people might look at that the first time.

[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.940]
Oh, Napoli, Naples in Italy. You know, I had none. Sorry.

[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.120]
Stockholm 6, San Francisco 5. I'm shocked.

[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.540]
And Dorolavia 4. Virgin Islands 4. Jamaica 2.

[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.780]
Las Vegas 2 in Nassau has got a pair out of 224 votes.

[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.080]
Now, why did you email me this thing with you? Is this like to kill a show someday?

[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.260]
Exactly.

[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.140]
The 100 most often mispronounced words and phrases in Angles.

[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.560]
Some of them are obvious and some of them are not just a thing.

[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.620]
You mean like acts? Yeah, obviously.

[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.280]
Boy, if there's anything that really just frosts my ass,

[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:25.860]
it's when anybody says, can I ask you something? Let me ask you a question.

[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.920]
Can I ask your head?

[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.160]
It says, this mispronunciation has been around for so long that a linguist, Mark Aranoff,

[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.620]
thinks we should cherish it as part of our linguistic heritage.

[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.720]
And most of us will give the axe to axe.

[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.400]
A-X-E to AKS.

[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.520]
Athlete? Yeah.

[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.580]
I like these. These are cute.

[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.680]
But we don't want to get sidetracked on this, do we?

[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.000]
No, no. For some reason.

[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.600]
We need dozens and dozens more names on that list.

[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.840]
We've got to pump up that total. Of course, main reason you want to go to our website today is check out the lovely picture.

[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.620]
In the Beated Curtain section of Linda Blair.

[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.460]
Just really shocked a hell out of me. WDQA, hello.

[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.700]
Hey, how about Vancouver for your list?

[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.580]
How about a beautiful place they say?

[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:08.340]
Yes.

[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.220]
Best Wheeler of the America line.

[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.400]
I think you're pardoned.

[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.420]
This is a lay on the phone. How about Whistler in particular?

[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.960]
Whistler BC. Okay, that's where they got the really good weed. Okay, pal, I can see around here.

[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.000]
Vancouver, British Columbia. Let's get that on there.

[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:23.260]
Okay.

[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.400]
In spite of that Todd Bertuzzi creep.

[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.700]
Hey, we hate you Todd. You're a ghoulin man. We hate your guts.

[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.060]
Hopefully, it's just spent your ass for like five years.

[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.540]
WQA and the unconscious line nine. Hello.

[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.060]
Okay.

[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.520]
Oh, you're screaming.

[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:39.860]
Screamous.

[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:41.100]
New?

[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.640]
Yes? No.

[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.760]
Okay, it's not new. It's...

[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.800]
Oh, hey, Neil. Okay, okay. I had to hear you talk then.

[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.040]
Sorry.

[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.920]
Hi. Hi. Oh, Linda Blair rhymes with, you know,

[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.860]
that's a nice picture.

[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:52.840]
Too big here.

[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.640]
Oh, yeah, you...

[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.660]
When I first tune in, you were talking about Don and Mike.

[00:46:59.240 --> 00:46:59.480]
Right.

[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.520]
What was...what were you saying about?

[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:03.900]
I said...

[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.080]
Don and Mike...

[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.680]
Well, that's what I said.

[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:09.880]
Neil...

[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.080]
What the Gilbert doesn't know anything about Don and Mike.

[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:13.060]
I'm sure he's never heard them.

[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:14.580]
Yeah, I've...

[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.160]
Don and Mike used to be on WIOD. He's heard them.

[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.920]
We all have heard them. They suck. And have a nice day.

[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.960]
The thing about Don and Mike was that KC...

[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.080]
I'm glad he mentioned that though again,

[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.980]
because I want to keep repeating this as often as I can.

[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.160]
I might motivate somebody somewhere to pick up on this.

[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.280]
KC...what did I get this from?

[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.880]
Radio and records today.

[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.820]
KCJJ Iowa City...

[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.940]
I went expanded band-A and station owned by Steve Bridges will preempt its talk

[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.680]
at HOT AC Program in Mixed.

[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.880]
Tomorrow, five in the morning till 6 p.m.

[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:47.120]
To air messages urging listeners to contact the FCC's commissioners

[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.360]
and those in Congress representing Eastern Iowa,

[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.540]
to voice their displeasure with the current climate attacking

[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.820]
the fundamental principles of free speech and choice.

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.660]
Bridges says whether you like Howard Stern or not,

[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.180]
and we don't carry the show, 18 million people do.

[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.060]
Third channel is every right to cancel it on their stations,

[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.980]
but the government has no right to threaten others who demon appropriate.

[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.780]
It should be left up for the communities they serve.

[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.840]
KCJJ carries the Westwood one,

[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.080]
located down in my program,

[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.260]
and today's best music the rest of the day.

[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.180]
And I tip my head if I were wearing one.

[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.260]
I tip my beanie.

[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.760]
I tip my headgear to KCJJ in Iowa City.

[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.200]
I would say it's a gutsy-ballsy thing, man.

[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.400]
Unfortunately, do you think anybody else is going to be doing that?

[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.240]
No. No way.

[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:27.280]
No way. We got money to make.

[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.480]
We got bigger fish to fry.

[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.600]
Spineless gutless bunch of cowards.

[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.560]
That's my colleagues in the broadcast industry.

[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.380]
Bunch of Spineless Jellyfish.

[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.120]
WQA, I'm hello.

[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:42.080]
What was that guy smoking?

[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.900]
I just want to say George is gay.

[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:46.840]
WQA, hello.

[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:48.500]
How are you doing Uncle Neil?

[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:49.840]
A little bit of a fire pot.

[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.820]
Do you know you have one of those folding billboards over on Halnell?

[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:55.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.760]
Okay. Have a good day, sir.

[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:58.980]
And thanks so much.

[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.800]
We got billboards all over the place.

[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.860]
We got billboards up the old nostril.

[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.320]
Gratum.

[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.220]
No, we can't say that.

[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.260]
All over the place.

[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.080]
We got some billboards.

[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:07.820]
Nice going, Greg.

[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.720]
But of course, you know, he'd like Humpty Dumpty again.

[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.240]
If he breaks all the pieces all over the place, all over the place, all over the...

[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:12.800]
You see the egg?

[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.780]
If you drive it around south-Ford, you'll see pieces of egg.

[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.980]
Some of those pieces of egg are in Greg's face, of course.

[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.920]
And the other pieces are just all over it and just littered along the landscape.

[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:24.540]
You'll see him.

[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.920]
That's the QAM egg that Greg broke into a zit in.

[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.940]
He's like Humpty Dumpty.

[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.020]
Ever see Humpty Dumpty and Greg together?

[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.360]
Well, same person.

[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:34.540]

[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:36.940]
WQAM, hello.

[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.000]
Hello.

[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:37.860]
Hello.

[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.640]
Yes, Piddle.

[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.580]
I've got no one floating for Kielpo.

[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.620]
Put me down for Kielpo.

[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.440]
The girls are chief.

[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.800]
Come in to QAM, hello.

[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:47.560]
Piddle.

[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:48.320]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:54.840]
Okay, two words I don't like is when people say, e-regardless, which isn't even a word.

[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.960]
I wonder if that's on his list.

[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.020]
Let me see if I can find it.

[00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.860]
That's on another list of words that don't really exist.

[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.040]
That doesn't exist.

[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.820]
And when somebody says, all's on the same.

[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.980]
Yeah, all I'm saying.

[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:07.940]
Yeah, I love that.

[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:08.980]
I got to hate that.

[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:09.460]
Uh-huh.

[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:10.640]
Hey, uh, yeah.

[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.340]
Oh, yeah, it's on here.

[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.280]
Irregardless is instead of regardless.

[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.500]
It's as less already says without.

[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.960]
So there's no need to repeat the same cinema with ear.

[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.220]
It's an irritate.

[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:23.220]
Irregate.

[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:23.260]

[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:23.780]
Oh, okay.

[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:28.320]
You know, the thing about action is it was something all I'm saying is cringe.

[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:32.000]
Well, see that acting used to be a black thing.

[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.260]
But now it's also a, um, a reacon thing, I guess.

[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:40.260]
And, uh, Julio, I don't know all kinds of, uh, people who aren't well educated, uh, say acts.

[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.140]
Can I ask you something?

[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:42.760]
Even white people say it, too.

[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:43.940]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:44.480]
Yeah.

[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.780]
Well, you know, hey, uh, Neil, it's so funny.

[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:52.260]
You know, you watch movies that are set in the future and you see how the government is controlling them and, and, and all in everything.

[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.180]
And, and years ago, you might laugh and say, uh, that's crazy.

[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.900]
But now it's so coming through it.

[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.520]
And in 1984, you know, you just can't believe what you're seeing what's going on.

[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.520]
I can't believe how passive the public is.

[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:08.160]
I mean, no matter what it is, the public just sits back and whenever the media tells them they should be concerned about.

[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.800]
That's what they get all whipped up about.

[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.600]
You know, Martha Stewart and all this other crap.

[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:15.420]
And then, and while their freedoms are being taken away, they're like, uh, oblivious.

[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:21.560]
Well, I don't know if you heard Howard this morning, but he was, uh, you know, he was almost giving up and then he wants to fight back.

[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.580]
And he just feels it is nothing that he can do.

[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.460]
He just feels his hands are so tied.

[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.020]
Yeah.

[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:34.920]
That's, uh, they're going to get him regardless, you know, regardless of what he, uh, regardless of what he, um, what he does.

[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.120]
And it's a shame and it's going to happen to everybody.

[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.680]
And, uh, when we left with, uh, what's not going to happen to everybody?

[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.300]
And it's not going to happen to everybody.

[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.340]
That's why it's different with you.

[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.180]
It's going to happen to those people who are too stupid and stubborn to understand what you see.

[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:52.760]
If you're driving down a highway, if you're driving down I-75 or whatever, 95.

[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.940]
And you see 40 radar cops, okay?

[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.000]
And they got- all of them got their radar guns pointed at the traffic.

[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.820]
If you have any brains, you're going to slow down to the speed limit until you get out of that situation.

[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.620]
See what I'm saying?

[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:06.680]
I see what you think.

[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:11.160]
But if you want to be stubborn and say, well, I'm driving a Lamborghini, man, I got a really hot fast car here.

[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:11.840]
I'm going to show them.

[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.280]
Well, then it's just no question about it.

[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.100]
They're going to nail your ass.

[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.780]
So that that's, you know, there are times when you use your brain and there are other times when you want to be stubborn.

[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:20.660]
Hey Neil.

[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:21.660]
Yes sir.

[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:25.220]
For your poll, I'm looking to buy a place in Mallorca, Spain.

[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.360]
So, Spain be beautiful there.

[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:28.500]
So I think that's a nice place.

[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:29.360]
Okay, good luck.

[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.160]
I'll see you there, Pellie.

[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.160]
Okay, bye bye.

[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.040]
Mallorca, M-A-J-O-R-C-K-C-A.

[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:41.420]
How about I just say M-A-J-A-M-A-J-A-M-A-J-O-R-C-K-C-A.

[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.100]
Why can't I say that?

[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:43.700]
I don't know.

[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.200]
God.

[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.840]
I must be catching from this list that you sent me.

[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.660]
I'm a fairly illiterate guy.

[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:51.940]
I'll break it a little bit.

[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.620]
If you had tons of cash in what city, what do you choose to live in?

[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.020]
Hallelujah 68, New York 46, Miami 33 to Rotter-22, Amsterdam 21, Rome, US 17.

[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.720]
Naples Florida, that is 15.

[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:06.140]
Naples Florida.

[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.020]
Can you change that?

[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.480]
Joshard is the air kept to do that.

[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:10.820]
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:12.400]
Take care of it, please.

[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:14.600]
Let's see.

[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.200]
Where the hell am I?

[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.560]
San Francisco, 10 Virgin Islands, 9.

[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:25.980]
Vegas 8, Stockholm 6, and Dora LaVaya 4, Jamaica 3, NASA 2, Vancouver and New York 0.

[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.260]
Why do so many people...

[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:29.560]
I went through that phase.

[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.140]
I thought, oh, I sure love to live in Vegas.

[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.860]
I've been started looking at prices of property on that crap.

[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.680]
Why would you want to live in Vegas?

[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:37.500]
I don't know.

[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:40.680]
I don't understand people who want to live in Phoenix, Vegas, the desert.

[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.380]
Well, I mean, for getting about that, I mean, the weather doesn't bother me.

[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.820]
Once I'm 15, it does feel more than like, oh, 100.

[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:47.740]
10 or 12.

[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:48.720]
Right, right.

[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.840]
But, well, that part of it does get to you.

[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:52.340]
There's a lot to do there.

[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.040]
There you go.

[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.280]
Oh, that's right. You're going there.

[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.480]
Oh, I've been there, but yeah, I'm going back.

[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.120]
Oh, no, I know there's a lot to do there, but other than gamble and eat.

[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.560]
And you can get laid off on the bottom.

[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.940]
Oh, you can get out of here, the show's...

[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:07.540]
Well, what, you know what?

[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.440]
Name me a show that you went to in Vegas.

[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.020]
Well, I was going to go to the Topless Magic Show, but somebody that I was there with didn't want to.

[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:14.900]
I see.

[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.680]
I went to see Luis Miguel at Caesars.

[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.940]
He was great, but I also saw Luis Miguel in Miami.

[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.040]
So I didn't really need to go to Vegas to see Luis Miguel.

[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:22.660]
You know what?

[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:25.820]
I did see the Lance Burton Magic Act before he was all big.

[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:26.500]
Yeah.

[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:27.940]
Oh, guess who's going home?

[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:28.420]
Roy!

[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:29.560]
He's going home.

[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.140]
With the skull.

[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.540]
With a little, uh, beaded the skull.

[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.920]
Yeah, I heard they put a hinge on it.

[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:37.420]
No, seriously, he's going home.

[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.460]
He's walking a little bit.

[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.240]
He's shuffling around.

[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:40.700]
Good old...

[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:40.900]
Roy!

[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:44.760]
So before long, he'll be doing it with the big cats again.

[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.940]
12 minutes after 11 at 5, 60 WQM.

[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.360]
You weigh it, you weigh it.

[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.860]
It stays in Miami town.

[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.300]
At 560WQA.

[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.500]
Hello, this is Michael Powell.

[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:09.180]
Son of Colin Powell who helped us send me to this lofty position through certain political favors.

[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:13.900]
I'd like to take this moment to talk about the feel that we hear on the radio airwaves.

[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:16.500]
And someday I might even turn the radio on to hear it myself.

[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:21.060]
So I announced from this moment on all radio broadcasters of the Think Clear Channel Corporation

[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:24.880]
not adhering to the victims handed down by the holy ones of the Saudi Bush royalty,

[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.560]
who are the lords and givers of life.

[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:27.600]
Bye bye, sonny.

[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:33.080]
We'll be stripped naked and medically sold together by Dr. Laura Mengeleau to a Jewish child.

[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:36.040]
I urge you to stop this December film,

[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.920]
especially paid for by other wary publicans and the Nazi Malibu.

[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.360]
1117-560WQA Vancouver got a vote.

[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:46.180]
Pracey and Kendall says she wants to nominate Pacific Beach or a two specific which it is.

[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.480]
San Diego, California.

[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.100]
Let's put San Diego under. I hear it's a Julius.

[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:51.440]
Yeah.

[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.320]
Nice climate. What? You don't like it?

[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.460]
No, I've heard good things. I've just never been there.

[00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:58.960]
Well, I've never been there either. So let's take Pracey's word for it.

[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:04.000]
She says they showed Hank eating at the arena during the heat game last night.

[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:06.780]
Cut it out, how bad. How could they eat him already?

[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.440]
He should heat you warning and put down the forks as Tracy.

[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.360]
She wants to make a shameless request. Could you please play the bit where the kid does your show?

[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.260]
I'm afraid she's talking about young nils and she, oh, God.

[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.900]
That must be what she's talking about.

[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:23.900]
Well, I guess what. And then she also says in an honor of our great good departed friend.

[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:24.620]
Party.

[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.260]
Yeah, the fat Don Cox. He was fat too.

[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:32.080]
Right, drinking.

[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:36.440]
What? Don't be attacking dead people.

[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.940]
I'm not attacking him for those of you who are fat and drinking.

[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:39.680]
You're going to die.

[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:42.220]
And you fat who aren't drinking are going to die too.

[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.900]
Anthony says Jamaica, a town called Manderville.

[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:50.500]
I thought he played hockey from I used to be in Cornell in the Leafs in the San Luis.

[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.160]
Kurt Manderville. And anyway, Jamaica's close enough Anthony.

[00:57:54.400 --> 00:58:00.000]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.180]
WDQAM. Hello.

[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.780]
Hello, Neil. How are you doing?

[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:03.320]
Pretty good.

[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.980]
Listen to you talking about the asking and action.

[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:11.240]
And I remember one year of a great mayor, Ed Koch.

[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:16.760]
And mention about teaching our children how to say ask instead of act.

[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.580]
He was ripped a new one by all my hearty crew.

[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:21.240]
Really?

[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:25.440]
But when we graduated, yo, yo, yo, you know what I'm saying?

[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.500]
You know what I'm saying? Can you see what I'm saying?

[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.820]
Yeah. So Neil, I see at the border.

[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:32.780]
Let me ask you one question.

[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:33.360]
Okay.

[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:34.680]
Why not?

[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5.

[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.060]
And of course, we've gone beyond that.

[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.320]
How long was that big?

[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:44.820]
About five minutes and then it became right.

[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:45.140]
What up?

[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:45.780]
What up?

[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:46.860]
And obviously, it went up.

[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.540]
You're obviously just trying to be cool.

[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.980]
So don't bother with any of this crap unless you're one of them.

[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.560]
And also just say, sup.

[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.080]
Yeah, but that was like how many seconds it is?

[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.120]
About 30 seconds.

[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:57.920]
Yeah, 30 seconds.

[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.180]
See, they just keep moving it on and moving it on.

[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.420]
So that all of us old parts we can't keep up with it.

[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.220]
And quite frankly, I never wanted to keep up with it.

[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.260]
That's one good thing about me.

[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.120]
To that, man.

[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:09.260]
Had no interest.

[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:10.880]
WDQAM. Hello.

[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:13.980]
I especially hate the word, especially.

[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:15.520]
Especially for you, yeah.

[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:16.460]
Okay.

[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.680]
Especially if you remember that by the McGuire sisters?

[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.100]
No.

[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:19.640]
Of course not.

[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.040]
Long before you were born.

[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:25.240]
McGuire sisters used to be on the Arthur God for sure, I believe, with a lot of other goyms.

[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:26.780]
And which one was it?

[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:29.300]
Was it Phyllis McGuire that was the gangsters, the girlfriend?

[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.860]
Sam G. and Conor of the gangsta?

[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:38.040]
Yeah, the mobsters, the girlfriend from Chicago, Sam G. and Conor who came to a wicked end.

[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.520]
WDQAM. Hello.

[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:41.760]
Yeah, if I speak to Neil.

[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:42.360]
Speaking.

[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:43.560]
Neil, how you doing?

[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:44.260]
Pretty good.

[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:48.640]
Neil, what do you think about that guy, Bertuzzi soccer punch and that guy from the Avalon?

[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.420]
One of the worst things I ever saw in my life, he should be suspended the rest of the year

[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:53.760]
and the playoffs and maybe beyond.

[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:55.540]
It was just grotesque.

[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.620]
First of all, he grabbed the guy from behind Steve Moore, grabbed him by the Jersey, punched him in the back of that

[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.380]
and then slammed his head down on the ice.

[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:03.600]
And here's a big pool of blood.

[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.660]
The guys had a broken neck and a concussion.

[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.300]
And Bertuzzi's here in Toronto today for a hearing.

[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.940]
I hope they really nail his ass big time.

[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.780]
And the police are looking into it too.

[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.620]
And you're listening to the Vancouver fans, they're calling up acting like he didn't have anything wrong.

[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:22.660]
Bull crap, that was one, that may have been, the only worst one was the one by Donald Brishir.

[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.600]
And Marty McSorley, your earphone cracked out.

[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:30.020]
When Marty McSorley whacked Brishir on the side of the head with a stick, that was worse.

[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.760]
But this one was a close second.

[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:33.620]
It's unacceptable.

[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:38.920]
And unless they start putting it to end of this crap, they're going to wind up with some guy getting killed out there.

[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.180]
Just a matter of time, if they let this crap go on.

[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.840]
Yeah, but what's wrong with our game?

[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.400]
What's wrong with your game is that you lost control of it.

[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.380]
That's what's wrong with your game.

[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.700]
It blows.

[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:49.920]
WQM, hello.

[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.480]
Thank you. How you doing?

[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.080]
Pretty good?

[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.420]
Uh, it works, what it works for.

[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:56.500]
Here's one for you.

[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.300]
I think it's got no education, but I have the eight on all.

[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:02.840]
They say, all.

[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:11.500]
Can that some shot by the five six seven oh five 16?

[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:11.860]
Wow.

[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.300]
What? I mean, what's there to say?

[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.340]
I mean, it's supposed to be stood on its own. It was a beautiful thing.

[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.880]
Obviously the supplies are lasting.

[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.280]
Oh, yeah, no question about that.

[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.460]
And of course, you started all this with this list here.

[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:24.620]
They like lists.

[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.880]
Yeah, well, there's what already made for it.

[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.720]
Turn over to 1360 WKAT.

[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.440]
You can get some frauds list before noon.

[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.380]
Barbiturate.

[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.420]
Well, not wait a minute.

[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:38.180]
They have no, uh, that bet for Bush and a lot of other Iran's who say nuclear.

[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.340]
I bet that's on this list.

[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.540]
Oh, yeah, there it is.

[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.260]
The thing about all of these is that there's no reason for them to mispronounce half of them that way.

[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.220]
They're not stalled that way.

[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:47.580]
Just they pull it out of there.

[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.860]
It says the British and Australians find the American repetition of the U between the K and the L.

[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.020]
Quaintly amusing.

[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.040]
Good reason to get it right.

[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.280]
Nuclear instead of nuclear.

[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.720]
I mean, it's a, and I'll tell you another one is a jewer.

[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.220]
Yes, it's jeweler.

[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.080]
Yeah, jeweler.

[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.300]
And it's jewelry, not jewelry.

[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.360]
See, there goes George.

[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.500]
You got one more of that Jew talk.

[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.680]
Jew started it.

[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.280]
Can't control yourself, can you?

[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.400]
Here's one that says I used to work at the Red Lobster, a very popular with African Americans.

[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.520]
And they pronounce shrimp as swims.

[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.940]
I never heard that.

[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:18.840]
It's some seems.

[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:20.380]
Yes.

[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.180]
It said it may be one of duct their heads in the lobster tank.

[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:24.720]
Swims.

[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:24.820]
Swims.

[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:25.660]
Swims.

[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.060]
He's got it done.

[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.080]
All right.

[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.080]
He's been there with that.

[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.320]
Oh, no.

[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.420]
Man, oh man, I'm going to go to Red Lobster for once a day.

[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.600]
I think just so I can hear about them.

[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:38.980]
Swims.

[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.240]
Take a recorder.

[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:41.120]
All right.

[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.060]
Auckland, New Zealand, somebody says they want to live down under.

[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.740]
I bet you that's a pretty nice place.

[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.440]
I've heard nothing.

[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.840]
But wonderful things about New Zealand.

[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:49.140]

[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.720]
Just two damn far from any place.

[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.080]
But then there's some people that want to get far from where used to be civilized.

[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:54.280]
Right.

[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.220]
I don't blame them.

[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:59.340]
I want to get far away down under and never come back up again.

[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.580]
5, 6, 7, we're speaking in Linda Blair pictures.

[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.820]
I'm really shocked.

[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.140]
I didn't know she had it entered.

[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.120]
Yes.

[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:06.900]
That honor.

[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:07.900]
Yeah.

[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:08.960]
Well, we can't say what?

[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.940]
One over there and another one over there.

[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.180]
A match set.

[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.360]
WQM.

[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:13.600]
Hello.

[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.140]
QAM.

[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.200]
Hi guys.

[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:17.740]
How are you?

[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:18.440]
Pretty good.

[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:19.160]
Great.

[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:19.520]
Listen.

[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:20.580]
How about recreate?

[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.720]
Daddy Bush was taking his boat out to recreate.

[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:25.180]
Recreate.

[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.280]
But that's not even such a word.

[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.040]
I don't think so.

[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:30.680]
I don't think so.

[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.640]
And that probably won't be on here because there's no such word, right?

[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:34.920]
Who does?

[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:35.820]
No, there's no.

[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.340]
Well, let me look.

[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:37.480]
There's recreate.

[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:39.320]
Let's see.

[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:39.600]
No.

[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.240]
Not on here.

[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:41.980]
We occur.

[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.640]
Yeah, we occur for recur.

[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.700]
It says you don't have to invent a new word from a curve.

[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.460]
We already have a verb recur that does the trick.

[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:50.140]
We occur.

[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.560]
Revolent for relevant.

[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.160]
But this is a good list.

[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:55.540]
Realeter.

[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.480]
Realeter for all, yeah.

[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.940]
That one really bugs me.

[01:03:59.220 --> 01:03:59.620]
Realeter.

[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:00.460]
Reality?

[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.160]
Yeah, I talked to my realeter this morning.

[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:02.960]
Realter.

[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:03.420]
You idiot.

[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:03.980]
Realter.

[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:04.720]
Not realter.

[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.480]
Oh, gee.

[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.560]
Everybody says that.

[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.220]
I know.

[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:07.700]
I hate it.

[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:10.020]
This thing is making me realize Americans are having a lot of them.

[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:11.460]
I realize they were all though.

[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:12.240]
I will say this.

[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:12.700]
You really?

[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:13.500]
Realize.

[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.620]
I will say this.

[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:16.500]
You talk about people who can't speak in O'English.

[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:17.300]
You go to England.

[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.260]
You go where there are any Brits, man.

[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.320]
You can't understand a freaking word that these people are saying.

[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.420]
You need an interpreter.

[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.200]
They have no clue how to speak that language.

[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.360]
It never ceases to amaze me.

[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.940]
These are the people, at least their ancestors, invented the language.

[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.720]
And they never figured out how to speak it.

[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.580]
They'd be like creating a brilliant, like inventing the television set.

[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.580]
But never figuring out how to turn it on.

[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.860]
Pond, like Michael Powell.

[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:44.800]
Like inventing the radio.

[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.160]
But never figuring out how to turn it on.

[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.060]
Shmuck.

[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:48.920]
WDQA, hello.

[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:49.940]
Neil.

[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:50.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.360]
To add to your words, I don't know if it's on the list.

[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.460]
And this one just absolutely bugs me.

[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:59.000]
I'm hearing it more and more on broadcast TV and even radio.

[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.180]
Pacific.

[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.040]
Oh, yeah.

[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.260]
Let me give you a Pacific.

[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.100]
Pacific, yeah.

[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.560]
Pacificly Pacific.

[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:07.700]
Pacific.

[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.420]
There's no more S in that word.

[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.820]
Not on the list, but I'm with you.

[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:13.740]
Okay.

[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:14.800]
Thank you.

[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.620]
Thanks a lot, Polly.

[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.580]
I'll see you in Hawaii, which is in the Pacific.

[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.680]
Why not go to show you how good education is.

[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.600]
You can't complain about American education because you haven't been speaking there, ain't none.

[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:25.820]
Very little.

[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.200]
26, Pat.

[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.180]
Now, see you've got the whole show sidetrack with this list.

[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:30.840]
Nice job, George.

[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.080]
Sorry.

[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:32.100]
That's okay.

[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.500]
They like this a lot better than the places where it goes.

[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:34.720]
Why, you need it.

[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:35.680]
The other thing is a very, huh?

[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.100]
That's why I emailed it to you.

[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.560]
I didn't think you'd read it till after the show.

[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:39.300]
Why?

[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.360]
It's mixed in match.

[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.680]
Yeah, we can do whatever the hell they want.

[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.740]
Whatever it'll kill the four hours.

[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:44.520]
You know how it works here.

[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.040]
It's payday.

[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.460]
I'm sure clearance got that check in my box on time.

[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.300]
Or else.

[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.940]
Now, he started really bug me that clearance because he's becoming more and more idiotic.

[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:58.880]
I never thought that was possible, but, you know, his ineptitude is starting to really show

[01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.660]
a big time now.

[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.640]
Drowning in a sea of ineptitude.

[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.400]
That's clearance.

[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:05.980]
Stick with a ball games.

[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:06.340]
Okay.

[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:06.960]
Stick with a B.

[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:07.700]
Stick with a UM.

[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.800]
Stick with something your own level.

[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.740]
You and Mike Rosenthal.

[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:10.940]
Stick on that level, clearance.

[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:11.300]
Okay.

[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:11.840]
You're all right.

[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.460]
You're not a bad guy, but get serious.

[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:19.040]
As my little dog used to say when I mentioned clearance's name, Esmeral Program Director.

[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.640]
26 past 11 at 560 WDQM.

[01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:23.980]
How's that New Year's resolution going?

[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.140]
It's the 10th of March already.

[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.300]
It's almost the I'da Martian St. Patis then.

[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.780]
I bet you a lot of you people are fat.

[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.580]
In fact, we got that article and everybody's talking about now.

[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:36.060]
And you notice how I'm resisting, but I'll get to it eventually, about how fat more people

[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:39.000]
are dying from fat than smoking from anything in America.

[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.940]
We're fat.

[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.580]
Well, it's tough to stick to a lot of these diet regimens.

[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:45.540]
Not easy to stay with them because they're boring.

[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.860]
Number one, there's little variety.

[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.320]
Number two, with balance for life, it's a piece of cake.

[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.160]
Because balance for life is the premier meal delivery service.

[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.520]
It's based on Dr. Barry Sears, the zone diet.

[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.760]
And they deliver right here, dough, three meals and two snacks every day in a little black sack.

[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:02.080]
With all that food in there, five delicious feedings.

[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.260]
How can you say you're out of diet?

[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:06.620]
So try the real meal service that delivers results based on the zone diet.

[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.260]
And don't settle for no imitations.

[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:13.200]
Imagine there's no shopping, no cooking, no cleaning, no calorie counting, not even any carb counting.

[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:17.700]
People are losing an average of 12 to 18 pounds a month with balance for life.

[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:21.840]
The zone diet's been proven to lower diabetes too, high cholesterol and high blood pressure as well.

[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.680]
And now if you ever wanted to try the South Beach diet, here's your chance.

[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:30.440]
Balance for life is the closest thing you'll ever find because it's the only meal delivery company that offers you menu choices.

[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.160]
Let you go from phase one to phase three of the South Beach diet too.

[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:37.260]
So like I said, if you failed and all the others in your frustrated and you really want to lose that weight.

[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.820]
You ought yourself to try balance for life.

[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.260]
You'll feel the difference and see the results on the scale like right away.

Way to A.

[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:03.920]
Where of exploding balls.

[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.160]
What word did you say?

[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.740]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:19.180]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:19.180]

[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:19.180]

[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:19.240]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.560]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.500]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:22.980]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.360]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.560]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.140]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.300]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.620]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.240]
I'm not a fan of the word.

[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.180]
All is well.

[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:44.880]
It's a pain.

[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.840]
Always weacher.

[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:05.820]
I've been đ up here.

[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:07.020]

[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:07.060]
Always you are black.

Meager told reporters waiting

[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.620]
while it's a disease of old time

[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.820]
it's named from the German or

[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:17.540]

[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:18.920]

for that bit

[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.300]
because Michael Powell don't like it too much

[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.280]
Michael Moore might like it

[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.200]

[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.580]

I don't know if this has come out

[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:42.420]
because I've only lived for a couple of minutes

[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.040]
but how about that phrase

[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.320]

he disrespected me

[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.400]
he never heard that before

[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.220]
no

[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.320]

he disrespected me

[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.640]
he disrespected me

[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.060]

pericure people who can't get out of town

[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.020]
if you had a ton of cash and one

[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.000]

[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.100]

[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.060]

[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.000]
Miami like maybe Evan Chiro would be good

[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.640]
or plantation acres

[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.240]
Eric and Josh

[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:35.080]
I mean I've seen it in print as Indian times

[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.560]
but I've for some reason that just

[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.660]
I don't know let me do a quick search on here

[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.320]
I know it's not with L's it's M-A-J

Mallorca online the Valeric island

[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.380]
the only problem with this going online

[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.220]
with these searches that if you misspell something

[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:51.900]
they still comes up

[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.820]
I mean just things

[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.860]
like did you mean to spell this one

[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.000]
no but it doesn't do that

[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.540]
Google yeah

[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.620]
Google what Google my ass

[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.700]
hey hey you want me to top that

[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.840]
no seriously look

[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:05.820]
haha

[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:09.220]
well you look it up I don't have time to deal around with my

[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:11.200]
organic hello I'm sure it's a beautiful place

[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.500]
yeah I know

[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000]
I like this story though non-believers form political action group through with government of religion

[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.860]
this is in today's Palm Beach Post I like it

[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:20.760]
a lot it isn't going to go anywhere

[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.960]
but I think it's great I might actually donate some cash

[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.260]
atheists and other non-believers

[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:33.240]
launched a political action committee yesterday to endorse candidates and lobby law makers to remove all traces of religion from the government

[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.200]
oh right so long overdue

[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.020]
so about time all the God squad

[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.460]
oh right Jesus Christ is the getch keys

[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:41.980]
oh right the old Orthodox

[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:43.320]
lunatics

[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.880]
and the Muslims

[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.700]
oh right

[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.360]
but organizers acknowledge they face a major problem

[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:52.000]
most politicians won't want public support

[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.440]
from their new group which they're calling

[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:57.280]
the godless americans political action committee that's gay pack

[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:58.820]
oh gay

[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.740]
haha you beat me to it

[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.600]
not a good idea to start any kind of an acronym there with the gay

[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.760]
godless american political action committee

[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:13.480]
so Ellen Johnson the president of the american atheists who announced a formation of the new group proposing an unusual approach

[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.160]
godless american pack could use the threat of endorsement to pressure law makers

[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.020]
and deciding with the group on issues

[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:21.160]
if a candidate says don't endorse me

[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.160]
we'll have to say we have the right to endorse somebody

[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.540]
but perhaps we can talk about what we can get in terms of promises

[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.480]
from that candidate to help us out and return for not endorsing them

[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:33.300]
Johnson told a sparsely attended news conference of the national press club in DC

[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:34.740]
sparsely attended

[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.260]
the designated political director of the new group

[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:40.720]
Jeffrey Lewis told a reporter lady that I personally wouldn't use such a pressure tactic

[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.880]
so far the group has little money to give away

[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.060]
Johnson said they've got one initial donation

[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:48.600]
a thousand dollars from civil liberties activist woody cappella boston

[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:50.940]

[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:06.240]
I just did all kinds of searches and you can spell it either way. It still comes up doesn't correct you

[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.860]
Okay, but I'm sure that MAJ is correct

[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:13.200]
The New York Stullix it's right and Dora La Vee. What however it is. It's right

[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.840]
Geneva Switzerland somebody says that's a good choice. I've heard lots of good things about Switzerland fights

[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.720]
But I ain't never been there yet

[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.320]
So make sure Josh when you put that on there put Geneva Switzerland because they might think we're talking about

[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:48.980]
Geneva, New York, okay, speaking the young Neil. Oh, I got to play that don't let me forget. Don't forget

[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.040]
Let's see impact getting back to the other thing

[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:56.660]
It says in the English language things have an impact on you, but they don't impact you. I don't uh

[01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:02.340]
It says get it right role instead. I'm your weather blows, but at any rate. I don't think that's correct. Can't impact be a verb

[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:08.580]
That's a good question. They online dictionary ought to answer it right? I'm sure that it is

[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.400]
It can have an impact that can also impact your life. I don't think there's any doubt about this. This is a no no trainer

[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:20.300]
It can impact your life that I would bet your life both your lives on it right now

[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.640]
And I'll throw in Greg and the clearance. I want to agree with you. It sounds correct

[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.260]
But you know how that goes. Are you looking it up? I am

[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:27.800]
Impact verb

[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.120]
noun or verb

[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:32.560]
Yeah

[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:37.480]
Got it. Yeah, and well hang on. No, I mean I got it. I don't have it

[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.860]
Well, why not how long can it take to do a uh search? I got to get to the right thing

[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:47.900]
Man, oh man see if you were doing that thing that I've been doing that we're on now what else I think called

[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:50.620]
What they feed the feed demon

[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.640]
Don't you do that to feed demon that we're under now? I don't know what you're talking about

[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:00.740]
The feed demon it's got all the different feeds. It's got all the news stories including ours now

[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.660]
Impact noun impact verb. So it's a verb also

[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.480]
They're wrong. You're absolutely wrong

[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.780]
Have you been doing impacting impact?

[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:09.840]
Vickinary.com

[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.540]
And for example, even have a word of the day. Patrician is the word of the day

[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.720]

So you're wrong impact and you wrote it in big bowl letters like hey, I'm gonna show you a finger who well guess what

[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:25.240]

Cow but he used to be but he used to be such a bush liquor

[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.580]
He defended the war everything that bush did. He is also such a hypocrite

[01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:01.840]
He talks about all this Bible stuff and then in the next breath talks about screwing chicks

[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.120]
He's now totally changed his tune is screaming and yelling about losing his freedoms now

[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:10.780]

Pereded it government

[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:34.800]

Yeah, there are people say Illinois. Just like there people who say Chicago. I hate that. It's not Chicago

Good golly. It's Chicago. It's Chicago. Give me another word that begins with CH that's that you pronounce

Get yourself that unbelievably low interest rate of just 1.25 percent if you have a hundred thousand dollar loan your payments

[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:14.580]
Are a mere three thirty four month if you have you a two hundred thousand dollar loan you pay only six sixty eight a month

[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:17.620]
And don't forget once you refinance to get a new home mortgage from financial group

[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:22.220]
You will never pay closing costs again right down on your wrist their new tool free number

[01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:27.020]
It's one eight six six three nine five lend and call and find out where I vote this pretty damn soon

[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:30.860]
Get the low rate mortgage you deserve then move on to your next property with no further cost of expense

[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:36.920]
You pay zero underwriting fee zero dot fees zero closing cost even when you move your ass to another property

[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:43.400]
Get the new low rate financing just 1.25 percent with the only one mortgage from financial group and never pay closing costs again

[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:49.560]
One eight six six three nine five lend that's financial group at one eight six six three nine five

[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:55.840]

[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:13.440]
And I like rubbing my smelly gorilla as with stock upfront jewels and listening to the near

[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.420]
Rocket

[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:15.980]
He never fun

[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:16.520]
Take iron!

[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:23.060]
Oh, they'll be coming down for heaven, oh, Ponsan Patise.

[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:26.220]
But great, they finally, hey, Richhal, across the USA.

[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.360]
What do you call her? What is this I hear?

[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:33.020]
Describe and valley, who? There's a bunch of queers again this year, who say that I wish to.

[01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:36.380]
Oh, God, loves the Irish, and loves the Cards of your game.

[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.300]
And the Arya won't be marching upon St. Patise.

[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:45.380]
You can be a bum, a bucket of stumps, sure, and have okay, but you can't be Irish if you're gay.

[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:46.180]
No.

[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:54.480]
Now you're on a high barren hymns, those hamen and cis-grey have delivered this pronouncement upon the blessed day.

[01:31:54.860 --> 01:32:01.140]
Sure a little bit have haven't fallen nestled in the sea.

[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:04.980]
But you're gone straight to Helperhorma's actuality.

[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:08.920]
Oh, come, loves the Irish, as long as men are men.

[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:12.160]
It's a perhaps a little bit hard, so we've never been sure of it.

[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.360]
You can be stinking drunk and Ireland sings the labyrinth all the way.

[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:18.000]
But you can't be Irish if you're gay.

[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:21.280]
No, you can't be Irish if you're gay.

[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:24.560]
Don't even try to be an Irish if you're gay.

[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.220]
I'll tell you one thing, I finally figured it out.

[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:30.180]
I've seen a big bunch of Scotsman, unadvice.

[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:33.160]
The people from the British Isles are genetically challenged.

[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:34.860]
Okay.

[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:37.220]
That's the problem. All of them.

[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:41.300]
Breeding the Scots, the Irish, the Brits, the Welsh.

[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:43.180]
They're genetically challenged.

[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.540]
Baguio city, I'm sure that's not how you said. Baguio?

[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:48.460]
Baguio?

[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:50.380]
You're looking into Baguio?

[01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:56.460]
In the Philippines, says somebody, I guess we'll just put down the Philippines just to pacify this fact,

[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:58.360]
because he says, or he or she or whoever.

[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:00.640]
This town is in the mountains, overlooks the sea.

[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:03.200]
The mean annual temperature is 76 degrees due to the elevation.

[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.900]
And you can have frequent companions shipped up to the mountainside, Las Montanillas.

[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:09.840]
I think they drag them up on a rope.

[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.480]
Hey, somebody send me up a dope on a rope, please. Do the old rope a dope.

[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:18.180]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.720]
We've got all kinds of stuff going on today. Thanks to George, thanks for me that thing.

[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.500]
I think we can maybe tomorrow we'll milk it a little bit more, you know what I mean?

[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.600]
We can take some of the best ones on there and make a poll from it.

[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:31.220]
And then add to it.

[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:32.100]
Sure.

[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.560]
Sounds like a plan to me.

[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.460]
Across as opposed to across.

[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.680]
Don't say across, say across.

[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:42.820]
It's easy to confuse across with cross, but better keep them separate.

[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:45.980]
Across.

[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:48.700]
He went across the street.

[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:52.180]
Affidavid, as opposed to affidavid.

[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.920]
Even if he's a lawyer's name is David, he issues affidavits, it says.

[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:56.200]
Affidavid.

[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.720]
Anardic, as opposed to Antarctic.

[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.000]
And how about February?

[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:02.160]
Is that on here?

[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:03.880]
Is it? Sure.

[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:06.440]

[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:07.940]
February.

[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:12.140]
We don't like two syllables in succession with an R, so some of us dump the first one in this word.

[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:17.780]
Most dictionaries now accept a singular pronunciation, but if you have an agile tongue, you may want to shoot for the original.

[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:20.680]
Oh, if you have an agile tongue, there's all kinds of things you might be thinking about.

[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:22.640]
We can't say anything on here anymore.

[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:24.600]
Oh, no way.

[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.460]
Don't even be thinking about that.

[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:31.280]
If you have an agile tongue, but nevertheless, February.

[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.760]
I mean, February sounds stupid.

[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.200]
I mean, don't really say February.

[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:37.300]
I don't even know how you say it anymore.

[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:37.900]
February.

[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:43.660]
Yeah, you get it, you like sneak it in there real quick, but you don't say February.

[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:46.160]
Oh, I just feel like stupid, Sam.

[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:47.320]
I feel like somebody we know.

[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:48.360]
Absolutely stupid.

[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:49.760]
I want to do that.

[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:52.880]
56670560, pound 560.

[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.420]
Did that computer show up yet, by the way?

[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:55.960]
No. No.

[01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:00.600]
I sure hope it's there by 2 o'clock this afternoon in the QM building.

[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.440]
You know, the one that keeps disappearing from my house.

[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:03.780]
Yeah.

[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:05.200]
QM. Hello.

[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:07.800]
QAM.

[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:12.140]
Yeah, how you doing, Neil?

[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:12.940]
Okay, sir.

[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.720]
I was wondering if you could find out for me why Joe and Mark were on our last night.

[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:21.060]
I called the guy, answered the phone, he said that they were called into the office at the last minute.

[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:21.800]
Yeah.

[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.940]
And I don't know what happened.

[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:26.520]
Maybe you know, is anybody there, the guy that answered the phone that he had worked with you?

[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:28.060]
Maybe he knows.

[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.360]
What time was this?

[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:33.040]
At 2 o'clock when I put on Joe and Mark in the morning.

[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:33.780]
Wait me in 2 in the morning?

[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:34.240]
Yeah.

[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.900]
Well, we'll check into it, Pellie.

[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:36.560]
All right, thanks.

[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:37.880]
Okay, we'll get you some info on that.

[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:38.880]
We got any info on that yet?

[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:41.020]
No.

[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.620]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:50.220]
What is your lot of crap going down these days in this business, you know?

[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:51.940]
There's a lot of stuff, a lot of mysteries.

[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.420]
WQAM, hello.

[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:54.860]
Neil.

[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:55.700]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.120]
Hey, how you doing, man?

[01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:57.820]
Pretty good.

[01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:58.580]
Good.

[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:03.480]
I don't, I was lost in the last hour, but I wanted, maybe somebody touched on it.

[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.460]
It drives me crazy when people say, supposedly instead of supposedly...

[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:07.880]
Oh, yeah.

[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:10.480]
Hey, man, brother.

[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:11.380]
What do they say?

[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:13.740]
Supposedly instead of supposedly...

[01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:15.540]
They say, supposedly, I never heard that.

[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.000]
I've been here all the time.

[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:18.360]
Never heard that in my life.

[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:19.420]
It drives me crazy.

[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:20.420]
Just wanted to check in.

[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.620]
Well, it's on here.

[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:22.140]
It's on the list.

[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:22.900]
It'll make you feel better.

[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:23.740]
Okay, good.

[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:24.180]
Thanks for having me.

[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:24.980]
Okay, thanks a lot, Alan.

[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:25.580]
That's a little time in America.

[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:27.780]
Supposedly?

[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:33.640]
Well, I'll tell you right now, and I don't want to sound like arrogant or like that, but the people here in Canada, I held them a lot better educated.

[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:35.180]
I grant you that.

[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.140]
There aren't as many of them.

[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:40.460]
And no matter what their skin color is, they generally seem to all speak English.

[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.220]
Very, you know, a problem.

[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:46.800]
As a matter of fact, I hear people say, supposedly more than the correct way, supposedly.

[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.060]
I've never heard that in my life, supposedly.

[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:50.100]
Supposedly.

[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:50.760]
Josh?

[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:52.480]
Yeah, I'm guilty.

[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.640]
You say, supposedly?

[01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:56.500]
Yeah, sometimes.

[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:57.960]
Oh my god.

[01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:59.380]
He must have a brain like a shrimp.

[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.040]
This is good.

[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:05.140]
Well, you're right.

[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:05.960]
This is a good idea.

[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:07.160]
Where the hell did you find this?

[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.060]
I was looking around for naked pictures of celebrities.

[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:11.300]
Yeah.

[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.840]
Because that's my job, right?

[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:13.480]
Right.

[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:20.120]
And that came up on one of the little sites that's, you know, if you're interested in naked pictures of women, you might also like this.

[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.500]
I'll say it again, man.

[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:23.640]
I lend a Blair picture, I think, is a damn impressive.

[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.380]
Nice going, Linda.

[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:25.220]
You go, sweetheart.

[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:26.540]
That's from my Linda Blair collection.

[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:27.280]
Wow.

[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:32.520]
At one point, I kind of put her in the same category with like Phoebe Kates.

[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:33.520]
Really?

[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:34.640]
No, no. She's always had that.

[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:36.000]
And you know who's hefted those things?

[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:37.640]
Yeah.

[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:38.420]
Rick James.

[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:39.660]
Really?

[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:40.040]
Yeah.

[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:41.760]
What a disgusting thought that was.

[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.900]
And right in the middle of lunch hour now and you're talking about that.

[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:44.780]
Oh, man.

[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:45.300]
Woo!

[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:46.560]
Talk about freaky.

[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:48.340]
Super freaky.

[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:48.920]
Right.

[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.140]
100 most often mispronounced words and phrases in English.

[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:56.040]
This is a beautiful, oh yeah, barbiturate as opposed to barbiturate.

[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:56.840]
Right.

[01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:59.840]
And I used to say that until somebody said, hey, asshole.

[01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:01.020]
You used to say barbiturate?

[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.120]
Well, no, the little kid.

[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:04.220]
Somebody gave me one and said, here's how you say it.

[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.600]
This one, I never, oh yeah, film.

[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:06.920]
Film.

[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.520]
As opposed to film.

[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:11.700]
I think only really stupid people say film.

[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:12.460]
Yeah.

[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:13.980]
You've got to be a moron to say that.

[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:14.360]
Film.

[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:15.760]
Oh, X, X, et cetera.

[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:16.580]
Yeah.

[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:17.020]
Oh yeah.

[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.560]
Et cetera, et cetera.

[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:21.120]
You morons, you idiots.

[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.440]
I mean, I'm not all that smart, but Jesus Christ.

[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:25.240]
Good going, Miss Molly.

[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:25.700]
Yeah.

[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:26.980]
Express it right after it.

[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:28.620]
It's as holy moly.

[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.460]
It's enough to make you want to go to Las Montanhas and just hide out.

[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:36.520]
I'd like to live in Italy in the, uh, in Sicily.

[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:37.940]
Croyley-oni.

[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.160]
I really would.

[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:42.740]
I'd like to live in the, uh, never been to Sicily, but I sure it's so beautiful.

[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:44.300]
Let me show you Sicily.

[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:45.100]
Okay.

[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:50.520]
537-0560, pound 560, and maybe, uh, Perugia.

[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.460]
They have those great candies there, you know, Perugina.

[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.660]
So I've heard so much Dan Good, Fluten, Italy.

[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:57.520]
Now, how come we're so fat and they're not?

[01:38:58.060 --> 01:38:58.960]
That's what I'd like to know.

[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.920]
All these stories now, they suddenly discovered after all this time that we're dying like crazy

[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:03.640]
because we're fat.

[01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:04.700]
Right.

[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:05.640]
They just discovered that.

[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:08.900]
They were looking for John Candy and they said, oh, he's not around the world.

[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:10.000]
He's dead because he was fat.

[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.720]
Oh, how about Mama Cass?

[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:12.320]
How she doing?

[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:13.540]
How about, uh, what's your name?

[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.820]
It used to be in Hollywood squares, the big fat, uh, tooty tooty fields.

[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:18.360]
No.

[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:21.140]
All these people would die because they were fat.

[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.540]
Your friends had died that they were fat.

[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:25.960]
Yep.

[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.320]
Two of them so far.

[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:28.620]
Two so far.

[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.820]
We got people in that building who were going to die because they're not just fat, but

[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:33.740]
they're just gigantic.

[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:35.220]
You know what I mean?

[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:38.200]
Not just fat, but huge.

[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:38.920]
That was funny.

[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.320]
And who the hell might have talked at 196 pounds?

[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.600]
I say very rigorously.

[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:45.920]
Well, I was 193 before when I was a vacation.

[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.000]
Now that's not really that bad, okay?

[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:50.440]
Not good, huh?

[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:51.200]
It could be better.

[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.140]
It needs to be a lot better.

[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:54.160]
I'm functioning.

[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.340]
I'm doing a show way over my playing weight.

[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:00.460]
Now people might laugh when you say that, but when you're diabetic, you have a certain

[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:04.260]
weight limit at which when you get beyond that, it's very difficult to function.

[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:05.000]
You know what I mean?

[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:05.340]
Down.

[01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:06.960]
No, no.

[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:11.580]
Seriously, when you get above and as you get older, that number keeps coming down.

[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:14.040]
In other words, used to be able to function at 200.

[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.040]
Well, when you get to be a certain another 10 years, then 190.

[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:18.680]
And then see where I'm going?

[01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:19.260]
Yep.

[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:20.160]
To the grave.

[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.360]
I think 90 is probably old enough though.

[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:27.460]
Anti-obesity public service ads may be too much to stomachs as USA today, eh?

[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:31.640]
The government unveiled public service ads yesterday, aimed at getting Americans to lose

[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.900]
weight and obesity experts are giving them mixed reviews.

[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.720]
Kind of like those bush ads that are getting very negative reviews, I got an article on

[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:38.760]
that a little bit later on.

[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.760]
GOP boss ads insult to 9-11 families, but he doesn't care.

[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.800]
Ed Gillespie, piece of crap.

[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:49.920]
Andrew 9-11 families again yesterday by saying only a small segment who are very anti-war

[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:53.920]
objected to President Bush's use of ground zero scenes in his reelection ads, the father

[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.860]
of one I love and victim called the comment insulting.

[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.240]
And there's lots more from the New York Daily News.

[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:00.020]
But we'll save that.

[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:07.060]
The goal of the campaign, www.smallstep.gov, is that people take small achievable steps

[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.160]
to improve their health and diversity obesity epidemic.

[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:12.720]
Now, let me ask you, oh, and you know who said that to Cheesehead, Tommy Thompson, they

[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:13.680]
dragged his ass out again.

[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:14.280]
Cheesehead.

[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:15.400]
What an idiot.

[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.240]
A drank water from a creek.

[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:17.960]

[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.120]
Who, as long as I live, I'll never forget that.

[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.180]
And then while we're on that subject, even though it's a little bit off the beaten path

[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.900]
here today, let me ask you this question.

[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.280]
How are they coming with a search for that...

[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:29.720]
An entrance.

[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:30.100]
Yeah.

[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:33.500]
For that guy who was making all those envelopes up.

[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:34.380]
Shut up.

[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:35.060]
Okay.

[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:40.000]
But how come the Italians read all that pasta and everybody says, well, the Mediterranean

[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:40.440]
died?

[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:41.580]
Okay, well, what is that?

[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.580]
Because it includes a lot of starch.

[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:44.460]
It includes pasta.

[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:48.020]
They eat pasta like it's coming out of a faucet somewhere.

[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:52.440]
Now, I will grant you, they don't eat the gigantic humongous portions and they don't

[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440]
eat like spaghetti with meatballs, God forbid.

[01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:56.360]
You go to Italy and ask for a spaghetti.

[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.460]
Meatballs, not giving you the old Bafan Gula, man.

[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.160]
They'll say, Achapecia.

[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:02.280]
K idiota.

[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.540]
Or something like that.

[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:09.040]
12 minutes past noon at 5.60, you really need to be in Italy.

[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:10.460]
Everybody who's never been in Italy.

[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:11.740]
If there is one, what?

[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:12.580]
I'm going right now.

[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.780]
No, seriously, you probably think, I want to go to Amsterdam.

[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:19.640]
The way before you would want to go to Amsterdam, trust me, you would want to go to Italy.

[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:20.920]
I think all we know is to think about.

[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.120]
It is so fabuloso, man.

[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:26.660]
It's just the food and the people and the things to see.

[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:30.860]
You walk around it and you're looking at these, it's like living in a time warp and you're

[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:33.160]
looking on the sides of these buildings on OVI.

[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:34.600]
What is that?

[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:36.700]
That's a building that's 2,000 years old.

[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.180]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:38.960]
Yeah.

[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:40.220]
I want to go.

[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:42.620]
And then of course, they got a lot of naked statues.

[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:44.380]
So John Ascroft probably don't want you to go.

[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:47.260]
But he's busy healing up from his operation, which unfortunately went okay.

[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:48.100]
Damn it.

[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:49.740]
And I'll tell you one thing.

[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:52.520]
Speaking of fat, if you're fat, you probably try in the Atkins Dime.

[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.400]
And the sugar busters with the South Beach side.

[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:57.080]
All the low carb sugar free diets are the rage non.

[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:00.880]
In fact, a lot of the food joints are pedaling low carb because they know that this is very

[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:01.440]
popular to none.

[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:04.740]
As a result, if you want to lose the weight on low carb diet, you have to keep on it.

[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:05.520]
That's the key.

[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.820]
You have to stay on it forever, really.

[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:10.360]
And the number one low carb store in the world is Delights and West Booker.

[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.600]
They've got a worth 1,000 low carb products to choose from.

[01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:15.660]
In fact, they probably got a lot of new ones too because I know this toy this copy has

[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:18.020]
dated December 31st of last year.

[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:20.420]
So it's now a piece of copy from last year.

[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:23.500]
I mean, there's plenty of stuff on here, but I was sure a toy since you're doing such

[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:24.920]
a magnificent job with everything else.

[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:27.740]
They probably really ought to check this out too with our good friends over there.

[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:32.680]
Over a thousand low carb products, including breads and bagels, cookies and crackers, chips

[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:36.620]
and brownies, chocolates, ice cream, pasta, sauces, ketchup, cheesecakes, everything

[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:37.500]
out of the sun just above.

[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:38.980]
They offer you the widest selection.

[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:41.140]
The license opens seven days a week from 10 to 10.

[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:43.280]
You can always try anything to store before you bite.

[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:44.780]
And they got a knowledgeable staff.

[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.640]
They know you're low carb dieting inside and out.

[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:50.180]
And they've got the most complete line of Atkins brand's products that you'll find anywhere.

[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.100]
And Atkins products are on sale today.

[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.080]
Next, Sookas Everyday at Delights.

[01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:58.000]
The number one low carb diet in the world is Atkins and whatever else.

[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.420]
And the number one low carb sugar free store is the lights of West Bokka on the North

[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:04.260]
East corner of Glades in 441 right next to Boston Market.

[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:07.300]
In fact, you can go next to it at Boston Market and probably get some of that meat.

[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:08.220]
Meat low?

[01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:10.260]
Okay.

[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:11.940]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:15.880]
Yes, there's a you can stick on your Atkins at Boston Market.

[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.140]
They got your turkey and stuff like that and they're still in business.

[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:23.000]
Call toll free at Delights 1-877 Low Carb L-O-W-C-A-R-B.

Or on the web it's lowcarb.com.

[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:29.280]
Don't forget to end one thing I don't think they do carry though at Boston Market is...

[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:30.680]
See you.

[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:33.980]
There's only one Delights at West Bokka.

[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:35.740]
It's your official Atkins retail center.

[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:37.240]
It's in Bokka and it's swell.

[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:42.440]
This is sports radio licensing.

[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:43.860]
You way am.

[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:48.580]
By the way, I've been giving it some stores.

[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:49.100]

[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:51.000]
Oh, what do you think it is?

[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:58.140]
I know that me and you can do much better go with 6 to 10 and not at 5.

[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.440]
A Gentile in the cranky too.

[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.380]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:09.740]
I think you really got out of your mind.

[01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:12.100]
You got to have your weary bag.

[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.540]
Strap on to tight.

[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.820]
No chance I'll do a show with you.

[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.440]
And I'd rather die.

[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:19.380]
We'd be crappy together.

[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:28.900]
Why I'll help you know that I'm a big baffin' Jew from Brooklyn Heights.

[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:34.240]
I've been raped by everybody but you.

[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:36.240]
You're not high-tie.

[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:39.840]
We involved this man with blood.

[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:43.880]
No way that if we had a fight that you'd survive.

[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:46.140]
We'd wanna hear a Gentile.

[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:47.700]
And push it tight.

[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:49.360]
That's crappy together.

[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.200]
Stop!

[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:54.180]
Stop!

[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:54.780]

[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:55.360]

[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:56.960]

[01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:57.800]
Stop!

[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:03.020]
Stop!

[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:14.320]
A show with you and me for me is much better 6 to 10 not 5.

[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:17.540]
It's only right that I should get more sleep.

[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:21.880]
Good night. I think we might be happy to get there

[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:52.820]
The Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord.

[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:57.040]
Twenty-pass noon.

[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.860]
I never let that finish all the way up before, but that time I was inspired.

[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:05.100]
Twenty-pass the hour and happy birthday.

[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:07.400]
Well, what else do you say?

[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:11.240]
Congratulations to Miguel and his lovely wife and their baby was born, a little baby boy.

[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:12.160]
You say congratulations.

[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:13.940]
Felicidades.

[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:17.360]
But you had to play like a little something.

[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:22.500]
Alright, so at any rate they had a baby boy whose name is Carlos now and I sure hope we don't turn out like

[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:26.160]
Freaky Carlos, okay, maybe a little freaky but not quite that freaky.

[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.120]
Why would you drink somebody like that?

[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:29.760]
By naming him Carlos.

[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.960]
Yeah, we've had a bad luck in our building with Carlos.

[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:33.260]
We've had three of them.

[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:38.120]
That's what it sits out of the reception desk which is, we don't know what the origin of that thing is.

[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:41.760]
And then we had our Carlos, beener boy, which had less said about that the better.

[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.520]
And then we got Carlos Pequery, whatever his name is.

[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:48.400]
Who can't quit dicking around with the equipment on the weekend and dealing with all of our stuff.

[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:51.380]
So that's 0 for 3, it sounds like to me.

[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:59.140]
But maybe it can break the spell and also Guilty, his wife had another or she's popping him out like from a pop up toaster.

[01:47:59.320 --> 01:47:59.560]
You know what?

[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:00.120]
Right.

[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:02.260]
Another one and his name is Kyle.

[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:03.660]
I hate to break the news to you, Guilty.

[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.300]
Jews don't name their kids Kyle.

[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:09.780]
On South Park you can be Kyle, but Jews don't name their kids Kyle.

[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:14.740]
I'm going to watch the South Park movie again because it'll pick me up.

[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:15.700]
Thank you very much.

[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:17.820]
Thanks for the good news about the computer.

[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:19.100]
The one that keeps it disappearing.

[01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.640]
But now that Josh has got a hold of it, don't let go of it.

[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:23.760]
It's sweet and it never and the computer too.

[01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:26.080]
What was I just saying before that?

[01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:26.620]
Kyle.

[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.000]
Oh, yeah, Kyle.

[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:29.280]
I'm going to watch that movie again.

[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:33.620]
So there was some good news and that is I want to read this one thing in case anybody must have before.

[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.380]
The Senate Commerce Committee they are moving ahead.

[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:37.700]
It's tougher in decency standards.

[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:38.840]
They want to find this one.

[01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:39.740]
They want to find that one.

[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:43.320]
Any performer goes on TV and says anything like that.

[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:44.300]
They're going to find their ass.

[01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:50.240]
But by a narrow 12 to 11 vote yesterday, the Senate Commerce Committee defeated a provision.

[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:56.000]
I would have extended the FCC oversight provisions of indecency and violence to cable and satellite programming,

[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.360]
except for pay-per-view channels such as HB.

[01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:58.600]
Oh.

[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:00.420]
So they defeated that.

[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:04.280]
So cable and satellite programming are safe for right now.

[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:07.180]
Until they get all pissed off and fired up again.

[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:08.420]
Well, we didn't go far enough.

[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.820]
Let's visit that again.

[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:11.400]
Okay, let's visit it again.

[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.120]
Love a neighbor like you'd like to be loved yourself.

[01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:15.060]
Yeah, okay.

[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:15.540]
Wow.

[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:17.300]
I don't think we can even talk about that.

[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:18.940]
No way.

[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:20.360]
Don't even know.

[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.820]
He's talking potty mouth in Ohio.

[01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:25.940]
He's going to get his ass kicked in Ohio because their unemployment rate is like over 6%.

[01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:26.400]
Right.

[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:29.560]
A lot of people out of work knows miraculous jobs that have been promising.

[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:30.340]
Well, guess what?

[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:34.140]
Just like those weapons of mass distraction that weren't there,

[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:35.280]
then jobs aren't there either.

[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:37.660]
Oh, you waiting to see this mother going to have a job?

[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:38.820]
You had a jobs report, not.

[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.860]
Well, let's see Steve faxes and says people will say,

[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.080]
Sauchich instead of Sausage.

[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:49.440]
He says mainly black people if I can say that.

[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.400]
You can't say that, Steve.

[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:52.040]
Sauchich?

[01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:52.820]
I never heard that.

[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:53.160]
Did you?

[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:54.700]
No.

[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:55.500]
Sauchich.

[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:56.240]
Sauchich.

[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:57.220]
There's some of Sauchich in the video.

[01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:58.340]
He'll say Sauchich.

[01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:00.860]
Sauchich in Prolon and Capacool.

[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:01.620]
Oh, I hate that.

[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.900]
It just makes me squirm.

[01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:07.960]
You go into an Italian market and some of the New York weedos might be shopping.

[01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:09.820]
And they say, let me have a bottle of Capacool.

[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:11.200]
Oh, man.

[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:12.160]
Kick them out of here.

[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:13.420]
Wow.

[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:16.960]
Pope had them deported faster and you can say the swish guard are fags.

[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:21.100]
John and Portse Lucis is all the guys who rupt last night because their prostrates

[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:22.400]
wouldn't allow them to remain prostrate.

[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:23.280]
Stupid plus.

[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:24.860]
Yeah, that's one of the most common.

[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:26.560]
Is that on the list?

[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.680]
I don't think I'm peak.

[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:30.200]
Not on here.

[01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:32.280]
That is one of the very most common.

[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.780]
Instead of prostrate, they'll say prostrate.

[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:35.300]
Right.

[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.120]
Prostrate yourself before.

[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:38.460]
Jesus the Lord.

[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:39.620]
Before the Lord.

[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:40.200]

[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:41.640]
No, God.

[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:45.540]
Here's the fact from somebody that's really bent out of shape, really pissed off, which is good.

[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:49.340]
If you ever visited Rome, which I have many times.

[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.900]
And will again this year's a matter of fact.

[01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:55.200]
And you still picked Honolulu, Mime, New York San Francisco, etc.

[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:55.620]
You were right.

[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:59.180]
Effing and more on it says with no taste of intelligence, flots so ever.

[01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:03.560]
Well, there must be a lot of people who have no taste at all.

[01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:05.500]
It was a tough choice for me.

[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:07.580]
I had three to choose from in my mind.

[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.600]
Toronto Amsterdam or Rome.

[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:14.560]
I'll take another city that will two more.

[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:16.020]
Neither would you run a list.

[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.540]
Let's put them on anyway because these people are too stupid to say it.

[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.380]
Berlin and Cologne, Germany.

[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:22.860]
Can you handle Cologne, Josh?

[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:24.580]
I got it.

[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:26.420]
COL OGN, Cologne.

[01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:29.380]
Or you could spell that the German way, KOLN.

[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:32.460]
But I don't think we have the thing with the two dots on our tie-brother.

[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:34.340]
You can put them in manual.

[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:40.680]
And when speaking of that, when you go to Germany into the Internet, the Internet cafes,

[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:47.720]
and you're dealing on the net, it's really kind of freaky because I'm like,

[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:50.880]
I'm still on where the keyboard is exactly the same as the one that we use.

[01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:52.280]
In Germany, it's not.

[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:59.580]
The letter Y is where the letter Z or X is.

[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:01.000]
I'm not really sure which one is that.

[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:01.960]
Or maybe, huh?

[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:02.400]
Z.

[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:05.720]
Oh, don't we just stop with that, please.

[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:10.420]
But the letter Y is way down around the bottom and the left hand.

[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:10.960]
Y.

[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:15.780]
And the at symbol, instead of being on the number two,

[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:19.160]
the at symbol is on the Q letter.

[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:24.720]
And on the keyboard, there's an extra key that you have to press for alternate, uh, whatever's.

[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:30.880]
And when you press that in the letter Q, then for example, if you do your, uh, you know, email at

[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:34.120]
a well dot com or whatever is you have to use the at symbol, it's on the Q button.

[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:35.860]
That's pretty strange.

[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:36.400]
Queer.

[01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:38.300]
Ah.

[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:44.500]
Anyway, some of these anti obesity ads, this is our surreal in one TV, which I saw this morning on CNN.

[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:47.860]
Boys playing on a beach to discover a human belly.

[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:48.580]
Did you see that one?

[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:49.560]
Yeah.

[01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:54.340]
They're poking at it and the little kids says, oh, I guess they must have left their big belly here on the beach.

[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:59.960]
Now, the implication being is very, very sublippable that if you walk it on the beach that you'll leave your big belly there.

[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:00.620]
That's right.

[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:03.340]
In another shoppers find a double chin in a grocery store.

[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:10.880]
Several print ads focus on close-up shots of heavy stomachs, thighs and buttocks, and show how they might slim down as their owners get more active.

[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:15.300]
Peggy Conlon, president of the ad council, which produces public services.

[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:20.480]
The new ads were a test market on audiences and everybody really understood them and felt motivated and then went back to sleep.

[01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:23.040]
Other city ads might offend overweight Americans.

[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.240]
See, I find that unacceptable.

[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:26.120]
Too bad.

[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:27.760]
Offensive even.

[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:34.520]
The message to eat healthier and be more active is good, but to send it up on a way that makes overweight people look disgusting is highly insensitive.

[01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:39.560]
Stigmatizing it on unnecessary says Kelly Brown, the elder director of the Yale Center for Eating and Weight Disorders.

[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:42.140]
I have two letters for you Kelly, F you.

[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:44.080]
Those are my two letters, okay?

[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:46.680]
Very simple, right to the point.

[01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:47.440]
F you, honey.

[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:53.200]
As a fat person myself, fat is disgusting, it's gross, it's ugly, it's nauseating.

[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:58.900]
And this business of always doing that, you don't have to treat fat people with the kid gloves.

[01:53:59.280 --> 01:53:59.620]
Bologna.

[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:01.820]
Bologna is good on the ad council.

[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:02.440]
Right, bologna.

[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:17.880]
I went to the new system, I was thinking about losing weight.

[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:24.920]
I stepped on the scale and they got a measure in sight.

[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:30.960]
They said, wait a minute, Rister is going so much that we can do.

[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:37.440]
I think life will suck you maybe the only thing for you.

[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:44.560]
Suck a fat off a lady, suck the salient lead.

[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:55.240]
Suck the fat off a lady, suck away, right on leave.

[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:06.960]
I don't have to die, I don't have to go and get you sized.

[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:14.080]
I don't have the word about no boldges around my thighs

[01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:20.560]
Because by the life of suction, you know I'm a brand new man

[01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:27.960]
Put up the Hoover, suck the fat out of splash you can't

[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:33.720]
Racco suck the fat out of a honey, suck the saliently

[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:41.520]
suck the fat out of a honey, hey hey hey hey

[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:44.700]
So why are you around me?

[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:51.820]
Gregory in bulk of Faction says thanks to our New Yorkers

[01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:56.860]
there is no allure against going to the turlent all-lure

[01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:00.920]
no l-a-w-r no l-a-r against going to the turlent

[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:04.440]
Only Archie Bunker is the only one to say turlent

[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.560]
Because when he says that we laugh our ass off

[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:07.400]
You like to have the lure?

[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:12.360]
When you can have a whole bunch of words with a Boston and the New York accents

[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.040]
and write a butcher to death

[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:19.820]
Speaking of being a fat, inactive Americans are eating themselves to death

[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:22.360]
at an alarming rate they're unhealthy, have its fast approaching tobacco

[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.200]
with the top underlying preventable cause of death

[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.700]
A government study found do something smart like having your stomach staple like Josh Friedman

[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:30.820]
and then you can see how good you smell

[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:33.860]
WQAM hello

[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:38.300]
Hey Neil, the one that really bugs me I don't know if you've gone through it already

[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:42.660]
is when people say statistics instead of statistics

[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:43.860]
Statistics?

[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:47.580]
Statistics, oh my god it's like a Midwestern thing in the end

[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:49.880]
It just drives me crazy

[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:51.400]
Okay thanks, Pallie

[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:51.720]
Alright

[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:55.580]
I'm saying another thing which is not a mispronunciation I guess

[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:57.520]
It's just an accent but it just bugs me

[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:59.520]
People from the Midwest say milk

[01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:04.040]
People from like Pittsburgh to the through the Midwest say am I...

[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:06.100]
Any I word it pronounced it like an E

[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:07.160]
How about my Emma?

[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:08.440]
Or they'll say Illinois

[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.180]
Oh that just drives me Illinois?

[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:11.640]
Why what is that?

[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:15.340]
Or like the guy said before his wife was right Illinois

[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:18.540]
There are people say Illinois and it sure annoys the hell out of me

[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:19.840]
I'll tell you that right now my Emma

[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.180]
Right, part fate

[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:24.840]
Irv Shindler on K.A.T used to say my Emma beach my Emma

[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:26.840]
A lot of local salty crackers say that

[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.800]
Go back to China Irv he's still alive

[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:30.760]
Can you believe that remember he called on the year a couple of years ago

[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.340]
Well we're not sure if he's still alive

[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.480]
What if he's still schlepping the China

[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:39.020]
In 2000 poor diet including obesity and physical and activity caused

[01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:40.240]
400,000 U.S. deaths

[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:42.360]
See here's the thing in cities in Europe

[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:45.220]
Although there you know the problem here in Canada is getting almost as bad as America

[01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:47.280]
Is it the same crap that people are eating

[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.240]
Same in activity

[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:54.360]
But in Europe you see very very much much smaller number of fat people

[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:55.240]
Very rare

[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.780]
The Dutch on it and I know I will say this

[01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:00.700]
Now you've explained this to me

[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:04.520]
Young Dutch people tend to be very skinny

[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:07.300]
In fact I've put it this before their bodies are like ikabod crane

[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:08.660]
Even they might have great faces

[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:11.560]
Yeah, but they're like emaciated like they have that Auschwitz look

[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.980]
And yet once they get passed about the

[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:20.360]
All of a sudden something happens they start getting like really grotesque and ballooning up and getting fat and pudgey

[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:21.380]
And what's that all about?

[01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:23.680]
I don't know I thought you said food was bad there

[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:27.900]
Maybe it takes that long for all them fries with mayo to start kicking in you know what I'm saying

[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.540]
Maybe it takes about 30 years

[01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:33.360]
And all of a sudden it just like settles in there and starts expanding

[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:38.400]
So they can wear those gigantic spandex pants on the dammarack but at any rate

[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:40.240]
In 2000

[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:43.000]
I'll get back to the thing which I interrupted myself about Italy

[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:46.200]
They're all of that pasta and you know what I think it is?

[01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:46.540]
What?

[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:47.600]
Genetic

[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:50.840]
Oh yeah, yeah you acclimate yourself to your culture's diet

[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:56.700]
Just like the Chinese look at the enormous amount of rice the Chinese that just pounds and pounds of rice

[01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:58.200]
It's the staple of their diet in China

[01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:01.240]
And yet once the last time you saw a fat Chinese person

[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:04.540]
I mean there's some but I'm in pretty damn few most of them are skinny

[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.180]
Right

[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:08.340]
With teeny tiny little bell

[01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:16.040]
In 2004 diet including obesity and physical and activity caused 400,000 U.S. deaths more than 16% of all deaths in the number 2 killer

[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:20.280]
Comparing with 435,000 for tobacco or 18% is the top underlying killer

[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:23.180]
Soon we'll be passing tobacco like it's standing still

[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:30.160]
The gap between the two substantially narrower than 1990 when poor diet and activity caused 300,000 deaths

[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:33.580]
14% compared with 400,000 for tobacco or 19%

[01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:39.020]
This is tragic since Dr. Julie Geburting, CDC's director of the study are worth fears were confirmed

[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:42.240]
Dr. Geburting she was here in Toronto last year when the SARS thing was going on

[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:43.480]
I don't think it's too close to her

[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:49.560]
It's going to overtake tobacco if the trend continues she said at CDC we're going to do everything we can to prevent it

[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:52.640]
Obesity has got to be the number one job for us in terms of chronic diseases

[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:55.480]
Right and McDonald says no more poop resizing

[01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.320]
That's what they said last week that's their response to it no more poop resizing

[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:01.080]
I got to order two orders

[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:03.780]
Yeah that's it have three orders of fries

[02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:09.100]
And then you go into your 7-11 and get the big gulp

[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:14.040]
You know that 10 gallon coke with about 4 pounds of sugar in it, it's got wheels on it

[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:18.620]
I think what they ought to do is just like take a humongous container and just put a big

[02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:20.940]
Big batch of sugar in it

[02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:21.320]
Careful

[02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:26.000]
No you know what I'm saying a big batch of sugar in it you could like just spit some water in it

[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:27.520]
Moisten up a little bit

[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:35.340]
Because that's basically what you're doing I mean if you have the diet so I mean it's a whole different story like I'm drinking gallons and gallons of my caffeine-free diet coke

[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:39.220]
Well they have not because you probably don't buy candy for children stuff like that

[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:39.740]
No I don't

[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:41.180]
I buy candy for adults

[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:46.120]
Remember the the Jolly Rancher Flavos sticks they had green apple, watermelon things like that

[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:46.620]
Oh yeah sure

[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:48.520]
They come in a liquid now so you can drink them

[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:49.380]
Oh man

[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:54.380]
So what was that stuff we used to used to be in like little wax?

[02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:57.300]
Was that a Christmas time or holiday time you know what I'm talking about?

[02:00:57.380 --> 02:00:59.200]
The wax candy with the sugary liquid in there?

[02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:00.540]
Yeah, yeah that's weak

[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:06.000]
Oh that goes back a long time back when I was a little tiny kid a hundred years ago in school we used to suck on those

[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.400]
I mean those candies

[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:08.380]
Wow

[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:14.340]
And it was used to be like all different kind of flavors grape and lime and what was the idea behind that?

[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:15.180]
What was that all about?

[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:16.800]
Sugar water

[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:18.780]
I'm waiting for my engine to start with a bunch of sugar water

[02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:22.280]
Man oh man I'm addicted to sugar the worst possible thing and pasta

[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:23.520]
Oh God

[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:26.860]
The SS the sugar would start police ought to be here

[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:29.360]
Instead of course we got bush and the other SS

[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:31.800]
There you go

[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:34.000]
WQM hello

[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.400]
Hey just COD

[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:36.640]
Yes sir I OD

[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:38.620]
I mean QAM yes

[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:41.600]
What about Wednesday?

[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:44.120]
Yeah

[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:46.480]
And what about W?

[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:47.700]
W?

[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:49.100]
WW

[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:50.540]
Is it WW?

[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:51.820]
Right

[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:53.060]
Oh the W

[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:57.100]
Yeah it's a bunch of the guys who listen to your show we love your show man

[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:58.360]
Thanks Karli have a great day

[02:01:58.360 --> 02:01:59.160]
Thank you

[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:00.720]
And vote ten times against W

[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:05.120]
Now let's see is that what was the first one you said?

[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:07.680]
Wednesday

[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:08.680]
Yeah Wednesday

[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:09.600]
I think it was another reach

[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:11.220]
No it was not

[02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:12.680]
Nobody says Wednesday

[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:14.780]
And I don't think you're supposed to

[02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:17.560]
Well it's not on here the one just look on this list

[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:20.120]
How are you really supposed to be pronouncing that? Wednesday

[02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:20.980]
Wednesday

[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:24.620]
And every Wednesday

[02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:25.260]
And every Wednesday

[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:25.820]
Wednesday

[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:26.740]
Wednesday

[02:02:28.420 --> 02:02:29.860]
That's German for Wednesdays

[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:30.400]
Mid-Fauch

[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:32.140]
Mid-Fauch

[02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:32.740]
Mid-Fauch

[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:35.620]
I will say this as much as I love Berlin and Kallon

[02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:37.400]
I haven't been anywhere else in Germany what I will

[02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:39.800]
But I still have a little

[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:43.860]
A little bit of a problem when I hear it being spoken you know

[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:46.400]
When I hear it is expressing the Deutsch

[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:47.400]
Ooh it just

[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:48.240]
Ooh yeah

[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:50.500]
There's something about it genetic in your case

[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:52.420]
All of a sudden I feel kind of like a walking Lancet

[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:53.320]
I don't know why that is

[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:59.500]
20 till 1 at 5 60 WQM down on batteries knows nothing is more important than the safety of your family

[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:03.280]
Unfortunately thousands of Americans die every year at home fires involving matrices

[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:06.520]
A common myth is that these are careless cigarette smokers but

[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:11.860]
Statistics show that the vast majority of these fires are started by a little pain in the ass kids playing with matches

[02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:16.020]
Certain now offers a new line of fire retardant matrices called fire blocker

[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:19.680]
Through dramatically stalled the spread of fires to get families critical time to escape

[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:24.240]
They're also more comfortable durable and supportive than ever say won't sacrifice comfort for safety

[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:28.060]
According to new regulations all new matrices will be fire retardant within a year

[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:28.900]
But until then

[02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:33.340]
Certain is the only major brand exceeding this fire safety standard right now today

[02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:37.260]
Dalai madris is the only retailer can deliver a new certifier blocker to you today

[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:40.980]
So column tool free 1 800 matriots right now for same day delivery

[02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:44.660]
Dalai madris has got certifier blocker in the traditional double-sided design

[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:47.360]
So you get two beds for the price of one with double the protection

[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:50.660]

It's a simple beer for a simple man

[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:19.620]
For shhh

[02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:24.100]
Whether you're watching shiny cars go real fast at Daytona

[02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:28.640]
Or simply trying to pronounce tough words like nuclear

[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:29.500]
Bush

[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:34.080]
Goes down as easy as National Guard duty in Alabama

[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:40.140]
So after a long hard day of pretending to make phone calls and trying to look busy

[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:55.180]
The President of beers

On Washer Bush say doofus Missouri

[02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:01.160]

[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.780]
When he was just making that speech only moments ago

[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:04.240]
In Cleveland

[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:07.180]

Got it

[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:13.980]
Just mention that in passing

[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:18.760]
If we had tons of cash what one city would you choose to live in

[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:20.140]

That's the one I just I see that and my head's third spinning

[02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:37.980]
What does that mean?

[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:39.380]
I don't know

[02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:43.180]

Rome 31

[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:50.720]
Why would I agree with that fact of the idea that Rome is not to embedded in this

[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:54.840]
Tells me that love you haven't been in Rome it's because if I probably should have voted for Rome

[02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:57.700]
Because if you had all the money in the world you build your own big

[02:05:57.700 --> 02:06:00.880]
Palacio or somewhere you know up in mountains lost one panace

[02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:01.580]

Well they're the little nervous when they see those German cities

[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:42.100]
I'll tell you one thing after just seeing the bush mice around my TV on CNN and Cleveland

[02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:45.440]
I worry hell of a lot less when I'm in Germany about Nazis and that kind of stuff

[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:46.600]
Then I do what I'm in the USA

[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:50.680]
Especially what's going on lately WQM hello

[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:52.040]
Yes sir

[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:54.640]
The rumors going around the Joe Mark was suspended that true

[02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:56.980]
Haven't heard nothing about it

[02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:58.520]
The rumors going around from where?

[02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:01.240]
I have an insight source they were suspended and there was a meeting

[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:02.820]
So it's the same at the clock this morning

[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:03.580]
Yeah

[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.980]
Suspended for how long?

[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:08.480]
It doesn't say it doesn't sound

[02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:11.600]
It was supposed to be a meeting today and then the decision will be here today

[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:15.860]
Also there was suspended yesterday is what you said

[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:16.900]
Right there was there was there was

[02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:17.860]
Well it came to it Paley

[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:19.660]
And we got any information on it yet?

[02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:20.280]
No no

[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:22.780]
Is there a memo out yet about it?

[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:22.940]
No

[02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:26.000]
567 05 60

[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.920]
Pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:31.740]
Lots of crap going down a radio man

[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:34.420]
Pretty soon when you turn on your radio all you're going to hear is

[02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:37.040]
The radio version of the test pattern

[02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:39.680]
Only it doesn't translate to well the radio

[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:42.940]
Like it did on TV when you used to see the thing with a little Indian on it?

[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:43.200]
Yeah

[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:45.020]
Indian head

[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:46.960]
Right the old little Indian head

[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:51.000]
By the way on CNN International they got a weather broad who's got a shrunken head

[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.680]
I don't know where the hell they found this bitch but she is the most bizarre looking creature

[02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:59.100]
And she talks like a munchkin but she's got like a little shrunken head

[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:00.480]
The czar

[02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:01.340]
WDQA and hello

[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:02.280]
Hi Neil

[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:03.060]
Yes sir

[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:06.300]
This is my annual call to you I call you about once a year how you doing?

[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:07.440]
Very well

[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:13.720]
Good I was calling to tell you that your poll numbers often times are artificially low and I can tell you why

[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:14.400]
Okay

[02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:18.220]
I work in an office where everyone shares a server

[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:21.920]
It's a pretty big office I work for a government agency somewhere in Miami

[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:22.680]
Right

[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:28.840]
And what happens is a lot of times I'll go to vote on the poll and if anyone else is on there and is already voted

[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.400]
It won't take my vote or anyone

[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:30.800]
Right

[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:32.360]
That's true with everybody right

[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:37.200]
The number of votes we get on a poll is only a tiny fraction of those people are listening thank goodness

[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:39.900]
Exactly yes a fraction so just you know

[02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:41.600]
Now do you have AOL?

[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:44.780]
No this is through work I mean

[02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:48.600]
There's something here in this building only one person in the building can vote because we share a story

[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:49.720]
I see I'll be damned

[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:53.320]
And I guess that's pretty common so anyway

[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:55.560]
Thanks for the bad news

[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:56.200]
Okay thank you

[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:02.320]
Okay hop on a real fast that's my suggestion before the any of the other pain in the ass people in the building get to their computers hop on it

[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:05.960]
612 votes on there Berlin and Cologne don't have any yet so

[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:13.640]
What do I know see this goes to show you again the broke your nature of people in Florida even though we got all this polyglot or whatever they want to call it

[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:15.580]
All these people allegedly from all over the world

[02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:17.480]
What were the hell are the people who have been in Cologne?

[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:21.340]
Anybody that's ever been in Cologne Germany isn't just obsessed with it isn't it?

[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:26.640]
To go back to that other factor about Rome Cologne is just fabulous fabulous

[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:35.480]
The things to see the people the food the ambiance even the train station area you can spend a whole day inside the train station

[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:36.980]
It's like a shopping center

[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:38.420]
Fabaloso

[02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:42.920]
And speaking of civilized places in Berlin

[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:45.820]
How did I find this I don't know

[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:53.760]
One day of course you go to lunch go a little bit too far away from the hotel and all of a sudden you're like go stepping back to the hotel real fast and just barely make it

[02:09:53.760 --> 02:10:02.740]
Luckily so I hope that wasn't going to happen again in one evening after dinner I'm walking into the easy internet cafe

[02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:05.900]
I'm going to go online and check out the what kind of crap you're doing and whatever else

[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:09.920]
And I'm thinking to myself well I got a piece of bad it's just like the end of the world here

[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:12.940]
And I don't know what they'll do maybe they'll have a pea place in the end of the cafe

[02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:20.080]
And I bought a block away right on the main drag the Kudam in Berlin right out there on a corner where there's a newsstand

[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:22.120]
And it says city WC

[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:24.940]
Well WC in Jack Parnu that was water closet

[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:27.940]
And I thought are you telling me that they actually have such a civilized place

[02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:35.220]
And you're looking there are two stairwells going down and one says D for Domest and one has H for Air and ladies and gentlemen

[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.220]
And you go down the stairs and it's just like in the train station in Cologne

[02:10:40.840 --> 02:10:49.080]
And remember these beautiful beautiful toilets van all these urinals and then of course you have to pay to do the more serious business like 50 cent

[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:55.340]
And you go through a little turnstown and got all the towers and wow what a beautiful I mean clean and antiseptic

[02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:57.380]
And just amazing right out there in the middle of the city

[02:10:57.380 --> 02:11:01.580]
So when nature is calling as opposed to like doing a number in your pants or whatever

[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:05.120]
Or like going into a total state of panic there you are

[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:07.800]
I'll still believe I mean right in the middle of the city it's fabulous

[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:10.300]
Can you imagine seeing that in Miami?

[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:12.320]
Oh no or New York

[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:18.340]
Or of course there's like an Amsterdam where they have those outdoor pee places where you stand in a green round of the thing

[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:20.460]
Where the hole that goes down to the ground

[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:23.440]
They sort of have that going in Paris don't they? It's called outside

[02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:24.980]
Yeah it's called the street

[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:28.200]
WQAM hello

[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:38.320]
Saw the body

[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:40.520]
I have no idea because either

[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:43.340]
Bad phone technique whatever was it me go

[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:44.640]
Real bad phone technique

[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:47.100]
Maybe it was just like that

[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:49.240]
WQAM hello

[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:50.520]

I'm 95, you got my truck loaded up

[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:04.540]
I'm heading out of town hopefully for good

[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:11.620]
And just listening hopefully just giving you a call to stay for one to give hope to everybody

[02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:13.180]
And so for everything we'll get there

[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:14.520]
Best of luck here pali

[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:15.540]
Bye bye bye

[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:18.100]
No problem man it's a pleasure man

[02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:23.140]
I'm feeling so happy now and I've felt this way since I'm like there in the seventh grade man

[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:23.820]
Exactly

[02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:25.480]
I'm happy and excited man

[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:26.960]
I can't believe it yes

[02:12:27.380 --> 02:12:30.840]
That's always my happiest moment is today that I'm leaving South Florida going anywhere

[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:31.800]
Good luck pali

[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:32.440]
Best of luck

[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:34.120]
Thank you very much and have a good one

[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:34.880]
Okay you too

[02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:37.080]
Or even a mediocre one wouldn't be bad

[02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:38.540]
5670560

[02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:43.920]
Pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line one of the most depressing moment

[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:47.880]
And you know a lot of people don't like hearing this I don't care I just expressing my honest opinion

[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:49.220]
Like it or not

[02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:52.460]
The pressing moment is getting off the airplane at MIA

[02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:59.800]
And walking through that jet way and all of a sudden the humidity just smacks you in the face like oh wow

[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:00.900]
Yeah the man

[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:05.360]
And you just feel like a wilted flower like a wilted pansy man it's just not a good feeling

[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:10.460]
How to do the one nineteen New York 85 Miami 75 San Francisco 47

[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:14.680]
Amsterdam 46 Naples Florida 40

[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:18.720]
That to me is a real head turner I don't I don't buy it that's got to be the crank vote of the day

[02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:20.380]
Naples Florida

[02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:22.040]
Westing 30 QM

[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:27.580]
Yeah, bye-bye. I regret life. I hop out of hop and more of that last guy. He's had not a time

[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.700]
30 QM hello

[02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:31.580]
I just speak with me. Oh please speaking

[02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:36.820]
Yeah, yes, I'd like to add Nimbin Australia to the list Nimbin

[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:40.400]
Nimbin and I M B I N

[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:41.120]
Yeah

[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:43.040]
Beautiful place

[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:44.760]
Very late back

[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:48.220]
Almost hippie tight atmosphere really

[02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:54.060]
Yeah, very open culture. It's an Amsterdam without all the tourists

[02:13:54.060 --> 02:14:00.420]
Mm-hmm kind of atmosphere going pretty open to everything

[02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:04.060]
Is it here any big city that we could put on there to anybody might

[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:06.920]
It's a day north a day's drive north of Sydney

[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:10.440]
Oh, well, it puts in the on air just still you know

[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:16.960]
Okay, thank you Sydney you got an s-y-d-n-e-y got it we got it

[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:17.920]
Excellent

[02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:26.980]
How we spell in my orca five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 80 is not what they have they have fantastic grapes there don't they my orca

[02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:29.460]
I don't know what I've never been there

[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:36.280]
Well, I'm going to have to be there know something about it. I haven't been there either is not what they're famous for is in my orca is wine and grapes

[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:37.720]
La garapa

[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:41.420]
La garopa well, I know where it's famous for la garopa that's Amsterdam

[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:49.620]
Amsterdam is one of those places where you know you keep say at least I do I keep saying I just place stuff I'm never coming back here

[02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:55.360]
And then you give it another shot and it's great. It's just it all depends on how many tourists are there

[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:59.380]
Because when there are a lot of tourists there's a whole different ambiance like my last vacation here

[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:03.540]
A lot of tourists all kinds of italianos and people from everywhere

[02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:06.880]
And even the silly-ass Brits they add to the ambiance you know

[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:12.140]
When it's just the Dutch oh I can't give me about twenty thirty hours I do a whole show on the Dutch people

[02:15:12.140 --> 02:15:14.000]
Okay, go for it

[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.000]
Mmm-mm-mm, my my my not not exactly my favorite

[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.460]
My life and love this is for trade-eal by city

[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:23.300]
Way to way

[02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:28.120]
Oh boy it's the one to two hour

[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:36.060]
Tonight on the self-discovery channel A's, double A's or D's

[02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:42.720]
Join me each week as I explore the inner workings of well myself on the self-discovery channel

[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:47.540]
I dig deep and won't stop until I've thoroughly explored well myself

[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:54.100]
So if you don't get the self-discovery channel call your cable operator and say hey I want to explore

[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:57.980]
Well myself the self-discovery channel

[02:15:57.980 --> 02:15:59.960]
Oh you'll love it

[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:02.880]
Now where's the on-spitch for this?

[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:05.180]
Oh there we go

[02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:12.480]
One o'clock at 560 WQM add-on coming over to the Humper at 4

[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:15.160]
Jim faxes and says here are two words for you

[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:18.340]
This one made famous by your buddy Dion Sanders, Venus

[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:21.320]
Instead of business, Venus, Venus

[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:25.140]
And ridiculous, pronounced, ridiculous, I beg your pardon?

[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:26.320]
I said it's right

[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:28.640]
Pronounced, ridiculous

[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:34.140]
And also Jim says please call me a quick call me Reverend Levy and hanging up on me

[02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:36.280]
I'm not Reverend and not old Evie, what does that mean?

[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:37.440]
Your gay

[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:38.580]
I think he's confused

[02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:41.340]
He's confused

[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:47.280]
Gay Republicans to run ad-serging defeat of Bushback Amendment

[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.980]
A group of gay Republicans who supported President Bush in 2000 will arrow TV

[02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:55.780]
And opposing a Bushback constitutional amendment that would prohibit gays from marrying

[02:16:56.720 --> 02:16:57.820]
The 32nd spot

[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:01.840]
By the law of Kevin Republicans who are a bunch of self-hating fangs by the way

[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:06.020]
Showed Vice President Dick Cheney at a debate four years ago saying people should be free to win or end

[02:17:06.020 --> 02:17:10.120]
In any kind of relationship they want to enter and do, the ad begins tomorrow in several states

[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:14.720]
The Vice President also says I don't think there should be necessarily a federal policy in this area

[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:16.780]
The words we agree then flash on the screen

[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:21.640]
Cheney said last week he's in port to President even though one of his daughters, Murray, is gay

[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:24.560]
Out of the closet, bull-dike, et cetera, and so on

[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:33.720]
The law of Kevin Republicans' million dollar effort to defeat the amendment includes lobbying, grass, so in other words, they're spending a million dollars to defeat the amendment for these people

[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:35.400]
Most of them are still going to vote for Bush

[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:38.500]
It's like Jews for Hitler, man, it makes no sense to me

[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:41.960]
It's like Jesus for Pontius Pilate, I don't get it

[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:45.980]
Or Jesus for... Instead of Jews for Jesus, how about Jesus for Jews?

[02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:48.280]
There you go, just like his family, I guess

[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:49.080]
In Jesus Jews

[02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:54.500]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, what's the story on a hockey punch on Thomas Tuesday?

[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:57.700]
We're running the 25 players in the league in terms of scoring

[02:17:57.700 --> 02:18:00.760]
So he's not just a cement head going around smashing people

[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:04.580]
He's a skilled player and that's one of the reason why people are concerned about this

[02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:07.400]
Because this is a player who a lot of other people even can't...

[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:10.120]
Well, they're still holding their meat, they're still bup-bup-bup-bup, like that

[02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:12.540]
I hope they really stick it to him

[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:13.920]
WDQ, why am I am hello?

[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:16.180]
Hi, Neil, how you doing?

[02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:16.840]
Yes sir, good

[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:23.060]
There's a expression out of Brooklyn, but I always hate it, everybody

[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:27.380]
When you bump into someone, they say bump, do NK

[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:32.300]
They say who might want to put that on for the old Brooklynites?

[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:36.060]
And I do want to mention one thing, I don't know if you heard the rumor

[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:42.460]
But they're saying that Tom Broca may be a possible defeat

[02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:46.520]
Yeah, we had to stir on our website, he's got two chances none and much less than none

[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:47.880]
Don't pay any attention to it

[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:49.720]
Okay, I like it as you're one of the questions

[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:53.520]
Every time I try to go to your site and I try to vote

[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:56.840]
And I hit the vote button there because I make my selections

[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:00.840]
I always get up and argue well that they can't display that page

[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:02.460]
Is there anything you suggest?

[02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:04.780]
Move to another neighborhood

[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:08.740]
No, no, seriously, it's exactly the thing that I was calling about before

[02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:12.080]
Is somebody else by you maybe down the block?

[02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:14.480]
He's got a different thing, are you using AOL sir?

[02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:15.380]
Yes

[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:16.240]
Well, there you go

[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:18.240]
Yeah, that's what I was talking about

[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:20.100]
No, AOL nothing works on AOL

[02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:21.680]
Oh, that's true

[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:24.240]
Okay, good talking to you

[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:25.260]
Good luck, you palmy

[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:28.560]
When he was talking about like little kids say I have a bunk on my A-N-E

[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:30.280]
Instead of bump, I never heard that

[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:32.060]
You ever heard little kids say I have a bunk?

[02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:33.460]
Let's be a northeastern thing

[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:35.200]
All right, I've heard boo-boo

[02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:36.440]
Mi-t

[02:19:36.440 --> 02:19:37.220]
Hey boo-boo

[02:19:38.220 --> 02:20:06.240]
Mi-t

[02:20:07.620 --> 02:20:08.680]
Oh man

[02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:15.980]
McDonald's played by health critics and fat aflattening sales has launched the biggest change to his menu in

[02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:17.160]
30 years

[02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:21.320]
30 years with its plans to give the multi-million pound prepared salad market

[02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:25.360]
multi-million pound prepared salad market

[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:27.980]
You can choose your salad topping and dressing

[02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:30.280]
You can mix and match the suit you've gotten lifestyle

[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:31.480]
Set a McDonald's spokeswoman

[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:32.480]
Who are they kidding?

[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:39.060]
However, consumers hoping to lose weight by switching from burgers to salads may be disappointed according to the interactive

[02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:41.400]
Nutrition Center on McDonald's own website

[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:42.160]
For example

[02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:50.140]
On the new menu to be launched at the end of this month a Caesar salad with chicken from error contains 18.4 grams of fat

[02:20:50.140 --> 02:20:53.280]
Compared with 11 and a half grams of fat and a standard cheeseburger

[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:57.520]
The British Nutrition Foundation told Reuters that welcome the salad menu

[02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:03.380]
But warned that salad dressings bought in fast food allister supermarkets could be very high in fat and calories

[02:21:03.380 --> 02:21:09.240]
They said they recommend a daily fat intake for minus 95 grams per day and for women 70 grams per day

[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:12.480]
So they're giving you a big son to dance

[02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:16.680]
First of all, if you really want to lose weight the only thing you're going to eat in McDonald's is the burgers without the bun

[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:17.120]
That's it

[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:20.300]
And don't be licking the ketchup off the bun

[02:21:20.300 --> 02:21:21.980]
That's one of the bad habits I have like it

[02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:23.160]
I'm still not going to McDonald's

[02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:23.520]
Certainly I know

[02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:24.460]
What?

[02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:25.500]
Fat

[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:27.440]
Well, it's got some taste to it

[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:29.180]
Yeah, I could have some taste

[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:31.500]
You know what the ketchup is loaded with don't you?

[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:33.080]
Sugar

[02:21:33.900 --> 02:21:34.320]
Azucati

[02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:39.500]
It's loaded with sugar even see that cruisable nausea that grossed out by it

[02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:42.400]
Azucati, Azucati, so sweet, it's coma inducing

[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:43.440]
Loaded with sugar

[02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:47.440]
So if you just take the buns and toss them

[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:50.320]
The best thing to do is just get it take going to the drive here window

[02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:52.140]
Eat it in a car toss the bun so nobody watches

[02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:54.660]
Or actually an Amsterdam they don't pay attention to it anyway

[02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:56.320]
That should be the freakyest thing going on there

[02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:58.380]
You can sit in there inside eating it

[02:21:58.380 --> 02:21:59.640]
No, they don't even look at you

[02:21:59.640 --> 02:22:02.960]
Just put the bun in the sack and just take the nap

[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:04.000]
Can use it as a holder

[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:07.780]
And you eat the cheeseburger, the hamburger, whatever you like without the bun

[02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:10.840]
That's where the evil comes in the bun, the bread, the starch baby

[02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:13.800]
Starts turns the sugar right away in your body and makes you

[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:16.560]
Fat is a pig and if they're still talking

[02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:18.120]
Here they're still hocking low fat

[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:20.280]
I wonder when they're going to bring snack wells back again

[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:22.160]
After the first 40 or 50 of those

[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:24.260]
It starts to pile on out a couple of pounds

[02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:25.840]
Snack wells, remember that?

[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:26.240]
Sure

[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:29.800]
Speaking of your health by the way I've got to give John Kerry something good

[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:33.580]
Finally a lot of time to quit Wafflin and be in such a nervous nilly

[02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:38.960]
Democratic presidential challenger, John Kerry has promised Americans on

[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:41.960]
Fettered access to cheaper Canadian prescription drugs

[02:22:42.700 --> 02:22:45.160]
Bringing the contentious issue to the forefront of an

[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:48.440]
Acrimonious US election campaign says the Toronto star

[02:22:49.700 --> 02:22:51.460]
Yesterday at around in Evanston, Illinois

[02:22:51.460 --> 02:22:53.120]
Why Kerry stood with Illinois governor Rod?

[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:54.840]
How you say that?

[02:22:55.180 --> 02:22:56.920]
How you say that?

[02:22:56.920 --> 02:23:00.300]
A leading proponent of drug re-importation and an elderly couple of

[02:23:00.300 --> 02:23:03.280]
Suzy US government for denying them cheaper Canadian medications

[02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:07.240]
Under a democratic administration, Kerry promised America seniors would no

[02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:10.460]
Longer have to choose between affordable medicine or basic necessities

[02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:13.800]
Such as food and housing instead of taking immediate action on

[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:16.140]
Re-importation the lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors

[02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:19.440]
Kerry said the Bush administration is using taxpayer dollars to

[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:22.240]
Unadged to convince Americans that they passed meaningful prescription

[02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:23.220]
Dredgery forum

[02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:27.060]
Bush severly insist on tax cuts as he steadily loses jobs in his

[02:23:27.060 --> 02:23:30.460]
Country he steadily refuses to allow the importation drugs from Canada

[02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:32.500]
While steadily the prices are going up

[02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:34.160]
Nice going boy

[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:37.400]
As Kerry was sticking a Democrat on Capitol Hill announced he would

[02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:42.220]
Stalled an omination of former FDA chief Mark McCullen the most visible opponent to Canadian

[02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:45.120]
Dredgery importation to a key Medicare post nice going

[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:50.120]
Byron Durgan North Dakota senator said he was acting because McCullen refused to

[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:53.860]
Explain why he was blocking America's access to Canadian prescription medicines

[02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:59.080]
All the lies all they ripoffs just keep gouging a public all those Canadian

[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:02.700]
Drugs do not say they might come from like a Kuala Lumpur and they might come right

[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:06.320]
Maybe they come out of your back bone L. Nose

[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:09.920]
Lie and lie and lie to the public and just rip them off

[02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:11.160]
That's why I don't understand

[02:24:11.660 --> 02:24:15.120]
You think that most people in America were wealthy that they that they loved the big

[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:19.020]
Businesses they loved Walmart they loved all the big drug companies that are gouging them and raping them

[02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:22.940]
They like it they're told they like mo they enjoy gang rape I don't know what it is

[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:27.980]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line

WQ and hello Nail yes sir how's it going pretty good

[02:24:32.620 --> 02:24:36.500]
It's one of that's your quick question. Do you know what happened with a dual mark?

[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:39.480]
No WQ and hello

[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:46.100]
How you doing pretty good two things one is I don't know if you've used this word or this term yet

[02:24:46.100 --> 02:24:51.180]
But the way George Bush pronounces nuclear he says nuclear we've been there we've been there that one yes

[02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:55.980]
Oh and also I just want to say will you just mention about Bush well you know I was here he's steady

[02:24:55.980 --> 02:25:00.000]
And he has these ideas and he sticks with them the only problem is they're all the wrong ideas

[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:03.340]
Mm-hmm. Anyway have a great day and you too well sir

[02:25:03.340 --> 02:25:08.340]
Yeah he sticks with his ideas the only problem is most of them are pretty damn bad

[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:15.460]
But we had that interim constitution sign in Iraq what's not to like all we had some more innocent bystanders died over

[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:17.640]
This morning again worth it yeah

And there's still a pin in their pants about a civil war between the Shiites and the Asunis

[02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:28.680]
Because it's a bunch of religious nuts we had about as much business going in the areas we have

[02:25:29.100 --> 02:25:33.960]
As we had put in a Aristide on that plane if they wanted to kill him go ahead have a good time you know the rebels

[02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:38.660]
We had to be playing the crystals and he's a rebel the rebels and they'll never be any good

[02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:44.580]
If you had tons of cash which one city would you choose to live in that's our poll quest on theorogers.com

East Binan Berliner 688 votes it was JFK called in from the other side the original one

[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:09.160]
Well speaking of JFK what a psychic for my governor how are you?

[02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:12.860]
I'm gonna show on how we're deemed flipping them a pancakes. He was good at that you know what this he was

[02:27:15.380 --> 02:27:20.600]
I think he may have a future in that because everyone landed right on a plate in fact he could let out a big

[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:25.380]
Whatever you with every pancake that flood lands on your plate. I like it. Nice going Howard

[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:30.120]
He turned out to be well I don't want to go through it. You know did a lot of good things yada yada yada

[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:36.140]
And and they've shown that thing on CNN four million times already about Joe Trippi in the campaign and how to all fell apart

[02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:41.940]
They keep showing it like every ten minutes on CNN is those somehow they're trying to apologize for making such an ass at them

[02:27:41.940 --> 02:27:44.760]
But the fact that it matters is the people at CNN aren't the ones that voted

[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:50.280]
And most of the people have voted including Iowa and everywhere else voted for somebody else

[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:54.640]
So thanks for doing some good stuff and stirring some people up Howard but now it's time to move on

[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:55.100]

[02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:48.260]
That great bratwurst the curry worst whatever kid curry worst whatever it's great and you go right next door to Netherlands and it's like food what's that we're too busy with the sex and drugs

[02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:53.820]
We don't know from food so if you want to eat go to Germany if you want sex and drugs go what next go and then get out

[02:33:55.140 --> 02:34:00.000]
So that last call they made it worthwhile right there it was a good time to hand the reins over to Josh

[02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:45.540]
This sucker punch and I take my take if it obviously it was an out of bounds hit but within the framework of hockey

[02:35:45.540 --> 02:35:52.960]
Which is a very bad no no no has a lot of great bell ski I'm gonna tell you I get a baseball bed smack this guy over

[02:35:52.960 --> 02:36:00.800]
long it's ever happened probably and quite frankly whenever retaliation hockey doesn't happen with a stick I'm sort of pleased because I think oh my god

[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:10.740]
This guy had a broken neck he sucker punched him from behind he grabbed him by the back of his jersey a sucker punch him in the head from behind and smashed him down to the ice he had his head on the ice and

[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:18.800]
As a broken neck in this guy saying well Luster wasn't with a stick you know where are these people coming from your crazy people your crazy crazy

[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:24.680]
People and that's why they gave a hockey itself the structing because Gary Benton is a moron because the people in this sport like Don

[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:34.160]
Cherry are morons they don't get it there's no room there's no place for this crap the holding and clutching in a hooking there's no game going on it's just a bunch of guys trying to

[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:43.360]
Would have picked as much damage is like the WWF on ice it's ridiculous but anyway am I gonna upset about it I just can't believe they put some

[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:49.140]
Schmuck on air like this but then again at CNN what do you expect defending it like oh it wasn't so bad a

[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:57.920]
New study speaking of the media new study of how the media's covered the issue of weapons of mass destruction released today concludes many stories

[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:05.380]
Stenographically reported the incumbent administrations perspectives on WMAW MD giving two little critical examination of the way officials

[02:37:05.380 --> 02:37:12.600]
Frame the events issues threats and policy options the other three main conclusions of the study conducted by the Center for International

[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:20.500]
and Security Studies in Maryland and the University of Maryland said two fused stories offered alternative perspectives to the official line on WMD

[02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:24.800]
Surrounding the right conflict most journalists accepted the Bush administration linking the war on terror

[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:32.800]
Inextricably the issue of WMD and most media outlets represented WMD is a monolithic menace without distinguishing between types of weapons and

[02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:36.060]
Between possible weapons programs and the existence of actual weapons

[02:37:37.180 --> 02:37:46.280]
The authors of the study state that poor coverage of WMD resulted less from political bias on a part of journalists editors and producers than from tired journalistic conventions

[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:52.420]
They also declared that the British media reported more critically on public policy than their American colleagues

[02:37:53.060 --> 02:38:00.300]
But a shock in a forward to the study John Steinbruner director of the Center writes the American political system is in the early stages of

[02:38:00.300 --> 02:38:10.320]
Contending with an unwelcome but ultimately unavoidable problem the US initiated war against Iraq on the basis of an inaccurate representation of the scope and immediacy of the threat posed and did so without international authority

[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:16.640]
That is prejudice the legitimacy of the occupation thereby undermining the single most important ingredient of successful reconstruction

[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:23.740]
He adds that the American media did not play the role of checking and balancing the exercise of power that the standard theory of democracy requires

[02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:29.600]
Amen! Well said nice going you go boy! The media sucks! Make no mistake about it

[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:37.700]
Just all jump on the bad way I'm going to come up with this so we had on MSNBC the wall of heroes with all the pictures on the wall

[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:44.160]
All the nameless pictures for the most part and then of course both all the networks operation Iraqi freedom

[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:46.660]
The media is sick and it's not badly

[02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:49.600]
Where were they come from all of a sudden I thought it was you know I

[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:57.140]
Thought it was because of those WMDs and 45 minutes away from some grotesque horrendous event that was going to take place

[02:38:57.140 --> 02:39:00.540]
Some nauseating attack all of these things

[02:39:01.220 --> 02:39:07.640]
Well I didn't go to where we're not we're not going to pan out so we'll come up with some other basis for this even though we decided it five years ago

[02:39:09.780 --> 02:39:15.460]
This man ought to be in peace he ought to be in impeachment hearings right now he and Cheney both should have been impeachment hearings months ago

[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:21.520]
And he had to say we see him going around the country speaking with his 170 million dollar war chest

[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:25.200]
Would that stupid look on his face that during a headlights look?

[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:30.460]
And he just goes on and he had to spend hours and hours on CNN on the hockey punch

[02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:33.200]
How many people do you think watching CNN care about hockey?

[02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:34.140]
Five third man

[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:44.520]

The hopeful next first lady should think twice before display for big foe may guns and or see

[02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:36.340]

[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:41.980]
Our Dean is right

Watch it and see our Dean's eyes

[02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:58.460]
133 at 560 w. Cum got some bad news well we did know a little bit about this before but we had a lie

[02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:06.800]
Yeah, right right Joe marked Vlad and Anthony barring some reversal of fortune are no longer with the radio station

[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:13.480]
They're appealing for what it's worth but for what it's worth like the Buffalo Springfield said right how many sent is it worth

[02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:20.300]
So ever there was some kind of an episode some kind of a sexual escape that took place on her show I don't know how many days ago

[02:43:20.300 --> 02:43:23.060]
I don't know

[02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:29.320]
No and at any rate that was the straw that broke the camel's back and what can I say

[02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:31.840]
A sign of the time

[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:38.360]
It's a sign of the times everything if you fart the wrong flavor and you would think that with what's going on right now

[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:42.460]
You'd really think that if people were what would I been saying you know instead of being stupid and stubborn

[02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:48.680]
Just cut it back a while give it a little rest right now try to tell for real that he listen no no

[02:43:50.380 --> 02:43:56.160]
And I was doing mark bye-bye pretty sad do we have any idea what's gonna be on the night overnight two to five and a more

[02:43:56.160 --> 02:44:02.300]
No I don't probably you know can not sports whatever that awful sports thing we got

[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:05.460]
What is that thing that we run on Friday sporting news radio

[02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:13.480]
Oh my god holy moly of course parents alike because it's sports sports speaking of sports Damien Cox in the Toronto Star Day and the

[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:18.620]
Virtuesie hearing for those ten people out there who care has been postponed till this afternoon as far as no more news on it

[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:25.980]
But Damien Cox is really good calmness in the star says hockey's culture of violence must end don't expect the NHL to raise its voice

[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:31.700]
He says Todd Virtuesie has no defense sadly like Martin McSorley match onsen all the other

[02:44:31.700 --> 02:44:38.680]
Amai's dogs that have created mayhem and hurt people before him Virtuesie will nonetheless have his defenders the mad cycle of NHL

[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:46.640]
Violence goes round and round largely because the industry is so devoid of two leaders willing to separate themselves from the pack mentality that defines the politically correct lines

[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:53.580]
And so many issues that line heard over and over yesterday was that Virtuesie's unprovoked unmoorned and cowardly attack on Colorado's

[02:44:53.580 --> 02:44:57.740]
Steve Moore two nights ago that left more with a fractured neck was an unfortunate incident

[02:44:58.700 --> 02:45:01.680]
Unfortunate price sickening despicable and in a front of the sport

[02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:07.880]
But you won't hear that from this league an environment in which goalies were once labeled as sissy's for wearing masks and players thought of his

[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:14.220]
Less than manly for wearing helmets you won't hear a player or coach or GM or union rep stand up and call for justice on behalf of Moore

[02:45:14.220 --> 02:45:22.180]
You likely won't hear any significant figures in the sport demand the NHL put an end to these vicious incidents that every two or three years lines won't release players in a criminal court

[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:29.200]
You're only here excuses and cliches and silence and empty apologies it's all part of a sick age old hockey mentality

[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:34.800]
A running back in a football can cut your whole and get drilled by a mental linebacker and then shake off the blow and retreat to his huddle

[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:39.320]
He doesn't demand that a player on his own team cross to the other heartland challenge that linebacker to a fight

[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:46.200]
And hockey however every clean hit is an insult to be avenged every issue to those who believe in this culture is best resolved with fists

[02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:50.540]
You hit our guy we high stick you you knock our guy out we put your guy in a hospital

[02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:54.960]
As long as that remains the dominant mentality people like Steve Moore will have to suffer now and then

[02:45:55.460 --> 02:46:03.360]
Virtusies boss Vancouver Conace Baja and Brian Burke suggested yesterday that this incident should not be compared to Martin McSorley's infamous chop to the head of Donald

[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:05.960]
Bershear four years ago, Burke's right this one's worse

[02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:12.840]
Bershear at least had spard with McSorley earlier in that game more on the other hand had done nothing to Bertusie during Monday's game

[02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:19.680]
Yet Bertusie stocked more with the game far out of hand in favor of the abs ostensibly the seek revenge for a head against the teammate three weeks earlier

[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:29.220]
When Moore turned his head to continue playing the game the 6-4245 pound Bertusie struck with two cowardice diving his glove fist into the side of the unsuspecting Moore's head

[02:46:29.220 --> 02:46:36.460]
As Moore fell Bertusie used his forearm to drive his opponents head into the ice as Moore lay there face down an unconscious in a pool of blood

[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:38.980]
Bertusie drew his arm back to punch him again

[02:46:39.660 --> 02:46:45.560]
Thank goodness Andre Nicoletian Moore's team it was there to prevent the killer shot and it might have well been a killer shot

[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:53.320]
There was pre-meditation that was intent to injure there was extreme violence for this Bertusie should forfeit is right to participate in the National Hockey League

[02:46:53.320 --> 02:46:59.120]
He should be banned for the rest of the season including the playoffs and if someone wants to make arguments for a permanent ban I'd sure be willing to listen

[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:04.600]
Moore over Bertusie's coach smirking Mark Crawford should receive it in forest holiday as well

[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:11.940]
He could have called off the dogs in the third period with his team down by six schools but instead kept pushing Brad May and Wade Brookbank over the boards to create more trouble

[02:47:11.940 --> 02:47:17.120]
He helped create the blood loss that encouraged Bertusie to do something terrible so call the courts in one more time

[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:22.660]
Hand down the stiff suspensions one more time and then watch the sixth cycle of NHL violence begin anew

[02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:25.480]
Right's the outstanding Damien Cox today's Toronto star

[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:26.480]
Oh, that's going Damien

[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:29.620]
But nevertheless does anybody care?

[02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:29.820]
No

[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:31.960]
I know George is whipped up about it he's pretty pissed off

[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:32.500]
But what?

[02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:33.920]
That thing

It's a beautiful city and beautiful people but I'll because I enjoy staying stuck home I just like saying it

[02:52:03.960 --> 02:52:13.160]
She'm on you so shame on you by the way have you seen some of those bad boys at the new rampy

[02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:17.180]
Now what are you

[02:52:17.180 --> 02:52:21.540]
Cackling about a good is this my god a

[02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:29.340]
Million producers in the world and they stick me in here with an egg

[02:52:32.120 --> 02:52:34.160]
She's my god

[02:52:35.160 --> 02:52:36.200]
I'm a castle

[02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:47.160]
Oh no you're supposed to be such a nice boy and now you're for a couple yeah but you can't shut it off you can't shut it off

[02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:50.820]
I don't need this

[02:52:50.820 --> 02:52:54.080]
It offers from other stations

[02:52:55.220 --> 02:52:56.100]
Catavia

[02:52:56.820 --> 02:52:58.080]
El Maira

[02:52:58.080 --> 02:52:59.500]
Fred Doia

[02:52:59.500 --> 02:53:07.120]
But instead I stay here and entertain you grotesque sub-human dude bag

[02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:09.440]
Unbelievable

[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:11.500]
To meet the hell

[02:53:11.500 --> 02:53:13.680]
Hello is this Neil Rogers

[02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:16.080]
What kind of phone are you on sir?

[02:53:16.620 --> 02:53:17.620]
How's that again?

[02:53:17.620 --> 02:53:20.320]
Do you have a dial phone or a watt?

[02:53:20.860 --> 02:53:23.080]
No I have to put it to the operator

[02:53:23.620 --> 02:53:25.040]
Ha ha ha ha

[02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:26.580]
Let's

[02:53:28.480 --> 02:53:30.100]
Let's not get into that

[02:53:30.100 --> 02:53:34.620]
Hey I was listening to Joey Reynolds on WKBW last night

[02:53:34.620 --> 02:53:35.920]
Somebody asked him

[02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:38.400]
Did you hear what he's been saying about you?

[02:53:38.740 --> 02:53:42.380]
No I don't listen anymore he's a daughtering old man

[02:53:42.380 --> 02:53:44.500]
He claims he's only 40

[02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:48.200]
Yeah right and do we be true in two?

[02:53:50.060 --> 02:53:52.560]
Oh shut a girl for a second

[02:53:53.360 --> 02:53:57.040]
And if you think he's bad now, what it totally happens?

[02:53:57.440 --> 02:53:59.060]
Oh boy

[02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:01.260]
Okay let me come back

[02:54:01.260 --> 02:54:04.280]
Maybe the egg will come out of his shell

[02:54:04.280 --> 02:54:05.360]
But let's hope that

[02:54:06.780 --> 02:54:09.060]
148 dear days we've said it about what's your name?

[02:54:09.220 --> 02:54:10.040]
I hope what's your name?

[02:54:10.060 --> 02:54:11.360]
We still listening whoever wanted to hear that

[02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:11.920]
Hey what's your name?

[02:54:11.980 --> 02:54:12.780]
Don't forget to play that

[02:54:12.780 --> 02:54:13.360]
Okay

[02:54:15.220 --> 02:54:17.520]
5670560, pound 5680 on the AT&T line

[02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:19.300]
Bad news, John Mark Adios

[02:54:19.300 --> 02:54:21.100]
What can I say? Good guys but

[02:54:21.780 --> 02:54:23.580]
See I'm not going to make too much comment

[02:54:23.580 --> 02:54:26.840]
Because I don't really know the details of what happened

[02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:29.500]
So on the one hand we're sorry to see them go

[02:54:29.500 --> 02:54:32.560]
We're also sorry to see the destruction of QM

[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:33.700]
Did I just mention this yesterday?

[02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:37.820]
And today we had no inkling yesterday that any of this was coming now with John Mark

[02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:42.440]
But talking about sitting and watching the whole place disintegrating around us

[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:45.160]
Like watching the fall of Pompeii

[02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:46.440]
This is a tragic

[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:50.700]
We had the Humper on the right on the edge on the cusp of extermination

[02:54:52.040 --> 02:54:54.540]
And he had to come back and apologize yesterday

[02:54:54.540 --> 02:54:56.380]
What is tailed between his fat thighs

[02:54:56.380 --> 02:54:58.660]
And here we are now with John Mark Adios

[02:54:58.660 --> 02:54:59.300]
Bye bye

[02:54:59.300 --> 02:55:01.420]
What the hell is going to happen next?

[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:03.540]
I got some ideas

[02:55:03.540 --> 02:55:04.340]
Absolutely

[02:55:04.340 --> 02:55:06.000]
Now are you going to pick on Mo again?

[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:07.300]
What? What did I say?

[02:55:07.420 --> 02:55:08.540]
Actually we hardly even talk you

[02:55:08.540 --> 02:55:10.600]
I don't know because he's got so boring to me

[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:12.680]
I just have no interest in him no more

[02:55:13.420 --> 02:55:13.900]
You know?

[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:15.160]
Yeah

[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:17.680]
I heard him for the first time in here this morning at 7.15

[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:19.660]
When I crawl out of bed and get my ass in here

[02:55:19.660 --> 02:55:22.300]
And I just open the pot and smoke a little bit

[02:55:22.300 --> 02:55:26.080]
And I listened to him and he was doing all the stuff we talked about yesterday

[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:28.240]
OJ and the Steel and the Satellite signals

[02:55:28.240 --> 02:55:29.940]
And Tonya Harding with a hockey

[02:55:29.940 --> 02:55:31.640]
And I thought this is

[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:35.960]
And he was trying to make some horrible awful jokes about OJ

[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:37.620]
And all the cop shows he was watching

[02:55:37.620 --> 02:55:38.600]
It was just tragic

[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:39.840]
Absolutely

[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:42.340]
And I thought to myself, Jim Sarni's got a good point

[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:44.720]
WQM Hello

[02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:46.060]
Dale

[02:55:46.060 --> 02:55:47.120]
Yes sir

[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:48.620]
How about Aspen?

[02:55:49.140 --> 02:55:49.480]
Or any other...

[02:55:49.480 --> 02:55:50.220]
Aspen Colorado

[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:53.860]
Yeah, because of any of the skivers or as long as you don't have to work in it

[02:55:53.860 --> 02:55:54.900]
It's not a little playing, alright?

[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:56.900]
There you go, you got it, okay pal, you got it

[02:55:56.900 --> 02:55:59.820]
Aspen Colorado, you got it, Josh? Good, he got it

[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:01.200]
WQM Hello

[02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:04.120]
Yeah, I was going to vote for San Francisco

[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:06.880]
But obviously that's already been put on the list, great city

[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:09.460]
My other recommendation would have been Turin, Italy

[02:56:09.860 --> 02:56:10.740]
Oh, Turin, no

[02:56:10.740 --> 02:56:13.300]
Turin, a terrific, it's an hour from the mountains

[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:16.580]
It's right there on the water, it's not too large, not too big

[02:56:16.980 --> 02:56:20.020]
It's small, it's just about right, it's a great place

[02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:23.100]
And not well run over by the tourist yet like Venice

[02:56:23.100 --> 02:56:24.880]
And foreign, the rest of the places

[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:27.260]
Okay, I'm going to have to put it on my itinerary

[02:56:27.260 --> 02:56:29.000]
It's a, yeah, you'll enjoy it, yeah, it's right

[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:30.780]
Especially if you go to the summary, you'll have a great time

[02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:35.840]
Listen real quick, the mojo drops, the stupid and the no and gain all those

[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:38.980]
Other than the website anytime soon

[02:56:40.580 --> 02:56:42.620]
Well, they should probably should be stupid

[02:56:42.620 --> 02:56:45.080]
I like the one where he says, take off those checkered pants

[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:46.000]
That's one of my favorite

[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:47.960]
Actually, stupid is around our house all the time

[02:56:47.960 --> 02:56:50.440]
So it'll be, actually if you did a keychain with it, that would have been great

[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:53.540]
I know you did one with that, but you couldn't use all of them so I appreciate it

[02:56:53.540 --> 02:56:58.000]
And then obviously it's always a request, a standing request for I'ma and these boring

[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.020]
That is just the best

[02:57:00.020 --> 02:57:02.040]
Good, he's showing up now, he's all over the place

[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:04.820]
They confirmed the political maven of 2004

[02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:09.400]
Oh, I haven't helped us all the while at least he's for carrying anyways so there's something

[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:11.960]
Okay, now, have a great day, yeah, for now is right

[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:13.960]
Until I carry, I look in the cross side

[02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:16.500]
Well, a little bit, I'm a smanner

[02:57:16.500 --> 02:57:21.780]
There's proof boys and girls if you have no, well, he used to have talent years ago, you know, about how many years ago

[02:57:21.780 --> 02:57:22.840]
About 30, man

[02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:24.720]
More like 50, I'll take your word for it

[02:57:25.180 --> 02:57:30.860]
But even post death, you can still be making big bucks and be legendary and beyond, you know, on a network that nobody watches

[02:57:30.860 --> 02:57:32.560]
And radio stations and all that

[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:33.440]
I'll wait till we play the bit

[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:36.140]
You got to run on there to you, RIN, to the ENO

[02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:42.140]
I got a lot more cities in Italy than I need to see yet, I have a venancy is not one on my, I don't want to see a venice

[02:57:42.140 --> 02:57:43.600]
So I'll smell those canals, what?

[02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:45.360]
Still waiting for your report on Prague

[02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:47.120]
Have a minute yet

[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:48.100]
So I'm waiting

[02:57:48.100 --> 02:57:53.380]
Maybe later this year, like in Augusto, August Prague would have passed a lot of, a zillion places to go

[02:57:53.380 --> 02:57:57.740]
So little time and so many wonderful places to see and here we sit at QAM

[02:57:58.440 --> 02:57:59.760]
I am local

[02:58:00.260 --> 02:58:00.740]
I'm here

[02:58:00.740 --> 02:58:02.800]
This was radio 560, thank you very much

[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:03.760]
Thank you very much, you AM

[02:58:05.480 --> 02:58:06.620]
It's a boring

[02:58:06.620 --> 02:58:09.560]
What's better than a live radio show every morning on TV?

[02:58:09.880 --> 02:58:10.880]
Well, just about anything

[02:58:10.880 --> 02:58:14.880]
The pad hasn't stocked MSNBC from teeming up with radio's original bad boy

[02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:16.320]
Who now looks like an SDL ring

[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:19.300]
Listen Bernie, I'm a sell-out internist, coffee sucks

[02:58:19.300 --> 02:58:23.100]
Yes, every morning, see, I'm a sluss and do a tape of other people's county bits

[02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:24.340]
Live, I'm the air

[02:58:24.340 --> 02:58:25.900]
I need a hammer to bite into this muffin

[02:58:25.900 --> 02:58:27.800]
Somebody have asked for a press one plate like you

[02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:29.820]
See his wild behind the scenes at it

[02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:33.120]
I'm not gonna make them, I am the eye-manuel, walrus, cucko-catchew

[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:34.840]
Now get me some fresh coffee or your fire

[02:58:34.840 --> 02:58:36.440]
I'm a S.E.Z. reverent

[02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:37.660]
So I want to deal with the poor

[02:58:37.660 --> 02:58:38.700]
P.E.Z. topical

[02:58:38.700 --> 02:58:40.400]
So I want to deal with his water game play

[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:41.700]
P.E.Z. in coherent

[02:58:41.700 --> 02:58:44.060]
I'll tell you what, that's a double representant

[02:58:44.060 --> 02:58:44.980]
What the hell is this bottle?

[02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:47.740]
P.E.Z. I understand he's going to ring

[02:58:47.740 --> 02:58:49.700]
And he's only on MSNBC

[02:58:49.700 --> 02:58:51.180]
A cable channel, nobody watches

[02:58:51.180 --> 02:58:53.560]
And a bunch of AM radio stations, nobody listens to

[02:58:53.560 --> 02:58:56.360]
And when somebody gets some fresh jingo, it's I.L.S.

[02:58:56.360 --> 02:58:58.020]
He's only been dead for 18 years

[02:58:58.020 --> 02:58:58.520]
Oh right

[02:58:58.520 --> 02:59:00.300]
He's still going strong, it's amazing

[02:59:02.380 --> 02:59:04.680]
157, we got the mad dog coming by next to it

[02:59:04.680 --> 02:59:06.220]
Did anybody tell us what's going to be on the schedule?

[02:59:06.220 --> 02:59:08.760]
See, I could go off into a whole thing now about clearance

[02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:10.120]
I mean, I probably better not

[02:59:11.400 --> 02:59:12.420]
You know what I mean?

[02:59:12.440 --> 02:59:12.560]
No

[02:59:12.560 --> 02:59:14.880]
No, it reminds me of the scene in the Godfather

[02:59:14.880 --> 02:59:16.300]
Remember when they're coming down the stairs?

[02:59:17.240 --> 02:59:18.540]
Sonny in the Tom Hagen

[02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:21.460]
And he says, if I had a wartime consulieri

[02:59:21.460 --> 02:59:23.100]
And he says, pop had a...

[02:59:23.100 --> 02:59:24.820]
J.K.O, the quote I got

[02:59:25.340 --> 02:59:26.700]
Oh, I'm sorry, didn't mean that

[02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:27.560]
Mom made some...

[02:59:27.560 --> 02:59:28.780]
It's up there, you know

[02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:31.740]
If pop...

[02:59:31.740 --> 02:59:34.380]
If I had a wartime consulieri, I wouldn't be in this mess right now

[02:59:34.380 --> 02:59:35.480]
And it's the same thing at QA

[02:59:35.480 --> 02:59:39.020]
And this is the time for a wartime program director, not a little boy

[02:59:39.480 --> 02:59:41.680]
Who's got a bunch of little friends from the University of Miami

[02:59:41.680 --> 02:59:43.820]
Who sit around and are like playing radio

[02:59:43.820 --> 02:59:45.460]
How many times have I said that about giving...

[02:59:46.040 --> 02:59:48.100]
Turning over your radio station to a bunch of little children

[02:59:48.100 --> 02:59:49.320]
Who are playing radio

[02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:50.460]
About 30 men

[02:59:50.900 --> 02:59:52.280]
Just this month, I think

[02:59:52.280 --> 02:59:54.240]
And so in the 10th

[02:59:54.760 --> 02:59:57.640]
We can't afford the luxury of having people sit in the mouth

[02:59:57.640 --> 02:59:58.720]
Learning the business, I mean

[02:59:58.720 --> 03:00:02.720]
See, we're back in the day, eight million years ago

[03:00:03.200 --> 03:00:05.500]
Back in the day, once upon a time in America

[03:00:05.500 --> 03:00:07.200]
You'd start out in a business

[03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:08.820]
At the bottom and you'd work your way up

[03:00:08.820 --> 03:00:11.520]
You'd start out in Canada, when New York and Batavia, New York

[03:00:11.520 --> 03:00:14.580]
And Sturgis, Michigan, and Albion, Michigan, and places like that

[03:00:14.580 --> 03:00:17.280]
And you'd work your way up to hopefully the big time

[03:00:17.280 --> 03:00:19.560]
Whatever your talents would take you to

[03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:24.380]
Not anymore, I guess it's like that with everything else too

[03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:26.180]
Let's start at the top and then move up

[03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:29.000]
Start at the top and then make greater demands

[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:30.560]
Well, I mean, clearance is a good guy

[03:00:30.560 --> 03:00:32.620]
And gets my paycheck so on time and that's all well and good

[03:00:32.620 --> 03:00:35.560]
But I think that he needs to have a little assistance

[03:00:35.560 --> 03:00:37.720]
Maybe from up or somebody else in that building

[03:00:37.720 --> 03:00:39.220]
Sitting down with various people

[03:00:39.220 --> 03:00:41.100]
Which I've requested this very specifically

[03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:43.200]
That they need to talk to some of the people

[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:45.540]
That were explaining the lay of the land or what's going on right now

[03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:47.160]
The audience, like I told you before

[03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:49.460]
To show this morning, the audience still doesn't get it

[03:00:49.460 --> 03:00:51.580]
They're pissed off that Howard got taken off the year in Miami

[03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:54.320]
And the other five clear channel markets

[03:00:54.320 --> 03:00:55.340]
They're pissed off about that

[03:00:55.340 --> 03:00:57.260]
But they don't understand it

[03:00:59.100 --> 03:01:01.400]
This is so chilling what's going on right now

[03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:04.600]
And so limiting and so scary that there are no words to describe it

[03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:06.560]
None that we can f***ing say on a year

[03:01:07.940 --> 03:01:10.700]
And so I don't know all the details of the Joe and Mark business

[03:01:10.700 --> 03:01:13.560]
But it's like I said, it's really sad watching everything kind of crumbling

[03:01:13.560 --> 03:01:14.680]
And just sitting around you

[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:16.860]
While Pia silly little kids are sitting around

[03:01:16.860 --> 03:01:18.740]
Picking each other's nose and talking about

[03:01:18.740 --> 03:01:20.720]
Sports and ball games and crap like that

[03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:23.480]
You think when you deal with a multi-million dollar business

[03:01:23.480 --> 03:01:25.780]
With a stock exchange listed company

[03:01:25.780 --> 03:01:28.600]
You think that you'd probably have like people over the age of 10

[03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:30.580]
In charge and taking care of business

[03:01:30.580 --> 03:01:31.120]
See what I'm saying?

[03:01:32.180 --> 03:01:34.080]
I don't know, what do I know

[03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:36.600]
My dog is coming up next, that's what I do know

[03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:38.600]
And then a Humper who's back with a stankalore

[03:01:39.540 --> 03:01:41.000]
Humper's hanging on Beth Redd

[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:42.920]
For the stankal and put down the forecang

[03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:51.900]
Bye, bye, bye
