[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]
How it how it's bad. Oh

[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.680]
I'm a shun the city what's this thing called electricity?

[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.500]
L.A. where it's hot muggy ain't no place for a horse and buddies

[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.920]
They might go on a vendor where a big hat's in funny suspenders

[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.280]
Listen to that. Oh, it's a different world

[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.480]
No folks so you can't call girls come on come on and raise that barn

[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.440]
They can't swear they can just say

[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.180]
If you miss it, the city these kids they can't stay the same because they're honest in the city

[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.460]
Because they're honest in the city

[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.140]
No more eating only mutton they can use zippers instead of buttons

[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.800]
First time see it a computer going for lunch at a place called hooters

[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.560]
Car's home never heard street noise and it's the first time they've ever seen a homeboy

[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.360]
Listen in back home. It's a different thing

[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.820]
No tattoos or belly rings come on come on and feel no guilt when you get home

[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:11.400]
You can do this that will L.A. the place is so pretty if they say how will they survive when they're honest in the city when they're honest in the city

[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.880]
I'm dying over here

[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.480]
You

[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.180]
It's 1117 at 560 WQM nice thing. What do you see? What was that?

[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.160]
Do you know

[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.700]
We got Josh Cordis in the beast today George is off today because his daughter is on a way to Japan

[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.320]
Any of the taker of the airport. So here we are anything else Robin

[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.180]
I got an idea what do you see we go till midnight

[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.880]
All right, okay, huh

[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.580]
We're gonna go on till midnight whether mad dog likes it or not whether I'm more like it

[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.040]
Don't don't don't don't don't don't you by the way moe your full of it as usual is mo man. Oh man. He is just more a momentous

[00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.660]
lunatic

[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.160]
He thinks that I'm upset over the fact that I'm other taking time off of my show that I have to work a lot less for the same money

[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.780]
Hey, guess what moe you're living in a dream world the only thing that does bug me is that whole you know

[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.780]
Be nice if we knew when they were going home if they ran out of gas finally and true in the towel

[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.020]
Anything else rob it anything else is there anything else for you know

[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.580]
It's just a little bit you know over the top you know I'm saying

[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.300]
Is there anybody there on that side? Yeah, we're here

[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.480]
Yeah, what are you gonna be the silent routine like Zack? How is that it? No, no, no, I wouldn't do that

[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.320]
Yeah, you do it all the time, but you are just a big tub of crap

[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.900]
Anything else I think she has another one for you. Here's a fact that says this sucks

[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.940]
I must listen on the internet worst of all you haven't started your show yet. It's around 1045

[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.480]
Well guess what 30 minutes later we're still waiting

[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.080]
So I'm ecstatic they can go on to one o'clock

[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.600]
But it would be nice to have like some little inkling it by the window get done because I don't want to have to listen to her

[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.320]
Drowning on anything else anything else. I you know because it's it's not my cup of tea. I'm delighted that we got that on the year

[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.580]
It's enlightening is it yeah the news very enlightening. It says even if I wanted to listen to Howard Stern

[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.720]
He's not streaming on QA and what up with that? Yeah, what up with that? Well, I guess we can't stream his show on QA

[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.520]
I'm right on anything we're streaming that air in the morning really yeah, well, that's one more a bonus for us

[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.960]
That's great

[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.340]
Here's Steve who's obviously doesn't understand that he says I just want to let you know you're not broadcasting on the internet today

[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.260]
I can hear the promos and the whistling sound during commercials

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.220]
Well, then it goes dead when you come on. I hope this can be repaired. Well, guess what Steve when you sent this facts

[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.840]
hours ago I wasn't on

[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.440]
So you didn't miss what you missed the Howard Stern show, but you didn't miss this because I was not why don't you just do your own show on the internet

[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.640]
And then we'll just stream it on QA I love to do that. That's a great idea. You'll just start it 10 of the internet

[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.600]
No, like I said, that's a really bad idea. Oh right. They'll go for that

[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.780]
They don't want to be associated with that because you know, I'd use all the words that have been invented

[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.240]
And don't you just want to add this one? I don't you want to add that one and come on

[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.040]
Let's add this one and Jenna James and I don't give you started now. I don't want to say word

[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.380]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.060]
Because that show is not for me that show is for the people who would go out and like it

[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.180]
They got a huge audience or you feel like I love the tremendous promotion by the way the WQM is given to

[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.400]
You rival and Howard's here and a couple of very jackass interviews in the Jim Sarni story and the very in the sports page that nobody who listens to Howard Stern reads anyway

[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.420]
Any billboards? No, any newspaper ads? No, any flyers?

[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.120]
Anybody walking around with a sandwich board on Lincoln Road Mall or in Boynton Beach up there?

[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.780]
No, of course if they were in Boynton Beach

[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.040]
It wouldn't care anyway because they'd be listening on buzz 103 and they'd hear it like a clean and non-expergated pretty much and with a really good signal

[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.380]
But nevertheless not for us to ask these questions is it we just work here? We just work here

[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.320]
We want the money so Mo if you see Mo Howard David and he wants a lot of

[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.160]
Angst and a lot of conflict and a lot of anger

[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.460]
If that piece thinks that I'm going to accept his apology, you know

[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.980]
You're just an angry old bitter man. It's all you are Mo

[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.160]
So if you want to conjure up in your mind that I'm all been out of shape because Stern goes on till

[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.600]
1045 1115 whenever they quit the screwing around all right

[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.460]
If they went on till 130

[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.500]
I'd be the happiest man on the face of their thing

[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.820]
It paid this kind of money for doing a lot less work

[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.980]
All I can say is oh right this man if this old crow

[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.540]
Do you really believe oh sorry crow if this old cude really believes

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.340]
That I'm here like save the world or something like that

[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.660]
This is the same guy that was ripping me several months ago. Oh here you see span under radio

[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.000]
He's going to be reading the newspaper articles again. I you know

[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.300]
That was bad but now I'm supposed to be saving a world because I decided I don't I'm not going to get angry over the fact that they've cut my workload down

[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.320]
I mean this man is just

[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.620]
Impossible I heard those some of those promos. I didn't hear too much this morning, but I heard some of those promos

[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.200]
Same Q. I.M. Howard Stern Neil Maddog and the hammer

[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.060]
That was I didn't hear nothing about Goli

[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.820]
I didn't hear nothing about Mo

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.680]
Oh Steve says you're back on the net have a great day. Well, we never were on the net

[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.160]
Don't you understand the Howard Stern show we're not allowed to stream that on the net

[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.260]
Because then we're not allowed to do this we're not allowed to use his voice and we're not allowed to do anything because he is the king of all hype

[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.320]
So we can't to do that

[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:30.040]
1700 eight votes on Georgia's pool and by the way you can scratch out that first break because we're not going to like try to jam four breaks into like 45 minutes

[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.140]
Okay, I'm just talking

[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.480]
The time came and it went for our break and it was gone. So bye-bye

[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.260]
That's something that they're going to have to work out with the water not so you can figure out what they're doing because they obviously don't

[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.320]
Georgia asked yesterday. So how does this during show sound on Q.A.M. on yesterday the debut of the Howard Stern show on WQ.A.M.

[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.580]
Oh

[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.040]
And here's the result not too promising so far. I

[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.500]
Didn't listen before and I'm still not listening. We have 1700 eight votes. I didn't listen before I'm still not listening

[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:07.000]
563 33% of third how do you like that? You've heard with all the dumps. It sounds like crap 380

[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.060]
I should mention right up front yet

[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.000]
That the audience thinks that the mufflinzy is dumping everything

[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.280]
He is but in addition to that we're having all kinds of satellite problems so there are dropouts on the satellite

[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.820]
That's when grieper cranks up that heavy metal music right. It's actually Tommy's band that he's playing

[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.580]
So Tommy's band sounds pretty good the only problem being that the audience thinks every time they hear that oh that

[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.120]
Dupts is dumping again the Howard must have said crap or something, you know

[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.500]
So we got the dumps and then we got the dropouts on the satellite

[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.680]
So with those two together it really does sound like crap

[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.400]
So with all the dumps it sounds like crap 380 22.2% to them

[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.260]
Great sounds great. It's good to have Howard back 291

[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.400]
It sounds like crap, but I'm still going to listen 196

[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.080]
So if you add those two together you got 28.4% which leads another 72% almost

[00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:00.060]
I want my sports back 191 and because of the signal it sounds like crap 87 because it's on a crappy AM station with

[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.640]
with all of that

[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.120]
So um a lot of unhappy people I guess but keep in mind this is just a transition period right

[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.580]
Right it'll get better

[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.380]
It'll get a lot better in addition to which most of the stern people don't have any idea that he's on this radio station because Greg

[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.680]
Read as usual has dropped the ball. This is it's unbelievable how anybody

[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:26.320]
Delayable can in fact if you get a fast Greg I bet you some of them for these clover's might drop out and want it to horseshoe

[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.560]
Yes, they don't get up too fast

[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.880]
I have never seen anybody make more mistakes do more things wrong

[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.100]
Unacceptable and just every time it's like jumping into a bunch of horse crab and coming out smelling like life

[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.700]
You know that's him

[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.840]
I don't know how he does it you know that's right. You're not a position to say yeah

[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.200]
I have no idea but you are in a position to say how well in fact Josh Cordis I'll out you right now

[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.280]
He used to when the first one this morning told me about Mo opening up a big mouth

[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.020]
I'm going to be listening tomorrow morning because I think Neil is going to be very upset about and I don't believe any of that crap

[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.980]
It's all on the air you're full of crap, Mo

[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.320]
You're just a professional trouble maker which is why you've been blown out everywhere you've ever worked

[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.520]
Just about or maybe everywhere and why if they had any way to get you out of there right now believe you me

[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.120]
I saw a hang on the remember hang over he's still alive. I saw him on a racing thing on

[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.520]
This an ABC on Saturday did a good job. He was there with Brent Mausberg and a bunch of guys

[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.420]
In fact, there's hang what a consulted with me. I would have given him the Frankie Dittori horses the second horse of the

[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.340]
Pick for there. He'd have been had a little better shot

[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.080]
But at any rate that he did a good job and he's still around very round and he's

[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.220]
Hopefully coming back everybody in the radio station

[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.980]
We took a pool before the show this morning while Robin was giving us another story and anything else anything else

[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.000]
And the pool is pretty much unanimous. We want the hopper back

[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.320]
Nevertheless, we've been out talk about it. Christy Turlington behind a beat of curtain on neo-rangers.com

[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.040]
Born January 2nd 1969. I think that's the second time we had her run the thing isn't

[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.000]
I don't remember. Now probably before you started. It's a while back. There you go

[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.760]
Christy Turlington, so that makes her 35 last time. I checked ruin in Walnut Creek, California

[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.300]
Ladies and gentlemen best of George Michael

[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:12.700]
Wow, and I must have been a short flick. Inimate portrait. Now we'll be cambo scene smoking cigarette cinnamon in the midst of cool the Beatles revolution a lot of made for TV crap

[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:14.940]
catwalk unzipped

[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:21.200]
Uh, and a bunch and that's it basically, but there she is. He looks pretty decent, I would say she ain't no Jenna Jameson

[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.100]
But who the hell is right? Right

[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:29.420]
You think how is gonna F Jenna Jameson? Don't forget the Howard Stern show that was on this morning will be on e tonight

[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.580]
See we're here to promote the Stern show. I'm delighted to have Monc Cuyon. It's a great lead in

[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.960]
I mean, I don't I don't I can't handle the show myself especially well any of it

[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.780]
Anything else Robin

[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:50.760]
Seriously stop and think about it. How massive does your ego have to be to just go on until they practically drag you off kicking and screaming at like 10-20

[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.040]
He said, you know, we're gonna wrap it up after this. Right those at 10-20 right well. They did

[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.680]
It just happened to be like 55 minutes later

[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.800]
26 after 11 at 560, I'm gonna QA and over the years I've told you about Chuck Alfie

[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.260]
Moe Howard, David at 4-7

[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.920]
Throwing in for the suspended invocation

[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.480]
Hank Goldberg, 4-7

[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.840]
Then we got the big

[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.080]
Oh! At the 7-935

[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.220]
The Finn's training camp

[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.140]
What's he going to be doing out there at 7 o'clock at night?

[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.180]
I don't know, talking about Antonio Friedman or something

[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.240]
Dispission around

[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.100]
And then we got Marlon's on deck 935

[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.620]
The game is at 10-10 kind of a strange time

[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.320]
At 7-10 in the west coast Marlon's at the Dodgers

[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.700]
Followed by the embarrassing sporting news radio

[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.280]
Here is Johnny's, somebody says

[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.820]
Good choice, Johnny Carson, right?

[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.820]
Love Johnny Carson

[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.720]
Do you really?

[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.220]
Why?

[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.300]
I just thought he was

[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.360]
Thought it show was great

[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.160]
Did you?

[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.420]
Yeah, him and Ed McMahon

[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.860]
A lot of people like McDonald's

[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.380]
Don't forget and vanilla ice cream

[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.640]
Rick says who's just unbelievably chronic

[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.900]
How about the great Bob Hope for your poll?

[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.980]
That's another good choice

[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.380]
And another one like I said, they love McDonald's

[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.920]
He says Greg Wheat is still an idiot

[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.540]
And all I can say to that Rick is

[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.960]
Absolutely correct

[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.840]
Where is George?

[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.880]
George is taking his daughter to the airport today

[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.220]
He's going to Japan for that student exchange program

[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.200]
And that's for it, this guy is unbelievable

[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.500]
Good luck to Rick at a life

[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.900]
Here's Elmer who says

[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.500]
I think you've stumbled onto something

[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.220]
No, Elmer

[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.400]
Why don't you do a live unedited unsensitivity version

[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.140]
You show on the internet

[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.800]
So how are the sides to shut Robyn up?

[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.920]
Think about it, don't think the FCC can regularly

[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.100]
What you see on the net just yet

[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.640]
See that would defeat the whole purpose

[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.180]
All the benefits of being able to

[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.720]
Screw off for an hour and a half

[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.480]
For an hour and a quarter or 45 minutes

[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.640]
And not having to do the work

[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.080]
That would just create more busy work

[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.440]
And what would be the point, right?

[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:01.060]
Right

[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.020]
So the answer is

[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.120]
Great idea Elmer, but the answer is no

[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60

[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.100]
On a GAT and C in Verizon Wireless Line

[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.800]
America's most beloved celebrity of all time

[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.920]
Lucille Ball, I voted for the right one I guess

[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.520]
25

[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.240]
Elvis

[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.440]
He's got 17

[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.220]
Redskelt and 7, Carol Burnett 2

[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.340]
Bob Hope 1, Johnny Carson None

[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.820]
Mr. Rogers don't have any

[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.880]
Frankie Lamin none out of the first 52 votes

[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.360]
I don't see Danny K on there

[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.980]
K-A-Y-E, I don't see no Danny K, Josh

[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.000]
He's typing right now

[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.480]
As I speak, he's typing right

[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.620]
I probably thought that was a joke

[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.920]
He would know Danny K from

[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.080]
Stubby K

[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.280]
You're right

[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.140]
So I go at Punk

[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.120]
Oh, here you go, John Wayne

[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.400]
Is our friend John in Columbia South Carolina

[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.640]
Good choice, John

[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.740]
We'll keep you little too soon

[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:52.760]
To the Bushmeister on there

[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.160]
Montana man, Shocks community

[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.820]
Maybe Robin could have read this this morning

[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.820]
Howard did save me from reading about Chuck Leonard Dyn

[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.760]
The former WABC Drocked a Black Guy

[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.080]
Chuck Leonard did

[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.040]
He didn't know he was Black

[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.400]
At any rate, you don't know who Chuck Leonard

[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.400]
I was no idea

[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.660]
Way before your time

[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.680]
Back when WABC was the big, big, rock station in New York

[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.380]
77 WB Friday went to talk and ruined it

[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.680]
And he was right about Cousin Brucie

[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.160]
What a f***hole he is

[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.060]
I noticed Howard was using a lot of words

[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.060]
Which I'm sure that we dumped

[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.300]
See, I hear the pre-delay here

[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.060]
Through my hoard

[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.240]
But he used a lot of stuff on there

[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.740]
That we can't say, Duff

[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.040]
Like f***ing bag and f***ing damn

[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.880]
And a whole bunch of other things

[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.380]
That's okay

[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.220]
Until this is Calispell Montana

[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.500]
Too bad George ain't here today

[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.940]
Because he's a Montana kind of guy

[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.240]
Sure

[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.400]
Until he was arrested this year

[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.760]
And his underwear in a motel room

[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.000]
With a nearly naked young woman

[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.080]
Who was behind in her payments

[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.440]
To his finance company

[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.220]
There wasn't a businessman in this town

[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.520]
More respected and Richard A. Dason Sr

[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.900]
He had won the Great Chief Award

[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.820]
The Highest Honourable Local

[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.740]
Business Leader can receive from the Chamber of Commerce

[00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.480]
Anominating letter for the award

[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.080]
Described him as the epitome of the reason

[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.880]
We all want to live in the Calispell area

[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.680]
Dason was an energetic force in the construction of a new hospital

[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.880]
A ski resort large hotel that established this

[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.060]
Northwest Montana town of 15,000

[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.320]
As a player in the convention business of the Rocky Mountain West

[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.000]
He was impressively energetic

[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.620]
Two interredible and social causes

[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.280]
Serving as a church elder

[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.040]
Helping teenagers finish high school

[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.700]
And volunteering his time to Christian

[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.000]
Financial counseling which helped people manage debts

[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.400]
Since his arrest in February in a sting operation

[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.600]
In the cut-rated local motel

[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.940]
Police have unearthed a side of

[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.020]
Dason's life that, while impressively energetic, is decidedly less civic-minded

[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.920]
Dason 62, who was married with grown children and several grandchildren

[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.840]
Has allegedly told police that over the past decade he paid more than a million dollars

[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.600]
To have sex with a large number of young women

[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.340]
Many of whom were in legal trouble

[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.240]
Addicted to drugs and in debt to him

[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.420]
According to court documents

[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.000]
When police asked Dason how many of these women there had been

[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.340]
He said there had been too many to count

[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.480]
About 30,000

[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.420]
Who'd he thousand probably

[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.420]
Dason apparently lost count two police

[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.220]
They have how much money he'd paid all these women

[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.980]
Investigators counting his checks

[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.100]
He paid by checking amounts of between a thousand and six grand for encounter

[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.820]
Sometimes as much as a hundred and thirty grand per month

[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.800]
Now I estimate that Dason spent at least wait a year this

[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.160]
At least five million dollars as Charles Harball the same attorney

[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.600]
Isn't he on that show with Chris Matthews Harball?

[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.620]
The State Department of Public Health and Human Services is also trying to find out what Dason is

[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.000]
A court appointed conservative with five hundred thousand

[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.940]
That have been awarded in product liability settlement for long-term care of a severely brain damaged child

[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.800]
In an effort in an effort but David last month in the county court overseeing the conservatorship

[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.920]
A state social worker said the money under Dason's control disappeared with no formula counting

[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.480]
Between 1995 and 2000 since then the child having turned up in local hospital

[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.520]
A severe malnutrition and infected ulcers on his back side

[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.520]
Brackum has become a word of the state

[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.080]
And that lovely lovely

[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.500]
So far Dason has been charged with rape for allegedly paying a 15-year-old girl for sex

[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.240]
The age of the consent of Montana's 16

[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.480]
He's also been charged with two felony counts of promoting prostitution

[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.760]
Yoddy yoddy yoddy yoddy

[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.460]
Oh nice good good American guy

[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:02.440]
Now

[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.740]
There is one thing that I'll say that I'm beginning to wonder about yeah

[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:11.100]
That didn't dawn on me until this moment since this is my first day of following stern okay

[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.700]
And that is this

[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.840]
The neo-roggers list is and I know this has come as a great shock to Greg Reed who is done for that a boxer rocks

[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.760]
But the neo-roggers audience there are many of our list. There's who really aren't howard stern people

[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.720]
You follow what I'm saying right right

[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.800]
Now that being the case how do our listers know I mean do we have like a crystal ball

[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.940]
Do we have a psychic hotline that they can call to tell them what day they're going to run out of steam on that show and go home

[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.300]
Because we were being told oh it's about 10 30 10 45 on the average now

[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.200]
Yesterday is the first day we carried this turn show they wrapped it up at about 11 10

[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.260]
I would say you would take right right right

[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.740]
This morning about 11 15

[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:54.500]
If my mammary is correct right right so we're not even close to having any idea when they finally a

[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.420]
Throw in the sound how did the neo-roggers listers have any clue as to when we start?

[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.340]
I guess they'll just have to keep but checking back with us right maybe we can like ring some sirens or

[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.660]
Yeah, or just set off

[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.880]
Stink bomb when you're front yard something like that let's you know

[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.380]
Hey guess what the coast is clear now you can change the dial not really a two promising that part of it

[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.200]
It sounds like if there are any negatives to the whole deal

[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.520]
That sounds like one right there not that I want to be negative

[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.360]
Like some crusty cranky people we know

[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.860]
Sir Joe and highly as says I tried for two days to listen to Howard Stern share waiting for you

[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.080]
God what a piece of crap he says

[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:36.640]
Nothing they said was unique or funny or held my attention for more than a few seconds and changing the subject saw the opening ceremonies for the Olympics

[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.420]
So he's the one

[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.280]
And saw the Iraqi delegation noticed that the USA approved flag of them replaced by their traditional flag

[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:47.980]
I guess they're showing the world and to our biased media that not always going as planned or whatever that means

[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.200]
What does that mean no idea?

[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:56.920]
And you notice one of the things the American athletes are doing is wearing very tiny little American decals or logos under

[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.680]
shirts and sweaters and things

[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:04.880]
Not too popular being American around the world these jays a too bad one of those things that the bushmaster did for you

[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.300]
How many people are watching the Olympics so far?

[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.180]
How many people attending was big event?

[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:16.760]
Eight billion dollars they spent an Athens NBC spent a billion dollars for the rights and nobody in to show enough

[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.340]
What if they had no Olympics and nobody showed up? I think we're answering that question right now. Who cares

[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.380]
Really pretty boring stuff. You know why I love handball

[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.980]
In addition to where and that don't forget to synchronize the women's diving

[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.820]
But Athens and most of Europe in the month of august they go on vacation anyway to show how well this was planned

[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:40.560]
The local people go on vacation. The tories does they're all terrified of terrorism. So uh, they're ain't nobody there

[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.400]
But wait till the next Olympics and be gin

[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.440]
Oh, yeah, they're all gonna be flock at a china

[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.600]
Although the one thing they got a billion people are so they can shove in all the locals nobody don't even notice

[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.780]
WQA and hello, you know, yes sir. Hey man. You're right about mom. Man

He was talking about how you're gonna be sitting there listening to every word that Howard says oh yeah, right

[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:09.780]
And somebody called up about this yesterday those sports guys they say stuff on the air or they let stuff go on the air that

[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.440]
Supposedly you can't say anymore, but they say it all the time on their show

[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:19.560]
I'm gonna stay on the wait-a-man this station of course even our good buddy Joe Rose the other day or like a week ago

[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.660]
Or so I heard him say the f-word as far as a female like you know SLUT

[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.760]
I've heard that he had you heard about Dennis Miller, right?

[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.560]
No yet Dennis Miller on Dennis Miller said a hole on the air. They didn't even dump it

[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:37.200]

[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.020]
Why? Oh

By the way a KDK8 took rush off and put Bill O'Reilly on you ready for that in Pittsburgh

[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.760]

Tiny ones Fred Rogers two Frankie Lyman one and Danny K has got the big. Oh you don't have any

[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:30.740]
Olimpix our terrorist dreams has reported the Olympic Games increase our terrorist dream come true and undercover report has been able to get a job at the heart of the games and plant three suspicious items that resemble components to make a bomb

[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.220]
When a bomb a Grande

[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.660]
Despite a massive

[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.900]
1 billion pound secure. That's like two almost two billion dollars

[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.580]
Security operation a journalist managed to secure a driving job

[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.500]

At Friday spectacular opening ceremony in Athens a reporter was able to stand within 60 feet of dozens of heads of state including Prime Minister Tony Blair

[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.780]
The Sunday mirrors Bob Graham

[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:03.540]
The relation to Florida's of Bob Graham said he left packages containing slabs of gray plasticine

[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:10.420]
Batteries coils of wire and electrical tape in various locations including inside a sandwich container in the main Olympic stadium

[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:16.700]
He said none of the packages was detected despite a major security lockdown and searches by the Greek army

[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:23.020]
Identity checks which would have exposed them as a journalist were never carried out and the reporter was able to wander around the site with passes

[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.720]
In the names of Michael mouse and Robert bin Laden around his neck

[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.520]
Michael mouse

[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:34.960]
Bob Graham said when security was supposed to be at its tightest I regularly drove a nine-seater minivan

[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.740]
Continually provided by an Olympic sponsor on an office site to get supplies of ice to children for the workers performers and volunteers

[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:47.280]
When I returned with upwards of 60 large bags of ice the content of the van were never properly searched

[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.340]
I could have picked up anything could have contained any number of explosives

[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:55.220]
He added security is absolutely disgraceful the games are a terrorist dream come true

[00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:00.840]
Given assurances from the authorities and the resources available to scandal on an Olympic scale he said

[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.300]
I guess one more good reason that the people who didn't go are saying good idea

[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.780]
made the right move

[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.800]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 and 10 of rise line

[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:17.420]
So what do you think about that little dilemma I have there but a show that starts like in no particular time

[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:21.960]
And nobody knows when to tune in for it at most we get a minute and a half notice

[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:27.780]
Right one there shows you know well no we get it but the audience doesn't right so I'm saying there's no way to know

[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.840]
You saw that back all the stuff that I do at the beginning of the show like yesterday's pull and the

[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:38.040]
Christie tourney tins behind a beaded curtain today a lot of people are gonna miss the beginning of the show

[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.640]
And I have any idea what we're talking about it's kind of like when they threw a show back on there at nine

[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.960]
Yeah, and had the nine to one thing on there

[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.880]
And of course expecting everybody to turn off their morning shows at nine which they weren't gonna do and didn't do

[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.940]
Uh as Greg Reid continues fouling and fouling and screwing up, but you know what who cares so long as that check keeps coming

[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.760]

No seriously the way they do that it's it's almost the zoo is like like an endurance contest

[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.400]
How much more can we do until we just collapse right on the floor you hear him fouling for cards

[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.300]
He knocks the cards over in the phone

[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:39.040]
And and then she does the little lead into the uh the soundbite that they're gonna play see three. I mean that's real professional

[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.240]
C4

[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.440]
With all the ones and all the other money they generate they can't like get a computer

[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.460]
Oh, I'm sure they got plenty of computers. They got all those people sitting around that room

But that was all back in the day, you know those of us living in the past

[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:36.180]
I don't think we are living in the past. I think TV and all and entertainment back then was so much better than the crap that's on now

[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.820]
I mean garbage

[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.540]

Multitutive problems on our hands thanks to Greg just jump into it with both both heads

[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.580]
Everything he does at least he's consistent right just like when he hired mold

[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.240]
Not to mention of course when he hired your favorite I'll take your children

[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.560]
Sell them to some Haitian. Yeah

[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.680]
hiring people have been fired at 80 million jobs in last six years and just putting them on air

[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.580]
Hey, this is gonna be great. This is gonna be great

[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:33.820]
And all based on the fact that he's trying to put he's doing the Humpty Dumpty routine trying to put the pieces of the egg back together

[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:40.200]
We're gonna be smashed when he blew the first team out there in addition to which doesn't it come as kind of shocking to you that he's got this

[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:40.980]
Cavalry attitude

[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:47.700]
Well, you know the NFL games are all gonna be on serious on the car radios and so on so the dolphin franchises and that's

[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:52.540]
Valuable anymore. We don't really care whether Wayne likes it or any Jones or this to that like this during show

[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:58.400]
So we would you know we've gone from this sports obsessive like all of a sudden we stopped in the middle road and did a U-turn

[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.100]
Right

[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:03.980]
I don't know. Don't doesn't it seem that way? I don't know

[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.760]
Do you know anything besides how he's just gonna bring you lunch? Yeah, they just did thanks a lot

[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:14.040]
See, there's my psychic powers working again. We have a problem with Howard. I'm not with Howard's turn yet

[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.900]
But with the way that show operates and certainly with

[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.800]
We just don't have a lot of luck with Howard except for how he's thanks. How is

[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.520]
12 minutes past no Jesus after noon already

[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.160]
Yeah

[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.660]
And Mo thinks I'm pissed off. I'm gonna have a problem

[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.440]
So then I have it worked like a couple hours a day

[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.800]
In addition to which let me say this for you mr. Hot shot mr.

[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.440]
Line green pants. Let me say this to you

[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.720]
When he first came the reason that they had to move my time to nine to one was to accommodate the great Howard

[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.800]
David it because he was only gonna work three hours

[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.900]
I wish I were six to nine and after being on the year for how many years

[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.980]
And ten to two I had to move to accommodate his lazy fat will call us to be back full ass

[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.760]
So he only does three hours now that he's doing the hump or being suspended

[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.660]
You four to seven that sounds like three hours to make so why the hell should I have to do four hours?

[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.900]
Am I paying some kind of a penalty or something? Yeah

[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:06.960]

[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.720]
Doron Grinowski that's the John Bond that's the name you guys name Theron

[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.380]
I think you're pardoned it's the roe

[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:11.700]
The roe now I thought it was Doron because it rhymes with m-o-r-o-n moron that could be true

[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:17.920]
The roe kind of a name is ad no idea sounds like a goofful name could be Israeli

[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:23.280]
Door oh that's what the george said I think Grinowski well guess what the roe

[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:27.620]
You're gonna have your shoe size your social security number your phone numbers

[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:32.520]

[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.500]
But you're just annoying right

[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:40.720]
He's annoying extremely annoying now all of a sudden calls in ideas. I heard him call

[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:46.700]
The big oh of course talks to all the losers like chronic Carl and all the other sports nerds

[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.340]
Oh, yeah, this is the role in aka chamba

[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:55.200]
I mean what do you try to tell us the wrong I have no life. Oh brother WQA and hello

[00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:02.320]
Neil the room also rhymes with muddy corn. Yes sir. Yeah, I am are you sounds like Reverend Jones to me?

[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.340]
No, it's not Reverend Jones. Okay

[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:09.900]
I've got a question um as far as our stern show trying to spot you both aspects of it

[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:14.600]
Is there a way they would cut his show up at 10 so you can start? No, no, no chance

[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.320]
They won't do it see even if I did it even if I did object to it

[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.500]
It wouldn't make any difference we'd be in the middle of another one of Greg Reed's legal problems because they they made the deal

[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.460]
With infinity with the uh

[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:30.340]
Cinecators of the show before they even discussed it with me. It was a done deal by the time they told me about it

[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:36.000]
I see you guys this basically have to wait it out until the show ends until he runs out of gas and decides that his egos

[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.840]
Had it for the ladies gonna go home now. Okay, I love like I said because I know George's um when he was on yesterday

[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.140]
He was on to like one thirty two o'clock and he

[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.960]
He showed you no longer also. It was the whole

[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.820]
One hundred to one thirty one thirty then

[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.940]
Okay, so basically maybe you got a light in the sky like that man

[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:56.680]
You should have us out there saying kneeled on us up and otherwise you got to just keep

[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.200]
I don't know what you're trying to say one who was on at one thirty stern was off at 10 after 11 years today

[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:04.100]
Yeah, then Howard's been on side and George went on

[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:09.360]
Then I think that was it. It was before you know if this whole show was over and it goes by so quick

[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.580]
Yeah, well thank god. Thanks for the good news

[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:14.480]
All I could say that is oh yeah

[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.500]
I'm not I'm not bitching about that so mode. Don't be getting fat head

[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:25.240]
Better than it already is. I'm just I'm just a little bit concerned about that aspect of how anybody's gonna have any idea

[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:29.500]
If they're not a stern listener in addition to which see the pull result from George's point yesterday

[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:35.480]
That was also skewed because the stern people who don't listen to us. I mean you think the stern people are running to near

[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:41.100]
Rogers dot com to hold on our poll. No, they're on the Howard message board. Well, well whatever they're yeah the traveling message board

[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.380]
Whatever they're doing. It's got nothing to do with us most of them

[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:48.620]
So so it's very much skewed because those are mostly many aridges listeners which quite frankly we have a few

[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.080]
As opposed to the stern people so you know the fact that what did it say?

[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:56.240]
Let's say great sounds good to have our back 17%

[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:01.500]
But that's very effective because the stern people who don't listen to me or the rest of this radio station

[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:08.060]
They were there. I'm assuming that is if a pigeon dropped one on their windowsill and told them oh by the way howard said back on QM Monday

[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.040]
It's just on cunt is there not even a newspaper ad anything

[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.620]
Yeah, there's some newspaper ads. I saw the news last night

[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:22.660]
You saw it on what news on channel four. I was watching they said uh, you know stern started in Miami today

[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:28.620]
And that's it. Yeah, it was a little blurb. Let me tell you something about Tom Jerkero. Okay, beside the fact that

[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.860]
He's body stupid. Yeah, here's the guys on permanent vacation

[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:37.120]
He just finished his summertime out on a wester. He's he's talking about me being in Toronto and being out of touch with South Florida

[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.620]
I don't know anybody who's out of touch more than he is

[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:45.560]
He's on a west coast the last month getting wind and dying with the fall on TV previous by the TV people now

[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:49.140]
Now that we got the biggest radio story in a long long time

[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:53.340]
Where's the little time? Make the evidently sound vacation because the only thing you'll find on a website

[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:58.460]
They're nothing in the newspaper and the only thing on a website is that the puff piece that he does the questions and answers in the tv book

[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:03.260]
This past Sunday which obviously they got a whole bunch of those in the can ahead of time. So he's not even around

[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:10.040]
So like I said before other than Barry jackass and give a sharny with a few words in the sports nerd columns

[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:16.980]
There's nothing going on there. There's no big hype about this which is really sad nice go on Greg you idiot you ninkam poop

[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:21.500]
You simple then keep scratching that hole in your head. Okay, maybe you'll find something

[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.180]
WQM hello

[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:26.860]
WQM hello

[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.660]

[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.000]
Uh, I was thinking curly. I'm assuming he was American

[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:46.760]
Purly

[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:50.480]
No Larry curly. Everybody loves early. Yeah, okay

[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.440]
You sound a little girly curly

[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:58.280]
Judy Garland now we're talking Judy fabulous garland says this facts right here. That's a good choice right nobody

[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.380]
Didn't like Judy girl and even though she was very neurotic like a little bit

[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:01.920]
Yeah

[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:03.780]
Some way

[00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:08.920]
Hi everybody love Judy girl. Let's put her on there before she starts popping a few more pills

[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.140]
I understand they had to fill up the coffin with some extra goods

[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:14.760]

Yes, sir

[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:28.560]
I heard it. Yeah, why did they bring him back? What do you mean why did they bring him back because he's gonna make a lot of money for him

[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:32.240]
Oh my god, he's not seeming to change the whole show about anyway

[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.600]
About the guy at the Olympics who didn't get such

[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.640]
Yeah, uh, he didn't get fresh because he was white, you know, I'm saying

Thank you

[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:51.920]
5.6.7. Oh here's one hair couple James Dean and I guess that he'll get some boats although I for the life of me

[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:55.580]
Be loved

[00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:01.220]
I don't I don't know if she was all that much to be loved just everybody was horny for but won't put her on there, right?

[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.300]
That's the same thing

[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.680]
No, it is not it's the same thing

[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:09.380]
Why did you want to have do you think these people wanted sex with Lucille ball?

[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:16.620]
You think you wanted to happen to sack with Jackie Gleason maybe the Duke I think the Duke a lot of these macho guys

[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.120]

[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:43.220]
Well, actually yeah, I actually used to listen to him on the other station and then

[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:49.020]
And then they dropped him I was listening to you guys and then I did what you said I boycott a clear channel

[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:53.340]
I didn't listen to six tenorators on the station anymore. I live with a clear channel. I wasn't talking

[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.300]
but at least clear channel had the

[00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:57.900]
bone act to

[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.440]
cancel him and

[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:05.860]
And take a stance you guys have brought back something that I don't know what the hell are they just not the stern show

[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:10.500]
And they you every every every two minutes they cut it out

[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:14.420]
They play that racket it's it's an embarrassment. I really I

[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:19.420]
I know that 96 one on the same at the same time with an offer of easily station

[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:27.840]
That's what I can't figure out because they send Duff and Robert Grieper over to four Myers or to Naples for a couple days

[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:32.000]
Two weeks ago for a little bit of orientation training to teach them how to like

[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:37.460]
sit in monitor the show and what to dump and what to leave in there and and for whatever reason the beesleaves over there in a

[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:41.740]
West Coast they leave almost everything in and on our station we dump like every other words

[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.860]
Will you say fix it how they're gonna fix it

[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.700]
They're never gonna happen

[00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:00.280]

Upsetting I bet they'll be disturbed by it Tom Harkin in Iowa. He's pretty disturbed by Dick Cheney

[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:15.240]
He's really pissed off about dick who's not vice president dick Cheney's questioning of John Kerry's war record and his ability to protect America is cowardly

[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.260]
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa said yesterday

[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:28.620]
It just outrageous me that someone who gave got five deferments during Vietnam and said he had other priorities at that time would say that said the Iowa Democrat a former Navy fighter pilot

[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:35.400]
Harkin said he is seeing clips of the vice president saying in Iowa last week that Kerry lacks a basic understanding of the war on terrorism

[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.020]
He accused Bush and his vice president of resorting to dirty attacks on John Kerry's war record

[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:40.540]
Absolutely

[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:50.160]
Correct. They're running scared because John Kerry as a war record and they don't sit Harkin or Cheney is doing and what he is saying is cowardly and his actions are cowardly like I said

[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:50.900]
They you are

[01:01:52.320 --> 01:02:00.180]

[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.000]
Why didn't he get blown out?

[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.000]
What do you mean by that? Well, he just was out of a job

[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:47.720]
Can you can you explain the difference? Well, he was Joe's producer and Joe wasn't on anymore

[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:49.760]
Right

[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:56.840]
Well, let me ask you this yeah, how are there other producers around who wasn't Robert Grieper the

[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:02.120]
Morning show wasn't the most morning producer now. He's gonna run the Howard Stern show right so so the show is changed

[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.560]
But he didn't get blown out that's because he's got negative pictures of Josh the Darrow right the creepers will hold different story

[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.780]
Oh, I know that

[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.200]

[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.420]
I guess we know it's a secret

[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.620]
When you see more Mickey-D

[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:55.660]
McDonald's

[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:59.880]
I scream McDonald's certain the radio shows 1246 at 1246

[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.700]
Can you believe it's almost one o'clock?

[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:02.800]
I bet that

[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.860]

I mean this is oh here's a fact from joe and south Miami see this is another thing

[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.060]
This is happening at the worst possible time of the year

[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.560]
Because it's the summertime and where are

[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.620]
An enormous number of people in south florida and all over the country they're on vacation right

[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:41.340]
I don't know the color back now schools in session, but that's my point

[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.160]
They go away they come back and joe and south Miami says what happened?

[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:50.780]
He says hi up alley what happened? I've been in china for three weeks get back here and all hell is broken loose

He's on vacation. He's suspended. He's who knows what

[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:07.500]
Because his contract ends in november most gutter year and a half left so with a sterren thing

[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:11.740]
Anybody who really believes that this is all about a real suspension your full of crap. Oh, I shouldn't say that

[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:13.100]
That's just my opinion

[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:18.400]
Hey, did the humper it says but moe makes me sick beyond believe he is horrible

[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:23.940]

[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.980]
No, but I'll put it on it. Don't want to make it too difficult

[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.000]
It says on the how we stir and problem. I know there was a problem. Did you?

[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:53.920]
No, sir. I didn't say it was a problem. I'm just I'm just thinking out loud of the our loyal listeners out there

[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.520]
Which we don't care about them some they supported me for a long time

[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.680]
But nevertheless says why don't you air from 1130 to 330 it says

[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:06.260]
That we know what it's doing in right like I'm gonna stick around to 330 now. I'm done it to okay

[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:14.380]
Whether I started 10 10 30 10 45 11 15 157 30 159 14 2 o'clock. That's the end

[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:20.320]
Says either that or dumpster and from a loyal new listener. Well, I'm sure we got some of our people aren't too happy about the whole deal

[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.780]
But uh, hey, I'm happy. So you should be happy. Do you know me? I'm happy that's all says uh

[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:27.540]
Yeah, like that

[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:36.740]
What is this thing you just facts me now the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said yesterday that John Kerry deserved his combat medals for heroism and Vietnam

[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.620]
Which some veterans have disputed. Thank you very much. It's on our website

[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.240]
Sorry, what I probably wouldn't have mentioned that so thank you

[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.200]
I would not will mention this one though

[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.160]
Bush accused of exploiting hurricane in Florida as he offers a to the disaster area

[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.520]
He wouldn't do something like that way

[01:12:53.180 --> 01:13:00.920]
President George Bush flew into southwest Florida Sunday and a mission that was as much about politics as compassion for the area devastated by the hurricane over the weekend

[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:06.980]
Accompanied by his fat ass brother Jeb Bush governor of the state and by Mike Brown the director of FEMA

[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:13.320]
The president toured by helicopter and online Charlotte and Lee counties would suffer the most damage by far from hurricane Charlie

[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:20.600]
He made the brief morning visit as a huge swath of central Florida struck by the storm was struggling to emerge from the debris and wreckage

[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:24.320]
The official death toll it says here made it 13. I think it's 19 now, isn't it

[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.900]
19 I saw 17 19

[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:33.140]
And as many as two million residents along the storms passed on the Gulf Coast of Atlantic remained without power the cost of reconstructions

[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:33.820]
expected to receive

[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:36.140]
10 billion dollars

[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:41.300]
For mr. Bush to handling at the aftermath of Charlie the worst hurricane hit Florida in a dozen years since Andrew 92

[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.920]
Which we know all too well could be crucial was hopes of winning the state in the presidential election November

[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.740]
latest pull show is rival John Kerry with a slim age in the state

[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.400]
I think it was 4741 six points or 4841 mr

[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:59.480]
Bush will be heating harsh lessons learned by his father who was heavily criticized in the wake of hurricane Andrew in August

[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:02.200]
92 three months before losing that year's election to Bill Clinton

[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:08.480]
George Bush senior came under criticism when he flew to the perimeter of the storm's worst damage south of Miami and hastily left again

[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:14.420]
After Andrew Moore where there were loud complaints from local officials that the federal agencies led by FEMA

[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.700]
reacted much too slowly and getting assistance to the area

[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:22.400]
I'm being elected Bill Clinton made the reform of FEMA which oversees all emergencies in the county a top priority

[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.760]
Are we sure miss Bob? It all wait

[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:24.740]
man

[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.780]
Now we got Josh registered to vote there. He's gonna be voting several times. What about the beast? Are you registered voted?

[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:32.920]
Of course I am. Oh thank god

[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:38.080]
That hasn't come in yet by the way. I beg your pardon. That hasn't come in yet by the way. What hasn't come in?

[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:42.560]
I am my my card my registration. You ready to vote a registration card? Well, I would call him

[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:50.640]
Will you laugh at a guy? Call who a guy stopped by and gave me a pamphlet to fill out and I mailed it in well call him up

[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:56.380]
Okay, and say hey, why what do you mean a guy stopped by you don't still have the pamphlet doesn't have a phone number on it?

[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:58.060]
No, I mailed in the pamphlet

[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.700]
Well call the what do you live in data Broward? Broward you live in Broward

[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:07.520]
Call a Broward elections office and tell him ask him if your name is on the thing and if so how come you don't have your card yet

[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.900]
And if not get it to get with it

[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.800]
Because who knows maybe that guy was just some kind of a used car salesman or something who knows who he was

[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.880]
He was a little fruity

[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.840]
Was he really too deep fruity?

[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:19.440]
Yeah

[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.320]
Seem to be a lot of those people around

[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:28.280]
Carrey leads bush to spite nader here's the latest pool. All right is over here. All right those votes

[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:32.320]
We need Josh our courtesans vote. We need the beast vote mom vote in absentee

[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:37.400]
In fact, I'm gonna do is make copies of it and I'm gonna try mailing it in about a hundred hundred time

[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.440]
Maybe a thousand times maybe 30,000

[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.540]
Just just to be on the safe side

[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.780]
Democratic challenger John Kerry has pulled ahead a president George W Bush even while Ralph Nader that loser

[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:53.420]
That ego-tist and other presidential candidates ever counted for according to the brand new pool

[01:15:54.280 --> 01:16:02.260]
Kerry leads bush nation-wide 47 of 43% even with nader the libertarian constitution and green party candidates included in the latest

[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.560]
Agbi pool minus those contenders

[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.160]
Kerry and his running made had a

[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.820]
50 to 43% lead over bush

[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:13.400]
The Kerry Edwards ticket is gained two points since the Democratic Party or convention last month

[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:17.020]
Bush is overall approval rating rose three points low to 47 percent

[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:21.600]
Although 52 percent of likely voters said they disapproved of the job the president is doing

[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:29.300]
Zodney also found that voters holding passports preferred Kerry like yours truly 58 to 35

[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:33.740]
voters without passports favored Bush 40 to 39 see the difference there

[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:39.980]
Those people who don't have passports like you guys you have a passport. I don't know

[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:42.940]
I know Josh doesn't know see

[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:45.360]
people

[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:50.340]
People that don't have passports it means they don't get around they don't go anywhere. They don't know anything about the world or like myopic

[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.560]
They have tunnel vision

[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:59.820]
But the people like it around and see what's going on in the rest of the world how America is hated and reviled right now from all around the globe

[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.640]
Even down under man

[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.680]
That look at the Olympics. I'm seriously used to have like big emblems

[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.260]
You know USA now like if you need a Mount Palimar telescope to see the USA on there

[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.740]
Fact most of them are saying hey work an avian a

[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.260]
Big investors narrowly predict carry over can you believe it's almost one o'clock?

[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:21.920]
This is the greatest thing. I don't care. You know our audience will figure it out, you know

[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:28.600]
You know what I'm saying is it sound selfish and good. I don't care. He must hate it though

[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.320]
What oh, yeah, I do hate it more you idiot

[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:39.080]
You're still Nancy one thing about me. I'm like most he's another one of those guys with a huge huge ego in case you haven't noticed

[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.060]
I've noticed oh brother

[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.560]
What is it about guys named Howard that have these mammoth insatiable egos

[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.480]
And so the idea that if he was on four hours and somebody else in friends on his time he'd be very upset

[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.820]
I'm the hilarious. I'm so happy

[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:58.960]
Here it's a little the only thing that bothers me about that last part of it is that Josh there this morning over

[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.400]
We asked a little bit. Oh, they're getting ready. A robin's gonna do the news when robin starts doing the news

[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.660]
That's the last segment of the show, which means it goes on for about an hour

[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:09.860]
Okay, anything else

[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.400]
Anything else robin

[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:15.960]
anymore news

[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:19.680]
It's like an endurance contest

[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:27.060]
Anyway, can I get back to this moment? Turn the big money managers who steer billions of dollars and investments around the world

[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:29.880]
Reckon that US Senator John Kerry might just be

[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.280]
W in November, but it's non-Americans who give them the best chance

[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:40.900]
As in most current election polls the race comes out close 41 to 37% and nearly 300 respondents who together manage around

[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:44.300]
940 billion dollars investments say that Kerry would be bush

[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:51.360]
41 to 37 the rest are like clues, but there was a difference in view depending on where the fund manager was based

[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:56.240]
This is very much an international perspective on the elections that David Bowers no relation to Johnny Bower

[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.540]
Merrill's teeth global investment strategist

[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:07.020]
Bush won among the 36 North American based respondents 44 to 33% among these 68 British based managers 37 to 34% and among the

[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:13.780]
43 Japan based respondents 4937 Kerry, however, was favored by 96 continental Europeans 46 33

[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:20.340]
28 Asian Pacific based respondents 43 29 and by 16 South African managers 50 to 31

[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:27.560]
The respondents were also liked about the impact of a Kerry win on financial markets while 44% said that Kerry win would have no impact on the market

[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:33.080]
37% success in outcome would be negative and 13% believe it would be positive see the big money people

[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.840]
There are always Republicans believe you me

[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:40.100]
Including my financial advisor all of these people anybody that's got big bucks except a few of us

[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:44.140]
For whatever reason in the Hollywood people is the only other people are got big money and the Democrats

[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:49.840]
Because they have some values and they're not just selfish and greedy and cut my taxes to mo

[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:50.880]
Some mo

[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:56.220]
Do do do do do I was picking a mo on that promo you heard it again before was it a region or a promo

[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.740]

[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.460]
Howard Stern and Neil and mad dog and then hammer

[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.000]
Did you hear anything about Moe in there? No, it was a problem by the way

[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:13.540]
Well, whatever the hell it was and hear nothing about old Moe. He said he's just wallpaper now

[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:19.100]
Yeah, no one loves him anymore. No one thinks about him. He says no one loves him any Mo

[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.820]
joke that it

[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:25.340]
He said he maybe he ought to sue us for alienation of affection

[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:33.840]

Mr. Tommy. Hey Tommy. How you doing? How you doing? Who's this?

[01:26:56.540 --> 01:27:02.620]
What are you calling? I'm calling Neil. That's me. Oh, I'm doing good to see you. Hey, what person?

[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:08.320]
Two Tommy. Yeah, good. Hey, I was wondering how come you don't have that job before I know this?

[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.940]
Because nobody knows who that is. That's probably the reason. Somebody Q. A. M. Hello

[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.300]
Yeah, how you doing pretty good?

[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:22.620]
All right, as far as more of it Dennis Miller on the show today there. Yeah, I think that that's good that he's got big names for

[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.460]
Let's be in your channel because you can't

[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:28.740]
Yeah, right. I'm jealous because I can't have big names celebrities on the show. We can put it in

[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.900]
We don't do guests in case you have an order of schmuck

[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.980]
But there's some that must be a warrant from a little of Anna's boyfriend, you think?

[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.000]
Maybe I think so

[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:43.140]
Sounded very suspicious to me yet we're just jealous that we can't have Dennis Miller and other schmucks like that on the air

[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:44.420]
We don't do guests

[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.840]
In fact, I noticed a couple of times I have punched it up since the Humphreys been on decay. I mean suspended fired whatever he is

[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.820]
Guests lots and lots of guests in the room with that. I'm here it is because I'm always terrified of all those crack calls in the afternoon

[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:57.800]
Is that what you told me

[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.740]
I didn't tell you that or I guess George told me that I think George

[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:07.120]
He said he doesn't deal with it very well

[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.760]
He gets all far blundet and as a result we're gonna have a lot of guests. We're gonna have Dennis Miller

[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:14.720]
We're gonna have Johnny Miller and we're gonna have a blood Miller. How about Jay Miller?

[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.620]
Jay Miller would be good

[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:24.100]

The two to one decision by the first district court of appeal upholds in August 2002

[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:37.680]
Worldwide trial judge who said that the law violates the separation of church in state and a provision of the state

[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:41.920]
Constitution that bans you some tax dollars on religious schools the state's been allowing

[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:47.100]
A lot of the issue vouchers during its appeal and that will likely remain true until they floor the supreme court decides the case

[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:51.720]
Ultimately and you can bet your bottom dollar. They're gonna say unconstitutional baby forget about it

[01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:14.750]
That's taking a licking George W. Bush is gonna give the democrats a bigger licking than Hootskin Turner

[01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:18.410]
Well, I know what Hootsie isn't who's Turner

[01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:24.530]
George W. Bush is gonna turn this economy around faster than little Reagan's cranium in the excess

[01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:27.970]
I didn't know Ronald Reagan was in that movie. I mean come on

[01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:29.650]
I don't mean to go off it all right here

[01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:35.750]
But George W is to pro-active for policy what he's in for was to quasi physics

[01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:39.730]
I was on good at this and

[01:34:40.410 --> 01:34:42.150]
So please folks come November

[01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:50.590]
So far both for George W. Bush trust me on this when you'll be happier than Ruben studded with a fistful of ponderosa co-pots

[01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:58.890]
Let me see this surprising new friends of George W. Bush five sixty W. Q.A. I'm don't step on me again

[01:34:58.890 --> 01:35:03.310]
Please here's a fact from Dean who says with the except of the one theft of a freight train in the thirties

[01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:08.230]
There was eventually chopped up the youthful in the discretion is the most beloved celebrity market history George burns

[01:35:09.210 --> 01:35:10.570]
How do we leave him off of there?

[01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:18.090]
Now he's on it says could Bob Hope Elvis or John Wayne play God on film no good point George burns

[01:35:18.090 --> 01:35:23.950]
Electro's big fat ones in the stoke used to I hear from a darker perspective. It says here's a list of pretty good ones. My Hammond Oli

[01:35:25.570 --> 01:35:30.630]
You don't want to put well we put the Arnold Palmer on her so Michael Jordan will put him on

[01:35:31.930 --> 01:35:37.090]
Rachel's bill Cosby. It's got Clinton on here with no politicians, please and Bob Marley and Jerry Garcia

[01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:39.310]
Did you put those all on there what?

[01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:41.670]
No, well Hammond Oli

[01:35:43.410 --> 01:35:46.930]
Well, I don't want to have to read the whole beast has got the facts there. I'll give it to him

[01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:50.030]
Yeah, a lot of them they're in hand to him is I don't want to keep reading more of them

[01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:54.370]
Now here's a fact from a disgruntler listener out there, which is always good a chronic

[01:35:54.810 --> 01:35:56.730]
Faxor too by the way I recognize the handwriting

[01:35:57.590 --> 01:36:02.770]
I've been a long time listener and have to tell you that a pool does not a show make you are much more talented than that

[01:36:02.770 --> 01:36:03.930]
I'm very disappointed

[01:36:03.930 --> 01:36:07.890]
It's bad enough. You're hardly ever on and then you spend it on ponderous stupid pools

[01:36:07.890 --> 01:36:10.990]
See it says at the bottom. Well, it must be from jazz mccay

[01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:17.690]
If you don't like the show I have one thing to say the okay but do it pulls a long time

[01:36:18.710 --> 01:36:21.750]
There's a lot more than we did on the show all day in fact when we do the pool

[01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:26.070]
We know people call in with suggestions and then we read the result once every 15-20 minutes

[01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.870]
And that's about it

[01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:28.610]
There's a lot more of the show than the pool

[01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:32.210]
But obviously you're just another disgruntled self-loverian who wants to share your brilliance

[01:36:32.730 --> 01:36:34.830]
With me and the rest of the world. So thank you so much

[01:36:36.230 --> 01:36:41.010]
Go out and bark at the moon and see if it goes away. Can you see how it works? Let me know how it worked out for you

[01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:47.190]
5670560 pound five sixty on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line WQA and hello

[01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:51.870]
Hello, yes, sir. Hi, it's Howard Stern WNBC

[01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:54.510]
How old are you?

[01:36:56.050 --> 01:37:01.790]
What's going on? Are you really good looking? Oh?

[01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:02.050]
Hello

[01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:11.290]
Somebody with a steering draft and by the way, I have to point out that that's somebody playing an old tape from WNBC

[01:37:11.290 --> 01:37:16.010]
100 years ago before a Stern got canned there for some I'm as a bunch of booze after he dried out

[01:37:17.150 --> 01:37:21.950]
And the reason I have to clarify that is because we're not allowed to play a Stern's voice on the air the rest of the day

[01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:24.910]
Beside the show you know that no, I didn't know that we're not allowed to play it

[01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:30.630]
But that was a car. So that's okay very entertaining. Hey Rob, and anything else

[01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:33.250]
Here's line nine WQAM

[01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:37.050]
I knew how to go. Okay. How's the weather in Toronto?

[01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:40.410]
The weather is beautiful sunny and about 73. It's so very nice

[01:37:40.410 --> 01:37:44.970]
It's overcast and cloudy here, which is fitting for the mood here. Really?

[01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:48.190]
Absolutely. Why is that? What are they pissed off about?

[01:37:48.750 --> 01:37:53.490]
What I'd take this off about there. I still got people in the streets blocking the streets because they're going on

[01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:54.190]
Yeah

[01:37:56.090 --> 01:37:59.470]
So I gotta get out of here now. Okay, good luck to pal. See you at the border

[01:37:59.470 --> 01:38:01.290]
5607 0560

[01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:05.690]
Palm 560 on a 18 team for rising line WQAM. Hello

[01:38:05.690 --> 01:38:12.890]
Yes, sir. I got proof of your proud. Yeah. Okay. We got beautiful and energy assumption

[01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:21.630]
WQAM. Hello hi Neil. Yes, ma'am. You know you mentioned that

[01:38:21.630 --> 01:38:28.810]
Words that ends with bag this morning. Yeah, that was not dumped on how our show you want to know why

[01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:32.790]
You want to know why? Why? I'll say why because he said in fact

[01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:37.070]
I would happen to be listening at that point. I headed on the back because I was waiting to see if they were ever going to go home

[01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:40.430]
And he know and he said some other word

[01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:44.970]
That I know that Duff dumped it but then because we got that seven second delay

[01:38:44.970 --> 01:38:49.630]
It's got to read the dump has to recover and he said the other word immediately a following so I in my mind

[01:38:49.630 --> 01:38:53.830]
I thought to myself. Well that one got on the ear. Yes, it did and yesterday

[01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:55.810]
I was listening and I thought you know

[01:38:55.810 --> 01:38:58.330]
There must be something wrong with the feed because

[01:38:58.910 --> 01:39:03.950]
Once in a while I'm listening to air America and the same thing happens it goes out and

[01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:05.830]
I thought I could just a few seconds

[01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:12.370]
But then this morning I was listening and it just so happened that all those big long dumps and then Tommy's van coming on

[01:39:12.370 --> 01:39:18.450]
Because happened to be when Jim denny James and we're talking about our movie and you know things that were

[01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:21.190]
Probably questionable material

[01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:27.710]
For especially you know Duff he must be just a fineless little girl. No, no, you know you don't understand

[01:39:27.710 --> 01:39:31.650]
He's he's under strict orders. It's got nothing to do with him. He's not making the station policy

[01:39:31.650 --> 01:39:33.170]
That's the beesleasing Greg Reed

[01:39:33.170 --> 01:39:36.490]
But how can they can get away with it in Naples and

[01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:39.270]
On that station I know that

[01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:45.730]
Well, I guess I guess because their license in Naples isn't in jeopardy like our license might be one of these days if they don't

[01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:50.170]
Get smart but how could why is that different than yours the same company

[01:39:51.190 --> 01:39:51.990]
It's the same company

[01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:57.310]
Okay, you don't have the same or I know the first yeah the unmentioned one there you go

[01:39:57.870 --> 01:40:04.030]
How would know about him too because he's been trying to get on Howard showed as a date him for years

[01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:06.090]
He has an agenda or anything

[01:40:06.090 --> 01:40:08.490]
No nothing like that okay, well

[01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:13.530]
It's just a shame that one person can screw up people's lives like that

[01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:20.510]
I don't have to tell me I'm an expert on that. Oh, I know that I know have a great taste. We don't need to bye-bye

[01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:25.730]
See the whole idea of community standards. I mean, it's just a lie the FCC like all your other government agencies

[01:40:25.730 --> 01:40:29.550]
They lie through their teeth well community standards and there you know

[01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:34.750]
How can one person in any community of more than 20 people decide community standards? There is no such thing right?

[01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:41.530]
Right, but not according to the FCC because you have a government that's and not just Republicans but Democrats alike in fact

[01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:48.850]
Jonathan Adelstein who's the most rabbit of them all he's a Democrat and a Jew but nevertheless he doesn't believe in free speech

[01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:55.950]
The whole bunch of mall five of them are doing just a bunch of fascist to think that they're gonna show everybody how goody two shoes

[01:40:55.950 --> 01:41:01.190]
They can be and how they can drag America kicking and screaming back at the Stone Age and they're doing a hell of a job of it too

[01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:08.990]
Stuff that's as innocuous as anything that we used to do just routine it just like the thing with the fart sounds

[01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:15.930]
I mean look what kind of a childish mentality you have to be to say oh fart sounds are offensive. We can't have that stuff on here

[01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:18.010]
They based on what?

[01:41:19.110 --> 01:41:22.630]
Based on the fact that a group of brutish morons sat around a table somewhere

[01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:28.150]
Decided that they were gonna clean up the airwaves to protect America from from far from gas. I guess I don't know

[01:41:28.150 --> 01:41:31.770]
I mean our little kids offended if they hear a fart sound

[01:41:32.610 --> 01:41:36.270]
The only time I'll offend invite is if it's for real. I have it to be there downwind

[01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:39.870]
Line nine w2 a.m. Hello

[01:41:41.170 --> 01:41:45.690]
I'm like a ask how you're doing because that's bigger than last 15 people actually the same question here

[01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:50.290]
How you doing and I'm doing just as good as I was before great. Yeah, 50 was you know something

[01:41:50.290 --> 01:41:55.710]
I'm gonna turn 40 in about another 11 hours right now, right and I've listened to you since

[01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:59.550]
1778 I can go back over to famous name

[01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:06.270]
Thank you very much and go back over to famous name game and the holy Joe's and the mall and all hair and the match

[01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:13.470]
To hair this guy come on beforehand. I mean, please at least put some patience on the reason why there are no borders out there

[01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:17.610]
There's no advertising because it's not the Howard's third show if the Howard's third show

[01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:23.530]
It's a cab driver comes in and bust it. He's like a worth free over there. I mean you're doing the opposite

[01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:24.110]
You're doing

[01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:30.130]
Less to get paid more money and more money in your eyes. This guy's making 15 million year when is he gonna produce?

[01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:34.450]
I mean if he lived off what he did before because some are shows that are the same as today

[01:42:34.450 --> 01:42:38.590]
There's nothing different about it. Show there's nothing he's doing today that he didn't do in 1983

[01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:44.470]
I don't know what the phenomenon is about this guy and he's the king of all media and why everybody just loves him

[01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:48.490]
But they did him on best 10 o'clock the guy doesn't have four hours of material

[01:42:48.490 --> 01:42:54.910]
That's a damn fact and ten minutes of commercials with QIM should do is put his commercials on while he's on the years of release

[01:42:54.910 --> 01:43:00.150]
When it's just thanks we could say at least listen to the spots because I can't see anybody coloring this nonsense

[01:43:00.150 --> 01:43:04.590]
And actually it is it's a damn fact. I hate it to wait till 10 30 10 45

[01:43:04.590 --> 01:43:09.990]
Whenever they're gonna put you on their back slide for this has been that made his name 20 years ago

[01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:15.230]
And the 20 years will still be on here make it twice as much money and doing absolutely nothing. Thanks for your time, Neil

[01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:16.190]
And have a great day

[01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:24.430]

[01:45:54.710 --> 01:45:56.210]
I have to go.

[01:45:56.290 --> 01:45:57.430]
Oh, wait, by the way, something.

[01:45:57.490 --> 01:45:59.750]
No, I have to go.

[01:45:59.890 --> 01:46:02.030]
I told you what, I'll hold you over the break.

[01:46:02.150 --> 01:46:02.510]
How's that?

[01:46:03.010 --> 01:46:05.170]
I'll give you one of my old tank t-shirts.

[01:46:05.370 --> 01:46:05.670]
How's that?

[01:46:06.730 --> 01:46:09.610]
No, hey, that's what the only color we had.

[01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:11.990]
The things I know that's lower than it.

[01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:14.470]
They're going going going going going.

[01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:17.390]
They're going going going going going going.

[01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:21.430]
They're going going going going going.

[01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:22.350]
They're going going going going going.

[01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:26.110]
Wow, you got sick, you ain't gonna say.

[01:46:27.190 --> 01:46:29.950]
I'm your nose and I just say.

[01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:33.970]
And around those losing pimples.

[01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:37.270]
You've got my eyes on you.

[01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:41.290]
If you go look and down here I don't see.

[01:46:42.110 --> 01:46:44.950]
A road map of Yitzel and D.

[01:46:45.970 --> 01:46:49.430]
You've got to have me some way to die.

[01:46:49.670 --> 01:46:51.230]
Die, die, die, die.

[01:46:51.730 --> 01:46:54.950]
I know it's close when something stays.

[01:46:55.710 --> 01:46:58.410]
It's almost every day I get.

[01:46:59.370 --> 01:47:02.010]
And my veins, and they start to tickle.

[01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:05.130]
I had to know it, and it was always always.

[01:47:05.130 --> 01:47:10.490]
Yeah, I told my God, told my God about that.

[01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:13.490]
That's what God told me, when they all died.

[01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:17.850]
And I told my spirit, with my old veins.

[01:47:19.190 --> 01:47:24.250]
Yeah, I told my spirit, and I told my spirit,

[01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:30.390]
And I told my spirit, how I know that I'm pleasing.

[01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:47.910]
What about 134, 26, go two at five, 60 WDQM, mad dog coming along.

[01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:49.930]
Can you believe it's almost that time?

[01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:53.450]
Holy moly rat man.

[01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:57.650]
See, haven't I said for a long time, four hours is too long?

[01:47:58.010 --> 01:47:58.790]
And you were right.

[01:47:59.270 --> 01:48:02.290]
Now, for 30 million a year, I do a five hour and 50 minutes show too.

[01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:05.150]
I'd go on until I collapse, you know, every day until I ran out of gas.

[01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:06.590]
Another new story.

[01:48:06.670 --> 01:48:09.790]
For hours is too freaking long, but like three hours and 45 minutes.

[01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:12.130]
Is that what it is?

[01:48:13.130 --> 01:48:16.090]
Yeah, today is two hours and 45 minutes.

[01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:18.450]
I'm almost embarrassed to take that check, you know it.

[01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:20.090]
But, I'll overlook it.

[01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:23.630]
Here's a thanks from our buddy Bigar and he says,

[01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:26.510]
don't listen to that anti-pull jerk or what's your pull, there's a lot of fun.

[01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:31.050]
Before I finish the other sentence, which is cute, let me just say this to you, okay?

[01:48:31.930 --> 01:48:35.250]
As George would verify, and Josh, anybody who ever worked on his show,

[01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:38.410]
when you call his show, you can talk about basically anything you want.

[01:48:38.910 --> 01:48:41.870]
And I've been even asking, you know, the response with all the changes and the format,

[01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:42.950]
what's going on in the station.

[01:48:43.050 --> 01:48:44.950]
Now, there are many things people can be talking about,

[01:48:45.090 --> 01:48:47.510]
and in addition to like throwing in some names on the pole, which they do.

[01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:51.410]
But generally speaking, unless you've got a building pole, and people can add names to,

[01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:54.810]
they ain't got nothing to say in South Florida, I didn't invent that, that's nothing new.

[01:48:55.690 --> 01:48:56.370]
At any rate.

[01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:59.470]
It says also related to starting late due to Howard.

[01:48:59.710 --> 01:49:02.950]
Boy, how can I get somebody to work the first hour of my job, Bobab, since Bigarney.

[01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:05.410]
Good point, Arnie, as usual, you got your thumb on it.

[01:49:06.730 --> 01:49:10.530]
What person in their right mind wouldn't give their left arm and half of their left

[01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:13.850]
to have somebody else work the first hour and an hour and a quarter of their job

[01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:14.810]
and just to get paid the same?

[01:49:14.890 --> 01:49:15.790]
Sounds like a deal to me.

[01:49:16.150 --> 01:49:16.970]
To us, listening.

[01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:19.710]
Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

[01:49:20.630 --> 01:49:21.350]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:49:23.690 --> 01:49:24.090]
QAM?

[01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:26.430]
Sounds dead as a door nailed to me.

[01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.930]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:49:28.630 --> 01:49:29.070]
Good, hello.

[01:49:29.650 --> 01:49:30.030]
Yes, sir.

[01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:33.310]
You heard that the king of pop is moving to Miami.

[01:49:34.770 --> 01:49:34.990]
And?

[01:49:35.690 --> 01:49:38.410]
Yeah, Michael Jackson, man, he's moving right next door.

[01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:39.250]
And?

[01:49:40.130 --> 01:49:41.330]
Ah, we're going to love it, buddy.

[01:49:41.630 --> 01:49:42.030]
Have a good day.

[01:49:42.110 --> 01:49:43.910]
Okay, good, okay, say hello to you too.

[01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:48.530]
Never met a slime ball, let me just say, I almost said something else.

[01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:49.330]
F***ing bag.

[01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:51.290]
It begins with scum.

[01:49:51.490 --> 01:49:51.990]
Can't say that.

[01:49:53.210 --> 01:49:56.550]
Who do you think is the most beloved American celebrity of all time that's our poll on

[01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:57.430]
neo-roger.com?

[01:49:57.570 --> 01:49:58.330]
For him to need votes.

[01:49:59.210 --> 01:50:00.750]
And, you know, come see Come Saw.

[01:50:01.230 --> 01:50:04.550]
Of course, the other thing when you gauge the response on a pool, keep in mind that when you're

[01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:07.510]
only on for two hours and forty-five minutes, you're in the course of the show and ain't

[01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:08.870]
going to be that big on the pool, right?

[01:50:09.730 --> 01:50:09.970]
Right.

[01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:13.450]
I don't think we're going to be doing too many of those, we got a thousand votes during

[01:50:13.450 --> 01:50:14.770]
the show, polls anymore, John.

[01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:15.910]
No more record, breakers.

[01:50:16.230 --> 01:50:16.430]
No.

[01:50:16.930 --> 01:50:24.730]
Elvis 89, or when 27 years ago was his last ball moment, you can almost hear it.

[01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:28.270]
You can almost smell it.

[01:50:29.050 --> 01:50:31.470]
And of course, back in the day, we could let you hear it, but we can't do that anymore.

[01:50:31.930 --> 01:50:38.510]
Elvis 91, he zoomed past, Bob Hope 85, Lucy's dropping, Lucy Elba 80, and after that it's

[01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:39.490]
not much.

[01:50:39.930 --> 01:50:45.230]
Jackie Gleason 24, the Duke 23, Johnny Carson 19, etc., etc., small potatoes.

[01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:47.690]
Everybody QAM, hello.

[01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:51.350]
Yeah, I'm Jackie Cacillom, maybe I'm there.

[01:50:51.850 --> 01:50:52.770]
Everybody QAM, hello.

[01:50:53.530 --> 01:50:53.930]
Yeah.

[01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:55.190]
Yes, sir.

[01:50:55.210 --> 01:50:56.290]
I'm going to talk about the house furniture.

[01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.370]
I'm listening.

[01:50:58.330 --> 01:50:58.670]
Hello.

[01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.910]
This is me.

[01:51:00.850 --> 01:51:01.470]
Is it Neil?

[01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:02.270]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:02.370 --> 01:51:02.850]
Sounds like me.

[01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:06.410]
Hey, why are they cutting up the house furniture like that?

[01:51:06.850 --> 01:51:07.370]
Why are they going to?

[01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:09.490]
I can barely listen to it every other word, they bleep.

[01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:12.370]
Well, that's because they want it and they don't want it.

[01:51:12.370 --> 01:51:12.790]
You know what I mean?

[01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:14.810]
They don't have the balls to put it on, I'm expregated.

[01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:16.850]
They're going to lose a lot of fans, right?

[01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:19.910]
Because they've got to go to 103.1 to listen to the full effect.

[01:51:20.450 --> 01:51:20.990]
There you go.

[01:51:22.230 --> 01:51:24.050]
All right, that's the way they want to do it.

[01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:25.690]
It's Aval, don't blame me, man.

[01:51:25.810 --> 01:51:26.510]
It's not my choice.

[01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:28.530]
It's the QA in FN way.

[01:51:29.150 --> 01:51:31.470]
He's getting a little porky with me, right?

[01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:33.090]
That's the way you want to do it.

[01:51:33.150 --> 01:51:34.110]
What do I got to do with it?

[01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:34.990]
Straightening you.

[01:51:35.410 --> 01:51:35.610]
Yeah.

[01:51:35.970 --> 01:51:37.110]
Well, we're going to go to the buzz.

[01:51:37.410 --> 01:51:38.410]
Get a good buzz, yeah.

[01:51:39.870 --> 01:51:41.330]
I mean, it just makes sense.

[01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:42.490]
Don't ask me.

[01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:45.010]
I'm not involved in these ingenious programming decisions.

[01:51:45.850 --> 01:51:49.290]
I'm not the one who all of a sudden had a bad case of diarrhea and woke up on morning

[01:51:49.290 --> 01:51:51.110]
and decided that, oh, I don't love sports anymore.

[01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:53.610]
And we don't care if the dolphins take their eggs somewhere else.

[01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:56.150]
And Howard Stern is going to make something.

[01:51:56.430 --> 01:51:56.950]
Maybe they're right.

[01:51:57.090 --> 01:51:57.910]
Maybe it's going to work.

[01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.910]
Maybe.

[01:51:59.290 --> 01:52:01.370]
And maybe on the other hand, it'll blow up right in their face.

[01:52:01.630 --> 01:52:03.310]
You know, like that.

[01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:04.430]
Who the hell knows?

[01:52:05.490 --> 01:52:06.210]
Time will tell.

[01:52:06.710 --> 01:52:07.470]
What do you think?

[01:52:07.850 --> 01:52:08.790]
Theoretically it could work.

[01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:09.610]
Right?

[01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:17.110]
I mean, there are so many people who can't hear the buzz or for Myers who are dying to hear

[01:52:17.110 --> 01:52:18.910]
Stern's act and his voice and whatever.

[01:52:19.110 --> 01:52:21.550]
Even if it is chopped up, they'll put up with whatever they get.

[01:52:21.810 --> 01:52:26.130]
But from what I'm hearing all of reports, and again, keep in mind, even if I wanted to listen

[01:52:26.130 --> 01:52:28.870]
to the whole thing, and I would only listen to a few minutes here and here last these

[01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:31.290]
two days, I hear the pre-delay.

[01:52:31.450 --> 01:52:33.630]
So in other words, when I'm hearing it, it's not all chopped up.

[01:52:33.630 --> 01:52:37.690]
All the way to here when the satellite drops out, all that funky Tommy's band music, all

[01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:38.490]
that heavy metal.

[01:52:39.650 --> 01:52:41.770]
And this morning I said, what is this?

[01:52:42.090 --> 01:52:44.130]
I mean, even I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on.

[01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:45.790]
You know, like is this part of the format?

[01:52:47.050 --> 01:52:48.810]
It sounds to be quite honest with you.

[01:52:48.930 --> 01:52:49.610]
Like an abortion.

[01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:54.510]
And you know how some people feel real strongly about abortion, don't you?

[01:52:56.690 --> 01:52:56.990]
Exactly.

[01:52:58.550 --> 01:53:04.770]
20 till 2 at 5, 60 WQA, and the new home of Howard Stern morning, six until whenever.

[01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:07.390]
And by the way, anything else Robin?

[01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:10.110]
Another new story?

[01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:12.470]
Oh, brother.

[01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:16.090]
Have you heard me talk about dry concepts for over 20 years on a show?

[01:53:16.150 --> 01:53:20.270]
In fact, I've used them in my home for over 20 years because they're very simple, they're the best in the business.

[01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:23.830]
No rip offs, no scams, no 595 room games that they play.

[01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:25.490]
They give you a written guaranteed price upfront.

[01:53:26.050 --> 01:53:32.250]
They send their certified technicians into your home, roll up their sleeves, they dry clean your carpets, which is an exclusive patented method.

[01:53:32.630 --> 01:53:33.950]
Nobody else in the world does this.

[01:53:34.170 --> 01:53:39.790]
It sucks out even the deep down dirt, way in the fibers of your carpet, that leaves your carpets looking and smelling just like brand new.

[01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:44.530]
Lemony fresh, and of course they're drying a couple of hours so you really can clean today, entertain tonight.

[01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:49.650]
So whether it's your carpeting, your draper, your pulse rear, your airy rugs, your expensive oriental rugs, all of these things.

[01:53:49.650 --> 01:53:51.790]
These are the folks you want to trust to them.

[01:53:51.850 --> 01:53:53.850]
And like I said, they give you a written guaranteed price upfront.

[01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:57.650]
A little rose when they finished the job you had to uncheck and you look at that floor and say,

[01:53:57.870 --> 01:54:00.630]
it looks and smells like I had brand new laid right there under floor.

[01:54:01.090 --> 01:54:04.870]
Call them toll free at 1-800-248-5071.

[01:54:05.050 --> 01:54:07.230]
Use them one time, you'll never dream of calling anybody else.

[01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:13.430]
And when you do make that call, have them put you understand by a list of the 7-X to 15% off the already unbeatable price.

[01:54:19.410 --> 01:54:23.250]
Drought Concepts making carpets clean and saw Florida since 1979.

[01:54:23.690 --> 01:54:25.770]
Your name's Emil Rogers.

[01:54:26.230 --> 01:54:29.430]
The President of the FlexiPKQAM.

[01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:34.030]
Pretty presidential endorsements.

[01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:37.530]
I'm Donald Trump and I'm endorsing John Kerry.

[01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:42.830]
Even though I have no respect for liberals, I also don't like right-wing nuts.

[01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:48.010]
Besides, my casinos always do better under democratic administrations.

[01:54:48.490 --> 01:54:52.330]
President Bush, this is the top one. You'll fire it.

[01:54:52.650 --> 01:54:59.510]
They say they'll keep up all their injuries until they expose all the secrecy.

[01:55:00.650 --> 01:55:04.030]
No, they're not hearing what they want to hear.

[01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:08.230]
There's no one talks while under open air.

[01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:12.610]
Is it truly FBI? No, about the press.

[01:55:13.110 --> 01:55:16.550]
This CIA make judgments that they now regret.

[01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:20.690]
Both the anti-terrorism policies.

[01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:25.090]
We just need more answers from the men who's key.

[01:55:25.190 --> 01:55:28.410]
We need to know. We need to know.

[01:55:29.170 --> 01:55:33.350]
What worse knew about my one-one we need to know.

[01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:36.870]
We need to know. We need to know.

[01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:42.010]
What worse knew about my one-one we need to know.

[01:55:43.170 --> 01:55:44.790]
145 and 560 W.

[01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:47.890]
If you're bringing the tear to my eye to think that it's almost time for the mad dog.

[01:55:48.090 --> 01:55:51.470]
Oh, right. Actually, he just came in. He's in studio today.

[01:55:51.850 --> 01:55:52.110]
Right.

[01:55:52.330 --> 01:55:55.830]
And he just had this look at his face like what's going on at QAM?

[01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:59.430]
Like he just swallowed the treasure cap.

[01:55:59.670 --> 01:56:01.870]
Yeah, he said it's weird. That was his quote.

[01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:04.550]
It's weird. All right.

[01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:07.390]
Yes. So he told us to tell you hello for him.

[01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:09.410]
Hey, mad dog. You demand.

[01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:12.030]
And by the way, he's been a kick in ass in those ratings.

[01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:15.030]
Gigantic humongous.

[01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:18.970]
And then, you know, the fact that he gave that money to Bob Graham's campaign.

[01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:20.390]
And we won't put that on the ear.

[01:56:20.530 --> 01:56:21.630]
And we'll hold it against him.

[01:56:22.030 --> 01:56:23.030]
Oh, I speak at a Wayne Highs thing.

[01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:26.050]
If you look on it, I forget what that website is where it tells you all the people

[01:56:26.050 --> 01:56:27.870]
that donated money to political campaigns.

[01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:28.310]
Right.

[01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:32.250]
And Shula and the mad dog give two grand a piece to Bob Graham.

[01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:34.510]
I guess that's covering their ass because of the Miami-Lace connection.

[01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:39.050]
But in any rate, Wayne, of course, always is a big Republican, right?

[01:56:39.330 --> 01:56:40.430]
Wayne, that field.

[01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:45.110]
But as far as Wayne being not wanting to stir on the station because of the fact,

[01:56:45.670 --> 01:56:46.990]
see if it doesn't make any sense to me.

[01:56:51.630 --> 01:56:54.070]
Well, I'm not going to waste my time with Wayne, okay?

[01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:55.430]
This doesn't make any sense.

[01:56:55.730 --> 01:56:55.990]
Okay.

[01:56:56.090 --> 01:56:58.310]
I'm not gay since I was aided New Jersey scandal.

[01:56:59.270 --> 01:57:03.870]
The Israeli man in Israeli, just like that moron Duron,

[01:57:05.550 --> 01:57:09.150]
Geronovsky, Duron, the drone, the moron.

[01:57:10.190 --> 01:57:13.590]
In fact, every time I hear that voice, I hear Marron is what comes to my mind.

[01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:16.970]
The Israeli man at the center of New Jersey Governor James McGreeby's restaurant,

[01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:19.950]
a designation over gay affair, said in an interview published yesterday,

[01:57:20.190 --> 01:57:23.730]
he is straight initially had no idea that his former boss was a homo.

[01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:28.330]
Gollum, Chappelle, for the Israeli Daily News Paper, Yeti Yot, Aura Note,

[01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:31.230]
then McGreeby repeatedly made unwanted sexual advances.

[01:57:32.110 --> 01:57:35.590]
Chappelle said he informed the governor at one point that he planned to sue him for sexual harassment,

[01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:38.730]
and Laurie's been negotiating a settlement when McGreeby resigned last week.

[01:57:39.070 --> 01:57:42.650]
The other story we had on our website said he was trying to shake him down for five million bucks.

[01:57:42.650 --> 01:57:47.290]
It doesn't bother me that it said that I'm gay, but I'm really not.

[01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:50.050]
He said I'm straight. I'm straight as an arrow.

[01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:52.930]
On the other hand, he accused me of being an extortionist.

[01:57:53.070 --> 01:57:55.790]
Someone has lost his mind, he was quoted as telling Yeti Yot.

[01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:59.030]
McGreeby and we know over the rest of that story.

[01:58:00.450 --> 01:58:01.930]
Trying to was shaking down for five million.

[01:58:02.250 --> 01:58:03.790]
So they say alleged.

[01:58:05.910 --> 01:58:09.890]
5.670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line,

[01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:12.050]
on the Howard Stern Response Line.

[01:58:13.090 --> 01:58:14.290]
Come in to QA and Hello.

[01:58:14.830 --> 01:58:15.970]
Hey Neil, yes sir.

[01:58:16.210 --> 01:58:18.930]
That'd be processed by a call by saying I'm a big feminist.

[01:58:18.930 --> 01:58:20.210]
Every year is a policy enthusiast.

[01:58:20.650 --> 01:58:22.870]
I get to say that at the beginning of data.

[01:58:23.370 --> 01:58:25.330]
I've no longer shown, I live higher Stern.

[01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:27.250]
I've never liked it before, but you say you know,

[01:58:27.630 --> 01:58:28.950]
that people like Benura and Aura,

[01:58:29.410 --> 01:58:30.690]
but I live higher Stern.

[01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:31.410]
I love you.

[01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:32.970]
I live with you QA.

[01:58:33.150 --> 01:58:34.230]
I'm not fed everything I need.

[01:58:34.770 --> 01:58:35.330]
Are you recording?

[01:58:35.710 --> 01:58:37.950]
Talk in the morning and spoke in the afternoon, right?

[01:58:38.370 --> 01:58:39.130]
What's nice about you?

[01:58:39.130 --> 01:58:42.410]
I was not so like, not sports 24 hours a day like a budgekin.

[01:58:42.930 --> 01:58:43.090]
Right.

[01:58:43.150 --> 01:58:47.970]
Now one more thing, I worked for FedEx and I passed by your building this afternoon.

[01:58:48.710 --> 01:58:49.990]
And you were talking about the satellite.

[01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:51.290]
There was a problem with satellite.

[01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:52.030]
Uh-huh.

[01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:55.470]
Okay, I saw a bunch of guys on the roof fixing the satellite.

[01:58:55.850 --> 01:59:00.410]
So I also leave all that cutting on and stuff won't be happening anymore in the morning.

[01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:04.310]
Now I think those guys on the roof were trying to restrain low from jumping is what I heard.

[01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:05.270]
Is that what it is?

[01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:06.590]
Neil.

[01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:07.850]
Thanks a lot, Kelly.

[01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:08.510]
Neil, Neil.

[01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:09.350]
One more thing.

[01:59:09.710 --> 01:59:11.330]
One more thing about your show trivia.

[01:59:11.770 --> 01:59:14.350]
Remember you had a caller called Big Something.

[01:59:14.590 --> 01:59:15.010]
Big Something.

[01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:16.790]
She was a security guard.

[01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.690]
Oh, yeah.

[01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:19.470]
Oh, George would know.

[01:59:19.650 --> 01:59:20.790]
Big, uh, yeah.

[01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:24.610]
She was a security guard in the Hall of the Hill in the building where my aunt lives.

[01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:25.150]
Right.

[01:59:25.370 --> 01:59:25.470]
Right.

[01:59:25.670 --> 01:59:28.990]
Me and my buddy were trying to figure out her name, but we couldn't.

[01:59:29.090 --> 01:59:29.690]
Oh, yeah.

[01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:34.050]
In fact, George just mentioned her to me the other day because we were talking about this lack of security guard we got now.

[01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:35.850]
Big, uh, big guy.

[01:59:35.850 --> 01:59:36.870]
Was it Big Max?

[01:59:37.230 --> 01:59:37.610]
Big Max.

[01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:38.150]
That's it.

[01:59:38.250 --> 01:59:38.910]
Is that the one?

[01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.710]
Yes, sir.

[01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.510]
All right, Neil.

[01:59:40.570 --> 01:59:41.090]
Let me see.

[01:59:41.210 --> 01:59:41.710]
Okay, see you.

[01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.290]
See that?

[01:59:42.370 --> 01:59:43.370]
Now that's the kind of call we need.

[01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:46.470]
There's a happy guy, which is not easy to find in South Florida, right?

[01:59:47.450 --> 01:59:47.590]
Right.

[01:59:47.690 --> 01:59:48.270]
He likes Stern.

[01:59:48.530 --> 01:59:49.090]
He likes me.

[01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:51.290]
He likes, uh, not somewhat sports anymore.

[01:59:51.590 --> 01:59:52.910]
He's a happy guy, right?

[01:59:53.190 --> 01:59:53.350]
Right.

[01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:54.290]
All right.

[01:59:54.630 --> 01:59:55.290]
He's a happy guy.

[01:59:56.230 --> 01:59:56.550]
Right.

[01:59:56.550 --> 01:59:56.550]

[01:59:56.550 --> 01:59:57.950]
And they're affixing the thing upon the roof.

[01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.350]
Huh?

[01:59:59.870 --> 02:00:01.190]
No, I really believe that it's more up there.

[02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.830]
Don't do it.

[02:00:01.930 --> 02:00:03.810]
Uh, Moe, you still got a couple of good years left in you.

[02:00:03.810 --> 02:00:04.450]
Yeah, doing something.

[02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:10.290]
I have to, after, after finding out that he's not listed in those promos at all.

[02:00:10.590 --> 02:00:11.690]
I mean, I heard it.

[02:00:11.790 --> 02:00:15.390]
It says Howard Stern, Neil, uh, mad dog and the hammer is what it said.

[02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:18.310]
I didn't hear no Moe in there.

[02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.790]
That was him.

[02:00:18.910 --> 02:00:19.310]
No day.

[02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:20.170]
He's just wallpaper.

[02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:21.870]
No one knows about him anymore.

[02:00:22.050 --> 02:00:22.790]
No one knows about him anymore.

[02:00:23.130 --> 02:00:23.130]

[02:00:23.130 --> 02:00:25.110]
When you think in his position, he'd be lucky.

[02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:26.350]
He'd be kissing the ground effect.

[02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.750]
No, no.

[02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:27.550]
We're not with that ego.

[02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:28.470]
He doesn't get it.

[02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:30.930]
Kiss the ground that you're still on the air, Moe.

[02:00:30.970 --> 02:00:31.810]
Believe me.

[02:00:31.810 --> 02:00:33.730]
I'm going to figure out some way to make you just disappear,

[02:00:33.890 --> 02:00:37.810]
thinking it's a vanishing cream, and stick it on that gigantic ball spot you got now.

[02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:38.630]
They do it.

[02:00:39.570 --> 02:00:42.550]
In fact, if you see Greg approaching with a big jar one of these days,

[02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:45.650]
Now, if you see Doug approaching with a big jar,

[02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:46.930]
That's another story.

[02:00:47.050 --> 02:00:48.430]
That's a horse of a different color.

[02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:54.570]
10-2 at 5-60, somebody Q-A-M.

[02:00:55.610 --> 02:00:57.250]
I've been telling you about a laser recharge.

[02:00:57.450 --> 02:00:59.550]
The toner and recharge cartridge specialist has to pass through.

[02:00:59.550 --> 02:01:02.410]
You waste a lot of your call, 800-287-9212,

[02:01:02.670 --> 02:01:05.370]
and save it a crap load of money on your printing and office equipment supplies.

[02:01:05.810 --> 02:01:08.170]
For those of you who haven't called, what you'll be waiting for?

[02:01:08.670 --> 02:01:12.210]
A laser recharge has got ink jets, thermo-carbon paper supplies.

[02:01:12.430 --> 02:01:16.590]
They provide service support maintenance for most makes and models of machines to make them run like brand new again.

[02:01:17.010 --> 02:01:20.450]
When you call 1-800-287-9212,

[02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:24.030]
You'll deal with just Bob, the Solonor has been supplying businesses and stuff,

[02:01:24.170 --> 02:01:26.690]
Florida with what they need most cases within 24 hours.

[02:01:27.190 --> 02:01:30.230]
A laser recharge can save you up to 50% on new cartridges,

[02:01:30.530 --> 02:01:34.690]
as compared to depot pricing, and all the cartridges sold by A laser recharge are

[02:01:35.570 --> 02:01:37.050]
Remanufactured, not refilled.

[02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:39.650]
Anybody on the street corner can sell you a cheap refill cartridge,

[02:01:40.030 --> 02:01:41.370]
but you'll only get what you pay for.

[02:01:42.030 --> 02:01:44.310]
Remanufactured cartridges are the only smart way to go.

[02:01:44.890 --> 02:01:46.970]
A laser carries a complete line of cartridges for printers,

[02:01:47.230 --> 02:01:50.030]
copiers and faxes, along with brother and Xerox drums as well.

[02:01:50.170 --> 02:01:52.210]
A laser recharge is part of their individual service,

[02:01:52.590 --> 02:01:55.710]
and they offer you a no-questions act, satisfaction, and what-and-see.

[02:01:55.710 --> 02:01:58.030]
So if you need total cartridges, all of these things,

[02:01:58.050 --> 02:01:59.810]
just pick up that phone call just Bob,

[02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:05.450]

[02:02:05.950 --> 02:02:08.310]

or make that call today, you'll have your stuff in no time at all.

[02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:13.570]
1-800-287-9212.

[02:02:14.290 --> 02:02:16.350]
You are listening to Neil Rodger's A,

[02:02:16.630 --> 02:02:20.430]
collectively on 5-6-4-0-5.

[02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:49.570]
3-2-1.

[02:02:50.430 --> 02:03:17.370]
3-2-1.

[02:03:22.910 --> 02:03:23.350]
3-2-1.

[02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.790]
3-2-1.

[02:03:25.150 --> 02:03:27.650]
3-2-1.

[02:03:29.690 --> 02:03:30.570]
3-2-1.

[02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:36.830]
Well, here's a good one to add to the pull of Marlon Brando,

[02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:38.490]
since any impember of pines, thank you Eddie.

[02:03:38.690 --> 02:03:41.590]
He's going to make us an offer, we can't refuse, or he can't, or somebody.

[02:03:42.910 --> 02:03:43.410]
What do you think?

[02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:46.270]
Yeah.

[02:03:46.670 --> 02:03:47.450]
It's a question of what?

[02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:51.530]
You don't think Marlon Brando belongs on the pull?

[02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:52.130]
Sure he does.

[02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:53.730]
Well, now that he croaked, what do you think?

[02:03:53.850 --> 02:03:53.850]

[02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:54.350]
What do you think?

[02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:56.030]
It's 2 o'clock already, Faso.

[02:03:57.710 --> 02:04:00.070]
You have to be dancing a jig around there.

[02:04:00.150 --> 02:04:01.930]
So, Valid Point, I can go to Keynes practice now.

[02:04:02.410 --> 02:04:02.850]
Here you go.

[02:04:04.510 --> 02:04:05.770]
Let's see, here's our pull result.

[02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:06.730]
I'm not going to touch that.

[02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:08.090]
453 votes.

[02:04:08.090 --> 02:04:11.070]
What do you think is America's most beloved celebrity of all time?

[02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:15.090]
And this was on a scale of 10 I'd say this pull was about a six and a half

[02:04:15.090 --> 02:04:16.250]
today, Come See Come Shot.

[02:04:17.190 --> 02:04:17.910]
11, 98.

[02:04:21.630 --> 02:04:24.130]
Who took his last VM 27 years ago?

[02:04:24.130 --> 02:04:27.190]
Well, the blessed last soul was wrong to me.

[02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:29.530]
Bob Hope 91, he ain't singing no more.

[02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:34.710]
Lucille Ball 85, John Wayne 25, Jackie Gleason 24, Johnny Carson 22.

[02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:38.190]
I'm going to read all the results just to a piss off at Faxi Raoul.

[02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:41.530]
You've got so much talent taking these fools to bed.

[02:04:42.450 --> 02:04:45.930]
Reds, Galton 16, Andy Griffith 11, Muhammad Ali 10, Fred Rogers 10,

[02:04:46.450 --> 02:04:49.910]
Captain Kang Wu 9, Celia Cruz at 8th, 8th, Prasigia.

[02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:50.430]
I'm incredible.

[02:04:50.810 --> 02:04:54.770]
I'll curl Bernat 7, Marilyn Monroe 6, Frank Sinatra 5, Frankie Lyman 5.

[02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:55.890]
Hey, Frankie, how's it going?

[02:04:57.250 --> 02:04:59.830]
Bill Clinton 4, Jerry Gell, now how come Clinton got on her?

[02:04:59.930 --> 02:05:00.530]
I said no politicians.

[02:05:02.630 --> 02:05:04.650]
You don't think that George made a mistake to you?

[02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:09.050]
No. Jerry Garcia, George Burns, Carol O'Connor, Judy Garland 3.

[02:05:09.590 --> 02:05:11.490]
James Dean and Danny K. each had a pair.

[02:05:12.690 --> 02:05:16.630]
Arnold Palmer 1, Bob Marley, Bill Cosby, Ray Charles or Michael Jordan.

[02:05:16.630 --> 02:05:18.970]
That was supposed to be the ethnic selections there.

[02:05:19.110 --> 02:05:22.830]
And so far they're all tied with, they got the big ol' honey like that.

[02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:28.550]
So pretty, you know, my general analization of this is that they still got some,

[02:05:28.570 --> 02:05:30.450]
they got some kinks to work out, you know.

[02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:33.330]
The organization, the corporation, Greg Reed.

[02:05:33.590 --> 02:05:35.590]
They got some kinks to work out in the deal, right?

[02:05:36.770 --> 02:05:38.190]
It's a work in progress.

[02:05:38.370 --> 02:05:43.290]
Right, it's a work in progress because naturally you don't expect Greg Reed to do anything like with careful planning.

[02:05:43.290 --> 02:05:48.410]
And like, ahead of time think about to this and about that and what if this and, you know,

[02:05:48.490 --> 02:05:51.430]
lay it out like somebody would do a, with careful intelligent planning.

[02:05:51.630 --> 02:05:54.250]
No, it's just jump right in with both feet and the sea, you know.

[02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:57.430]
Like jump it in that pool and finding out there's no water in it when you hit the bottom.

[02:05:58.150 --> 02:05:59.390]
So we'll see how it works out.

[02:05:59.650 --> 02:06:02.570]
Anyway, I'm ecstatic, man. This is exactly what the doctor ordered.

[02:06:02.670 --> 02:06:04.970]
In fact, I liked it so much. I'm going to come back on Thursday.

[02:06:05.670 --> 02:06:05.990]
Woo-hoo!

[02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:09.770]
Little George will be back tomorrow.

[02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:11.310]
And then I'll be back on Thursday.

[02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:12.930]
You see, it is only another week and a half of this.

[02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:16.270]
And then unfortunately, the bad news is, it's back to that five-day-a-week grant.

[02:06:17.550 --> 02:06:21.030]
But I hear the good news is, Robyn's going to have anything else by the way, Robyn.

[02:06:21.090 --> 02:06:21.950]
Bye-bye-bye!
