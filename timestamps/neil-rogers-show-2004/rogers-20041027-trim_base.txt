[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]
You know, the show on scratch will run.

[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.480]
How to do it, Marshall.

[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.080]
Absolutely.

[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.720]
George Bush, live up where you can land so that you can.

[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.420]
A boy, be here, name now you said you.

[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:33.000]
Subjected duty just fine, might you be absent in your mind George Bush.

[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.020]
Your position is if they cause John Kerry is out to sue your fate.

[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.480]
It's those questions of the National Guard that might leave your rep.

[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.340]
You nation start.

[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.340]
It's fun to say you're not AWOL and you can't prove you're not a AWOL.

[00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.620]
You're not a funny thing, the military can't find where you were in that one year's time.

[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.580]
You party then you went AWOL and daddy helped you go away.

[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.980]
AWOL, if you don't become clean with the story that's real you might earn back voter of P.O.

[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.760]
Did he say Israel?

[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.120]
I'm pretty sure that's what he says, wait for it.

[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.680]
Yeah, here it comes.

[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.400]
Yeah, I love it.

[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.600]
1033, 2074, the Neorodji show at 11 o'clock.

[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.000]
Let's see we got the mad dog at 2, the Humper at 4, guilty at 7, and etiquette 10.

[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.880]
What a pristine lineup that is.

[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.520]
How do you like that?

[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.800]
I'll always see tomorrow we got Humper must be either back on vacation or horse's fashion again.

[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.880]
I don't know what the deal is.

[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.540]
Because tomorrow we got Joe Zagaki from 4 to 7.

[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.560]
OK, and then on Friday we got guilty for the Humper.

[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.200]
So he must either be going off to Vegas again to plunge his guts out or who knows what in his place.

[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.100]
Who knows what.

[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.940]
So today's like an experiment for us because this is the first day.

[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.260]
I said on Monday that we were going to be doing this filler material to 11 o'clock because we have to start the show at 11.

[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.340]
Because this business is coming out at a different time every day.

[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.940]
Obviously it don't work.

[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.180]
No, no, no, no, there's not a chance in hell.

[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.680]
It's like we've been butchered, we've been slaughtered, we've been attacked, we've been assassinated.

[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.660]
And so as a result we have to pick ourselves up by some of these bootstraps and whip it.

[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.620]
So I'm thinking to myself, what will you auto really do?

[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.040]
It's take a lot of calls via 4 or 11 o'clock, don't you think?

[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.060]
What is well?

[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.880]
Yeah, get some of those in.

[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:59.080]
Now don't forget the Miami debut screening of Rush to War, a one hour documentary by Miami native and noted film producer Bob Teacher will be shown.

[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.300]
Oh, that was yesterday will be shown yesterday.

[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.760]
I thought it was going to be a tomorrow.

[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.760]
No, no.

[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.420]
Well, it was last night.

[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.400]
So if you missed it, you flood them on you.

[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.880]
Maybe we'll get some reports on it.

[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.940]
You think?

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.900]
Right.

[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.940]
I doubt that.

[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.260]
It'll be shown last night at 730 and 930 at the flavor nightclub.

[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.980]
Well, that's just to make up with the Woody Graber because you put some off all the time.

[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.500]
All the time.

[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.880]
I don't know if we're doing one.

[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.280]
Maybe for those crappy tickets, he always gives this.

[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.180]
So if you want to hear about who won the pool yesterday and today's pool and to be the gritten end of the start of the show, check back with us at 11.

[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.160]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.120]
This is also a little while I worked for WSUN.

[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.300]
Check back with us later.

[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.180]
Also give me some of the things that we're streaming.

[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.840]
Right.

[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.740]
Are we streaming?

[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.360]
We are now.

[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760]
Oh, WQAM.

[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.000]

[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.840]
Don't be a gross man.

[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.620]
Both of us.

[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.580]
WQAM, hello.

[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.960]

[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.840]

[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.280]
Been calling the election office always busy, busy, busy.

[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.680]
Right.

[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.200]
Can we go vote early or will that give us a problem?

[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.580]
Of course, you can go vote early.

[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.900]
Sure.

[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.880]

[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:16.300]
I had never thought that a program that was pointed to be set up which it originally was like your me Carter for third world

[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.240]
Country is would be here in the United States that is correct

[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:25.660]
That's the most important point is that third world countries and the ones that have to have their elections monitored because we can't trust the integrity

[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:32.700]
Election officials and of the parties political parties and now here we're doing it in the USA because we've got nothing but a bunch of crooks all the way around

[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.440]
Exactly and then on the two of saying night I'm going to be at the Broward Supervisor of Election Office

[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:46.020]
Being one of the observers and you would think that because she is a Democrat which Brenda's knife is we wouldn't be having problems

[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:52.460]
But just what the F&P Bale of sound coming in there not being know about it's like an amateur hour here in Florida

[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.300]
That's correct right. I think we better have Wesley Snipes

[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.940]
Yeah, I would rather have him. I think we could probably get it right in fact

[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.000]
Let's get Brenda Lee and Wesley Snipes and get the two of them together. They sure do better than Brenda

[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.900]
She's she's just nothing but another mirror of elephant all over again

[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:12.660]
No, absolutely she is she's a more educated one that's about it. Well do a job palying over

talk show where Michael Paul is on. When you get into the

[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.860]
world. That's right, in the change of world, by making a

[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.300]
phone call and getting there. You know, it's just amazing how

[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.160]
some of these people, but that's the American public for you,

[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.340]
baby, once you're sheep. Anyway, here's a fact from Elmer, who says,

[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.680]
I think even your audience may appreciate the new music video,

[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.960]
Mosh, by M&M. I make it. I make it important. Made the news all this

[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.160]
Lord. I didn't see it. Is that a monster Mosh? No, better. I

[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.000]
pasted link at the bottom of this fact. It says, I know you don't

[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.080]
care for this guy's music that much as neither I do to say the

[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.620]
very least. The video is a skating critique of our commander in

[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.380]
thief. Maybe you can post it on your site. There's no doubt it's

[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.220]
only a matter of time before gets taken off the air. Just pursue it

[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.960]
misspelled if you have a chance. Come on, Elmer, get an

[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.540]
educational KPS. Most will suck. Absolutely. What he says. So

[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.060]
maybe we'll want to put a link to it on our is that that good. I

[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.180]
haven't seen the video. I only saw the news reports about the

[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.860]
video and indeed it rips Bush and asses. And speaking of fighting

[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.940]
the FCC. You will never play this. You'll be going to play an

[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.520]
FCC song. After 11 o'clock. This is real 18 years ago. I'm

[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:44.380]
not easy. What are we gonna do? I think we are all being screwed.

[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:50.400]
I think we're why this happening to us. We want the FCC to get

[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.780]
off our fucks trot. There's no place for us now even

[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:01.700]
to do this. Are all down in the mouth. You can't listen. But now

[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:10.360]
you will find any words that will carve your mind. No fun to be

[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:20.320]
fed or by the FCC. No fun to be fed or by the FCC. They'll be

[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:32.500]
fed or by the FCC. No fun to be fed or by the FCC. They want us

[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.460]
to be clean. They think they know what we should feel. They

[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:42.040]
try to dictate to us what is real. Young enough. We listen to

[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:49.400]
us. I think young enough. Please don't put up a fuck. Help us

[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.800]
with one thing. You'll run us. Can't do it all by yourself.

[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.040]
Let's all help him. Don't put it up on the shelf. Let the

[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.480]
FCC know just how you feel. And maybe we'll get this much

[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:14.640]
of while we feel. As easy what are you doing to us? As easy

[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:21.760]
what are you doing to us? Our rating was life. In fact, they

[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:28.540]
might die because of the FCC. You want to band what we can do.

[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:35.640]
As easy you band what we can say. You've even tried to

[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.740]
send the records. Send the teachers.

[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.180]
Peace over. I am talking to you. I sent people.

[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.760]
They're standing by for what's true. Send your letter.

[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:55.340]
Into so far so we can tell the FCC what the end of us. They are

[00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:01.680]
your brothers. And so far are on your side. We have nothing to

[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.280]
hide. Young and young. Get your opinions out. And maybe

[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:17.160]
the FCC will stay out. As tough as easy in the morning now.

[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:23.380]
In the evening now no one knows what was right. They've been

[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:34.800]
saying we are the FCC to land. Go away. As easy. Get off our

[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.880]
path. As easy. Let us live our lives. For real.

[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:50.480]
As easy. As easy. Don't go away, man. Just go away.

[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.660]
How come it can't be more like that guy that did that save our

[00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:01.140]
first amendment rights campaign? That's right. That's ancient

[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:05.000]
history. You're like spitting into a windstorm. You're farting into a tunnel.

[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.900]
I want to get a lot of publicity from it. That's fine. We didn't get in.

[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.920]
We shouldn't get a lot of help from anybody else in the industry.

[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:15.640]
That's okay. Because it's America where censorship is all about.

[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.920]
You can't say crap and pretty soon if Bush gets in again we

[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.020]
can be able to take one especially if it smells the wrong aroma, the wrong

[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:26.720]
flavor. 5 6 7 0 5 60. I'll tell you one thing. Can she sing or what?

[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.660]
Whoever the bitch was boy that was that was something line nine.

[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.600]
Better get on before 10 at 11 o'clock WQ am hello. Q am.

[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.000]
Yeah, you taking calls tomorrow? I think I would take calls tomorrow.

[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.820]
Yeah, you making plans for tomorrow? Yeah, call me around 10 45.

[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:53.940]
OK, 45. OK. Hey, I got an idea. Let's make appointments for when people can call

[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.720]
in because a lot of these people are very busy especially with the early voting and

[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.480]
everything. You know, I'll go get the ledger. Right. WQ am hello.

[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.660]
Neil. Yes, sir. Top of the morning there to your pali. And back to your pali.

[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.180]
It's with tremendous pride that I'm able to say that I voted early and I voted for our guy

[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:16.080]
to take care of you. All right. Yeah. And just to put a few things in perspective,

[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.040]
after I voted, I went over to their campaign headquarters. They're in beautiful

[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.700]
Delray Beach and picked up a couple of signs for my lawn. Right. And saw we

[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.000]
planned those that afternoon when I got home. Got up the next morning. Somebody drove up

[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.540]
a lawn or ran the signs over. I'll be damned. Well, it's a good thing they didn't bring your

[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:37.300]
house down. That's next. I think they just kind of speak volumes for the mentality of

[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.180]
those people out there to think that maybe Bush ought to be in there for another four years.

[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.540]
Well, you doesn't be putting no carry signs up, mister, because you're on American

[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:48.740]
unpatriotic in whatever else. And perhaps you got your two. Yeah, exactly.

[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.840]
Well, it's also on the I just want to say thanks to everybody out there that can hear my voice

[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.640]
whatever do whatever you can. I volunteer for this weekend to do whatever I can to

[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.760]
put the phone banks, vote some signs as the street corners, whatever. Just get out

[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.080]
there. Tell your friends to get out there. Do whatever you can. You know, it's in our

[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.920]
best interest to see to it that that bonehead is ousted coming November 2nd. Amen.

[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:15.000]
Bye bye. We'll talk to you in a minute. We'll talk to you tomorrow at 1132.

[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.640]
56670560. That's great. Let's go to book appointments for when you can call on the show.

[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.740]
In fact, we'll even give them their own private line. How do you like that? In other words,

[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:32.340]
you can call that online free at 1214 tomorrow. That sounds good. Huh? Yeah, that's a

[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:41.260]
plan. WQAM. Hello. Hello. Yes. Yeah. God. Yes. I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah. You ought to be. I'm sorry.

[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.300]
Okay. I just want to do what you want. What is it? I want to ask you two questions. You're

[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:52.820]
speaking to a man. I'm sorry. Haven't they put you away yet? Oh, God. Listen. Two questions. Yeah.

[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:58.640]
Exactly. Okay. The first I wanted to let you out only on Wednesdays or what? God.

[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:06.920]
You know, just in just a two thing. Okay. Okay. The guy last week called in. He said everybody

[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:13.540]
Google Stanley Hilton. And I did that. Okay. And I said it with an app. It everybody

[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:18.880]
should do this. Google Stanley Hilton. Google Stanley Hilton. Yeah. You just read it. I mean,

[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:28.280]
read the interview. It's everybody should read it. What's the upshot? What is it all about? He's

[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:36.400]
not just implicated in 9-11 that he actually engineered it. Really? It's radical. Okay. But it's

[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.080]
everybody should read this. Or, you know, just do it. And you know what you're smart enough to

[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:47.420]
engineer 9-11? I would. I would. I would. I would. I would. Okay. Somebody did that.

[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:55.800]
And show you. Somebody. This is the Neil Roger show. This is your brain. Any

[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.380]
questions?

[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.800]
Yeah.

[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.800]
Yeah.

[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.620]
It's 11 o'clock at 5'60 WQM. Happy Wednesday to you. And now we start to show

[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.540]
officially. I like that. That worked out really well. Didn't it? Sure. Piece of cake. We had a

[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:40.380]
whole half hour there. We also got the FCC song in which what's it's like about that. In fact, I'm so

[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:45.300]
inspired by the Dizzy lady that just called. I actually printed out a story, a column. You

[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.900]
know, Williams River William Rivers Pit, which I read his stuff all the time from

[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.840]
June 20th, 2002. He's got an article all along the watchtower. That's his column about Stanley

[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.000]
Hilton and about the lawsuit and about all these things. So I'm going to actually read that.

[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.600]
Great. By the way, that was not the Dizzy lady. That was just a Dizzy lady. I didn't say the

[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:13.860]
capital T that was B with a small T as opposed to the official Dizzy lady. But you know this one. She's

[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.880]
a little. She though case. She means well. Anyway, our poll from yesterday. Let's get things

[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:24.840]
in order here. Okay. Let's get things organ eyes. Can we say organ? Oh, sorry, Joyce. Let's get things

[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:31.240]
in eyes. How are you? Are you that your vote is going to count next Tuesday? Huh? Or anytime?

[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:44.880]
2153 votes. Some of sure 607 have serious doubts. 494. Uh, about 30, 371. 100%. You're 322. Well, good for you.

[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:53.100]
Don't know 237. I can't vote 54. I don't give a shmit 43. And I won't vote only 25. Now, B did

[00:23:53.100 --> 00:24:00.960]
curtain today. Find picture too. I must tip my head to you. I am a falchi. And most people

[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.380]
are probably saying, what do you think most people know who she is? No. You're like a known

[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.800]
who she is behind the B did curtain when John Ascroft isn't looking. Just keep your eye on his eyes.

[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:17.560]
Okay. And when he looks away for a second, that's the time to take a peek at it. And the picture too. April 22, 1972,

[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:22.860]
Anna was born in Tampa, the Finland, which I'm sure I'm not pronouncing that right. Cause I ain't known that's,

[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:27.960]
well, she was born in Finland. Anyway, she made her debut in a TV commercial for an Italian bank

[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:40.780]
starring Paolo Velagio. And her filmography goes on with a whole bunch of Italian stuff. Apparazzi,

[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:48.220]
Giovanni Ebelli. How's that? What Enrico Ballai doing? Send it all to you day. Paolo Deneve.

[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.820]
I know a whole bunch of other Italian stuff, which I'm just reading it just to practice my Italian,

[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:58.820]
which isn't very good. Miracoro Italian. Del amor, te de la morta. And the things like that.

[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.660]
Melcontinente Nero. So there she is. Anna falchi. She is flawless. And she'll be on her way to a sweep.

[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.340]
Of course, keep in mind that they were down three zip to the Yankees and all of a sudden they

[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.860]
had to do a big turnaround, you know, that flip flop. That famous the England flip flop.

[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.700]
So as we saw to that, oh, speaking of that, there's our main.

[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.840]
Oh, you got a funny.

[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.560]
Responsibility. Scary John Kerry.

[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.340]
See, they put him out for like three seconds, who is becoming the chief minister of disinformation.

[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.160]
You know, John.

[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:45.280]
He echoed that it's not the administration's fault and he even criticized those who raised the subject.

[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:51.200]
Now, my friends, my fellow Americans, this is a growing scandal.

[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:59.440]
And the American people deserve a full and honest explanation of how it happened and what the president is going to do about it.

[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.420]
Now, there are risks.

[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:10.340]
And then at Lou Dobbs, that Nazi and drag who pretends to be something else with all his stories about outsourcing of jobs,

[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.000]
he's really crumbling out of the pressure now. We're just a few days left.

[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:22.180]
Last night on CNN, the main thrust of the hour in which he was castigating former UN inspectors was, well,

[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:26.960]
what would it be fair for the New York Times and CBS to run this story on the eve of the election,

[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.240]
which is what they were going to do October 31 or whatever.

[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:36.480]
And blew right up at his face because on the CNN poll, when I checked, there was like 77% of the people said, yes, only 23% said no.

[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.880]
I don't know why shouldn't it be honored? It's a new story, you jackass.

[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.200]
A major new story. Anyway, here's our poll today.

[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.680]
Which of these is most interesting to you? Most interesting, okay?

[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.200]
Not necessarily most important thing, but most interesting.

[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:59.160]
I've got three, six, nine, recuperating Clinton on stump for carry, humiliating Ashley Simpson-Lipsink on SNL,

[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.520]
tons of vanished weapons in Iraq, Red Sox may be world champs, they're just a win-away, dolphins finally win one.

[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.380]
The Patriots win their 21st in a row.

[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.240]
The NHL lockout. Anybody know about that?

[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:12.480]
No.

[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.620]
Shorted a flu vaccine or Bill Kamal busted and fired it at Channel 7.

[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.100]
That's a good list of stuff, you know what? Damn straight.

[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.420]
I didn't even put on Scott and Lacey Peterson because anybody cares about that is not allowed to listen to this show.

[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.580]
I mean, if you really get serious, when the hell is that thing going to end already?

[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:30.360]
What is over?

[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.780]
What? When they let him loose.

[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.560]
Which of these is most interesting to you?

[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:46.020]
Recooperating Clinton on stump for carry, humiliating Ashley Simpson-Lipsink on SNL, tons of vanished weapons in Iraq, red socks may be world champs, dolphins finally win one.

[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:52.880]
The Patriots win their 21st in a row. The NHL lockout, shorter to flu vaccine or Miss Abil Kamal busted and fired.

[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.940]
That's excellent list if you asked me.

[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.860]
I don't even know what I'm going to vote for when you come right down to it.

[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.340]
Maybe Miss Kamal because everybody else is voting for that one, right?

[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:08.860]
See, the deal is most of the time, most people would even remember who the hell Miss Kamal was, whether for a junior who payles behind a shadow of Miss Norcross.

[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:16.780]
But because we just had all him hurricanes and because most of us were house bombed and I was even lucky enough to be there for that one unlucky.

[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:25.020]
And watching hours and hours and hours, I mean, there was nothing else to see of all these weather ferries on there and there was Miss Kamal on there.

[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.660]
And you know something I think maybe God is meeting our little justice here, you know?

[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.000]
You think? It's carving so.

[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.720]
No, this is what you get when you get everybody whipped up into a frenzy and hyperventilating and stuff like that.

[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.500]
And then you have to pay your comeuppance, you know? Because the Lord works in mysterious ways.

[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.220]
Feel God!

[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.340]
That is correct. He's pissed off and fired up about the whole deal.

[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.020]
So Miss Kamal has got tourists and out on the beach.

[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:54.940]
Well, it's 1107 at 560 WQAM. It's the end of the month and now is the time to save like never before at Armstrong Ford.

[00:28:54.940 --> 00:29:00.340]
Of homestead where they have to clear out all remaining O4s on the lack to make room for those 2005's.

[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:05.600]
You'll save like never before on all remaining O4s and stock ready for immediate if not sooner delivery.

[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.120]
And all the O5s are in and ready to roll out plus for limited time.

[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.300]
They'll offer you 0% financing on any of the following.

[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.560]
Your explorers escapes, focuses, toruses and mustangs. Certain restrictions apply.

[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.220]
Lots of Armstrong Ford or homestead are jammed with more O5s arriving every day.

[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.300]
They're cutting prices now. You're going to save gigantic tons of cash.

[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:32.380]
Armstrong Ford offers more value to you too because when you buy your Ford there you'll get their exclusive tires and batteries for life program that is absolutely correct.

[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.300]

[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.760]
You are listening to Neil Rogers.

[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.320]
It's a glimpse of the player on 560 60 QAM.

[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.700]
Tom? Tom?

[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:24.740]
Oh, you see, crispy cream donuts like they were good for me. They might be told me that all the needless sugar and fat I got for meat and it does them every day might be why I weigh 400 pounds.

[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.220]
I gotta stop talking to get my oxygen mask back on.

[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:35.720]
At crispy cream donuts we've noticed that fewer of you are coming through our doors to stop your faces with our cholesterol dip sugar infused wake up treats.

[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.160]
At first we thought it was simply because many of you were just too fat to get through our front doors anymore.

[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:50.800]
Then we heard about low carb diets. Can you imagine how hurt everyone at crispy cream was when we heard that you, our customers, were turning your back on us simply because of your health?

[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.940]
Yeah, you're right. I feel so guilty.

[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:59.780]
That's why we're trying to lure you ingrates back through our newly widened doors with our all new crispy cream crumbs.

[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:05.720]
Crispy cream crumbs are much smaller. Crumbs actually so you have to eat a bunch of them to equal one full donut.

[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.300]
And our nutritionist here at crispy cream say that means they're almost like diet food.

[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.040]
I'll take a dozen bags.

[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:18.980]
Crispy cream crumbs. We use a cadence bell each of those three words. So how smart can we be anyway?

[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:19.280]
Listen.

[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.500]
That's another one for the audience.

[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.340]
And 11.3560s.

[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.980]
We watched WQAM.

[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:27.640]
WQAM.

[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.700]
We think it's link worthy. And you might actually like it.

[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.280]
Is it worthy? It is.

[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.840]
It is worthy. Well, I'm going on there. It's powerful.

[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:36.660]
Alright.

[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.820]
Then we'll have a link to the M&M video. There'll be another reason to go on the Arranger's dot com.

[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.260]
And William Rivers pit road June 20th, 2002.

[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.300]
Which was a Thursday. No less. You don't have to look it up.

[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.520]
Well, before we do that, WQAM.

[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.700]
Hey, what's up? How you doing?

[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.140]
Hey, want to start fighting for freedom of speech already. What's wrong with you?

[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:56.800]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:02.780]
Hey, I'm so pumped up today. I'm 21 years old. I'm on my way to vote for the first time.

[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.660]
Oh, right.

[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.880]
Last election I couldn't. And it's going to happen come Tuesday. We're going to get it done.

[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.880]
I think so, man. They're showing out and they're like ruling all over each other.

[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.320]
So many people showing up. That's it. It's going to be great. All right. Now take it easy.

[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.720]
Okay. Listen. Come in next Thursday 11.17 in the morning. Okay. You got a date.

[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.160]
Absolutely. Okay. See you. Well, what are you laughing about?

[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.840]
I'm making appointments for people at home. Now this is a whole new floor madman.

[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.500]
We got to figure it out. Listen. If anybody wants to fact,

[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.180]
Liehoff stands for let it happen on purpose.

[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.900]
The Liehoff theory puts forward the accusation that Bush and his people

[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:40.320]
allowed the September 11th attacks to take place despite the fact they've been repeatedly warned of an impending strike.

[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.480]
The Liehoff theory is straightforward.

[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.820]
In the month before 9.11, American intelligence agencies received ominous warnings

[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.200]
from the intelligence services of nations like Israel, Russia, Egypt, and Germany.

[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.760]
These warnings were pointed and attack involving hijacked aircraft

[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.520]
and prominent American landmarks was imminent. Our security forces were told.

[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.660]
Bush himself was briefed to these warnings weeks before they happened.

[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.820]
Instead of responding vigorously to these warnings, the Bush administration and its security apparatus did nothing.

[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.160]
Liehoff is, of course, the purest breed of conspiracy theory involving high-ranking members of government

[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.760]
from both parties, as well as the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA.

[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:21.860]
Like all good conspiracy theories, Liehoff is surmounted by disturbing facts and bits of evidence that are difficult to ignore.

[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.740]
The warnings from all those foreign intelligence services after all are quite real.

[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.660]
Egypt, Germany, Russia, and the Israelis were vociferous in their concerns.

[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.540]
The German intelligence service B&D told the U.S. and Israeli intelligence

[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:41.280]
that Middle East terrorists were planning to attack commercial aircraft to use his weapons to attack important symbols of American and Israeli culture.

[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:48.860]
The B&D's information came through echelon, the American control network of 120 satellites, that monitors all worldwide electronic communications.

[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.680]
Egypt, for similar warnings that, say, months regarding aircraft attacks delivered just before the G8 summit in Genoa,

[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.240]
Egypt's alert carried such weight that anti-aircraft batteries were placed around Columbus Airport in Italy.

[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:04.620]
The Russians warned the U.S. that the same summer of 25 pilots who had been trained for suicide missions

[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:08.900]
and Putin himself delivered the warning in the strongest possible terms to the U.S. government.

[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:15.140]
The Israeli intelligence service MESSA delivered a warning to both the FBI and the CIA detailing a major assault on the U.S.

[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.880]
against the large-scale target that was very vulnerable.

[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:26.720]
The Washington Post has reported that the NSA intercepted two messages on September 10, 2001, warning that something was going to happen the next day.

[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.760]
Tomorrow is zero hour, was one of the messages.

[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:36.660]
The NSA's charter is to intercept, translate, and pass on to FBI and CIA operatives important electronic signals from all across the globe.

[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:42.160]
The echelon satellite network, which provided the German B&D with their 9-loving information last June, is part of that system.

[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:53.260]
According to the NSA, the September 10th data was not translated until September 12th, but it stands to reason they were privy to the same electronic data the other foreign services were using as the basis for their warnings.

[00:34:54.100 --> 00:35:04.960]
One U.S. intelligence source claimed that that had provided no actionable intelligence, a fair claim given the vagueness of the messages and the volume of material NSA must deal with, yet in combination with these stride and foreign intelligence warnings,

[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.940]
the words intercepted by our large electronic ears on September 10th add to the growing questions.

[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:17.580]
Then there are the threads, a FEMA official told Dan rather that the disaster agency had been at the World Trade Center on September 10th.

[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:30.080]
Why? Governor Jeb Bush of Florida signed executive order number 01261 on September 7th, putting his state's National Guard on heightened alert status, essentially placing Florida under martial law for no demonstrable reason.

[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:38.220]
Why? Attorney General John Ashcroft stopped flying on commercial aircraft in the weeks before 9-11, something he had commonly done since his entry into the administration.

[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:48.720]
Why? At the core of the LIHOP theory lies motivation. What possible purpose could be served by the Bush administration allowing a terrorist attack to take place on American soil.

[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:55.160]
It is slightly inconceivable to most Americans that Bush and his people could demonstrate such callous disregard for American lives,

[00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:00.940]
and accusations that they allowed an attack to happen week of the worst kind of poisonous partisan politics. Why?

[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:10.300]
However is not so easily dismissed. Two French intelligence analysts, John Charles Bressard and Guiom Dasky, have published an extensively research book entitled,

[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:19.420]
Osama bin Laden, the Forbidden Truth. In it they leds that the Bush administration put energy policy before national security concerns. According to Bressard and Dasky,

[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:29.060]
a Foundering Pipeline project aimed at exploring natural gas reserves, along the Caspian Sea and Turkmenistan, was revived by the Bush administration when it arrived in Washington in January of 2001.

[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:39.860]
The Pipeline project, which sought to bring oil and natural gas from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan to a warm water port, had been the brainchild of American petroleum giant Unicael for much of the 1990s.

[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.460]
Unicael? Oh, that's not where Alawi came from, is it? And Hamid Karzai? Yes.

[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:57.600]
After the destruction of two American embassies in Africa in 1998, by Osama bin Laden, the Clinton administration forbade any American companies from doing business with the Taliban, which had been celebrating bin Laden in Afghanistan. Unicael's pipeline project was frozen.

[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:04.880]
After the Bush administration came to power, Bressard and Dasky alleged that reinvigorating the pipeline project became a high priority matter of policy.

[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:12.300]
Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocka was dispatched to Pakistan to discuss the pipeline with Taliban officials in August of 2001.

[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:22.480]
Rocka, a career officer with a CIA, had been deeply involved in agency activities within Afghanistan. According to documents, Bressard and Dasky claimed to hold the main subject of the discussion was oiled.

[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.640]
A Pakistani Foreign Minister was also present at the meeting and witnessed the exchange.

[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:36.920]
How does this pipeline relate to September 11th? According to Bressard and Dasky, the main obstacle to the completion of the pipeline was the fact that it had to pass through Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.

[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:43.060]
The project would receive no international support unless the Afghan government somehow became legitimized.

[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:53.020]
In bargaining for the pipeline, the Bush administration demanded that the Taliban reinstate the post-Kinwohamid Zayr Shah as ruler of Afghanistan and demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden for arrest.

[00:37:53.020 --> 00:38:06.100]
In return, the Taliban would reap untold billions in profit from the pipeline. According to Bressard and Dasky, part of the Bush administration's bargaining tactics involved threats of war if these conditions for the legitimacy of Afghanistan were not met.

[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:13.280]
The BBC of London reported on September 18th, 2001, of the existence of war plans on Bush's desk aimed at Afghanistan.

[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:19.400]
Nias Naik, a former Pakistan Foreign Secretary, stated that the war plans were slated for October 2001.

[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:26.220]
Condition set by the Bush administration to avoid war involved the Taliban's handing over of bin Laden and the acceptance of King Shah.

[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.460]
Naik went so far as to doubt that America would hold off on war even if these conditions were met.

[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:37.420]
The reason? The Bush administration very much wanted the unicale pipeline to go through and put intense pressure on the Taliban to see it happen.

[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:44.280]
As this was happening, American intelligence services were flooded with warnings of an impending attack on American targets by bin Laden and al-Qaeda.

[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:55.380]
The decision was made, let the attack come, and in the ensuing outrage American forces can carve out the guts of the Taliban government like a ripe gourd replacing them with a legitimate regime more receptive to the pipeline plan.

[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.340]
Did the Bush administration have an inkling of the massive death and destruction that would come on September 11th?

[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:09.560]
Those who espoused a lot have theory disagree on this point. Some believe, hang on one second because I have an interloper coming into my apartment right now even though I have the do not deserve sign on the door.

[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.440]
Okay. That's for real.

[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.320]
Sorry, I have to come back in two.

[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.080]
I'm freaking out.

[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.440]
Hold on a minute, baby.

[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:20.540]
Yeah, baby.

[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:20.880]
No, I'm kidding.

[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:26.120]
I've got a thing I put on the door every week, I come back in two but she obviously, no speaking English, you know how that goes.

[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.940]
Anyway, no, that's where you would know your Miami.

[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.260]
Did the Bush administration have an inkling of the massive death and destruction that would come on September 11th?

[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:49.980]
Those who espoused the lie-hop theory disagree on this point. Some believe that the team has present a ground zero on the day before the attack coupled with specific language within the international intelligence warnings pertaining to aircraft and high profile targets are prima facie evidence of specific prior knowledge.

[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.760]
Others believe that the Bush administration only knew vaguely that an attack would come but not wear a when.

[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.620]
They did not foresee the level of destruction that were caught flat footer when those planes appeared along New York's skyline.

[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:08.020]
In the end, lie-hop theory can encompass either view whether they had specific knowledge beforehand or merely decided let some attack happen somewhere.

[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.740]
The final results were the same.

[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.400]
The Taliban were routed and replaced by an interim government headed by a man named Hamid Karzai.

[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:19.720]
Karzai was recently elected president of Afghanistan in his own right, legitimizing the Afghan government.

[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:25.580]
Soon after this, Karzai announced the impending construction of a pipeline that would exploit Turkmenistan's natural gas reserves.

[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:32.580]
He names Unikal as the lead company for the project before becoming president Karzai of course was an adviser to Unikal. You guessed it.

[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:41.200]
For lie-hop theorist, the evidence is clear. The Bush administration got the pipeline it wanted. Along the way they used the horrors of 9-11 to place themselves above reproach.

[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:50.900]
It was in the patriotic fervor that resulted from the attacks. Both the press and the democratic opposition were bracketed by the administration espoused the idea that any questions or criticism were tantamount to treason.

[00:40:51.880 --> 00:41:00.340]
The passage of the Papia anti-terror act has given the U.S. government sweeping abilities to snuff the sent by defining it as terrorism thanks to the loosely defined wording of the bill.

[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:08.040]
Bush enjoyed stratospheric approval ratings that persisted this day. This was as of June of 2002. And American citizens were given new enemies to hate.

[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:15.720]
The defense department and the weapons contractors who cater to them received billions from the federal budget to do with this they pleased in order to address the objects of that hate.

[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:22.640]
Even the most hardened political observers must admit that this was the most truthful truth. September 11th was the greatest thing ever to happen to the Bush administration.

[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:30.060]
Attorney Stanley Hilton has brought lie-hop theory into the federal court system with his past actions sued and with the families of 9-11 victims he represents.

[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:37.740]
It will be interesting to see what transpires when these two facts collide in an American courtroom. Given the current climate it doesn't seem likely that much will come of it.

[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:43.980]
After all, these conspiracy theorists are just a bunch of nuts. Right? Right. That's what he says. Right?

[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:52.640]
Williams Rivers. Williams of Rivers. Pits. No, can't do it lies your hits or Freddie Pits. How come I always go through that whole routine? I was the Pits.

[00:41:52.940 --> 00:42:01.000]
Anyway, here's how our poll is coming so far. Which of these is most interesting to you? We got a battle going on here, baby. And I knew we would.

[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:11.500]
Tons of vanished weapons in Iraq, 69. Bill Kamal, Busted and fired at it, 55. He's right on those weapons. Ass. Busted. He's right on their ass.

[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:23.840]
Recuperating Clinton on the stump for carry 25. Red Sauce, maybe World's Tamps 18. Humiliating Ashley Simpson, Lipsink on SNL 12. D'Alphins, finally win 1-7. D'Alphins, finally 1-1. All right.

[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:32.500]
Shortage of flu vaccine for the NHL lockout for I'm shocked by that. And Patriots win their 21st in a row only three. Oh, well too bad you jealous.

We're gonna get Ricky a blow. Are you ready for some football then to them to ESPN game and he hits the hole right after Jesse opens it up. Oh, yeah.

[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:31.660]
ESPN game.

[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:42.460]
That's a fact that they're on good cowboy bears, Vikings, Packers, you'll get them all on ESPN game. He's gonna fire in into his guy right here.

[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:48.140]
He will the sweat. Of course you push your porch. You're poor smell. The passion. Disroad in backwards.

[00:43:48.420 --> 00:44:01.560]
You're putting right on his butt. There's ain't some makeover show on Bravo. It's the NFL on ESPN game. And then everyone's trying to flop it around down there in front where there's never a wardrobe mouth.

[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:14.700]
Function. I don't know where that one came from. Some days will never be the same. That was like it. The last shot out of the Roman candle call your cable operator now and demand ESPN game.

[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:22.660]
What do you have big old? What a meal. Those guys are all good ESPN game. Now that's a mouthful.

[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:33.960]
In the number 32 20 until the end of the five 60 here's a great fact from JW says I'd like to book Friday 11 35 on line nine. You got it JW got it down in the ledger. I did. All right. It's booked.

[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:50.640]
Also, it says I voted early for carry. The line was long enough. So I in English. So I voted in ESPN. You'll even though no speaking. No speaking. No speaking. No speaking. It's funny. It took about five minutes. Please place them for real stuff. I still miss his show. How do you like that? What do we have any? We got the chicken's ass and then I'll steal his two pay.

[00:44:50.640 --> 00:45:19.240]
I'll take your children. I'll sell them to some Haitians. Yeah, that's enough. Anyway, so I guess he's out on the beach again. I boy he sure got a star crossed existence. You know what? Well, it's one of those things. Well, that doesn't sound too like something. I thought he was your good pal. My best friend. I thought he was your good buddy. Indeed. No, we're just fine. Oh, no, I don't know if I can play this. Listen, I better not try.

[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:49.220]
I just can't take a chance. Okay, I'll let other people fight with Michael Paul on the FCC. I'm too old for that. Oh, if they only knew, man, what a joke. Anyway, it says, PS, how about some more Christina? Beated curtain picks. For a second, there, I thought it said, be the curtain pies. I'm not sure what kind of pies talking about. I think I got a pretty good idea. The one that we posted was the one and only nip shot. That was the only one. The only one worth posting. Well, that's your assignment. Now, Georgia's scouring the universe now. Maybe somebody else out there.

[00:45:49.220 --> 00:46:19.160]
There's got some booby pictures and booby traps and got to know what else of Christina. Although I must say that Anna Farcey, Fauci, whatever name is, Farty, Anna Fauci, she's held up a lot hotter than Christina would ever dream of being. Well, any, come on. Well, isn't that the truth? She's a voluptuous. She is flawless. I would say that's a great way to describe it. Flulless. There she is right there. She makes Christine look like stuff that I dropped in a bowl this morning. Okay. In fact, even without her, Christina, in my opinion, she's just

[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:48.940]
Fauci looking, you know, real Fauci, but with a lot of makeup and with all the tricks that they do, they can make her look really hot. And she looks like crap, Christina. I think she in the Carson daily are the same person. Look at that. Look at that. Anna Fauci, man. I mean, what's not to like there? That is if you're not hopping on that thing right away, at least the picture anyhow for a story. Regrian Coral Springs is I just found out I missed the first. This is great. I missed the first half hour. You showed today. What kind of crap is this? You said the show starts at 11.

[00:46:48.940 --> 00:47:18.060]
Now I find out that some people get it at 10.30. When you just don't have the right kind of radio, Greg. Who are these people? Are they special? Yes. How do I get on the preferred list of Neil fans? I've been listening to you for over 20 years and resent some newly come lately, getting more of you than me. Please put me on the preferred listener list. Hey, based on that last trend with America, we have any kind of listener list after that deal. Only right wingers and red necks, which is the same and sports nerds got diaries in the a month of September.

[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:47.960]
How many diaries did actually get sent back because of the hurricanes on other stuff? It was just a totally bogus month, which isn't rationalization, but anybody with a brain knows that Howard Stern didn't have a one point each year and men in the anana clock hour. I mean, that's just ridiculous. They also know that party radio didn't make this phenomenal comeback. Like allegedly, it's number one in the afternoon. Anybody with a brain knows that. That's my opinion. I'm like this. They know that party radio is dead. It's a doormat with the same six records. They're rooted in whatever they're playing. That's my opinion. I'm like this.

[00:47:47.960 --> 00:48:17.940]
All right, we got it. And anybody also with a brain knows that there are no heterosexual males under the age of 400, listen to love 94. So it was just all a pile of duties. What it was. Speaking of that, here's some good news. Kerry has lead in day. Pull says this is by Zogby International Democratic presidential. This is in the hero. So it might be true. John Kerry holds the comfortable lead among day County voters, much as former vice president, Al Gore did in 2000. Harold Paul says the biggest exception. We say with great regret. And so

[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:47.920]
despite of rumors to the contrary, the biggest exception is the Cuban American vote, which still overwhelmingly favors Bush. They just can't get it right there in little Havana. They're still living in a path. Even though now Castro says he's not going to take American dollars anymore. And we got this, you know, he's gotten all pissed off and bent out of shape because of this new Bush hard line. So that the people's relatives over there going to suffer even more than they ever did before. But that's okay. They just can't stop with the Bush crab. The poll conducted for the hero by Zogby International

[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:56.580]
shows Kerry favorite 54 to 41 indeed, but among Cuban Americans, the voting block target by Democrats nearly 79% say they backed.

[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:09.480]
Wooch, wooch, wooch. If you talk strictly numbers, Kerry is in very good shape in day. Zogby said, but if you're talking about intensity, Miami is a testimony in many ways to where we are as a country. High intensity polarization.

[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:20.480]
There is polarization in the organization for the poll 750 likely voters were called October 22 through the 25th margin of error is plus or minus 3.6%.

[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:29.060]
Zogby whose company is in Utica, New York where they drink UC, of course, Utica Club, UC. Give her those spots. Course now because you never live in upstate New York.

[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:39.160]
Utica Club, UC and probably out of business set about 10% of the poll workers were fluid in spine. You'll date County that most highly populated County in this importance.

[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:45.740]
Wayne State's been the focus of a political baddy, yada yada yada. And in this and that and all the other crap and are they're going to be able to fix it again in day.

[00:49:45.740 --> 00:50:00.620]
We're going to date County in 2000. Now let's look at these numbers. Okay. Because right now it's Kerry 54 and Bush 41 overall. Indeed in 2000 it was 53 for Gore 46 for more. So it carries doing three points better than Gore did right now.

[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:10.420]
Current the poll among Cuban Americans nearly 79% say they favor Bush. It also falls post of the total four years ago when just over 80% of Cuban Americans voted for.

[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:40.320]
So in other words, all this crap about why the Cubans have learned their lesson, their pissed off at Bush. They're going to vote for Kerry. How many are we talking about? Right. Bush all the way said, can swear off. He left. He 74. A Cuban American woman who participated in the poll. He says what he means. It means what he says. In other words, Abu Garret. Right. The other guy flaps in the wind like a sail. Mike Melnik, a Jewish voter from North Miami Beach said he was playing to vote for Kerry because Bush didn't have a grasp of the complex issues that threaten the middle class. What an understanding that that is.

[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:50.460]
I don't think we could be in more shape Melnik said. Kerry understands the issues. He's addressing the issues important to the middle class. By the way, how about that reduce that low consumer confidence in number yesterday? Wow.

[00:50:51.080 --> 00:51:00.820]
Took a huge dump. The biggest dump at about 4,000 years in the month of September. The poll shows Jewish voters in the state county supporting Kerry 82 to 15%.

[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:09.520]
And a larger margin than Cuban American supporting Bush. The only problem with that is if they're going to compare one to the other. There's a lot more Cubans than they've counted than there are Jews.

[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:24.320]
See. Zogby said Bush had failed to make inroads with the Jewish vote. Bush campaigned spokeswoman, Mercy Viana Schlapp. She's no Schlapper man said that Bush's message in his candidacy of strong support and data. Who cares what she says or the Kerry guy?

[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:30.860]
So there you go. Dave County so far as the latest Zogby poll 54% for Kerry 41 for Bush, Bush, Bush.

[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.920]
And if we'd stop letting them old Cubans vote, we'd be in love with her shape. Now and Howard.

[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:37.180]
Howard.

[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:45.560]
We got a message like that guy who called him before. He called in. It was an excellent point he made. I hope you people will stop and think about that about how fraudulent your elections have become.

[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:55.580]
When I was a kid 400 years ago, he actually would take place and if they were going to fix it, they'd do it behind closed doors real quiet. And nobody had to know about it. Now we got hang in chads, we got ballots being torn up where

[00:51:55.580 --> 00:52:01.400]
distrations being torn off absentee ballots not being mailed out. I mean, God only knows the kind of crap they're doing because he sure.

[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:11.020]
The Broward County Board of Supervisors election office pointed a finger at the US Postal Service yesterday for nearly 60,000 missing absentee ballots.

[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:16.500]
But took the blame for having a phone system that was being overwhelmed by calls from frustrated voters who are pissed up and fired off.

[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:27.040]
While the Post Office denied responsibility for the missing ballots, Broward County commissioners anxious to avoid another failed election offered to send county employees to help with the phones.

[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:39.040]
Dozens of employees could begin assisting the elections office. See, I don't even know if my vote's going to count. You know what? Right. My absentee ballot. I mean, it was mailed a ages ago. Days. I don't even know if it's going to count.

[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:47.760]
Dozens of employees could begin assisting the elections office today to answer telephone calls and to process voters at the 14 early voting sites.

[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:57.600]
What we're seeing is unprecedented. So if the supervisor of election needs our help, we will help. County Mayor Eileen Lieberman said it's a week to the election and voting is a basic right in our country. You go, Eileen.

[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:09.020]
What a perspication observation on her freaking part. Just six days away from the general election, the supervisor of elections office has fielded hundreds of complaints from people who have yet to receive their absentee ballots.

[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:14.760]
They are pissed up and fired off. Countless more than unable to get through the election office to complain or get their questions answered.

[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:24.860]
I tried for the last week or so to call the elections or office and it's just busy continually said Paula Zubak in 70, whose four week old request from actually ballots going on answered. I want to vote.

[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:36.980]
The election officials also said they launched an investigation and found that many of the missing ballots 58,000 of them were sent on October 7th and 8th to probably say this is something that's beyond our control deputy supervisor elections.

[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:40.160]
Just Stella Salas said post office officials say they're not at fault.

[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:47.540]
We have employees that we assign to handle the absentee ballots that come in said, you know, or rice spokesman for the Postal Service Health Florida District.

[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:54.800]
So all the absentee ballots that are received by the post office are processed and over immediately. In other words, probably the other 58,000 may just be our Schmidt-Canter-Songer.

[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:30.960]
14 to 9 to 560 W. Come, so anyway, I'm in the middle of reading that story about a half an hour ago. And there's a tap at the door, which I ignore, of course, because I'm in the middle of reading the story on a year doing a radio show. And it's the silly s illegal alien made again.

[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.660]
Come here, you're a chair there. You see him? Yeah.

[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:37.180]
Nine votes absentee ballots there. They're all over the damn place. There's so many people voting.

[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:44.600]
How do you like that? So we got ballots up the ass, baby, all over Florida, all over the place.

[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.440]
So I have no fear. The election will be stolen.

[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.320]
Parents square. Just like four years ago.

[00:54:52.600 --> 00:55:07.160]
Okay, Howard Stern got it away. He did exchange with FCC Commission Chairman Michael Powell during radio call and show yesterday with the shock shock saying the only reason Powell is in his position is because of his father, US Secretary of State, the anxious, Colin Powell, who always gets left off the hook because he's been in the middle of the party.

[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:16.560]
He's like, he's like, complicted. They always let him off the hook. Again, the other day there was show notes clips of him sitting there in front of Congress and in front of the UN, you know, both clips lying and lying and lying.

[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:26.300]
We got the maps. They got all these chemical. Stern said a friend told him the commissioner was going to be on the show and decided to call because Powell consistently avoids me and avoids answering my questions.

[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:30.740]
Does it make you nervous for you to talk to me? Stern asked, no, it does not. Powell replied.

[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:40.320]
Moments later Stern called Powell and and Nigma and said, you're the judge. You're the arbiter. You're the one who tells us what we can and can say on the air. God, he didn't even look like Joyce.

[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:51.160]
And yet I really don't even think you're qualified to be the head of the commission you deny that your father got you this job. Stern asked, I would deny to exceed him before Stern hung up. Powell told him good to talk to you.

[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.020]
Yeah, good to talk to you. Wow.

[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.040]
So I guess lying runs in the Powell family, right?

[00:55:59.020 --> 00:55:59.280]
Twitter.

[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:11.960]
And it goes on about clear channel paid this and this one paid. Powell was appointed by the way of the FCC by President Clinton proving that nobody is perfect and promoted a chairman by President Bush because daddy of course is Secretary of State.

[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:17.320]
And nobody don't like daddy or listen if they do it, can't say it in public because he's a like-complexed dark guy.

[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:27.700]
Now, I like the way that we get to take the calls in the fact in 1030 be a perfect time for Howard to say goodbye, which of course he'll say goodbye when he feels like it every day but it worked out well today.

[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:31.480]
Because then we can make a lot of appointments for people to call like a 1041.

[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.820]
Fit a bit. Yeah, we'll give you a fit.

[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:42.540]
Secret plans for the war in Iraq were passed in British Army cheese by US defense planners five months before the invasion was launched.

[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:49.480]
They court Marshall heard yesterday. This is in the independent UK. You sure is not going to read in your US weekly reader.

[00:56:50.800 --> 00:57:03.840]
The revelations, strength and suspicions that Tony Blair gave his agreement to President George Bush to go to war while the diplomatic efforts to force out of motion to comply with you and resolutions were continuing while they were continuing with that dog and pony show for public consumption to make it look good.

[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:14.020]
Alan Simpson, the leader of labor again, you win and showed that clear short was right to a certain her book serialized in the independent that Mr. Blair had knowingly misled parliament.

[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:22.480]
The plans are revealed during the court, Marshall of Ian Blamort, 23 from Leeds, who charged with a manslaughter of a comrade while serving in Iraq.

[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:29.540]
Sergeant John Nightingale, 32, a reservist from West Yorkshire died after being shot in the test September 23rd last year.

[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:40.860]
The court at Cateric Erison North Yorkshire heard that contingency plans were drawn up by Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Warren, staff officer at Land Command Salisbury Wiltshire, who was responsible for operational training.

[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:50.160]
Lieutenant Colonel Warren said US planners had passed on dates for which the invasion was planned. The hearing was told that Army chiefs wanted the training for the Army to start at the beginning of December 2002.

[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:54.300]
However, due to sensitivities, the training was delayed. Sensitivities in quotes.

[00:57:54.300 --> 00:58:02.840]
The court heard the training for the TA began two months late and for the regular Army one month late, Lieutenant Colonel Warren was asked what the sensitivities were.

[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:13.920]
Because in December there was a world interest if the UK had mobilized while all this was going on that would have shown an intent before the political process had been allowed to run its course, the hearing was adjourned.

[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:15.700]
How do you like that?

[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:32.040]
So it's right, it was Rumsfeld War was cooked up by Pienach and all these lunatics including your fat ass governor Jeb Bush by the way, who is a prominent member of the project for the New American Century, a bunch of Neocon lunatics and guess what it's blown up in their face and everyone around the round-tunnel that John Kerry is an armchair quarterback.

[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:39.620]
All these draft dodgers, all these chicken-offs, all these guys who never held it higher than their waste and a gun either.

[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:45.380]
How's that pull coming? I'm getting whipped up about this damn crap. We only got six days to go, you know what?

[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:51.660]
We can't afford another four more years of this crap and you think freedom of speech is limited now. You ain't heard nothing yet.

[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:59.380]
Which of these is most interesting to you we axe? 365 votes, tons of vanished weapons in Iraq, 146.

[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:07.840]
Bill Kamal busted and fired at 887, a strong second from Miss Kamal. Recuperating Clinton on the stump for Kerry 47, Red Sox may be World Champs.

[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:37.620]
Ever since this presidential race began, live up in wondered who was going to win.

[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:42.260]
It's a counterfall of ballots and find out who's gotten more.

[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:53.680]
Those old folks seem to have one thing in common. Looks like lots of them just keep their voice to Patrick Buchanan.

[00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:05.380]
Boy, so I'd like to know who won the election. Yes, I'd like to know who won the election.

[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:18.460]
Counter-vote, counter-vote, baby, counter-vote, counter-vote, over-counter-vote, counter-vote, baby, counter-vote, counter-vote, over-counter-vote.

[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:31.380]
The final tabulation started coming in. Then I saw a new splash on Channel 10. Some may read people all together in a bunch.

[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:42.540]
They said they were confused and didn't know which hold a punch. Those old folks seem to have one thing in common.

[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:42.520]
Counter-vote, over-counter-vote, counter-vote, baby, counter-vote, counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote, over-counter-vote

As the toll of Mayhem inspired by terrorist leader Abu Mubusha administration made a mistake once before the start of the war by stopping the military from attacking his camp in the Northeastern part of that country

[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:39.000]
The Pentagon drew up detailed plans in June of 2002 giving the administration a series of options for military strike on the camp-Mrs. Zarkawi was running then in remote-Northeastern Iraq, according to generals who were involved directly in planning the attack and several former White House staffers

[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:47.080]
They said the camp near the town of Kermal was known to contain Mr. Zarkawi and his supporters, as well as al-Qaeda fighters, all of whom had fled from Afghanistan

[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.340]
Intelligence indicated the camp was training recruits and making poisons for attacks against the West

[01:03:54.020 --> 01:04:08.080]
Senior Pentagon officials who were involved in planning the attack said that even by spring 2002, Mr. Zarkawi had been identified as a significant terrorist target based in part on intelligence that the camp he earlier ran in Afghanistan had been attempting to make chemical weapons

[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.840]
And because he was known as the head of a group that was plotting and training for attacks against the West

[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:17.960]
He already was identified as the ringleader in several failed terrorist plots against Israeli and European targets

[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:29.200]
In addition, by late 2002, while the White House was still deliberating over attacking the camp, Mr. Zarkawi was known to have been behind the October 2000 to assassination of a senior American diplomat in Amon Jordan

[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:39.340]
But the raid on Mr. Zarkawi didn't take place. Months passed with no approval of the plan from the White House until word came down just weeks before March 19, 2003, started the Iraq War

[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:48.440]
That Mr. Bush had rejected any strike on the camp until after an official outbreak of hostilities with Iraq, ultimately the camp was said just after the invasion of Iraq began

[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.980]
What have been bad timing, see, would look really bad?

[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:58.540]
Would have messed up all their plans. Like Tessio said, you know, Mrs. Up All My Plans can't do it, Pally.

[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:05.880]
So there you go, there's a little more insight as to why that guy still running around be care about is Miss Kamal and a 14-year-old boy.

[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:15.040]
Oh, he just wanted to be a father of forever father life, forever father. He wanted to father him and mother him and brother him and Nuzel. Who now knows what?

[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:21.080]
What do you mean the people that I talk to who are obviously a little more in touch with the whole South Florida deal?

[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:29.680]
Nobody that I know is in the least bit surprised about that whole story. Some of you are very naive because you see people on television and think, you know, I don't know what you think.

[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:35.920]
He's on television, he's the weather fairy. I've been telling you the weather fairy for a long time. This is the one place where you heard it right here on this show.

[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:45.700]
Well, just because he's gay doesn't make him a child molester, which of course that's all the more reason this is a grotesque story because it feeds that, you know, popular misconception.

[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:52.000]
Oh, all in faggot's there. Peter Files, maybe their child molesters. They all want to hop into sakwa and 14-year-old little boys.

[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.260]
Not all of them, just the show business ones.

[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.500]
I see. That's what the Josh Corteson.

[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:03.320]
56670560, pound 560 and they've arrived in singular wireless lines.

[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.560]
Yeah, maybe you can interpret from when he has that conversation with your little buddy there.

[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:08.780]
Hold on.

[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.520]
WQAM, hello.

[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.660]
This is no formal homie.

[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.620]
Yeah, okay, great. WQAM, hello.

[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:16.280]
Nearly, nearly, nearly.

[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:16.920]
Yes.

[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.240]
Hey, man, the lines are incredible.

[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:19.860]
Good.

[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:20.860]
Excellent.

[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.700]
And it's going to be a landslide, man.

[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.900]
I think they're really underestimating the black folks.

[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.600]
I think they're really underestimating the youth folk.

[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.060]
We're all going out there, man.

[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:30.820]
And we're real pumped up.

[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:32.760]
What are we going to do about the human soul, man?

[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.360]
And Dave County, what are we going to do with them?

[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:35.900]
Shoot them in the legs.

[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:39.680]
He's a pine reader.

[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:40.720]
He's a very psychic day.

[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.440]
Is it really everybody's in?

[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.360]
Hint them in the legs.

[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.160]
Oh, no.

[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.180]
Just above the ankle, okay?

[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.000]
We don't want to do any like serious permanent damage.

[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.660]
Although if it slows them down and they get mis-voting, that would be good.

[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:57.800]
Army unit not ordered to make Iraqi explosive surgeons, but all this song today is that they're

[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:02.100]
giving you about the timing of this story and about the weapons world, even really there,

[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.360]
and all this other crap.

[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:04.260]
Well, guess what?

[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:10.380]
The first US military unit to reach the Alc, oh, and I love the way people are pronouncing this.

[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.080]
Now, last night, last night, the guests on Lou Dobbs were saying,

[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.080]
Alc, Cacacac.

[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.540]
But Lou Dobbs was saying, Cacacac.

[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:24.240]
And that's what he was saying.

[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.760]
The first US military unit to reach the Alcacac military installation after the fall of Baghdad,

[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.280]
I don't know what you're laughing about.

[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.160]
It's a good enough for Lou Dobbs on CNN is making probably $80 million a year.

[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:35.820]
It's good enough for me.

[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:37.460]
He is so full of himself, man.

[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.080]
He's full of it and he's full of himself.

[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.080]
I ain't Lou Dobbs.

[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:40.980]
Why do I watch that?

[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:41.600]
I don't know.

[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:44.260]
Can I get through this story, please?

[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.360]
I got a break coming here.

[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.780]
Is it a long break or a week break?

[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.920]
A strong break or an African-奧 Franken's on now.

[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.880]
If you want to hear some really insightful, we didn't do the job.

[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:55.860]
And this is one of the jobs that needed to be done desperately.

[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.280]
It's kind of like guarding those nuclear weapons there in the former Soviet Union,

[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.160]
which I'm sure we're doing a fabulous job of that.

[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.440]
1213 at 560 WQA.

[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.580]
It's always a great time to call Dylemacris at 1-800-Macris.

[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.220]
And I wasn't even better to town than usual.

[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.460]
Dylemacris is slashing prices on certain matrices,

[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:18.540]
called 1-800-Macris right now and saving additional 20% off their super low-factory direct prices

[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:22.520]
on top quality, certain perfect sleepers only at Dylemacris.

[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:26.200]
When you call 1-800-Macris, you'll get same-day delivery all across South Florida.

[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.160]
You still get to pick the date and time for delivery and you two our window you like to fit your schedule.

[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:33.560]
And Dylemacris is proud of their on-time...

[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.700]
The U-Ga-

[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:40.980]
New on-Box.

[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.280]
From the director of Touched by an Angel.

[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.420]
So if you will just relax and push it.

[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:49.020]
Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in Touched by a Governor.

[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.360]
Governor? Is that your hand on my hand?

[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.480]
I'm a womanizer, I'm a terrible guy.

[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.940]
What is it with that boy?

[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.280]
Touched by a Governor.

[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.900]
I would go from house to house knocking indoors.

[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.000]
I'm the brokenator!

[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:02.820]
One Fox.

[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.800]
I apologize.

[01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:05.720]
Yeah, but...

[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.980]
1218 at 560 WQA.

[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:08.700]
Let's get in...

[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.560]
We got any appointments in the boat for this hour?

[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.380]
No, not for this hour, but it's the first make-up call this hour.

[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.200]
Pound 5, suit the enemy Verizon and Singular Ryder's Line.

[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.720]
And there's only one line...

[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.460]
Ring it anyway.

[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:19.200]
QA-M, hello.

[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:19.620]
Leo!

[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:20.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.860]
First time boater.

[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:23.420]
Boating for... carry.

[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.040]
I want to know about all these amendments.

[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:30.020]
How do I vote?

[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.240]
Or what's your opinion?

[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:31.780]
I know.

[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:33.480]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.740]
I just got to you, Tonya.

[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:36.800]
Listen very carefully, okay?

[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:37.040]
Tommy.

[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.080]
No, no, no.

[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.200]
No, no, no.

[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.940]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:44.060]
Yes, yes, yes.

[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:44.560]
Yes, yes.

[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.320]
Yes, yes.

[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:46.960]
Yes, yes.

[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.840]
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:48.540]
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:48.800]
You said again.

[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:49.980]
No, no, no.

[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.420]
Hey, hey, listen to me.

[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.660]
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:53.400]
See? Go ahead.

[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.240]
Listen to me.

[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:54.700]
I'm sorry.

[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.160]
10.40 o'clock last night watching the M&M video.

[01:09:59.060 --> 01:09:59.380]
Yeah.

[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.120]
On my satellite.

[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:00.860]
Right.

[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:01.880]
It goes blank.

[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.480]
13.4 satellite signal.

[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:04.760]
I can't believe it.

[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.520]
13.4, 13.2.

[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.300]
Yeah.

[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.060]
Everything is fine.

[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.120]
I live in Myanmar.

[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:10.220]
Oh, huh.

[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.620]
Take the weather last night.

[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.540]
The M&M police got you, baby.

[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:15.020]
Yes.

[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:15.640]
So.

[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.940]
So, no, no, no.

[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:18.800]
Yes, yes, yes.

[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.820]
Wait for the baby roof, please, catch your ass.

[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:21.900]
Okay, good nice job, pal.

[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.460]
I get out of here.

[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.700]
Let me say it again.

[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.280]
No, no, no.

[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.720]
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:28.860]
Yes.

[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:29.680]
There it is.

[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:30.300]
I got it.

[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:30.800]
Just relax.

[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:31.980]
I was counting.

[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:31.980]

[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.860]
A little bit, you know, I got to give you a little time there.

[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:35.640]
A little slone up.

[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.300]
Talk sometime.

[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.160]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:40.380]
Pond.

[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.520]
It's phenomenal turnout.

[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.980]
They also said they had a, who the hell was that guy from Vegas?

[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.900]
The Nevada turnout is spectacular too, because they had an advanced voting there also.

[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:50.500]
Everywhere they were, they were they had an early voting.

[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.540]
It's just people are turning out in droves.

[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:53.600]
And you want to know why?

[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.100]
Because people are pissed off and fired up, baby.

[01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.760]
People are whipped up into a frenzy.

[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.740]
The great, whatever the hell he was supposed to be, has split this country right down the

[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:08.820]
middle with all the dumb people on the one side and all the rest of us on the other side.

[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.600]
In fact, Molly Ivan says, what a great lead in.

[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:13.300]
Cool as people love bush.

[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:14.920]
You go, girl.

[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.000]
She says, oh, you sweet innocent carefree citizens in non-swing states.

[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.300]
You have no idea how much fun and slime you're missing.

[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.140]
This is a deadline, St. Louis.

[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:30.800]
In the swingers, wolves stalk us mercilessly as the pro wolf lobby points out indignantly.

[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:36.240]
No one has ever been killed by wolves on US soil, but try arguing that in the face of the relentless new TV ad campaign.

[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.160]
Breaking news everywhere.

[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.540]
380 tons of high explosives in Iraq left unattended.

[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.320]
Stock market down to years low, leading economic indicators down.

[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.460]
More tragedy in Iraq.

[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.900]
The swiftboat liars are back.

[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.300]
More Halliburton scandal.

[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:51.520]
George Tennant said the war in Iraq is wrong.

[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.440]
It feels like you're dodging meteorites here in the final days.

[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.740]
Actually, the best evidence suggests we need to slow way down and go way back.

[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:06.200]
Because far from being able to take in anything new, it turns out many of our felon affected in fact been abandoned shortly after the first Gulf War.

[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.560]
Bush and Cheney misled the country into war using these two false premises.

[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.680]
And it turns out an enormous number of our fellow citizens still believe both of them to be true.

[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:18.300]
It's not because they're stupid, but because an administration they trust is still telling them both.

[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.940]
Fony propositions are true.

[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.560]
I'm not so sure it's not because they're stupid.

[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:28.980]
Anyway, Molly Iven says normally when you get a situation like that where people are simply not acknowledging reality,

[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:35.220]
it's considered a cult, a form of group thing based on irrational beliefs propagated by what is normally a charismatic leader.

[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.180]
So those carry volunteers earnestly engaging voice supporters on latest outrage are way off base.

[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:43.600]
They need to go all the way back to the two great lies that got us into this.

[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:47.160]
Many American soldiers marching into Iraq believe it was payback for 9-11.

[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:54.080]
A third slightly blinding fact to me is that more people now than carry behaved shamefully in regard to Vietnam than did W.

[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:56.720]
Incredible what Brasian Lang will do, isn't it?

[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:03.920]
A friend of Bush's dad got him into the Champagne unit of the Texas National Guard, a unit packed with the sons of the privilege trying to stay out of Vietnam,

[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.020]
and he failed even to complete a service there.

[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:11.240]
Carry is a genuine bonafide war hero, the men who served on his boat are supporting him for president,

[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:16.940]
but those who didn't serve with him who weren't there who don't know what happened have been given more credence. Wolves will get you.

[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.560]
In further unhappy evidence of how ill-informed American people are, blame the media,

[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:28.300]
the program on international policy studies attitudes found Bush's supporters consistently ill-informed about Bush's stands on the issues.

[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.880]
Carry is by contrast are overwhelmingly right about his positions.

[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:38.840]
87% of Bush's supporters, Nikki Favour putting labor and environmental standards into international trade agreements,

[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:44.180]
80% of Bush supporters believe Bush wants to participate in the treaty banning landmines.

[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:49.520]
76% of Bush's supporters believe Bush wants to participate in the treaty banning nuclear weapons testing.

[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.060]
62% believe Bush would participate in the International Criminal Court.

[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:57.520]
61% believe Bush wants to participate in the Kyoto Treaty on Global Warming.

[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.240]
53% does not believe Bush is building a missile defense system, aka Star Wars.

[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:10.040]
The only two Bush stands the majority of his supporters got right were increasing the defense spending and who should write the new Iraqi constitution.

[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:18.500]
Carry supporters by contrast, know their man on seven out of eight issues with only 43% understanding he wants to keep defense spending the same,

[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.120]
but change how the money is spent and 57% believing he wants to up it.

[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.800]
So what's going on here? I don't think carry people are smarter than Bush people, so why are they better informed?

[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:35.600]
Maybe a small percentage of ideological right-wingers don't believe anything they establish from media say, but I don't think it's a matter of not believing what they hear it, but of not hearing what's factual.

[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.440]
The great triumph of the political right in this country has been the creation of a network of alternative media.

[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:45.120]
There are people who listen to Rush Limbaugh for more hours every day than the branch divisions listen to David Kuresh.

[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:50.480]
Watch Fox News, read The Washington Times, hey that's what the Bush administration does according to his own words.

[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.800]
But it's not just the right-wing media-prevying lies, they're quoting the administration.

[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:59.400]
These misunderstandings come directly from the Bush administration still over and over.

[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.880]
And they do, they lie like crazy and they're a lot of, I think she's wrong about the one thing, the stupid part.

[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:06.280]
Right, right.

[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:11.640]
A lot of stupid people out there, Molly, trust us. We talk to a lot of them every day. Believe me.

Call Jim Bob Newsom, the greatest comedy writer since Bill Kamin.

[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:10.500]
Politicians don't tell the truth and they lie.

[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:22.540]
Yeah, now as a grateful dead fan, I appreciate the enormous town of the New York City.

Anyway, David Sunrise says, is an almost lifelong fan of you in your program.

[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:03.840]
I ran across a how to use the valuable voting machines video that originally came from an any's got a website that's got .na, which means need a lot.

[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:04.780]

[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:05.780]
Oh, no.

[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:09.260]
Oh, gee, do you hear Neil Rogers talking about Catherine Harris playing Christy?

[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:09.960]
You ought to be fired.

[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.580]
Yeah, guess what website I'm going to ever look at anymore.

[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:13.940]
And nobody else with a brain up to either.

[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:14.560]
I don't know.

[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:18.520]
Richard Mellon's Skatefunded right wing piece of self-hating fat crap, the Fudge Report.

[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.460]
I never, I, I think it's off my thing.

[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:21.880]
It's off my thing.

[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.080]
I never had to.

[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.560]
I want to read right wing propaganda.

[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.340]
I can go to newsmax.com or something.

[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:26.460]

[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:28.740]
Get some real hallucinatory stuff for Fox News.com.

[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:36.620]
A silver Cadillac sped toward the group, but as Sarah Soda intersection last night, then swore that the last minute before driving off a corn to police.

[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.740]
Oh, my God.

[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:45.860]
Witnesses gave the car's license plate number to police and they tracked it to very em seltzer 46 and his brother Alka.

[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:51.460]
He came to the police station today and complained to officers that Harris supporters had impeded traffic.

[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:52.480]
You go, Barry.

[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:55.980]
I intimidated them with my car, seltzer told police.

[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:00.560]
In other words, he was just trying to move them pain in the ass people who were impeding his away, move them out of the way.

[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:00.880]
Okay.

[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:02.500]
What's wrong with that?

[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:06.200]
He was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:10.260]
A call for comment to Harris campaign secretary was not a meeting to return.

[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:22.860]
Harris, a Sarah Soda Republican and one of the prime fixtures of the 2000 election, a miserable nasty bitch is seeking a second congressional term after serving as Florida secretary of state during the protracted 2000 presidential fixed race.

[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:30.100]
And of course, Glenda in a hood is making like I said yesterday, Catherine seemed like a piker by comparison, like a small potatoes.

[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:32.260]
Now, that's right.

[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:34.420]
Nice job there. Glenda getting the Ralph Nader on about.

[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:38.900]
I'm sure that was very, very a nonpartisan and listed the way you know, make sure it's fair.

[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:43.420]
Speaking of Ralph Nader, Tim Robbins was on one of the talking hits last the yesterday sometime.

[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.120]
Do you see him?

[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:46.320]
No.

[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:52.980]
Now, unfortunately, like filled on a human, some other very naive people back in 2000, Tim Robbins was a great guy and is coming from all the right places.

[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:57.800]
He endorsed Ralph Nader, supported Ralph Nader and voted for Ralph Nader.

[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:03.340]
This time he's spending all of his waking moments running around the country, speaking to other Nader people telling them, don't do it again.

[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.560]
Don't do it again. Don't screw us again.

[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.520]
Like that song says that the Beast Boisting. Screw us again.

[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:16.040]
So that's what he's doing. That's his act. Join George and Bokeh Brian today for happy hour, five to seven at Treasure Island and MacGill.

[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:23.720]
And MacGill, whose wife likes him out once a week to go to the end of the year. If she only knew what was going on, she might not let him out.

[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:30.040]
Anyway, Treasure Island located off the Palmetto just north of the 120 second street exit. Stop by to win prizes.

[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:36.120]
Check out this week's feature Stephanie Evans who's going to be blowing bowling balls out of her orifice.

[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.680]
Is now would you keep your bowling balls in your orifice?

[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:40.780]
I keep it.

[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:45.960]
Right. Your golf clubs, your bowling balls, your ping pong balls, your badminton, uh, shuttlecocks, all of these things.

[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:50.800]
Documents raised new questions about Bush's guard service. I better not read that.

[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.620]
I will read it. I want to get a bunch of calls in here. Is it fully vetted?

[01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:02.100]
Also, I like this. This is from the Guardian. I wish we had the Guardian in the US instead of just in the UK.

[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:09.020]
And like somebody said, the internet's the internet is where it be. You know, the same guy that said, Abu Garib.

[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.000]
He's the guy that told you you'll find a real crap on the internet.

[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:19.080]
Let's see Steve says you got to check out this website. It's a hilarious game trying to give Bush a brain.

[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.760]
M gag.com. You're going to take a look at this also.

[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:32.220]
Yeah. Why do you got a whole bunch of homework assignments there while I'm doing these boring bedtime stories and taking a few very, very important calls to a course that's our bread and butter WQA M Hello.

[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:37.900]
I don't know why you're coming down on bill wall. You're not doing anything. Yeah. Reverend Jones WQM Hello.

[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:44.380]
Hey, Uncle Neil. How are you doing? Pretty good, pal. I just turned the radio. Sorry. I had to call you for two. This is Virginia key, by the way.

[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:51.760]
Oh, Virginia key. Hello. I actually converted a Cuban and got him to vote for carry one. Oh, my God. That is astonishing.

[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:59.080]
The classic thing was actually being in the room actually completely across the room when I heard him talking to his mother on the phone. Yeah.

[01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:09.700]
And how much Cuban party? He did 40, 44, 45. Right. And I could hear his mother screaming on the phone. Good.

[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:16.900]
From the other side of the room. She has a heart attack and then she can't vote on that. I know I'm familiar with public enemy number one. Excellent.

[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:24.980]
And to that idiot that called you at the end of yesterday's show, which one? The one that the idiot that was saying how come, you know, your liberal and how come gaze or liberal?

[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:34.200]
Listen to me. Hey, buddy. Why don't you go have a meeting at your house and log camera public and then give us a call? Okay. Yeah. Right. And by the way, log cabin Republicans are not endorsing Bush this year.

[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:40.000]
Even those right wing self-hating faggets aren't doing a. How do you like that? You know, he should have them over for wonderful little love.

[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:45.940]
He then over his knee is what he on. Something like that. Maybe over his rectum. Okay. Thanks, pal. I haven't read a good job. Nice going.

[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:52.020]
There's one of our people did it. We're building votes for Carrie one at a time. Just like we're building the audience here at Q.A.M.

[01:22:52.120 --> 01:23:01.700]
One shmuck in a sandwich board out there in Lincoln Road Mall, where nobody speaks English anyway. I heard a rumor that I think you started it. Yeah.

[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:12.040]
That all the traditional soft beach crowd that they're like all fleeing out of there since the hip hop crowd came moving in. Did I start that rumor? I don't know anything about that. I don't know who started that.

[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:24.000]
I've been hearing that from a lot of people that like even right in the middle of it down a sunny day like a noon. It's getting really dark on South Beach. That's what I'm hearing. That was that true. I don't know.

[01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:34.940]
What do you mean you don't know? You don't know? You don't know? I remember I told you that was their whole pram of promise. The idea that oh, South Beach. That's where it's at. All South Florida.

[01:23:34.940 --> 01:24:04.920]
Where am I? Got it. South. It's here. We're still in the him in Burston. He really did. But it goes to show you what a putts very diller is. Well, if all the people in the world with big money, he is one of the worst. He is one of the most idiotic shmucks. Very diller. I'd rather a work for Phyllis Diller. Don't be confused by the tide of contradictory voter surveys. Bush is in trouble. Right. Mark Moulittas. What is it? Moulinsus. Mark Moulinsus was having blitzes for lunch right now in England somewhere in the Guardian. You can see that. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I

[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.160]
believe they are looking. Is he looking. Is he looking at me now? Why is he looking at me快? I'm pretty that's what you guys said. I don't. Okay. I'm going to read this because this is pretty interesting.

[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:24.320]
Because a lot of people out there, they're getting so buffalored by these poles. Even if they lived like an oldyanna, they're getting buffaled by the poles. And especially CNN which shows those gallon poles over and over again even a Massachusetts. They wouldn't be surprised before Tuesday that CNN shows all the Bushes just moved ahead. Massachusetts.

[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.320]

[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:13.960]
About 45 at 560.

[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:14.860]
What was that F-A-G?

[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:15.180]
Something?

[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:16.580]
That's what I heard.

[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:22.000]
Now before that other story about the Don't Get All Panicky about these polls, embedded reporters

[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.840]
saw no explosive search.

[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.760]
That was more of a pit stop there for us.

[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:31.200]
And you know, the searching, I mean, certainly some of the soldiers head off there on and their

[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.180]
own look through the bunkers, just look at the vast amount of ordinance lying around.

[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:39.140]
But as far as we could tell, she said there was no move to secure the weapons, nothing

[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:40.440]
to keep looters away.

[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:45.520]
She told MSNBC that there was no talk among 101st of securing the area after they left

[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:45.780]
either.

[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:48.760]
She said the roads were cut off, so it would have been very difficult, they believed,

[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.800]
for the looters to get there.

[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:55.160]
So there's the latest in greatest is that story keeps expanding and embellishing and

[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.700]
just getting bigger and bigger like a gigantic mushroom.

[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.280]
There's nothing like a gigantic mushroom, you know?

[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.500]
Unless, of course, it turns out to be a toad stool.

[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:08.560]
Pigeon, which of these is most interesting to you?

[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:09.520]
That's our poll question.

[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.020]
Today we got 603 votes.

[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:14.480]
Pons of vanished weapons in Iraq, 231.

[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.480]
Before we do the poll result, I wanted to do it again.

[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.740]
It'll be ponderous to some of the people, but it's very necessary that we do this.

[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:26.440]
Because I think I've finally stumbled in the answer to our starting at different times

[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:27.160]
every day problem.

[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.940]
And that is that those people who have been kind of like put off by that and wondering what

[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:33.540]
that was going on.

[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:35.540]
You can tune in to 11 o'clock every morning.

[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.760]
We would like you to tune in like at 6 o'clock when Howard starts.

[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:40.860]
But I mean, if you're one of those people that isn't a Stern listener or you're here or

[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:43.740]
there, whatever, you can tune in at 11 and you won't miss so much.

[01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:48.020]
You'll miss some phone calls, but we're just going to take calls between whatever Howard ends.

[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:52.880]
Not the last two days, yesterday and Monday, it worked out perfect because they went on

[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.660]
right to 11 o'clock.

[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.180]
Which would be nice if they would do that every day.

[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.020]
Although it's even nicer now that we can make appointments with collars for them to call

[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:02.500]
between like say 10, 30 or 10, 35 and 11 o'clock, right?

[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:03.520]
Right.

[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:06.560]
Yeah, you can make an appointment and we'll give you your own line and you can call in.

[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:08.440]
We'll give you like five, 10 seconds to wait hang up on you.

[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.220]
So that's the deal.

[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.280]
So from 11 to two, basically, is the meat.

[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.000]
That's the meat of the matter.

[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:18.620]
That's the heart, the guts, the bladder, the liver, the pancreas of the show.

[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:22.060]
And the rest before that is like whatever, case the Rossirah.

[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:26.040]
And once in a while, if we don't get any phone calls, we'll drop in something really cute like

[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.240]
Wapu, Wapu, Wapu, Wapu, Wapu, Wapu.

[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:34.040]
And if we really want to be like that, cutting edge, like Al Franken.

[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.520]
Anyway, which of these is most interesting to you?

[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.680]
Tons of vanished weapons interact 234.

[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:43.700]
Bill Kamal busted and fired 138.

[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.720]
Recuperating Clinton on stump for carry 79.

[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:50.220]
Red Sox may be world champs, 73.

[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:53.400]
Humiliating Ashley Simpson lipstick on SNL.

[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.200]
That's got 30 men.

[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.360]
Dolphins finally win 126.

[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.580]
Don't hold your breath for a repeat on Monday night.

[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:04.960]
The NHL lockout 16, that just, that just blows me away.

[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:05.420]
You know what?

[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:08.460]
That many people who claim to be concerned about the hockey.

[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:13.300]
The strange part, the year before 60 scene times.

[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.140]
Shortage of flu vaccine nine and the patriots win their 21st in a row three.

[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.540]
See one thing about up here, A, we got hockey.

[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:22.100]
Go ahead until it's coming out of your eye.

[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.460]
When he does, he's, he, uh, coming back to Bo Ganey who, uh, you know,

[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:26.960]
See what I'm saying?

[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:30.640]
We got hockey stuff going in 26 hours a day.

[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.320]
Look at that.

[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.320]
It's certainly won by people this election.

[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:34.840]
Get out of there.

[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.420]
Well, there's the governor of Rockets.

[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:40.220]
I was trying to deny because they just showed the new pool, the state pool 48, 48.

[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:46.100]
And bum is going to be there on Sunday or Monday in Arkansas, put the carry over the top and get all that dark,

[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.320]
complex, and people out of there too.

[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.660]
We did do the break didn't we?

[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:49.300]
I tell you we did.

[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.520]
I just forgot to cross it off because I'm getting so far ahead of myself now that we officially have basically with the three hour show.

[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:57.100]
Right, right.

[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:57.860]
That's fine.

[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.580]
It's always 1105 to me, so I don't even know what it is.

[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:01.580]
Well, that's right.

[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:04.020]
Now in other words, they still haven't got the new clock in their clearance.

[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:04.980]
Can't even take care of that.

[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:08.100]
It can't get my paychecks on time anymore, which I'm sick and tired of his crap.

[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.620]
And we can't get a new clock in there for you.

[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:12.160]
I'm a little travel.

[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:16.640]
That's a tremendous expense there for Beasley broadcasting, which is listed on the NASDAQ,

[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:21.100]
which is supposedly a real responsible broadcasting company, a real honest to God,

[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:24.700]
not just some mom and pop bunch of rednecks, and they can't even get a freaking clock in there.

[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:25.400]
Look at that.

[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:27.860]
That crude oil is down to 5360 in that of bargain.

[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:29.660]
And the markets are up there again.

[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:32.140]
52 up on the Dow, 20 in up on the NASDAQ.

[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.020]
I wouldn't be surprised if they'd goose it up over 10,000 again if they get their way,

[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:41.500]
even though that consumer confidence yesterday was not good, bad, bad, bad, bad.

[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:44.700]
Now what the hell is this?

[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:49.060]
Frank in Melbourne says, what happened to Frank that was doing our electoral votes by the way?

[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:49.600]
What happened to him?

[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:50.020]
Remember him?

[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:50.600]
Mm-hmm.

[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.280]
I guarantee he's probably like a scared to do it now because...

[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.060]
That's the thing in the other day.

[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:55.780]
I'd fix it to you.

[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:56.940]
At least I'd do it.

[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:57.840]
That was days ago.

[01:29:58.180 --> 01:29:58.420]
Okay.

[01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:58.940]
Days ago.

[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.980]
You're like stuck in the past, man.

[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:02.780]
You better get with it.

[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.060]
You didn't even know about Boeing for soup.

[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:05.780]
Who?

[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:10.580]
Frank in Melbourne says, on Amendment 3, I'd like to point out what I think is the worst part of it.

[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.860]
Well, I don't want to go through all of this.

[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.480]
I mean, Frank in Melbourne, I don't want to like, denigrate your facts.

[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.280]
At the time, you took to write all of this, Kakarai, but I mean,

[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.800]
the public needs to remember a flag waving corp, blah, blah, blah.

[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:21.780]
Okay, just vote.

[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.280]
No.

[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:22.380]
No.

[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:23.700]
On Amendment 3, okay?

[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:25.420]
Where are these re-on now?

[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.720]
We don't need to like make the case.

[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.740]
The, yeah, on the eight amendments, here's the answer to you.

[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:32.180]
If you two lazy to look at our website, we've got them all listed.

[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.020]
There we have a link so you can read it in the detail and make up your own mind.

[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.300]
If you really are capable of doing that.

[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.080]
Or if you just want to go with us, just go...

[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:38.200]
No.

[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:38.700]
No.

[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:39.840]
Yes.

[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:40.920]
Yes.

[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:41.480]
Yes.

[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:42.860]
Yes.

[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:43.860]
Got it?

[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:45.180]
Got it.

[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:45.840]
Okay.

[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.660]
Now, what was I just doing here?

[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.300]
Oh, don't be confused by the tide of concrete through revoters surveys.

[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:52.480]
Bushes in trouble.

[01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:57.220]
This is by Mark Molitzis in the Guardian UK, which is a great publication.

[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.660]
Everybody ought to be forced to read the Guardian UK.

[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:00.800]
That left wing rag.

[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:01.400]
We love it.

[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:03.460]
With the weekend...

[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:06.620]
And you notice if there's like anything that's to the left of a till of a hunt.

[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.480]
Like occasionally CBS kinds to like, like, leans over there because they hate bush like poison.

[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:14.460]
And he's like, oh, that's biased and it's that liberal media.

[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:17.200]
But it's okay to have Fox on there 24-7.

[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:23.820]
It's okay that CNN and MSNBC are both attempting to be Fox light now, assuming that they're going to draw those viewers in, which they never will.

[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.580]
Hey, Fox is fair and balanced.

[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:26.980]
Yeah, right.

[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:27.580]
That's right.

[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:28.240]

[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:28.240]

[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:28.240]

[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:28.300]
That's right.

[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:28.380]

[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:28.380]

[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:29.020]
That's right.

[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:29.200]
That's right.

[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:29.820]
That's right.

[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:31.500]
That's right.

[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:32.100]
That's right.

[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:32.340]
That's right.

[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:33.200]
That's right.

[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:36.180]
That's right.

[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:38.200]
That's right.

[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.220]
That's right.

[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.400]
That's right.

[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:46.840]
That's right.

[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:51.760]
The fact is polls have a great deal to tell us about the state of the race and out of the way the people generally assume.

[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.260]
Now, I want you to listen to this.

[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:53.540]
Okay.

[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.240]
Can you handle it?

[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:54.640]
All right.

[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:59.360]
He says polls are always reported as though there's a winner and there's a loser.

[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:06.660]
So a poll showing bush leading 45 to 42 is headline bush leads by three when the reality is that bush is actually losing.

[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:13.140]
In US elections, any elected official gardening less than 50% of vote and polls is considered vulnerable.

[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:19.480]
As democratic pollster mark Blumenthal notes, voters typically know incumbents will have strong opinions about their performance.

[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:27.100]
Challengers are less familiar and invariably fall short on straightforward comparison of experience in the presidential arena commande foreign policy.

[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:37.860]
Some voters find themselves conflicted, dissatisfied with the incumbent, yet also wary of the challenger, and many carry that uncertainty to the final days of the campaign and sometimes right into the voting booth.

[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:46.300]
Among the perpetually conflicted, the attitudes about the incumbent are usually more predictive of these conflicted voters' final decision than their lingering doubts about the challenger.

[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:51.100]
Thus, in the campaign's last hours, we tend to see undecided voters break for the challenger.

[01:32:52.280 --> 01:33:02.640]
Testing this theory, blogger Chris Bowers examined presidential poll results since 1976 and calculated that undecided voters broke for the challenger 86% of the time.

[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.900]
It's a dynamic that clearly weighs heavily on the Bush campaign.

[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:14.660]
Speaking to conservative bloggers at the Republican National Convention, Bush's poster Matthew Dowd said the 56% rule didn't apply to the president.

[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:22.400]
Based on the polling data they've aggregated on undecided and battleground states, the Bush team is compiled the following profile on undecideds.

[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:31.360]
They're overwhelmingly white, tend to be older, go to church often and describe themselves as moderate to conservative, that says they can't find any self-described liberals remain undecided.

[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:37.320]
As a result, he's been guessing, some get it right, some get it wrong, and have the time the luck is probably involved.

[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:43.320]
That's why it's best to look at polls in the aggregate, easy to do given the sheer number of them are either obsessed over any special one.

[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:52.260]
With that brief polling primer, anyone can take a look at the numbers and get a sense for these states of the race, and a strict by the numbers calculation shows that Bush is in serious trouble.

[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:58.740]
In Ohio, Bush numbers range from 43 to 49%, failing to break 50% in any of the 12 Ohio polls.

[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:09.700]
Indeed, in October, there are signs that Bush has essentially abandoned the state, working to build a selectile majority by winning three out of four in Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, and New Mexico, but October polling in those states also shows an incompetence serious trouble.

[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:16.540]
In 14 Florida polls, Bush hasn't broken 50% since the survey USA poll conducted between October 1st and 3rd.

[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:20.520]
A subsequent survey USA poll now gives carry 50 to 49 lead in the state.

[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:25.380]
In Iowa, a single poll has them at 51%, while six others range between 46 and 49.

[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:30.820]
Wisconsin is giving Democrats heartburn, but Bush breaks 50% only one of the nine polls this month.

[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:33.940]
Two independent polls put him as far back as 43%.

[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:40.320]
New Mexico has bushed a 43 to 49% range, anemic numbers in the state that grow one by less than 1,000 votes last time.

[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:45.480]
Much can happen in one week, and Republicans are doing their part to prevent a fear of election.

[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:53.120]
Perhaps the Bush Campbells reflect any of the stuff from the last 24 to 36 hours, about the missing explosives in Iraq.

[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:57.980]
And those explosives are going to blow up all right right in their puts. You'll see.

[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:02.780]
1257 at 560 WQM, speaking of puts, if you look at the mirror, you're ugly.

[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:06.360]
You'll see that big glaring bald spot. It doesn't make you look at a younger any better.

[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:08.760]
It makes you look nasty and old is what it does.

[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:13.100]
Well, Charles Afiric can help you make you look great because he's been helping the famous and not so famous.

[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:15.300]
Look, they're best for about 30 years now.

[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:16.360]
About 30, man.

[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:20.540]
That is correct. You wouldn't even recognize Charlie's work when you see it because it doesn't look like a piece.

[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:27.100]
The most critical area of any here system is that hairline and Charlie's new skin like hair system is 100%.

[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:30.440]
Undetectable. That's right. The hair looks like it's grown right out of your scalp.

[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:32.320]
And Charlie's work is completely guaranteed.

[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:37.820]
You have nothing to lose but that ugly glaring bald spot because you tried Charlie's system for a month about 30, man.

[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:40.880]
30 days and after a month of you don't let the weight look in the fields and smells.

[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:45.560]
If you're not getting laid like at least 20, 30, 40 times a day, just say, hey, I want my money back.

[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:46.820]

I'm going to buy some things. Here's your QAM.

[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:27.520]
Here's the facts from a Ken who says, speaking of Catherine's stupid bitch, Harris. He's got a website.

[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:37.260]
A link. Links to a story about a C-SPAN camera picking up her and fellow Weasel Republican representative Rick Renzi can noodleing in the background.

[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:45.380]
While Republican Rob Simmons delivers a speech on the floor. The video goes on for a few minutes while these two married fools. Renzi has 12 kids.

[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.100]
Court each other in a background. Too bad though. The video stops right as it looks. She's ready to.

[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:55.880]
On him. I don't want to read that. Rob a double. Rob a double on him.

[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:59.780]
Well, did you take a look at that? How about these other things you've been looking at?

[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:04.760]
No, the Bush brain thing is up and it works just fine. And you should play test your skill.

[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:07.820]
And the other thing is going up as we speak. And I'm checking this one out right now.

[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:13.260]
This is dailycoss.com which is a great website. We love that one. We love dailycoss.com. Do we not? Yes.

[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:21.700]
Yes. Here's he. I know. No, no, sir. Then I asked for Fred. And here's his facts. Boy, you people sometimes when you least expect a way to man, you're right on top of it.

[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.620]
Suffolk claimed exclusive near Roger show poster Fred with one week to go says.

[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:33.060]
Yes, carry winning 289 to 249. Now let me just take a puke because I know a lot of people out there are very lazy.

[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:36.920]
All of some people aren't sitting at a computer right now. Some people don't have access to a computer.

[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:42.200]
And some poor sluppers out there don't even own a PC, which is very, very unacceptable at this point.

[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.460]
We think it's unacceptable.

[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.180]
Bush says Iraq is a dangerous place.

[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:54.860]
Oh, man. Maybe that's why we had all those people by when he told Pat Robertson there was going to be no casualties.

[01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:00.820]
Maybe he didn't realize it was a dangerous place. You think? It's possible. That might have been it.

[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:05.020]
What is the bush? Get the biggest way. At least the brain. How important prescription drug coverage?

[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:09.820]
The prescription drugs are being invented in general parts of the Medicare plan.

[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:17.000]
Oh, that is beautiful. Now, how do you now? Let's see. Oh, I see you have to click it to like try to drop the brain right right.

[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.220]
Oh, that'll keep you busy. It'll keep you off the streets for hours today, man. Give that to our sales department.

[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:29.940]
And don't forget about management such as it is. Okay. Now what I was going to do now. I got to stop that. Jesus.

[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:36.160]
Oh, game over. I lost. I couldn't get a brain in his head. Then we got M&M's Mosh video, which is great.

[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:42.000]
And then I'm looking, looking, looking. Here, where is our thing? There's no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:50.080]
Here's the electoral vote, predator. I know what it was. And I'm just trying to compare which it wasn't really good news for the Kerry people this morning.

[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:56.780]
That it's not the administration's fault. Any even criticized those who raised the subject.

[01:38:57.260 --> 01:39:10.400]
Anyway, it shows Bush 274 and the Kerry 257. But also this one gives Bush Ohio, which he's acquired their latest poll 2 points and Florida, which it shows him 4 points ahead, which both are certainly up for grabs.

[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:16.460]
It also shows Arkansas here for Bush 6 points. And but the latest poll beyond this shows it 48, 48, that even.

[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:24.580]
And this one also still shows the Bush point ahead in the why there is no way there's the China man's chance in Honolulu that he's going to win Hawaii.

[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:32.180]
Okay. They've only had two polls off here since the polling started. It's going to happen, baby. So it's a dead tide. Anyway, here's what Fred says. Did you get that?

[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:46.380]
He says he has Kerry winning 289 to 249 electoral votes with a week to go. Many states have moved to noncompetitive now like Louisiana, Arizona, Missouri, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington. Perhaps they were not competitive from the start.

[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:54.580]
Anyway, they're no longer in play. He says I still refuse to concede New Mexico. North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia in the bush. But it looks like he'll take those four.

[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:01.100]
Finally, the battlegrounder toss up states any of these could go either way of sent perhaps Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, which looks solid for Kerry.

[01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:06.420]
Rock solid as is Nevada for Bush. I'm not so sure about that from what we're hearing from Nevada today, but nevertheless.

[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:18.900]
It says the other six are truly too close to call, even including Arkansas, where bubble will be in a few days. He also says what the hell is up with Iowa and Wisconsin. Both Gore states last time that carries having a hard time closing too many white folks there.

[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:29.500]
I believe he says, although if you look at Iowa and Wisconsin, I like Wisconsin, Minnesota on the electoral map, the tracking map we've got on our website today finally Kerry ages back ahead in both Wisconsin and Minnesota.

[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:43.960]
And they've got Iowa even Stephen dead even flat foot. He also says Fred C does I have Kerry winning all three big states, not just swishful thinking unless jab in the hood, get in there, mess around again and looking like Kerry should win the three big inch of letters. Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.

[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:57.000]
Well, we'll see six days to go man. The pressure is so great. You can almost smell it. Let's get in a few thousand calls. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on these Verizon and singular wireless lines WQ AM. Hello.

[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:11.340]
Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi. Just one, let you know there is. I know she saw this website real clear politics.com. Nope. It's really an excellent one and breaks it down by state.

[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:25.560]
State by state. You can see all the polls of the past and the new polls really real clear politics.com right. And you go to the undecided state and then breaks it right down there. Very good.

[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:38.600]
Well, what are they showing now? They got a total. Yeah, they have a total and have all the different polls. You know, all the different ones from who does what poll and you kind of get a trend and see who's favorite in Bush and which ones favoring Kerry.

[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:50.140]
Right. It's kind of interesting. Yeah, one day asked guys think about ways they go and try to steal it. I was thinking there are way they can feel through the electoral college at the election done.

[01:41:51.140 --> 01:42:03.200]
Well, yeah, because there's one electorate in West Virginia who says he won't vote for Bush no matter what he's he's going to vote for Kerry. And then a Colorado that thing is on a ballot, which for the life of me, I don't see how they can pass that and then enforce it in this election.

[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:13.920]
But I think we're going to try to where they proportionally give out the electoral votes like they do in Maine. And if that happens, that could be pretty into that. If it's really as tight as people think that could change the election.

[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:20.280]
Yeah, and all get less election was going to try to do that when everything was up in the air down here.

[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:32.220]
Whether or not he's they would try and get their own electoral electorate and up there no matter what happened. Well, no matter what happened, Bush was going to win. Now his brother was going to win last time. He called him on a phone until don't worry the fixes in.

[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:40.380]
Yeah, I know. So no matter what it took, whether they had to bribe the clearance Thomas or given some good weed or whatever the hell took that was and they did it.

[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:50.480]
Yeah, I like Pally early and often thanks for the website. Real. Was it real clear politics dot com? You check that out? No. Well, I will during the break. Well, that's not pure alley.

[01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:57.500]
And I don't know if it is. There's not any cartoons. What I'm downloading that canoodle video of the canoodle one. Well, let's let's get all of this stuff on air.

[01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:07.980]
Or can keep people really busy. It's after all Wednesday already. We just got a few days left. I've been saying six days. It's is it five six three two one.

[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:20.400]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. WQAM. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Is this George? Yeah. Hey, George, I have a quick question this and I'm getting ready to vote. Right.

[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:32.100]
And I was told that if I don't vote on each candidate be it, you know, a senator or whatever the kiss, maybe my, my ballot would be. That is absolutely a lie. That is untrue.

[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:45.080]
Okay. You could go there and just vote for president. If you want. It's not a good idea. But I mean, you could just vote for anyone. If you want an only vote for the Senate, you have to vote near V race. That's idiotic. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Do a good job, Pally. Bye. Bye.

[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:56.220]
See, there you go. People. People that don't know anything about voting make up all of this crap in this poor guy or you got to vote near V. You don't have to do that. There are many people that just vote for president, which we certainly want to vote for.

[01:43:56.300 --> 01:44:14.180]
But it cast a role for Senate, right? Because we got to hang out of that Bobby Graham seat. Keep in mind that's not a seat that the Democrats can gain in Florida. That's when they try to hang on to. And that Uncle suddenly knew found right wing fanatic Mel Martinez. Who now needs his crap? Okay. So all you people are going to vote for care or whatever you're going to vote.

[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:28.000]
I mean, we got to get Betty Kaster in there and also those amendments, especially number four. Because I'm a degenerate. I want slot machines in there at the race tracks, especially at the Pompano Park, but at all of them and all that money for education, which has to be new funds for education.

[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:44.160]
By the way, tonight the 649 lottery here is 22 million George. So have a good time. All right. What are you laughing about? I came with it. Oh, I still can't get over that. The timing would have been so perfect. But my luck, you know, that would have been so great to have that number 13 instead of four.

[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:56.000]
That's what Bill Kamal said too. Just didn't work out Simon says I walked out a Broward County Court house with the powers to be looking for 58,000 absentee ballots.

[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:07.960]
Oh, God. Hey, we got it under control, baby. What's a few hundred thousand missing ballots here in air among friends, right? Right.

[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:18.560]
It's going to be you think the last time was really wow, because that was basically down the floor then and by that time everybody else had fixed the fix was already in.

[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:28.240]
But now you got a high and you got Florida and you got Minnesota and you got Wisconsin and even got maybe Hawaii by the time those votes come in five, six days after.

[01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:39.000]

5657.

[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:16.080]
Star one, ever, we feel like it.

[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:20.180]
1045, 1042, 30, 1057.

[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:21.420]
But again, we really start.

[02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:23.440]
I was telling her the MS, we started 11 o'clock, too.

[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:26.920]
And whatever happens before that is like we think of a bunch of great calls.

[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:28.460]
So get your appointments in now.

[02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:30.760]
We can schedule up until the year 2525.

[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:32.680]
The waiting room is filling up.

[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:33.560]
That is correct.

[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:34.300]
We're getting that book.

[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:35.980]
Is for going to have to get like a new appointment book.

[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:37.300]
Whatever happened to that thing.

[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:38.260]
Did you ever send that to me?

[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:38.820]
No.

[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:39.200]
That thing.

[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:41.220]
I give it to Brian DeSendier, so you ought to be getting it shortly.

[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:44.100]
When was that last week?

[02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:46.200]
I'm talking about that planner.

[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:47.640]
Yeah, yeah, I give it to him last week.

[02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:49.080]
Well, he sure as hell didn't.

[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:52.160]
He's busy sending me invoices for FedEx and stuff like that.

[02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:54.200]
But he isn't sending me stuff that's useful, you know.

[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.320]
That doesn't cost me any money.

[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:57.440]
Come on, Baldi, let's get with it.

[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:02.440]
And by the way, let me see if I can find this real fast, okay?

[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:03.020]
Okay.

[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:05.360]
Well, no, I can't.

[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:06.240]
I didn't know I said that.

[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:08.840]
How it broke those ideas and I canceled in and this.

[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:13.080]
Why, do I not have to be a little upset with you?

[02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:15.300]
He'd like to get his looks in first.

[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:17.780]
What a thought, you know.

[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:18.540]
Oh, God.

[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:19.860]
What is this story?

[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:21.320]
Why do whites mustache, you know?

[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:22.840]
What do you mean?

[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.280]
Well, why the hell did he ever shave it off?

[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:26.880]
It makes him look about 40 years older.

[02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:28.320]
And then you got tired of the way it's spelled.

[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:30.160]
Is that what it was? It's stuck?

[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:31.560]
Well, I never thought about that.

[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:32.420]
People with mustaches.

[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:34.340]
Speaking of that, guess who called me yesterday?

[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:36.320]
Your best close personal friend from Columbus, Ohio.

[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:36.940]
River.

[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:38.320]
And we were the rim man.

[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:40.760]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:42.900]
And he's going to be coming to South Florida.

[02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:44.820]
Play golf pretty soon because he got nothing else to do.

[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:49.120]
And he won't be going to a pizza lot to have free meals with ponytail

[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:50.540]
because Doug McLean's going with him.

[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:53.100]
So it'll probably be going to Ruth Chris all the time since Doug will be buying.

[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:56.460]
See if he was coming down just with like family and stuff.

[02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:58.520]
He'll be going to pizza lot every day for free meals.

[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.060]
The Ducatesee's video machine video is up.

[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:03.540]
All right, we got more crap on our website today.

[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:05.580]
If you don't hop on theoriders.com today, man,

[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:06.880]
your life ain't worth Schmidt, all right?

[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:08.820]
You're missing some heavy duty crap.

[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:12.220]
20-2, the mad dog coming along at 2 o'clock.

[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:15.800]
He's already got it engineered as my how that offense might just win another game this season.

[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:16.960]
But don't hold your breath.

[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:18.520]
Right now, let me tell you about our final.

[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:22.000]
We were able to qualify him, but they were able to present him three different options

[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.980]
as to the type of mortgage he could get.

[02:02:24.180 --> 02:02:26.020]
And they worked closely with him to determine which was best.

[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:27.660]
And then they made it happen.

[02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:30.200]
That's guaranteed mortgage bankers and deer field beach.

[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:34.060]
You can call them toll free 1-800-734-6616

[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:37.680]
with you looking for an interest only loan, a 30-year fixed rate.

[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:38.680]
About 30, man.

[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:40.560]
For one of the many low rate adjustable mortgages,

[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:43.740]
guaranteed mortgage bankers and deer field beach has exactly what you need.

[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:45.940]
They offer payments as low as $332.

[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:49.600]
Spread them and say cheese.

[02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:50.600]
Here's a little number.

[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:53.020]
I wrote the other day while I'm duck hunting with a judge.

[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:53.460]
What?

[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:00.080]
Thank you very much, the FCC.

[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:04.520]
Thank you very much for finding me.

[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:05.000]
Here.

[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:07.020]
5,000 bucks a few.

[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:08.780]
So I'm really out of luck.

[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:11.920]
That's more than how your deflice was judging me.

[02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:15.700]
So you very much the FCC.

[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:19.700]
For proving that free speech just isn't free.

[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.780]
Clear channels, a deer channel.

[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:24.640]
So how its turn must go.

[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:28.320]
A turn, a general, Ashcroft doesn't like strong words and so.

[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:32.140]
He's charging twice as much as all the drugs per Russian mo.

[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:35.300]
So how do you want so very much?

[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:42.960]
So how do you very much the Mr. Bush for your rowy curly sitting on your tush?

[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:47.880]
For Halliburton, Enron, all the companies who hail.

[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:51.680]
Let's send them a clear signal and stick marker straight in jail.

[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:55.160]
She's an upper deer rich rich and at least he isn't.

[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:55.620]
So how do you make a deal?

[02:03:56.100 --> 02:03:58.360]
So how do you want so very much?

[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:02.640]
So you get the chance to do.

[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:06.240]
You and everything you do.

[02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:09.280]
Your pace may come as real fate.

[02:04:09.660 --> 02:04:10.780]
You haven't got a lot.

[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:15.000]
As far as I'm concerned you're just a pasty face so fast.

[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:18.820]
And as per Condoleez, she's an intellectual judge.

[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:21.620]
So how do you want so very much?

[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:29.420]
So how do you very much the EPA for giving all the laskers oil away?

[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:34.200]
It really is a bummer when I come to my hunger.

[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:37.960]
The Osos and Ogozo now that Arnold's here to say.

[02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:41.560]
The nuclear intercails are going to pay plays in LA.

[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:46.040]
The great white males and crook you also very much.

[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:48.420]
147 and 560.

[02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:50.560]
Now let's cancel any appointments.

[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:53.000]
You'll have to rebook them phone calls for the rest of this hour.

[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:53.860]
We'll rebook them.

[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:59.180]
We'll be looking for like later in a week or maybe like right on election day because I have this article by Bruce Shapiro in the nation.

[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:00.080]
The red quiz election.

[02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:02.140]
Very important stuff.

[02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:11.060]
Even though it's like over most people's heads, most people are just like, well who looks pretty good and who didn't fall down or in the debate and who's a nice guy and who's got a firm handshake and who I think is a liar.

[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:18.660]
He says it's taken a cancerous tumor to do what the Kerry campaign would not place the US Supreme Court of the center of the presidential campaigns final days.

[02:05:19.340 --> 02:05:29.180]
Chief Justice William Rins ability to lead the court demands age in the unusually aggressive medical procedure he utter when may mean his prognosis isn't as routine as his back to work in a week press statement suggests.

[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:35.980]
But if nothing else, Rankquist Illness concentrates the feverish political mind not just on the next administration's court appointments,

[02:05:35.980 --> 02:05:41.600]
but on the former immediate possibility of a constitutional crisis in the aftermath of this contentious election.

[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:49.900]
The obvious point about Rankquist Illness is that it reminds voters of Bush v. Gore, of Roe v. Wade, of Miranda rights and the death penalty and affirmative action.

[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:53.740]
But these emotionally charged matters obscure something else just as important.

[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:59.480]
William Rinsquist is in many crucial ways the judicial godfather of the Bush administration and today's Republican right.

[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:15.920]
Even more than that of Ronald Reagan, Rankquist biography is a roadmap to the fundamental ideological divides of the past half century and it is Rankquist who more than any other individual erected from the 1950s onward, the legal scaffolding around which the Bush administration has built its domestic politics and its foreign policies.

[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:22.020]
In a real sense, this coming election is a referendum on William Rankquist as much as it is on George W. Bush.

[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:32.640]
Do I exaggerate? Consider where the Chief Justice's political biography begins as a clerk to Justice Robert Jackson at one of the defining moments of American law, the arguments over Brown v. Board of Education.

[02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:44.560]
Rankquist crafted memos defending segregation. The same young clerk egged on the executions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, sneering at justices whom he called old women for being uneasy about pulling the switch.

[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:52.080]
These two issues obstructing the enforcement of civil rights and aggressively advancing capital punishment became virtual obsessions with Rankquist.

[02:06:52.460 --> 02:07:13.540]
Beginning in Richard Nixon's Justice Department since 1979, a 71 on the Supreme Court, he has labored mightily and with great success to hold aloft these two emotional issues as rallying points for the right wing legal scholars and politicians alike and no presidential candidate in history relied so literally upon these two issues as the George W. Bush of 2000 who proved his manhood by aggressive executions in Texas.

[02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:26.080]
And one is office by disenfranchising African American voters in Florida. The fact is that no administration, not even Reagan's has depended upon Rankquist cumulative legacy of memos tactics, rulings and protégés as the Bush White House.

[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:35.780]
Touch any live wire issue and sooner or later the current the current issues traced back to his office door consider those Florida voters decades before the 2000 election.

[02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:42.480]
Rankquist is a politically ambitious lawyer pioneered finally home challenges to registered African Americans at Arizona pulling places.

[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:55.760]
The excesses of the Patriot Act and John Ashcroft Justice Department followed a line back to the early Nixon administration when then assisted in training general rank was provided the first thorough legal scaffolding for political surveillance, wiretaps and secret detention plans.

[02:07:55.760 --> 02:08:10.340]
And for his later Supreme Court decisions unleashing police powers corporate scandals the Federalist Society born under Rankquist's patronage in 1982 produced not just Clarence Thomas but a generation of anti-regulatory lawyers brought in by Bush to the EPA and other agencies.

[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:20.400]
Where did the Bush White House turn to find executive branch authority for imprisonment and torture in Iraq and Afghanistan to rank was 1970 memos in support of the invasion of neutral Cambodia.

[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:25.180]
The pathway to Bush versus Gore was tied with Rankquist briefs, memos and rulings.

[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:39.700]
Will after all Rankquist illness provoked constitutional crisis the reality is that the country has been in a constitutional crisis ever since Bush versus Gore a crisis accelerated by the Bush administration's opportunistic response to 9-11.

[02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:55.300]
What Bush and his team have understood so clearly is that the same fear of disorder and crime that powered Rankquist career could be resuscitated under the guise of fighting terrorism and with the same result radically expanding the power of the executive branch generally and the imperial presidency in particular.

[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:07.160]
What binds Bush and Rankquist so closely is not anything that should properly be called conservative but an aggressive commitment to dismantling the Federal government's enforcement of civil rights and civil liberties while expanding the state's power to police and punish.

[02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:21.580]
I put all this out not to feel clever and certainly not to wish an elderly cancer patient ill rather chief justice Rankquist brush with malignancy as a reminder of the Bush agenda that is older and deeper and more enduring than the alarms of 9-11 or the agonizing catastrophes of Iraq.

[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:28.160]
The question is not whether this election will provoke a constitutional crisis but whether it will resolve the crisis that's been brewing for years.

[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:33.020]
Pretty good stuff by Bush Shapiro in the nation.

[02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:39.140]
Don't forget to enjoy it in McGell and Bokobry and Happy Hour 5-7 this afternoon.

[02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:09.060]
I just thought you know well like I said it's a damn good thing we didn't put it on you know.

[02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:18.540]
You might tell you one thing I know IRS tax problems are got a way of ruining your life baby they destroy a financially physically and emotionally you have nightmares all night.

That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:38.860]
Three thousand people killed are not forgotten let's exploit them instead.

[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:49.180]
Hey there's oil to be caught in going after sat down to play Kato Sama there's no longer mention of the name in law.

[02:11:49.340 --> 02:12:02.340]
But no one seems concerned all come be in complacent believe in every word of this cartel administration that controls us by fear through media manipits.

[02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:08.080]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:22.900]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying.

[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:31.120]
We're all suspects now not the ass crop is saying I have nothing to hide table talkers all are saying.
