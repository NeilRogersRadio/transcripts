[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.480]
Hey, as soon as I'm talking about how he murdered those people and given this celebrity status and all his money back

[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.060]
Oh, you don't think he really did it to it?

[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.680]
Before we do anything else I want to urge everybody who's anywhere near a computer right now. Yeah before they take it off

[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.600]
Well, we don't know what it is we don't you show did you so Josh that picture with everything? I witnessed everybody and what is it?

[00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.260]
It's are you tell me okay? No, man the article in the New York Post this morning says OJ blames Nicole

[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.080]
Now if you go to nypost.com New York Post.com just NY post and

[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.940]
Click on under the news stories where it says OJ blames Nicole just click on a link to that story and the story will pop up

[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.720]
And there is a picture next to the story

[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.600]
That is captured OJ Simpson now

[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.080]
We only could wish that he's starting to deteriorate that badly if that really could be him there must be a guide, you know what?

[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.140]
No brother

[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.020]

Maybe somebody can tell us what that is a costume a costume

[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.680]
I

[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.000]
Mean we know why time made those OJ so black how come the post made him so light and bizarre but anyway oh wait

[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.040]
I got it. Yeah, this is some other guy named OJ Simpson. Well, there you go. Maybe this is the real killer

[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.740]
Anyway, here's a letter from New Times. We got a lot of OJ stuff coming. We got the great event Sustor and Brown

[00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.200]

[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.760]
Which we love we hate you OJ like poison isn't that ironic that scruand came in for a wear guest appearance before the show this morning

[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.620]

[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.660]
Is it?

[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.100]
It'd be a have to be a hell of a I could understand like the face part, you know, but the neck looks like the guy that runs the ring toss at the youth fair

[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.280]
Yeah, I know which ring it is too. That's the one buff was talking about this morning

[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.100]

[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.900]
Don't take it personal. She might make today's pull to his matter of fact

[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.700]
She might see that's bad especially since you already wrote around there. Yeah

[00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.340]
Well, at least we're keeping our name alive anyway. Kelly Craig 144

[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.740]

Elliott Rodriguez 19

[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.980]
I guess the audience doesn't share my dismay and discuss and content or maybe nobody watches channel four news

[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:28.300]
Jennifer Volopy 15 with her massive gigantic ego and Olisha Lane is in last place with seven

[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.520]
And Miguel was saying they're ain't nothing wrong with Olisha Lane never heard of and we don't have no idea who she is

[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.700]

Have you ever want seen this website? No your call radio no, or you might want to check it out

[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:47.220]
I was listening to waxy 790 this morning. I just can't imagine why and they had a show produced by this radio station

[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.300]
Was interesting to talk by David Corton

[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.660]
I don't have any idea what that means or what that's all about and quite frankly

[00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:00.520]
Okay, here's our pool today. Who's your all-time favorite fat person that are alive and we're not just talking about fat like me or Mo

[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:06.580]
We're talking about real fat now. We got some people on our station you qualify like the Humper right the beast

[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:14.280]
You know the beast and the Mo now are bonding in see the beast and Mo have a lot in common

[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:19.960]
And that is they they both keep they both keep wandering around trying to find somebody that they can latch onto now

[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:26.480]
The beast has been rejected by far out by Joe Rose by yours truly again now by Mo several times

[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.900]
But it looks like the two of them are like it looks like they're

[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.240]
Getting back together again. I'm pleased to see that some of you want to send them a congratulatory message

The homosexuals coming at me right now

[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.760]
There's woman right

[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.820]
We're on the other

[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.180]
We're so much

[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:43.620]
God

[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.580]
This is the entire line of the

[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:51.160]
The realization of gayness is sweeping across the planet

[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.520]
Cononus after coming at nation after nation state after state

[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.620]
Well, just one state so far, but that's just the beginning

[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.300]
There everywhere my god

[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.820]
The government oh my god, I can't believe it

[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.280]
There are even here one

[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:13.600]
Starting years ago with Ellen the generous now it's a homophobic event of global proportions

[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:21.280]
It's the epic saga of one man's desperate struggle to prevent the whole world from becoming gay or tolerating anyone who is

[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.780]
George W. Bush stars in the biggest blackbuster of the summer

[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.760]
Jay after tomorrow

[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.680]
Be there when it comes out and theaters this summer

Abu gai

[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.480]
Ten eighteen at five sixty W.D. Q.A.M. and an interview marking the 10th anniversary of Nicole Brown Simpson's murder

[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:45.540]
The anxious O.J. Simpson virtually blames his ex-wife for her own slaying the clearest Kobe bride and jack O innocent

[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:52.080]
Appears to mock the idea of date rape and plugs his own tacky reality TV show says the New York Post with his very bizarre picture

[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.880]
What is it?

[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.800]
It could be him

[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.700]
And based on what?

[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.560]
Based on that's how he goes out so that he don't get recognized

[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:08.360]
Right the disgraced grid legend makes the offhanded comments and a team interview with Fox news channels

[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:14.600]
The grotesque look and Greta van Sustor and Brown Schwartz speaking about how he's handled the anniversary of his wife slaying Simpson says

[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.960]
He's angry with Nicole for keeping an unsavory social set in 1994

[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.160]
The year a knife wielding a silent him slaughtered brown and rodentable golden outside her Brentwood condo

[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.580]
I'm angry with Nicole. I'm angry that she found herself hanging out with this group of who are these people Simpson said

[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.940]
I could count on my fingers the times I've seen Faye Resnick and this is a group of nomads

[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:38.040]
I guess then Nicole started hanging out with after we were divorced and her mother didn't like him

[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.140]
Van Sustor and Simpson taped their 44 minute chat recently at a hotel in Miami

[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]
During the interview which years Monday at 10 p.m. Simpson shamelessly plugs a prank reality TV show

[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.320]
He claims to be developing Simpson compared it to MTV show featuring actor Ashton Kuchikuchi Kuchikuchi pulling stunts

[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.680]
It's a takeoff on something called punk. It's me doing gag's as juice

[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.120]
Juice what they call juicing people he said on a scale of one to ten. It's seven or eight that it's gonna happen

[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.240]
Oh Jay. I forget. He'd call it stabbed

[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.960]
Oh Jay had harsh words for almost everyone involved in his trial saving his most blood attack for it in his brown

[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.180]
Who runs a foundation for her sister's memory? He claims she's profited from Nicole's murder

[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.140]
I'm sure the income is down on a foundation that she works for which I would imagine makes her income go down

[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.480]
Simpson said I don't think anyone's bills have been paid more than denies is from what came from the trial

[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.700]
Whatever that means

[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.960]
Simpson also comments on the prosecutions of NBA star Kobe Bryant and king of clop Michael Jackson

[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.560]
He believes both are innocent

[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.320]
Bryant is accused of raping a hotel employee Eagle County Colorado. Why Jackson's been invited for allegedly

[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.140]
molesting a young cancer victimized year in Santa Barbara County

[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.100]
As far as I'm concerned they bride and Michael Jackson are innocent till proven guilty. OJ said just like him

[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:55.180]
In commenting on Bryant's case Simpson appeared to mock the concept of date rape saying no doesn't always mean no

[00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:01.000]
I've certainly in my life had girls come to the room and say no or say whatever and when I was a kid growing up

[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.620]
Just about every girl said no once the laughing Simpson said you know

[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:11.120]
They had to because you think that they were slaughter something in my opinion date rape and stranger rape are two different things entirely

[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.800]
So no doesn't always mean no

[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:22.700]
I'll be right that Grizzly June 12th anniversary next week Simpson said he and the two children in the coals sitting 18 and just in 16 have already

[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.000]
Toasted their mom's memory

[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.720]
This is the best part

[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.340]
I don't look at the anniversary ever greet the fact that we ever had to know that this is the anniversary

[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:36.840]
I did mark the occasion a few days ago. I didn't have my kids at dinner at a Benny Hanatite place. I guess he liked the colorary

[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.260]
And I said okay, we got a toast. This would have been your mother's 45th birthday if I wouldn't have killed the bitch

[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:43.640]
I mean

[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.060]
Well

[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.300]
Now do we figure out who that picture is yet? No

[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.980]
Line nine probably knows wq. I am back. Ecclesi

[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.360]
Jackie Gleason the last little watch out for the fat pool. I see

[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.900]
Why do you got two possibilities now come on you got to take a look at this thing in my post.com

[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.960]
OJ blames Nicole

[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.020]
What is it Eric? Do you want him to post it? Yeah, that's not a bad idea

[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.960]
Maybe Eric will get around to do a man

[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.080]
Well, it's speaking of Eric in his Japanese wife. You're going to be very relieved to hear this before we get back to all this other stuff

[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.380]
You are going to breathe a sigh of relief when you hear this story from USA today. Okay

[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.100]
No sex please were Japanese. I think a pardon

[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:33.300]
To an astonishing degree astonishing not just ordinary pedestrian kind of interesting, but an astonishing degree as in oh my god

[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:38.380]
Right the sexes are going their opposite ways in Japan young women are revolting

[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:45.900]
I see revolting against the visual role of a beaten housewife opting instead to live at home and shop and socialize with girlfriends

[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:52.960]
Startled men are retreating in the solitary ways check ins of the countries famed love hotels are even falling as birth rates

[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.280]
But a social crisis looms in Japan. Yeah, that is a really

[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.700]
Says nothing is happening these days with depressing regularity between Japanese men and women

[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.060]
Junko Saki was nervously looking forward to a romantic getaway with the man she'd been seeing

[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.480]
But when they arrived at the seaside hotel last fall her boy requested separate rooms stunned

[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.700]
Saki nevertheless anticipated a late night knock on the door. It never happened

[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.000]
Nothing happened the Tokyo writer said

[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.560]
Mirages birds and hanky panky are all spiraling downward with troubling implications for Japan's future

[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:30.340]
Of sagging birth rate means that if you were working age people would be around the support a growing population of the elderly a social crisis looms

[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.760]
Now the reason George will be relieved is that his daughter's going to be on one of those student

[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.360]
Whatever they call those program programs. Yeah, right

[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.380]
For student exchange things and she's going to be in the Tokyo. I'm assuming Tokyo right not gonna

[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.820]
Oh, well over there. They're doing like crazy. Oh seriously

[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.420]
In a 2001 survey

[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.740]
Condom maker dulex found that Japan ranked dead last among 28 countries in the frequency of sex the average Japanese had sex

[00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.620]
Just 36 times a year. Hong Kong was next to last with 63 guess who was number one

[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.340]
America

[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.180]
Yeah, you got it 124 times a year. No, I just guess it

[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:14.700]
Americans ranked number one frequency of sex. They're horny. They're a desperate. Well, um, of course we are talking blow up dollars and things like that

[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.740]
How about Chris Farley for the pull formerly alive and from Saturday night live, so Steve

[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:26.080]
Okay, you got a lot of a lot of fat comedians a lot of fat mostly dead comedians because like we said over and over again

[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.720]
How about Don De la Wies

[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.320]
He's still alive. Oh, I'm gonna say when did he die? No, but I'm just saying

[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:39.120]
This isn't for dead. This is a dead or alive. We could start a show called Saturday night dead with all the dead people that used to be on that show. Yeah

[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:45.400]
Just 1.1 million babies were born in Japan last year the third straight decline the average Japanese couple of producers

[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.180]
Just 1.32 children one and a third

[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:55.540]
Well below the minimum 2.08 needed compensate for deaths is the result of plummeting birth rates Japan's population is expected to peak in

[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.860]
2006 and then decline rapidly, which is probably good news because they seem to suffer from a

[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.180]
Very bad overpopulation problem if you ask me I haven't been there

[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.160]
But when you look at the country geographically. It's a very small country on a map

[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.940]
Yeah, and Tokyo is just teaming with millions and millions and millions so they could probably use a little bit

[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:18.360]
You know, right? I guess that's the place to go if you want some there's a need if you want somewhat

[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.780]
Fun, hmm

[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.580]
Well your daughter's going here

[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.700]
5.670 5.60 pound 5.60 on the 18th

[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.080]
And I just just pass this along to I don't want to get bogged down on this all this stuff

[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:36.360]
And his name is not Chalabi it if his lawyer pronounces it Chalabi, which was always good enough for me before

[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:37.840]
That's good enough to

[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.600]
Ahmed Chalabi

[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:48.080]
The Iraqi politicians suspected by US authorities of having told a random spring that its secret communication coated and broken was involved in an intercept

[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.960]
Episode 9 years ago according to senior administration officials

[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.760]
Now there was this is nothing new. Didn't I tell you he was a crook and a slime ball. I told you that. Yeah

[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:03.040]
Officials yesterday recounted an incident in early 1995 when Chalabi's name turned up in an encrypted Iranian cable

[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.720]
Reporting a purported CIA back plan to assassinate Sodom was saying in Iraq's present

[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.560]
The message was intercepted by US intelligence and caused a major political stern Washington

[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:17.120]
It looks now like there's a chance that this whole thing the neocons may have got sucked in by the Iranians

[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.500]
And he might have been a part of it

[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.460]
He was dependent in the middle of it and he in a sense been providing all this phony

[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.420]
weapons on all this information on weapons of mass destruction and all these other phony documents

[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.460]
How do you like that happen? They're so smart. How could they yeah, they're so smart like more like that

[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:38.080]
So all these over 800 Americans who died over there in the 45,000 injured remained and all the other thousands of dead Iraqis

[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:42.280]
Guess what oops? Maybe we got sucked in oops. Sorry

[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.060]
WQA and hello

[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:50.020]
Hello, yes sir. This is for the dead person for the fat person fall. Yeah

[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.860]
I'm thinking about putting on big Wilson

[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.880]
He's already on news sir. Oh, okay. Thanks a lot. He's got four votes and thank you so much

[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.420]

[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.480]
You

[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:23.760]
Goodbye Chris Barley

[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:33.880]
You great big fatty always acting like a great big fat dumb retard in every film you've ever made

[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.080]
You got poor David's fate

[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.980]
His career could fade cuz

[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:49.480]
Allie has left is that lame old TV show he won't be making bloody movies no more

[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:59.200]
As you wanted to be just like John Belushi and have John can these children

[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:06.240]
You finally made it but we're not too careful what you wish

[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.680]
You gave us lots of laughter on Saturday night

[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:21.200]
But you were way too young to die to commit that man suicide

[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.940]
Oh

[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.740]
Goodbye Chris Farley

[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:36.360]
What did you eat to blow up like a big balloon eating like a fool that would only bring you certain

[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.580]
farmers are

[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:49.900]
And all you left was some cable movies and a few tales of your pants

[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.520]
That will fill to make community pools

[00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:02.380]
And you wanted to be just like John Belushi and have John can these children

[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.300]
You finally made it

[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.420]
But we're not too careful what you wish

[00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.310]
You're

You got so fat you die

[00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.310]
Oh my god, and it wasn't one more dinner that we had to like a

Potsky round one. Wouldn't that great? Oh, refresh me. I said here run on the edge of my seat

[00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.250]

1032 at 560 WQA

[00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.730]
I'm doing a mad dog this afternoon 2 to 4 as he broadcast live from the hooters in Dorel

I was asking about this morning if you like sitting a bottle

I'll join a QM QT tonight from 8 to 10 at the village grill and pump low-key that off commercial in a 1a stop by for prizes and specials on begs beer

Oh the fat albus

[00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.050]
Yeah, well, I guess that's okay, huh?

[00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:10.190]
All right, we'll put that albus well he was sure pretty monstrous back in the day back in those

[00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.410]
Vegas days when he was bursting out of his

[00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:20.070]
outfits those outfits are like two three sizes too small now since John Balushi's mentioned in that bit how about John Balushi now

[00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:27.190]
He was yes, he was he was he was pretty gigantic and a combination of all and heavy-duty drugs and the fat

[00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.010]
I think is like what kind of put him over the edge

[00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:36.030]
Wouldn't we agree on that yeah, so John Balushi and Elvis the fat Elvis who want to be sure put that

[00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:42.790]
on their Josh fat albus as opposed to the skinny albus right five six seven oh five sixty speaking of fat

[00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:49.210]
I here's one way up my want to put on there. We got some people like this fat individual all about the fat rush

[00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:56.950]
Okay, the battle between rush limbo and prosecutors investigating him for less prescription drug abuse took another nasty turn

[00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:03.350]
Yesterday when the conservative right-wing Nazi commentator accused them of breaking court rules and the sleep of the judges hearing the case

[00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:10.270]
The latest disagreement arose earlier this week when assistance state attorney Jim March told an appeals court that limbo's attorney provided

[00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:16.610]
Wrong information in the case both sides appeared before the fourth district court of appeals and April to debate whether limbo's medical records

[00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:21.610]
Which were seized for the ongoing criminal investigation should remain private during the court hearing limbo's attorney

[00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:28.350]
Where black toll judges that the Florida medical the floor legislature had a one-time revised state law so that medical records could not be taken by search warrant

[00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:32.230]
On Tuesday Mars provided the court with information that blacks comments were incorrect

[00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:39.910]
But two days later black fired back arguing that prosecutors were missing five years worth of audio tapes of lawmakers discussions when they made the assertions

[00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:44.910]
The prosecutor is wrong in his research recklessly incomplete black charge and response file the court yesterday

[00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.190]
Prosecutors may have many powers, but they don't have the power to skip five years of legislation and rewrite history

[00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.710]
He has the court to fine-marts for his false accusations

[00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:58.070]
Mike Edminton spokesman for the Mars office declined to come and further on a case yesterday and yoddy-oddy

[00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:03.470]
Saw about the fat rush who he was just trying to take them pills to cover up his back pain. That's all

[00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:05.610]
It kind of a pain in the ass

[00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.850]
I'm like what the fused on me

[00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.750]
So let's put the fat rush on there. Okay fat wrestling ball

[00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:18.090]
We got it. We got it. I got it five six seven. Never is anybody now got any idea

[00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:22.590]
Huh? No, we don't know. This is one of the great mysteries. I think that I've brought to the public's attention

[00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.110]
Far more uh

[00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.270]
desperate than anything else going on the world today. Who is this picture?

[00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:33.590]
It says very clearly under their oj Simpson. Can there be more than one oj Simpson? Oh, we sure hope and pray not

[00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:39.810]
Because if there is if they're like a whole bunch of them, there surely must be a lot of evil doers on the loose. Maybe I'll president. They's got a point

[00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:45.850]
I mean you look at the New York Daily News and they got a big

[00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:51.670]
Stripping him and asked by the way on big gotta be straight, but it's like the oj that we know and hate. It's the same, you know

[00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.030]
I don't get it w.k.a.m. Hello

[00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:59.670]
How you doing uncle Neil great. I tried to reach you yesterday because I just cut back from

[00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:06.150]
California and you were talking about assimilating yeah going up and down the coast especially near the Bay area

[00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:11.930]
There were 10 million and one Chinese radio shows and 10 million and one spanish radio shows

[00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:16.650]
It seems like all over the country there's no assimilation. Hmm and

[00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:25.390]
There was one good thing that I did find out there a lot of like improvisation. Yeah, it was actually still some decent music

[00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:30.530]
But there were just some of the small stations out there along the coast, but as far as you know

[00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.510]
American stations or whatever there's really no assimilation

[00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:41.030]
And I got somebody through your pole somebody that you don't really like but he was big and fat in the combination of the drugs and the fat

[00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.850]
Jerry got through you

[00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:46.250]
No Greg I don't dislike him. I just there wasn't into that whole thing

[00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:52.490]
Yeah, that whole stick but as far as the assimilation is all over the country because even when I was in Reno Nevada out there

[00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:57.390]
They had 10 million and one Hispanic station trust me man Kalamazoo Michigan check it out

[00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.630]
Thank you and have a great weekend bye-bye

[00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.050]
Okay, you got it we got Jerry Garcia

[00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.110]
Before for Jerry Garcia, we probably wouldn't have fish food right right

[00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:11.590]
I don't know what Jerry great well. I mean the fish was just another one of those the same high set

[00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.210]
That's right by the greatful dead

[00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:18.730]
I'm looking at this I gotta put this down this OJ picture of skinny me aggravated down

[00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.970]
Nightmare decade for OJ's dream team

[00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:28.610]
You're like this story you'll love it. I got I got stories up the old shoot about the OJ shoot

[00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:35.030]
Oh, man, I tell you one thing OJ the day that we that's my golden life is that I'll live that miserable bastard that murdering piece of crap

[00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:39.510]
That's my goal. I just decided that right now spontaneously right on the year. Okay? Okay

[00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:45.670]
I want to be around to see the day when they stick his murdering ass right in the ground and we think you can imagine

[00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:50.970]
Will be there to mourn, you know, there'll be our some of our people there be the water Nazi and be a throne. Oh

[00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:57.630]
Jay we miss you. Yeah, coffin climbers Greg will be there. He'll be there in his Brooks Brothers suit with his crappy haircut

[00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.330]
Nightmare decade for OJ's dream team

[00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:07.310]
For the key members of OJ Simpsons dream team of attorneys likes to become a nightmare since the trial ended nine years ago

[00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.770]
And we're delighted to see that

[00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:15.150]
Efflee Bailey is it had a charm career before we ended up with Simpson representing characters as colorful as the Boston

[00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.850]
Stranger and Patty Hearst, but post OJ

[00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.810]
Bailey's luck has turned to a crap nose-dived

[00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.650]
He was this barred and flora done 2001

[00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:29.490]
And the following year in Massachusetts for the way he handled 600,000 chairs of stock on by convicted drugs

[00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:35.230]
Muggler clogged the buck and he spent 44 days in federal prison in Florida after refusing to turn over the stock to the government

[00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:41.650]
In March 2003 Bailey was in hot water regaining took two million dollars in legal fees that legally belonged to the US government

[00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:46.250]
A federal jury in Florida decided jurors ordered him to return and pay additional three million in damages

[00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:51.950]
In October a judge said that decision is signed, but the US attorney's office in Orlando said it might file an appeal

[00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:57.270]
The Dubock case also drove a wedge between Bailey and his longtime friend dream team member Robert Shapiro

[00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.390]
Who represented the drug leader along with Bailey

[00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:04.050]
Bailey believes Shapiro would be trading by testifying for the government against Bailey in the stock case

[00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:10.390]
Since four never to deal with Shapiro again Shapiro's luck's been better than Bailey's, but he's also had some difficulties since the OJ draw

[00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.610]
Oh, that good

[00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:18.290]
He was recently dismissed by a client record producer Phil Specter who's accused of murdering a woman at his home

[00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:26.150]
He did it and he was dismissed by Yali Numen a 20-year-old California woman charged with hatching a series of elaborate plots to cheetah restraints husband

[00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.710]
Out of custody of their two children

[00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:32.950]
Flamboyant if the glove does not fit you must acquit and your full-of-shmit attorney Johnny Cochran

[00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:38.670]
Barely had time to savor his victory at Simpson's criminal trial before his ex-wife published a book claiming Johnny hitter

[00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.510]
And had a secret son by another woman

[00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:44.590]
Cochran vehemently did not abusing her and is the inquire review of last week

[00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:48.630]
Cochran recently underwent surgery for a golf ball-sized brain tumor

[00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:54.130]
Right the architect of the dream team Simpson's longtime pal Robert Kardashian won't see him no more

[00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:58.570]
Dited as in senior California home my September only six weeks after marrying Ellen Pearson

[00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:03.150]
Eight weeks after he learned he had cancer of the Asophagus asophage asophage how they say it

[00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:05.830]
Asophage yield cancer how you say it?

[00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:11.850]
I never say it. Yeah, I don't Kardashian went to his grave with his reputation still solied by his actions in the Simpson case

[00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:15.730]
He was carrying your garment bag out of Simpson's house 24 hours after the double slaying

[00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:22.050]
What everyone wanted to know was where Simpson's bloody clothes in there said his widow Ellen was Robert being an accomplice

[00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.390]
After the trial he never spoke to the dream team again

[00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.890]
He never spoke to OJ Simpson and even on his deathbed

[00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.690]
OJ didn't get around to call and how do you like that?

[00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.790]
And he also told his wife of OJ does call tell him it's the wrong number

[00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:41.290]
Where'd you go? I'm reaching for the a facs of fact here. Okay. You just thanks him. He's so much crap

[00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:46.090]
Yeah, there's a lot of crap. Wow. Just a lot of crap all the crap all the time man more than we can handle

[00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:51.130]
We're just drowning in see a crap. Let's see a fat. Oh, the fat Jerry Lewis

[00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:51.310]
Yes

[00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:56.830]
It's no longer as big and blown up like the bullfrog that he was that fact is not in slime

[00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:01.350]
And the time and four lottery else says that's a little insensitive. Hey lady. Oh, we put him on there

[00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:07.750]
Yeah, the fact you can be sure to put the fat Jerry Lewis because most of his life Jerry Lewis said that we knew in despise was skinny

[00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:14.330]
Now we've got the fact is I haven't sent them along saying the fat Neil Rogers from when you used to be fat

[00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:17.190]
Okay

[00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:22.390]
But they don't they didn't never knew me when I was really really fat when I was up to 266

[00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:27.710]
That was my serosoda days 1973. Let me tell you get about my hamburger helper and my

[00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:33.010]
That's true. I'm marching like a college football game on a Saturday afternoon

[00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:38.150]
What's not to like I go out and I buy a box of hamburger helper a a pound of ground sirloin

[00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.790]
I cook it all up there in the frying pan through when the hamburger helper whip it all up

[00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.430]
I give me a nice huge can of Hawaiian punchwood sugar

[00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.510]
And by the end of the day I've eaten a whole thing

[00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:53.190]
What a large game, huh? What a large oh yeah, and then I started to get in these

[00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.670]

The most unique competition ever a group of ordinary women will hand over their lives to a team of cosmetic and plastic surgery

[00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:31.730]
Have to be a little bit more dramatic to the best from the producer of the swan. It's the swan

[00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:39.570]
It's just like the swan, but in a surprised way. We make them uglier

[00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:42.110]
Behind that curtain there's a mirror

[00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.890]
When you feel comfortable you can let me know that you're ready

[00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:48.010]
The mirror will be revealed

[00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:49.950]

Famous jockey you wouldn't know him because it's a pad val of Venezuela whatever his name is whatever

[00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:49.370]
Back in july 1994 the inquirer created nasional headlines when we broke the story that OJ Simpson bought a knife

[00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:54.310]
Believed to be the murder weapon just weeks before the slangs of his ex-wife Nicole and Ron Goldman

[00:38:55.090 --> 00:39:00.350]
And on the 10th anniversary of the killings LA knife shop owner Richard Wattenberg told the inquirer

[00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:07.750]
It's been 10 years, but not one day goes by where someone doesn't say isn't this destroy where OJ bought the knife he killed his wife with

[00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.970]
And he says absolutely

[00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:11.350]
Yeah

[00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.290]
Simpson paid $81.17

[00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:20.350]
For the 14 and a half inch long German made stiletto knife called a lock blade

[00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:29.210]
Six weeks before the double murder salesman Jose Camacho and his boss Wattenberg told the inquirer in an exclusive interview for our July 12, 1994 issue

[00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:33.970]
Camacho told us Simpson had been outside on the street shooting scenes for the TV movie Frogman

[00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:40.090]
When he came in a 3 p.m. on Monday on the May 3rd after he bought the knife he wanted it sharpened

[00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:47.750]
Simpson even gave the salesman a card he signed it said to Jose peace to you or a Josh Becker would say

[00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:48.590]
um

[00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:53.170]
Two days after the killings LA homicide detective searching for the murder weapon came into the store

[00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:57.850]
Ross Cutlery that's the name of the store in downtown LA an interviewed Camacho and Richard Wattenberg

[00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:03.770]
They asked us every detail of what OJ said his demeanor Wattenberg told the inquirer and our lady they came back and bought the same knife

[00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:06.050]
The actual murder weapon has never been found today

[00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.830]
Wattenberg is reluctant to talk about the knife

[00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:12.970]
But he did tell the inquirer at the beginning believe it or not people would blame me for the murders for selling OJ the knife

[00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:14.530]
How do you like that? Yeah

[00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.110]
Man oh, I got I got how many pages here

[00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.650]
Okay stuff

[00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:26.810]
In fact, I think on Monday in honor of the the fact he murdered those two people will just play all the OJ bits on Monday

[00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:30.950]
Eric sent me a note saying old J is up now

[00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:33.970]
Old J that's right

[00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:35.570]
Yeah, me and that's what that is

[00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:39.870]
Maybe he'll lighten up a little bit in future is kind of like he seems to be in a Michael Jackson

[00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.950]
Maybe he'll do the same thing maybe they'll get that same a Clorox bleach job

[00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.910]
That's a little vigo baby is that what that is man? Oh, man

[00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.410]
We only could pray that he wake up looking like that tomorrow then we know that there was a guy

[00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.130]
God about that wow

[00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:56.110]
You've got to take a look at that people and why post calm OJ blames the call

[00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.150]
It's under the news stories that you got to click on that link

[00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:03.690]
OJ blames the call and it'll pop up with a story but then that picture with a caption OJ Simpson under it

[00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:09.250]
What is that what is it? I don't know man. That is a disgusting thing. Nobody QA him. Hello

[00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.790]

And of course Dom Delewese is most famous line that he never said but never left

[00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.810]
That's the honey tune. Yeah, he never said either

If you didn't see fatso you better go see it especially all your fat slabs out there like me go see fatso

[00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:36.370]
And the interesting part of it is in the end of the movie after he's married happily and has all those kids in the whole deal

[00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:38.930]
And they they showed that little as they're running the credits

[00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:47.430]
They showed the montage of clips from when he was so old and then older and he's like fat and skinnier and fatter again

[00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:52.750]
Like an accordion like a human accordion. I can't stop the fat. I feel sorry for me

[00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:59.230]
Yeah, he's great though. Hold on Delewese. He's pretty good ironically. Yes. He's three times the size now

[00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.530]
Is anyway I know I made that movie exactly

[00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:06.350]
I know some people like that. Yeah, I don't want to start it on the beast again, but I

[00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:11.470]
I affect if I were you here's a little message for both of you guys don't be in the studio

[00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.390]
Don't be around on the day when he blows up

[00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:21.690]
Yeah, I prepare goggles that I it's not gonna be a pre-site believe me and it won't be safe either. I saw that movie WQAM. Hello

All right Sydney Green Street for all you real old-timers. Did we put our some wells on? I thought we did

[00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.690]
Yes, Ariel Shuron. Did we put him on her? Yes, we got zero

[00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:48.030]
Well, just don't get militant about he just went on her a couple of minutes ago

[00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:54.810]
207 votes or some wells don't have any of the factory Lewis Dave Vixen's got one. You know who's vote that is? Who me?

[00:42:55.770 --> 00:43:00.870]
Well, I just voted for him because I knew nobody else would John Goodman too now. Let's see if these fat people

[00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:06.070]
Oh, that's really not fear because a lot of them are well my horse and wells died from a fat and smoke and two

[00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:08.310]
He smoked like I think he probably died from lung cancer

[00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:10.370]
before the fat caught him

[00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.070]
But let's take a look at how many of these people are dead, okay? John Candy

[00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:23.410]
77 votes dead Jackie Gleason 37 dead Chris Farley 29 votes dead John Belushi 16 votes dead

[00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:31.030]
So the first four all dead and three of them died long before their time from fat Jackie Gleason. I don't remember how old he was when he died

[00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:36.650]
Right, I don't know but he wasn't like a young man. No, but he was an old man either

[00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:41.410]
Kelly Craig 13 Kelly still alive come on loosen out and Kelly please

WQA and hello

[00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:43.050]
Neil yes, this is ambisha I have come back. Oh, and the fat how about the fat ambition

[00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:46.330]
She wasn't so much fat as she was just no mish

[00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.370]
I think your memory is failing it. She was pretty exotic

[00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:57.490]
But if you say so we won't put her on her. I know she was plum. She was here. She was pleasantly pl- she was un pleasantly plump

[00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.430]
Okay, we can put that in Bishop on there. No, don't put her on. Okay, don't put her on

[00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:01.930]
WQA and hello

[00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.290]
Not there QA and hello

[00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:07.170]
Oh, yeah, I got for the poll. Yes, sir

[00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:11.490]
Um, Luciano Paparotti and what's happening?

[00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:13.510]
And who's the other one?

[00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.610]
Regretting from what's happening? You don't know. Okay, we can't put them on then. Yeah, we don't know what is named

[00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:23.750]
Anyway, Luciano Paparotti. Okay, for all you pseudo intellectual. Oh, and by the way speaking as suits, you know, all the remember all the crying

[00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:28.150]
Well, I went TMI when Cox took the classical music off there and put on

[00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.410]
M.I.B. or what what do they make no party party ready party

[00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:38.570]
And party's not doing all that great. I should point out but at any rate WKAT in this last trend. I noticed

[00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:44.430]
Ha ha ha ha ha you can't find their numbers with a surge party. I think like a point one was there

[00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.030]
That was one of their higher numbers

[00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:50.690]
Is zero plus is zero point one is in one tenth of one percent

[00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:54.050]
So all those people that were wanting maybe they maybe they took my advice

[00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:55.730]
Maybe they actually went out there because they

[00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:58.890]
Their classical music crowd is supposed to be the people with a few bucks

[00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:01.090]
Maybe they went out there to their nearby record store

[00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:05.410]
Hopefully not blockbuster and they picked up a bunch of CDs and they listen to whatever they like

[00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:11.950]
You know Bach and Brahms and Beethoven and Mozart and all of that other pseudo intellectual crap or dare I say

[00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:16.130]
You know they have several classical channels on that XM and Sirius I understand

[00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.150]
Get serious. No

[00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:22.210]
And also even like on my cable for example almost all the cable all the way

[00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:24.530]
If you have direct TV all of them direct TV my cable all the way

[00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.350]
I'm typing you direct TV the orifice man and crank up your old Mozart

[00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:30.850]
By the look of this is my city

[00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.630]
The radio's on your side

[00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:37.730]
You

[00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:43.170]
Hey see it's 11 o'clock. I screwed up now the line 12 wasn't ringing was it? No, I didn't but it is gonna ring

[00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:43.970]
We hope

[00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:48.770]
Well, I know well because Dave is always very punctual. I almost forgot the whole darn thing there

[00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:52.270]
Anyway, here's one. It says two more names for your list buddy hackett now for an Hitchcock

[00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:55.790]
You're slow ones both dead by the way

[00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.690]
Now buddy hackett wasn't like young he wasn't ancient right right

[00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:05.550]
Alfred Hitchcock was ancient he lived a long time. He was kind of like the one time Churchill of the movies

[00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:13.090]
He lived a long time was a real pervote. That's what the tippy headroom's been a ton everybody right anybody who would listen and everybody all the other actresses too

[00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.890]
He was always pawn and claw on

[00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:16.250]
Yeah, well

[00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:21.690]
Louis Anderson who may be the worst game show host of all time and I read is he like a stand-up comedian

[00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:24.530]
What is his state what do you do started out as they stand-up comedian?

[00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:28.230]
I saw one of his routines and it was actually funny, but there was a hundred years ago

[00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:32.450]
Well, he seems like he might have been funny a hundred years ago Louis B. Anderson just a horrible game show host

[00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:36.770]
Fair right said and it just that's his ghost show you know, yeah

[00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:39.750]
Louis B. Anderson. Okay, let's get his badass on there too. All right

[00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:44.310]
Now watching that line 12 frankly, and I probably shouldn't have done that I dig where I should have zagged

[00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:50.810]
Because it's exactly 11 o'clock. I know for the derby right you could have you could have set the atomic clock

[00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:55.890]
You could have said big Ben by the time that line 12 started to ring him maybe he's gonna pre-cursor, huh?

[00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:57.130]
Maybe he's stuck in the toilet

[00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:03.950]
What what the hell does that mean? Well sometimes, you know, you just can't leave when you want to I see

[00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:10.230]
There it is. We got oh there it nested there. Yeah, so a few seconds. What's a few seconds among friends, right?

[00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.330]
There's Dave Johnson who's like about four seconds late. How you doing Dave?

[00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:15.490]
I smarty there

[00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.110]
Smarty asses here. Yeah

[00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:23.010]
Now while while we're at it before we get into the Belmont stuff the horse and around stuff

[00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:28.030]
You might I'm sure you've got some name the poll question. We have today. Who is your favorite all time?

[00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:32.810]
Fat person dead or alive and we've got people like John Candy and

[00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:38.590]
Marlon Brando and people like that. You've got a how about Peter Roosevelt? He was fat wasn't he?

[00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:43.430]
Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt leave it to you to come up with something like off the wall like that

[00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:49.230]
Is that well, you know, that's pretty good. I guess it's all about you know my my funny my my

[00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:53.490]
Yes, my I was an American history major. We're yeah. Yeah

[00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:57.730]
That's how we're close to creating combination tell you about Howard and then it all went down the terrace

[00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.490]
Ha ha ha

[00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.970]
They need you a blank. Anyway, we're not going to talk about Howard co-sell

[00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:09.810]
We want to be in a good mood. Tomorrow's the big day two to five in the morning line the only only thing that gives me a little bit pause on that is that back in the 79

[00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.470]
Spectacular bid was one to five in the morning line for the of Belmont

[00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:17.170]
You know, I got a new angle on Spectacular bid

[00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:23.790]
Ronnie Franklin this week had a teleconference that he talked about how he had spent a lot of time with

[00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:29.410]
Buddy Delphin Ronnie Franklin the week before the Belmont of 79 and

[00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:37.490]
And he said that they were intent on breaking secretariat's record right there either the breaking the 31 lengths or breaking the time

[00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:41.170]
You know, I had never I'd never heard that or thought about it

[00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:45.410]
I always thought of that because buddy Delph talked so big that this was the greatest horse ever

[00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:51.130]
And I really believe that he said Ronnie Franklin out there to win by a 50 lengths and just demolished and of course

[00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:54.850]
He ran a horse out and at the top of the stretch he showed like a dog and coastal went by him

[00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:57.270]
And I think I think you know, and of course

[00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:01.710]
That's why I had to come up with a safety pin story and then Ronnie Franklin was a bad jockey and was his mistake

[00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:05.730]
But I think it was buddy Delph all along well, I think it was a combination of the two of them

[00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.170]
But they and also they were terribly overconfident

[00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.850]
Spectacular bid was a great horse. Yeah, the farther we get away from him the better

[00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:15.550]
But but he should have won the triple crown, you know

[00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:16.710]
No question about it

[00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.410]
There always has been an angle on all of these for example

[00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:24.030]
It's Seattle slew it was always John Krueger and everybody was saying oh, we hope the Frenchman doesn't fall off in them

[00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:30.190]
What race was it was it in the Belmont or was it in the Kentucky Derby where he stood up before the finished line and saluted the crowd

[00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:33.210]
I think it was the Belmont yeah the the Belmont when he

[00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:37.330]
You know one of triple crown and you'd like kind of stood up in a sack as he won by open lengths

[00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:43.650]
And he he's like waving his weapon people are holding their breath like oh please John don't fall off now before the finish line

[00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:47.170]
Um is it is interesting that the

[00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:48.770]
Tricot and

[00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:51.830]
And the John Krueger, you know the two

[00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:57.170]
Riders that will not go down in history is the greatest riders, you know, they rode triple crown winners

[00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:01.430]
Right and Stuart Elliott who would have ever thought and I remember back before the Derby you were saying

[00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:04.570]
He's definitely gonna go from obscurity into being like a big name

[00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:11.030]
Is he only to the broadcasters that picked smarty Jones in all in all of the races before the Derby?

[00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.570]
I mean you know

[00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:14.670]
Everybody jumped on the bandwagon, but we were there before

[00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:18.830]
They man. Well it's about time. We've only had about 50 years of doing this sooner sooner later

[00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:20.730]
Now this race tomorrow

[00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:25.570]
Makes me want to purge a little bit. I you know these other guys that like master David

[00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:29.630]
They put him in there now it almost seems as though we got some trainers who don't think that they're going to win

[00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:33.370]
But they want to try to find a way to make smarty at Jones lose which bothers me a little bit

[00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:35.890]
Yeah, I only see a couple horses

[00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.750]
Well first of all, it may be smarty Jones can only beat himself

[00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:42.490]
Yeah, maybe and if he does

[00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:49.790]
I could only see purge rock heart 10 and the possibly editing to either the other horse it shouldn't be in there right

[00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:53.310]
I think I think it's gonna be rock heart 10's gonna be second now

[00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:59.610]
Patrick valon's well was supposed to ride him. I read about that right and he can't because he uh didn't

[00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:04.590]
Turn up at the drug test again. You know Patrick valon's well has had more chances than the everybody can't

[00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:05.470]
I mean, it's just amazing

[00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:10.930]
And am I right about that? How many different chances he's had to come back? Yeah, and uh, you know

[00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:17.450]
Solis is not a regular at Belmont Park. I mean, I think if you look at the jockeys that are that are there

[00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:18.550]
I mean wouldn't

[00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:21.790]
Jerry Bailey be the top jockey on the top

[00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:26.530]
You know one of the top competitors adding to yeah, but Alex Solis is no slouch boy

[00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:28.870]
He's a good jockey and this this horse

[00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:34.990]
For for people that watch this thing on TV rock heart 10 is is over 17 hands high

[00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:40.510]
By hand is about four inches, but and the the little horse marty Jones is only 15

[00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:45.170]
Three so I mean there's a there's a real disparity between the size of these two horses

[00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.990]
Mm-hmm watch them when they're get to when they get to get together

[00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:52.630]
I think rock heart 10 is gonna come roaring down the stretch to be seconded by about 12 lengths

[00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.510]
I mean he'll still be way behind smarty Jones, but I can see that now

[00:52:55.510 --> 00:53:00.470]
That's probably the way they're gonna run from well behind. So you think smarty Jones will win by 12? Yeah

[00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:02.450]
That's my question. Well, I hope he does

[00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:07.110]
I don't think it'll solve the problems of racing, but it'll sure be a nice shot in the arm

[00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:12.010]
Yeah, especially with all the depressing stuff going on in the world today and all the negative crap going on

[00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.570]
I think yeah, we need something like this. It's good for racing and it's good

[00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:20.490]
General for the psyche of the public too. I have a couple race track buddies that are gonna bet everything in a race to show

[00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.290]
I mean people are saying that smarty Jones is gonna win

[00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:27.270]
Can you imagine the millions that are gonna be bet on this horse to show and if no any chance

[00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.190]
He doesn't hit the board the show prices will be $100

[00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:36.690]
Yeah, the bridge jumpers are all gonna be up for that. Yeah, and what do you say is he gonna go off you think one to nine one to five

[00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:39.830]
One to five and it's and we're supposed to get rain tomorrow

[00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:44.970]
Oh really now that should help because he ran in rain in the adurbie. Oh he runs on anything. Yeah

[00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:46.610]
He absolutely is

[00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:52.290]
He's run on eight different distances and eight five different race tracks and you know

[00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:56.990]
He doesn't seem to need to bring his race track with him. He's he's really a special horse

[00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:59.210]
I wouldn't be great though to see him run as a four-year-old

[00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:02.470]
Well, they were making overtures toward that the other day

[00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:05.570]
We're in some articles where they were saying you know they're gonna run him after the bell mod again

[00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:08.790]
Win or lose and then it's possible that they're gonna run him as a four-year-old

[00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:11.510]
I'd love to see that now a firm ran as a four-year-old because

[00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:17.010]
See that was great in the 70s not only did we get spoiled with three and almost four triple crown winners in one decade

[00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:23.030]
But we had horses that were running as four-year-olds too. Seattle slew. I remember beating a firm. I remember um

[00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.390]
A firm beating spectacular bid

[00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:28.550]
Those were some great times. Yeah, those were great races

[00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:31.470]
Really in the the heyday of racing. Yeah, and

[00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:38.950]
Acceler ran in a big race with with a firm and and Seattle slew I think oh boy there. Yeah, great matchups

[00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:44.210]
In fact the the affirmed aledar um triple crown. I don't think we'll ever see anything like that again

[00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:49.490]
That was my first derby my first calling of the derby really oh boy. What a way to start, huh?

[00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:54.790]
I can remember we're at the late chick Anderson calling the bell mod and he said we'll test these two to the wire

[00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:58.610]
Remember that yeah, and allodars got a lady put a nose in front right in the middle of the stretch in

[00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:03.410]
I always got the feeling that the public for whatever reason was rooting for aledar and I loved the firm

[00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:05.270]
I thought the firm was just a beautiful horse

[00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:11.270]
Aladar was favored in the in the Kentucky derby. Yeah, and uh, I think there was a lot of sentimental

[00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:18.550]
Attention towards to allodar because of the Mrs. Markey the very elderly woman at own Calum at the time

[00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:23.470]
Yeah, the old lady at the end of the year. Yeah, but at least she wasn't breathing oxygen out of a tubanonose though

[00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:25.350]
You know, we've done another step beyond that this time

[00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:28.930]
That's a little bit it's a little bit scary to watch him

[00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:33.430]
You know when the horse is in the stretch and pulling away like he didn't the preekness there and you just tell you

[00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:38.290]
Think of yourself. Please don't die now. Just don't you don't get too carried away. What you say it?

[00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:43.410]
Then why aren't you thinking that come on? I'm watching the race. I'm all over the race. I forgot about that

[00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:50.150]
Well, listen smarty Jones by 12 and the rock card 10 for my perfected you're gonna pick who for second

[00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.990]
It sounds like Eddington

[00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:56.450]
You know what I'll go with you've talked me into it. I'll bet how about let's go for the for the trifecta come on

[00:55:56.450 --> 00:56:01.690]
I mean, you know, uh, I'll take I'll take purge third who will you take who you want

[00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:05.650]
Why do you talk me to Eddington? So we can't pick the same thing. That's boring

[00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:11.750]
So I'll both pick smarty Jones and top of rock art 10. You'll pick purge third and I'll pick the eight Eddington third with Jerry Bailey

[00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:16.370]
Okay, just as long as we keep pat day out of there, but I don't want to go into that. I'll see you at the window

[00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:17.890]
Okay, thanks

[00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:20.890]
Like always great talking to you. Take care. Say how to Hank

[00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:22.250]
See ya

[00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:25.550]
There's Dave Johnson. We got the bell month tomorrow. It's pretty exciting

[00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:30.110]
Even George is all whipped up about it. I'm sure that he's running right now to places advanced bed at pompino park

[00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:31.810]
Hmm, what's that?

[00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:37.650]
And by the way, don't we have a uh, let me take a look at that one seemed to me because I'm sure that they got a special thing going on

[00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:42.130]
The pompino. I don't want to give anybody any free spots, but sure I do let me take a look at that copy

[00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:44.850]
Yeah, there's no spot on the log today Troy

[00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:49.030]
Did Troy make a entrance in our this morning or something? No

[00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:53.590]
Well, that's pretty embarrassing because I know darn well that they're supposed to be running a spot today

[00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:56.410]
And for some reason it didn't make it on the log. Now see this is one of the reasons

[00:56:56.410 --> 00:57:01.430]
The sclerano we don't have any business on ears because people that want to be running spots. They're not on the air

[00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:07.970]
You thought of what I'm saying. What do you say? That kind of makes it a little bit difficult to make any money when you got people clients

[00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:10.210]
To support because this copy even says on it

[00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:14.230]
6364 which is yesterday and today

[00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:18.490]
I'm gonna do the spot now and if they don't want to pay for it

[00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:21.030]
That's fine because it's not on the log and if they're not scheduled. That's okay too

[00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:24.890]
But I I know darn well that they want to promote this because they do it for all the fearful crown races

[00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:30.550]
It's a good thing we just did that thing with they because it saves our friends at pompino park from embarrassment and try my good friend too

[00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:34.090]
Man, what is wrong with that sales department very seriously? I know

[00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:36.590]
How long can this be? Oh, but uh,

[00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:38.210]
Cares, huh nobody cares

[00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:41.950]
Now nobody cares all I care about is oh well

[00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:45.250]
Will you do this for me when you do that for me like screw in and they're sucking around this morning

[00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:49.350]
She wouldn't if I was she knew I was gonna rip OJ and as she probably would have been standing out the hallway whispering

Mr Roger how you doing sir mr. caller. Hi, okay. I got one that probably should have made list

[01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:24.790]
But it didn't what about Anna Nicole Smith oh, I had a quote, but she's your favorite

[01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:25.990]

I got that you don't want to okay back in the day. I might have explained it to you, but you don't want us to just move right on

[01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:45.890]
We'll draw maybe a picture no no thanks

[01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:51.450]
I haven't had that much paper at any rate. Let's get her on you. Okay. I guess he likes her is there again

[01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:53.450]
Keep in mind. I just name a bunch of fat people

[01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:59.170]
I'm starting to catch on now. I'm a little slow. How many fat people?

[01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:04.550]
No, the question is who is your all-time favorite fat person dead or alive

[01:05:04.550 --> 01:05:07.790]
I you know, there's nobody's mentioned Rosie O'Donnell because no because everybody hates her

[01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:12.930]
In this audience anyway, nobody's mentioned Roseanne bar because probably everybody hates her like poison

[01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:14.510]
But I would like her

[01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:17.210]
John Goodman got a vote but not Roseanne bar

[01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:24.130]
There are so many so many fat people most of them did I how about Tony feels I'm not saying put around list

[01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:25.890]
But there was one Tony feels

[01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:31.230]
Who used to champion the idea that just like that book I was telling about the way you can be fat and nothing wrong

[01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:35.770]
We're being fat fat is beautiful. What is like Shirley tweeters with all that crap. I wonder if she's still alive

[01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:40.890]
I'm tired of trying here's that book right here big fat lies

[01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:47.950]
Learn the astonishing facts the truth about your weight in your health Glenn A. Gaser gas or it's a gas

[01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:55.910]
Takes on the fat phobia that permeates so much of the research about obesity and health and basically what he says is you can be fat and healthy

[01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.590]
Oh my god, right

[01:05:57.590 --> 01:06:02.310]
P in fact it says that right in the back jacket here it says people can be fat and fit

[01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:08.750]
There is no connection between flat fat-clarked auto-reason or auto-reason obesity thinner is not necessarily healthier

[01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:12.210]
But when you're using mistwiggy and and

[01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:15.950]
Karen Carpenter is a barometer. I guess it's not too tough to figure that out

[01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:22.790]
Good body fat protects you from heart disease. You can achieve a natural way without diet a dieting and dieting because you weight gain

[01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:28.930]
That's if you eat too many yo-yo shit yo-yo's and ho-ho's man that'll do it

[01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:34.870]
I'm really excited proud of myself that I got that pomp and o park spot on because I know it was supposed to run and probably was supposed to run yesterday too

[01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:41.290]
If maybe we'll have to run another make good later although I already tore it up five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty only

[01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:43.950]
AT&T and Verizon line WQA and hello

[01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:45.870]
How about dusty roads

[01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:51.450]
Dusty roads, okay. How about dusty roads? You want to put dusty roads on there or not? Sure. Why not?

[01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:52.030]
Sure. Why not?

[01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.670]
From my childhood. How about

[01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:57.230]
Not she not fat

[01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:59.930]
Although I'll tell you somebody who was pretty exotic

[01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:02.010]
Well, I wanted to wonder two times. I saw

[01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:05.690]
He kind of Randy want to be

[01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:14.630]
The bad one broke although she was far from my favorite. Hey, she's not a Randy road clone. That's what she said exactly sure

[01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:17.230]
WQA and hello

[01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:21.230]
Yes, or yes sounds like you

[01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.770]
Okay

[01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:25.590]
Right

[01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:31.290]
Who gonna be able to cut rustlers I for right all right. Hey stack Calhoun and WC fields

[01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:36.750]
Who had the right idea about little kids by the way just keep them shut up and just stuck them off in the room closet somewhere

[01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:38.870]
Get them out of my face and I'm with him on that

[01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:43.870]
After I hate little kids, I just don't want to be around them when they're screaming and carrying on and making a big fuss

[01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:49.750]
Especially like on an airplane things like that or like a like an enclosed space. It's not a good idea

[01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:54.150]
Right all right. Just about anywhere. Yeah, right keep them out of my face

[01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:55.630]
WQA and hello

[01:07:56.070 --> 01:07:59.030]
I have the wealthiest fact person for the rest. Yes

[01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:01.190]
Go ahead

[01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:07.550]
Oprah Wincree. Okay, that's a that's a good choice. I guess I guess if somebody out there will like her

[01:08:08.370 --> 01:08:10.930]
Quite frankly on issue we can't stand opera no

[01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:16.970]
Because she's uh she's talentless. She does nothing. There is the luckiest person on the face of the earth bar none

[01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:21.870]
I mean, I know you don't like Bill Gates, but at least he's you know, he did something somewhere

[01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:26.370]
So you know, stole other people's ideas. Oh, okay, but at least he did that given given that

[01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:31.790]
But what is she done? She showed them the spell her name back with there at the end of the show with her harmful productions

[01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:36.570]
What what is she done besides make those uh, she said girlfriend? Yeah, yeah girl

[01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:41.830]
You go girlfriend and just sit there and yuck it up and oh my god. It's just uh

[01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:46.150]
That's the reason that the women of America have just been lit on the garden path

[01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:50.190]
I would much rather than when we're watching Jerry Springer than Oprah any day of the week

[01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:52.810]
At least Jerry Springer's got some you know comic relief right

[01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:59.790]
But Oprah they're just a nothing there, but she's got her book list and the women are running out that they're racing to the store whatever Oprah says

[01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:05.370]
Brother based on what based on the fact that she's such a wonderful human being

[01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:10.230]
That she's so well-adjusted and uh married and would children or family and all of that stuff

[01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:12.490]
Maybe she's a dike you think?

[01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:16.570]
No idea and of course do we really care? No

[01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:19.870]
It's a disgusting thought WQM. Hello

[01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.850]
Yes, sir

[01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:25.030]
Speaking

[01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:36.910]
Yeah, I got a couple of um, thank you, yeah, I know you don't like rap but you're smart. It's one of them. Okay. Did he smalls? Yeah

[01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:41.210]
Okay, and the other one I'm thinking of Paulie from Goodfell

[01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:47.410]
Paulie from Goodfellos. Okay. What what's the actor's name?

[01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:49.210]
George

[01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:51.810]
Paulie from yeah, I can see him

[01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:56.010]
Big fat Paulie he was uh one of the uh, you know

[01:09:57.130 --> 01:10:02.350]
When they were all over Paul Sorbino Paul Sorbino, I guess that's who it is. Is that who played Paul?

[01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:07.390]
I don't I know he's talking to all these Paulies and all these Italian movies. I don't have them all straight

[01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:12.450]
Oh, you're no you're thinking about the wrong Paulie. That's it. I'm telling you you're thinking about the one I told you old man

[01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:14.090]
Paulie won't see him no more

[01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:17.950]
Yeah, say the wrong Paulie won't see him no more. I love it

[01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:23.350]
Seriously, I know that I'm obsessed with godfather, but it's just that

[01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:30.470]
Erie so every scene I mean it's so brilliantly written and done and I did read the book before I saw the movie the book was

[01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:32.630]
The book was even better than the movie which he usually is

[01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:41.090]
But every single scene every character every actor and actress every uh, I mean this is why godfather three took it really so bad and

[01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:47.570]
deservedly so because even though the story was powerful and really very compelling needed to be told them and a lot of really great stuff in it

[01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:51.450]
It's just that you there was no room for bad acting in the godfather's saga

[01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:59.650]
This is I mean it's like if you're you're having a great meal and you have a fantastic appetizer and a juicy delicious steak or

[01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:03.850]
Lobster son and then the dessert is a piece of crap you know the same right

[01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:09.490]
There's just no room for that if it if it has it has to be perfection you have to live up to that standard

[01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:11.690]
Which wasn't easy to do on a real budget on a shoe string

[01:11:13.090 --> 01:11:21.930]
But again five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line two men sue a legging abuse by seminarian

[01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:28.830]
Two Harris County Texas residents filed a civil lawsuit claiming that a Catholic seminary student molested them in the mid 90s

[01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:33.890]
When he was training at St. Francis to sales Catholic Church to be a priest oh my god

[01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:40.650]
The two unidentified men not 21 and 22 claim that Juan Carlos Patino Arango molested them when they were eighth graders at the Paris school

[01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:45.630]
According to the suit well listen he wanted to be a priest right? Yeah practice makes perfect

[01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:54.370]
Let's see

[01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:59.470]

Only 4995

[01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:28.710]
The international name registry was like a unique

[01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:31.190]

I tear almost cut us to my eye when I see him on her he's doing his book tour now

[01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:15.910]
Isn't it making you almost want to cry

[01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:22.570]
It's me very sad you know when that song by Ralph Donner you don't know what you've got until you lose it right

[01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:27.370]
Luke Castello somebody says for a poll as in uh, Abbott and Castello but Abbott

[01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:29.190]
Luke Castello as in who's on first

[01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:36.110]
What you never saw that routine who's on first? That's what I was saying what what are you going to say? Oh, I

[01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:39.910]
Well, it's a baseball thing so quite frankly. I thought maybe we were a little bit over your head

[01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:42.990]
You know how you're leading by the way. I played I don't watch

[01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:51.530]
Well, what does that mean? I know how to play the game. I just don't watch other people do it. Oh some people like to play and watch anyway speaking of that

[01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:52.490]
Uh

[01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:59.970]
One Carlos Patino Arango that's the way I just did uh, he's listed as a Florida a Tampa Florida resident. I just mentioned that in passing and

[01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:05.690]
A retired Roman Catholic priest in a former priest have been uh, I'll see here's the this is chopped off

[01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:07.190]
Have be man

[01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:12.570]
Who says they who say they sexually abused him when he was a boy a loss who was filed Tuesday against

[01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:18.010]
Moncini Thomas O'Brien now 77 and retired and Thomas M. Reardon. Is that really his name?

[01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:23.790]
162 left a priesthood in 89 several other men filed suits against him in January as well

[01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:30.110]
In the new lawsuit or plaintiff identified as John B. Doe also said the priest gave them something when he was a boy and they harassed him

[01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:31.870]
I in later years

[01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:37.310]
See it's in it would be interesting to see the rest of that story what's off the right side sometimes the last couple of words

[01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:41.350]
Are the most important ones, but unfortunately they don't have it to be here the man said they demanded

[01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:47.030]
Session acts from him between 1970 when he was 13 and something else uh, return Loni got from them

[01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:53.030]
The lawsuit also says they tried to blackmail him something something with information about mirror mal marijuana use

[01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:58.270]
Reardon is denied previous allegations for his attorney Matthew Rokiner and didn't return a call Wednesday

[01:14:58.270 --> 01:15:03.250]
O'Brien's also denied brand center. Sir you go all the priest stories all the time how many thousand

[01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:09.350]
30,000 of these episodes that we got so far and probably a whole bunch of many thousands others you won't hear from them

[01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:14.810]
You wonder why why because they already killed themselves. Oh, by the way speaking of it's not a priest

[01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:22.710]
But it's along those lines that just emailed you a story that somebody emailed to me. Yeah about about a radio host and kitty porn

[01:15:22.710 --> 01:15:24.390]
And it's one of these American families

[01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:27.570]
I am what is wrong with you

[01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:35.330]
Well, I told you that before the show started day although maybe I lost the story because I was going to start at the beginning of the story with that

[01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:36.970]
I got all right. That was hours ago

[01:15:38.770 --> 01:15:41.110]
Don't you remember I told you that he's from the American family

[01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:43.950]
That's the one. Sorry. Yeah, with uh, oh

[01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:47.950]
Brother, what did I do with that now? It's a good thing. Maybe it maybe it's a blessing

[01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:53.850]
No, seriously, maybe I lost it would be the first time I lost it. I lost it. I lost it. I got a pile of crap here

[01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:57.830]
Let's see. OJ blames the cool. I mean when you got a pile of crap

[01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:03.690]
There's junior sale again who's still doing his fag talk. Maybe we could put them on here a show called fagot talk

[01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:05.890]
I'm probably getting the 80s share in this town

[01:16:06.810 --> 01:16:07.990]
I just uh, I don't know

[01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:12.950]
Can't find it. So it's a good thing. Thank you whoever sent that to us because it's probably a psychic inspiration

[01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:16.150]
Thank you. No one that I screwed up. Maybe I already schmit can't it you know me

[01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:21.550]
I just have it a turn stuff up and making it disappear real fast which I'd love to do with scruan

[01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:26.210]
Terrible just uh, can't find it. So thank you profusely. I won't get to it

[01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:30.910]
Unless you want to read it. No, I don't have it open anymore. Oh,

[01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:32.230]
I'll close it

[01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:38.770]
Anyway, the enquirer didn't just report the story where he came a key part of it is within all this OJ heavy intensive stuff

[01:16:38.770 --> 01:16:41.930]
Nobody but nobody it says not that they're so serving you understand

[01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:48.010]
But nobody but nobody covered the OJ Simpson murder case like the enquirer our exclusives one after another

[01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:51.470]
We're so impressive that the media elite made the enquirers coverage a story in itself

[01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:59.750]
And one of our scoops was so important even changed the outcome of one of OJ's trials in our first story following the June 12 94 murders of Simpsons

[01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:01.030]
X-Watnikul and Ron Goldman

[01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:06.930]
We revealed how shaken the caller confided to therapist dr. Susan forwarder fears that OJ would kill her one day

[01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:10.370]
Remember dr. Susan forward? No, you know the story forward and backward. Oh

[01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:15.710]
Just reached after the double killing we revealed that Nicole and OJ fought by telephone today the murders and argument that may have

[01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:16.810]
Side her death warrant

[01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:22.670]
It wasn't until nearly nearly a year later that LA prosecutor charged the same thing in court papers the enquirers report

[01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:28.270]
Repealing at six weeks before the murders OJ purchased a knife believe to be the murder weapon made global headlines in

[01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:34.290]
November 94 the enquirer reported exclusively that DNA test revealed the blood of both victims in OJ's Bronco

[01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:38.090]
Oh, we know that Mark firm and just put it there. He just smeared it

[01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:43.330]
It was the most damning evidence against the former football started took two months for the rest of the media to catch up

[01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:45.770]
The enquirers publication of the Cole's heart-wrenching

[01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:51.410]
Diaries of her abusive OJ's hands brought praise from the media and thanks when they battered women's groups across America

[01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:57.110]
The enquirer even told the world how OJ bed girlfriend Paul Barbar be ready to marry him in jail while the trial

[01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:59.850]
I'm full today story later confirmed by Paul on national TV

[01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:05.890]
Now here's the part that I like to vest is them those ugly but ugly shoes those ass ugly whatever

[01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:07.530]
Like ugly right

[01:18:08.190 --> 01:18:12.070]
Molly don't know starting when you're a your a caveat on a need some serious work

[01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:19.730]
Anybody that was in I was talking to Van Diesel about that last week and he said man. You sure don't know you're my Molly

[01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:28.550]
Then an April 23rd 96 issue after Simpson's acquittal at his criminal trial the enquirer published a scoop of scoops

[01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:34.970]
A photo of OJ wearing the same rare shoes those ugly ass shoes left bloody footprints at the murder scene

[01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:40.870]
See all of these things are just a coincidence right. I mean black people just they're always railroaded for crap that they didn't do

[01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:47.130]
During a deposition for the civil suit Simpson had denied ever owning a pair of Bruno Molly's the expensive Italian designer shoes

[01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:53.650]
That had left the footprint but before the civil trial the enquirer conducted an exhaustive search reviewing thousands of photos of OJ

[01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:58.290]
Taken the year leading up to the murders when he was doing color commentary for professional football games

[01:18:58.290 --> 01:19:02.930]
That's color not colored commentary most of the photo showed Simpson only from the way stuff but

[01:19:03.850 --> 01:19:07.750]
The enquirer hid pager in a set of photos that captured Simpson full length

[01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:15.990]
Strolling through the end zone in the photo OJ is seen walking in full stride the soul of his Bruno Molly shoe in plain view

[01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:17.090]
a two

[01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:18.230]
frute

[01:19:20.650 --> 01:19:25.030]
The enquirer's story in a company photo became the key piece of evidence in OJ civil conviction February

[01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:29.250]
47 and his victims families were awarded a judgment of 33 and a half million dollars

[01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:33.330]
One of OJ's criminal defenders was heard breathing a sigh relief when the enquirer's story broke

[01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:36.390]
I'm just glad I didn't have to contend with that during the criminal trial. He murdered

[01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:37.950]
How do you like that?

[01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:43.150]
The enquirer's scoop's brought incredible praise from the established media New York Times

[01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:48.050]
Wall Street urinal and even the Columbia journalism review all published major stories acknowledging how the enquirer

[01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:52.830]
Be the rest of the competition and after the enquirer's shoe photo impact in the civil trial time magazine

[01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:58.970]
Evening the enquirer's editor is one of the 25 most influential people in america 97 and October 17

[01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:06.210]
OJ's girlfriend Christy Proto granted the enquirer a stunning world exclusive an even which he to reveal at Simpson had confessed to her about the

[01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:11.070]
Killings Christy told the enquirer OJ killed the call and he told me the details

[01:20:11.650 --> 01:20:12.650]
How do you like that?

[01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:17.030]
I mean we all know you done it

[01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:20.870]
He done it and I think that probably suicide would be an appropriate thing right now

[01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:26.650]
Davis on a lot more grief and you know the brown family and the golden family that can at least rest in peace

[01:20:26.650 --> 01:20:30.110]
Maybe one day before they go for their long dirt nap. Okay. OJ

[01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:34.370]
Just blow your brains out. All right, and I'm off already with your bull crap with your ego trip

[01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:37.730]
Make us all sick and as far as your TV show is concerned

[01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:44.310]
I have only one suggestion for OJ and that stupid TV show. Oh god about it. That's it. Nice going, Mo. Oh god about it right

[01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:49.750]
Piece of crap. No, if it was OJ being chased around by you know

[01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:54.910]
Cannibal pigmies or something. Yeah, then I mean for real like one of the rest of the rear. Yeah

[01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:58.990]
That's real life. That's the kind of stuff we would all say fear the OJ fear factor

[01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:04.530]
as OJ is chased by hippopotamai and alligators and wild animals through the

[01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:11.630]
Oh man, I can just see that take them up to the Everglades to the glades. Oh yeah, what are we back exactly the wild crock

[01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:13.350]

The president the whole world's covered in ice you think we made a mistake. I don't think so

[01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:00.950]
The president don't you think pollution was a factor?

[01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:03.570]
Curent simple. I believe

[01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:05.750]
I repeat

[01:23:08.010 --> 01:23:16.690]
Who's to blame for letting this happen on your watch mr. President Saddam Hussein was responsible the day after the day after tomorrow

[01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:18.530]
Then again, I don't have a lot of intelligence

[01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:26.350]
Oh, no kidding 1145 quoted noon and we got the mad dog to win a show at the hooters this afternoon two o'clock in a derail no less

[01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:31.130]
So here's that story and I'm glad they did send this because this is much more complete than the one that I lost anyway

[01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:34.210]
X radio executive time for Kitty porn

[01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:38.610]
Tuplo Mississippi a former official at American Family Radio

[01:23:38.610 --> 01:23:39.730]
Oh my god

[01:23:39.730 --> 01:23:45.510]
Which regularly warns listeners about the dangers of pornography muster 15 years in prison for producing child pornography

[01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:52.310]
In federal court in Aberdeen, Wednesday, US district judge Glenn Davidson sentence carried Dwayne Stevens 47 of Tuplo

[01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:59.830]
Who pleaded guilty to two council producing child pornography a law passed by congress last year requires a 15-year sentence for creating child pornography

[01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:00.430]
mandatory

[01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:07.970]
It's tragic for everybody involved said the Reverend Donald Wildman found her an executive director of the Tuplo based American Family Association

[01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:13.690]
Which started the fast growing Christian radio network. It's one of those things you wish had never happened his family was devastated

[01:24:13.690 --> 01:24:16.470]
What kind of a comment is that you wish it never would have happened?

[01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:20.370]
Isn't that that Donald Wildman that goes to the funerals of people who die of age?

[01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:21.830]
No, that's a Fred Phelps from

[01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:24.670]
Sorry, I get them all confused you got your right wing bigot's confused

[01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:31.250]
American Family Radio with more than 200 stations and 35 states fired Stevens who produced a children's show for the network

[01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:36.670]
Is director of the children's news but Wildman said the Association is up to support the family financially through the tragedy

[01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:42.210]
US Attorney Jim Greenley of Oxford praised the corporate cooperation of Tuplo police in the FBI in the case

[01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:45.870]
The citizens of Tuplo and the Mississippi should be glad to know that kitty porn

[01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:48.610]
Creators since his mr. Stevens are being held accountable

[01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:52.230]
He said Stevens must now register as a sex offender and submit DNA samples

[01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:56.110]
He must also take light detector test undergo sec after sec after treatment

[01:24:56.770 --> 01:25:05.230]
On August 23rd 2003 to California men running Steven's home during the Tuplo furniture markets spotted images of possible child pornography on a computer disc

[01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:08.530]
While searching for an empty disc. They turned the two discs over to Tuplo police

[01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:14.470]
Four days later police arrested Stevens who remarked he had a problem which child pornography but hadn't touched any of the children

[01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:19.750]
Now I'm curious because the other story had said that he took pictures of his daughter

[01:25:20.230 --> 01:25:21.590]
This one doesn't say that

[01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:25.270]
So like I said the other story was not as long been reloaded at any rate

[01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:29.350]
In a letter to US district representative Roger Wicker

[01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:34.790]
Stevens wrote I took my eyes off of Jesus for a moment and did something terrible

[01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:41.250]
I took some pictures of one of my daughter's friends. Why see suffice it to say that these pictures were for in various sleeping positions

[01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:45.650]
Let me hasten to wear that I never touched her person or are there any showing her face?

[01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:50.170]
No, was there any involvement with the internet? I did not do this for personal profit but from a dark sin

[01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:53.790]
Nor did I touch her because I didn't want to wake her and have her damaged

[01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:58.890]
Psychologically and truthfully I didn't want to take a chance of getting caught sounds like a scene from happiness

[01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:03.630]
I know what I did was wrong. Oh, how I wish I could simply undo what I've done

[01:26:03.630 --> 01:26:09.670]
But I can't he said the American Family Association which boosts most of it as more than two million members has made fighting pornography

[01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:15.770]
One of its top priorities. How do you like that? We don't want to say the word hypocrite. Do we know? No, oh come on say it

[01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:21.450]
Oh hypocrites liars the s art. It's just like Russian is let's put all those drug people in prison

[01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:22.750]
I tried him

[01:26:23.190 --> 01:26:25.310]
I separate him. I will still pop in dangerous people

[01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:27.490]

[01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:16.710]
Where a student had written in their yearbook

[01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:42.830]
This kid is actually a good kid. He did it as a truth or dare

[01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:46.630]
From a friend of his right and it was

[01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:56.170]

Well, I could always is right. Yeah, there you go. So that's the story

[01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:06.510]

In a bitter blow up with OJ Simpson his daughter Sydney exploded in the rage punching her father screaming I need to

[01:30:59.010 --> 01:31:01.770]
Then threatening to kill herself by driving off a bridge

[01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:07.810]
They've romantic confrontation came just days before 18-year-old Sydney's high school graduation from the prestigious

[01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:12.830]
Gulliver school at Gulliver School in Miami and was triggered by several things including Sydney's

[01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:19.810]
Angra her father after potentially overhearing his murder confession plus a new dispute with him over her college plans. She's hot by the way. Yeah

[01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:27.130]
The attack was the latest incident in a series of problems. Oh, and by the way, you know who else is incredibly hot is uh bushes

[01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:30.510]
Nice he has a nice. Yeah

[01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:36.050]
He's gonna be in some movie or something man. I didn't even know he had a nice while working on find her

[01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:40.270]
What's her name? How can he have a nice or maybe it's uh, I don't know

[01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:49.030]
Maybe it's a decent law. I don't know what it is. I'm talking maybe it's uh, uh, what's her name? Maybe she went into rehab

[01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:55.950]
She has daughter to well no well. Maybe no well had like a miracle cure or something. No this I don't know she was someone of the bushes

[01:31:56.510 --> 01:32:03.230]
And I'm not gonna even polish that. I know we can't see the attack was the latest incident in a series of problems involving OJ and Sydney is the

[01:32:03.230 --> 01:32:07.290]
Inquire reported in February of 2003 a terrified Sydney called 9-11

[01:32:07.710 --> 01:32:11.270]
And locked herself in her bedroom after Simpson exploded in the fit of rage

[01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:16.630]
What's more, Sydney was temporarily suspended from the gullible school for punching a fellow student in 2002

[01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:23.230]
And back what OJ and his children were living in L.A. Sydney physically attacked OJ's girlfriend Christy Prody pulling her hair and knocking her to the floor

[01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:30.090]
Poor Sydney's got a lot of problems. She gets angry and physically strikes out at her friends and family and insider said I can't imagine why

[01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:34.050]
The latest confrontation between OJ and Sydney was even worse than previous ones

[01:32:34.050 --> 01:32:38.990]
She had just exploded in our OJ. It was a very bad scene inside a reveal. Maybe she didn't want to go to Benny Hanna

[01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:43.850]
He told friends she and OJ were discussing her going to college

[01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:48.350]
OJ wanted to go to a school in Florida was willing to pay up to the 16 grand year has been paying for gulliver

[01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:50.850]
But he refused to pay anymore singing can't afford it

[01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:56.130]
That's something he's paying 16 grand year to send her to a private prestigious school, but they have

[01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:59.210]
Browns in a goldmins are still getting squat

[01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:01.310]
That's because he did not a dime

[01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:08.150]
That's why he came to Florida to hide his money and to play the old Florida game you miserable lying piece of crap you

[01:33:08.150 --> 01:33:12.050]
Gotta see this picture him you gotta go out and get this inquiry leaf through it in the supermarket

[01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:15.630]
Yeah, that is good as the other picture on that story we have online right now

[01:33:15.630 --> 01:33:20.250]
Not that good. Oh, and you notice nobody ever called about that. They're probably what he what is that

[01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:25.250]
Yeah, there's a picture of him here getting out of A it looks like he's getting out of a helicopter

[01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:28.230]
So I don't know maybe it's out of a SUV. I don't know

[01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:32.230]
And he looks really bad. Oh, right. Oh, that's good news

[01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:35.750]
Sydney has been accepted at Boston University has her heart said I'm going there

[01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:37.570]
But that cost is over 30 grand a year

[01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:42.730]
When he told her to ask Nicole's parents to do the Brown to release some of the money Nicole put in trust for Sydney

[01:33:42.730 --> 01:33:48.350]
She flipped out. She sharded and slammed doors screaming at OJ. I hate you. I'm running away. I can't stand this anymore

[01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:50.230]
I can't do anything. I want to do

[01:33:50.650 --> 01:33:55.330]
When OJ tried to calm her down sitting got even angrier punching him and slapping him you go girl

[01:33:56.090 --> 01:34:01.650]
Sources say there's a haunting reason why Sydney is an odds with her dad her family members believe Sydney actually overheard her father

[01:34:01.650 --> 01:34:08.650]
Confess to the murder of her mom Nicole and buried memories of his confession are resurfacing causing her rage and ongoing fights with OJ the inside of

[01:34:08.650 --> 01:34:09.090]
He's saying

[01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:13.430]
For a few days after the most recent attack OJ and Sydney didn't talk to each other

[01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:19.650]
She walked around the house depressed sometimes in tears finally she burst into uncontrolled anger with OJ saying she was gonna commit suicide

[01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:22.570]
She cried that if she has to stay in Florida

[01:34:22.570 --> 01:34:25.790]
Well, that's enough to make anybody commit suicide. She was gonna kill herself

[01:34:27.010 --> 01:34:30.110]
See even without OJ even if you don't even know who the hell he is

[01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:33.570]
If you have to stay in Florida that enough to make a lot of people just blew their brains out

[01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:37.230]
She said I'm gonna drive my car off a bridge and get it all over with

[01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:41.250]
I'll be dead like my mother another source disclosed OJ was shocked by his daughter suicide threats

[01:34:41.250 --> 01:34:46.550]
He's worried that she might actually kill herself. I got an idea. OJ. How about she just forgets about it? You give it a shot

[01:34:54.450 --> 01:35:04.730]
I'm from OJ and I like rubbing my smelly grilla ass with soap made from jewels and listening to the new roe

[01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:06.250]
Hey, I'm gonna eat the hour

[01:35:06.250 --> 01:35:06.990]

[01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:38.890]
I'm the only one still alive

[01:36:38.890 --> 01:36:40.470]
I don't like that just barely

[01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:41.850]
I

[01:36:41.850 --> 01:36:44.990]
The top five well that's because I ain't quite so fat no more

[01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:48.950]
Right, oh you said well back at iod. I was like I'm pushing 240

[01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:52.710]
Right right now 196 this morning, which isn't great

[01:36:52.710 --> 01:37:00.110]
But I mean it's not gargantuan like 240 is just a big old tub of crack of course when you have three different places bringing food in every day

[01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:00.690]
Right

[01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:04.990]
Well, I didn't start at iod that started big time in jail, but it continued there

[01:37:05.490 --> 01:37:08.950]
Zeta was brutal and of course it's Zeta, you know, you get up at four o'clock in the morning

[01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:15.350]
And you're in there by five thirty or five o'clock and you're eating you're eating lunch at seven o'clock in the morning

[01:37:16.150 --> 01:37:19.150]
And people wouldn't believe it, but we had like pizza hut

[01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:23.070]
Who now was it was what's his name's brother-in-law members, Olten and sales?

[01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:29.550]
It was his brother-in-law or father-in-law rather red was the guy's name good guy. How you know red? Hope he's still alive. No

[01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:34.830]
He's not I don't think so. Oh, I don't know. How do you know that? I don't know

[01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:39.270]
Well, why do you say that then? I think I don't think so either. Yeah, I think you're right

[01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:44.490]
But anyway, yeah, he he he was like a manager or one of the pizza huts or something or regional manager

[01:37:44.490 --> 01:37:49.450]
And he used to bring us all different kinds of pizzas and then we had a place where we people would bring us cheeseburgers

[01:37:49.450 --> 01:37:54.230]
Where the hell was that one place where we get these big gigantic cheeseburgers? There's unbelievable

[01:37:55.570 --> 01:38:01.030]
And then of course there was always ponytail. He was bringing in food. I mean people would actually for us get up early in the morning

[01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:04.410]
Restaurants they weren't nearly even open yet and they bring us all kind of food

[01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:09.070]
See because when you get up at four in the morning by the time it gets to like eight o'clock you're ready for lunch

[01:38:10.130 --> 01:38:16.450]
And we don't need breakfast at all and you're ready for like a brunch. Okay. It was just a bad thing and that I would need continued

[01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:22.650]
That's the great thing about here is that there ain't nobody bringing me no food. I got my refrigerator in the other

[01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:28.470]
You know about ten feet away, but I'm not going in there. I'm not to have a little bit of that microwave bacon before the show

[01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:32.230]
One thing I have discovered for all you diabetics out there who are not breakfast eaters

[01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:35.490]
Is that if you do eat some protein in the morning a little?

[01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:39.390]
Not a big breakfast, but just a little bit of protein like maybe some bacon or whatever

[01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:44.590]
It stabilizes your blood sugar much better throughout the day as opposed to not eating until later on like lunch right

[01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:50.470]
How about that? Yeah, that's you're supposed to eat something when you can't even know some of us don't like to

[01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:54.250]
Well, but I'm just saying for people that are diabetic especially because it tends to

[01:38:54.250 --> 01:38:59.130]
Level out your blood sugar better as opposed to having the big rises those big gigantic jumps etc

[01:38:59.130 --> 01:39:05.370]
Anyway, it's boring five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:39:05.370 --> 01:39:06.730]
We're just reminiscing back in the old

[01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:11.510]
Really fat days is opposed to now the moderately fat. Yeah, just one day

[01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:14.350]

Yes, it is eighty three bucks for a meal, but who cares about that? I got the big bucks. Is that is the worth Chris?

[01:39:46.150 --> 01:39:49.530]
Better wow. I would I would definitely say it's better

[01:40:20.590 --> 01:40:22.730]

Hey, I just I don't know I just am sour on all of those things don't do it don't do what food

[01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:36.810]
Well, what does that mean don't do food? Yeah, well, you know, you know what I mean

[01:40:37.410 --> 01:40:43.730]
Oh, I just I'm just now I'm no longer sold on uh, I know the South Beach style is just a ripoff of

[01:40:43.730 --> 01:40:49.950]
Andkins just a blatant grotesque ripoff with all those fancy artsy fartsy buddies of his to me that that's just

[01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:52.550]
Outrate in fact just whistle the two and I'm gonna get the book

[01:40:57.030 --> 01:41:02.070]
Of course, I was just saying to the wife here today how tired the residents are all these fat people talking about the addkins

[01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:06.670]
And South Beach guy is how one is similar to the other and what's the difference and who gives a one

[01:41:08.210 --> 01:41:10.530]
He fat lardos out there stop eating

[01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:14.090]
Go for a walk skip a meal go for a walk

[01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:18.250]
The rest of the real board the tears that always that hot

[01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:24.650]
What oh can't wait

[01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:27.870]
Now here it is

[01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:32.590]
Well, this is really criminal. Let's see how much canadian 35 bucks Canadian that's criminal

[01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:39.890]
Although it is comes out the same 2495 US. That's uh like Robert and the thing that pisses me off not only that this doctor

[01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:42.270]
Aguistan who's a Miami Beach guy

[01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:46.010]
And he's making a fortune it was number one in the earth times bestseller list

[01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:49.110]
You know because we're all desperate all of us fat people so as soon as some new

[01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:54.530]
Diet book gets hyped right away to millions and millions of us. Oh, we're gonna, you know, buy a book and lose weight

[01:41:56.190 --> 01:42:01.310]
But at any rate not only is he do that but this part in the back of the book where you know after all of the recipes

[01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:05.350]
Which lets face unless your gourmet chef nobody is gonna make these recipes, you know like

[01:42:05.930 --> 01:42:09.590]
Tuna cucumber and red pepper salad with lemonade dill dressing okay

[01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:11.830]
Moroccan grilled chicken

[01:42:12.850 --> 01:42:18.410]
We've got like 75 different ingredients unless you're like Paul Prudom or somebody like that. Oh, you're not gonna make these

[01:42:19.330 --> 01:42:24.510]
But the thing that really just frost my ass about you doctor Aguistan is this thing in the back of the book

[01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:28.070]
where you've got these uh plugs for all your favorite buddies with a restaurant

[01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:30.490]
So okay now the average person like in the buke Iowa

[01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:35.850]
Doesn't give a flying crap about macaluso's restaurant at 1747 Alton Root in Miami Beach

[01:42:35.850 --> 01:42:41.930]
Or their executive chef whose picture is in here and his recipe for mal macaluso style grilled veal with broccoli rape

[01:42:43.230 --> 01:42:46.730]
Huh whatever the hell that is so we've talked about that before a raid. I don't know what that is

[01:42:47.490 --> 01:42:51.610]
China grill Washington Avenue, I mean these are all his buddies and he's got recipes

[01:42:52.090 --> 01:42:54.990]
Recommended by these top chefs. Well, what who cares

[01:42:56.570 --> 01:43:02.330]
99% of the people who buy this book don't live anywhere near Miami Beach and I'm never gonna go to any of these places and he's got to stick

[01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:07.210]
These guys in here to give a here's the roomy supper club on Lincoln Road, Miami Beach roast chicken with sweet garlic

[01:43:07.210 --> 01:43:09.250]
Milled onion sour it sound like crap anyway

[01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:15.670]
Really pisses me off don't buy the South Beach diet book okay. That's my recommendation if you want to go out and buy the addkins

[01:43:15.670 --> 01:43:20.750]
At least with addkins they's got like uh, you know addkins made easy little paperback thing

[01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:27.150]
Yeah, because everybody their brother ripped them off the guy croaked and then right away they all hopped on his grave

[01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:34.230]
Here's the story about that yearbook students that keep a skin elementary will have to hand over their yearbooks today to have a message of hate removed

[01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:41.370]
An eighth grader wrote an anti-semitic remark in German in the comments section. No misspell translated it means death to the Jews

[01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.450]
Oi

[01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:47.970]
About 450 copies of your book already have been distributed by the time a parent noticed the phrase and contacted the school

[01:43:47.970 --> 01:43:52.910]
It's surprising that it would slip by but in this case it did say John Schuster of i mi date county schools

[01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:56.290]
Students already had their yearbooks were told to rip out of page 66

[01:43:56.290 --> 01:44:01.790]
Which is where the words appear school principal doctor and rascos also send letter home to parents in part at reads

[01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:04.970]
In spite of careful editing to ensure that everything printed in the

[01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:10.870]
Memory book is proper and good taste some inappropriate material slip by us the eighth grader thought to be responsible

[01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:14.850]
Has been suspended for the rest of the school year which ends next week. Well, that's not a big deal

[01:44:14.850 --> 01:44:17.490]
Although let's see his an eighth grader. So he's not going to graduate anyway

[01:44:17.490 --> 01:44:19.530]
I don't like put a stain. It'll put a mark

[01:44:19.530 --> 01:44:22.430]
You know, unlike the guy said maybe it was in the case as it was a deer right?

[01:44:22.890 --> 01:44:25.830]
Yeah, that's what they say they should put a mark on that kid like with a brand

[01:44:26.610 --> 01:44:30.670]
Random okay, like maybe a pink triangle something like that on his forehead, okay

[01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:35.990]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT see I don't

[01:44:36.610 --> 01:44:39.390]
There's one thing to be a smart ass, but you take it to another level

[01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:43.310]
And that's the problem with too many of these kids everybody wants to outsmart ass the other one

[01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:49.070]
You know if you're gonna be a smart I put a dirty phrase in there, you know, yeah, put something really filthy in German. Okay, kids love that

[01:44:51.210 --> 01:44:55.870]
Then all the goody two shoes are all better. Oh my god. What kind of kind of filthy? Yeah, and would be great

[01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:59.250]
That's a kind of controversy. We'll sink our teeth in it. So let's speak have a good yuck

[01:44:59.250 --> 01:45:08.150]
Yeah, all-time favorite fat person dead or alive John Candy 135 Jackie Gleason 77 Chris Farley 65 John

Can't even square. Oh, I had no idea. Yeah, today's the day

[01:45:42.230 --> 01:45:46.390]
When they rose up and we ran to their support and helped them overthrow their oppressors

[01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:49.910]
We're not in the nation building

[01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:53.650]

Hello, Mia. Yes, sir

[01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:15.690]
Mia? Yes

[01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:19.630]
Offer your list. You should be ashamed. I can't believe you left them off. I bought Michael Moore

[01:46:20.690 --> 01:46:25.170]
Michael Moore is sensational. You're right. We're embarrassed and humorily then and we apologize profusely

[01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:29.010]
Is it going to be ever going to come out new June 25th?

[01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:32.290]
It is going to be about June 20th. It's all right. Can't wait. You can go to my

[01:46:32.290 --> 01:46:36.410]
You too go to michaelmore.com although last time I checked it

[01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:40.830]
It was still like overloaded and they were they took the trailer for the movie off of there because there was just so many hits on it

[01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:43.930]
It was just getting blown. I never did get it to work. Did you? No

[01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:47.170]
Well, that's because there was just too much traffic on air and just too much demand

[01:46:47.170 --> 01:46:50.750]
But the movie we had at Serenia's day will be in the theaters June 25th. Oh

[01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:52.530]
Everybody will see Fahrenheit 9-11

[01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:54.970]
The truth really start really seeping out

[01:46:55.870 --> 01:47:00.810]
All these books coming out this summer. I think the what's your what's his name? Larry flintbook is going to come out

[01:47:02.890 --> 01:47:05.930]
So see more herch his book is coming out as well

[01:47:06.710 --> 01:47:08.930]
In the fall before the election just in time

[01:47:11.670 --> 01:47:16.590]
All of these things as you watch just everything just crumbling around this bunch of neo-fascist

[01:47:16.590 --> 01:47:20.890]
Bastards as well exactly what they are in fact maybe one of them wrote that stuff in the yearbook

[01:47:20.890 --> 01:47:21.430]
My

[01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:24.930]
I was saying in the neo-fascist

[01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:36.110]
Oh, what's the problem opposite deploy from the vehicle

[01:47:38.130 --> 01:47:43.730]
If you're caught driving without a seatbelt you will be removed from your car and shot

[01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:49.210]
The police now have the authority to enforce seatbelt safety under the new Patriot Act 2

[01:47:49.210 --> 01:47:53.210]
The new laws in effect now so click it or be shot

[01:47:53.930 --> 01:48:01.330]
Officers don't like doing this. They are only following orders. It's for your own protection in the never-ending fight against terrorism

[01:48:01.330 --> 01:48:03.670]
Terrorist acts such as mouth noise

[01:48:04.930 --> 01:48:06.850]
Herping and fighting

[01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:12.930]
But be annoying to others. So under Patriot Act 2 eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants

[01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:17.690]
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot

[01:48:18.690 --> 01:48:20.030]
It's the law

[01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:24.650]
We like saying that the law the law

[01:48:25.190 --> 01:48:25.970]
The law

[01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:31.850]
The law and just to show you that practice makes perfect isn't a better edit

[01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:37.310]
It's a special day here. It is the world when the screaming gaze

[01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:45.210]
Meet the rest of the girls in the closet no more. That's what day day is for it's a day day after all

[01:48:45.210 --> 01:48:53.410]

In the closet no more that's what day day is for it's a day day after all

[01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:26.890]
It's a day of fun when we wear red shirts and when we all

You can hear the squirts we can tick go and tease with our manicure go tease is a day day after all

[01:49:35.850 --> 01:49:38.730]
I see what's that a big improvement wonderful much better

[01:49:38.730 --> 01:49:43.490]
Well, see I can't delete the old ones in here for obvious reasons because they weren't put in from on this end

[01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:47.990]
If I can say that so yeah have to be real careful on it like that one day a star plan a building

[01:49:48.690 --> 01:49:50.510]
All right, this ain't the right one

[01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:54.990]
I wouldn't have been able to recoup from that one just like that. Let's say that anyway here

[01:49:54.990 --> 01:49:59.110]
Kathy says fat Elizabeth Taylor for our poll. Okay Kathy you got it

[01:50:00.570 --> 01:50:04.970]
Here's a now do you know there's a new Batman movie coming out? I have been hearing rumors

[01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:11.930]
Well rumors about what Bruce and Bruce and Robin those are the old rumors

[01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:16.830]
He was his ward not as pedophile anyway, it says think you know Batman think again

[01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:22.390]
The highly anticipated action flick Batman begins tells the Cape Crusaders origins in a brand new way

[01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:28.330]
That cast him is a darkened conflicted good guy who nearly goes bad and inquire has an exclusive sneak peak

[01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:33.110]
Take a peak the thrillings of the thriller starring Christian Bale

[01:50:33.810 --> 01:50:38.170]
Who looks a lot like you know he looks like who does he look like he looks like an identical twin

[01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:42.730]
This one picture is trying to hard to tell identical twin of our old friend Brian Andrews

[01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:46.570]
From channel seven out of channel four or 90 wherever he is

[01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:48.610]
Is that amazing or what?

[01:50:49.150 --> 01:50:52.230]
Okay, and of course when you look at Brian Andrews you really think of

[01:50:52.230 --> 01:50:56.410]
Batman saying hey boy, what's that in your mouth? Not really. I think a can't wait Christian

[01:50:56.410 --> 01:51:01.430]
Bale will set around the guilt written young Bruce Wayne aka Batman as he struggles to cope with his parents murders

[01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:05.570]
And is tempted by the dark side under the tutelage of master criminal Ross Aboul

[01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:11.650]
This movie will explain how young Bruce Wayne transformed from a spoiled rich kid into a cram fighting legend

[01:51:11.650 --> 01:51:17.010]
And like Luke Skywalker in Star Wars is almost seduced by the forces of evil a source tells me inquire

[01:51:17.010 --> 01:51:21.190]
The film throughout the summer of 2005 I have to wait a year

[01:51:21.190 --> 01:51:26.630]
We'll explain Batman's fascination with bats and the origin of the bat cave and also explore the pivotal ever

[01:51:26.630 --> 01:51:32.330]
Event of Bruce's life the night his father Thomas and other Martha are gunned down by a mugger right in front of eight year old Bruce

[01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:34.790]
As an adult Bruce plans to murder his parents killer

[01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:37.470]
But ultimately realizes that the only way to avenge his parents is

[01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:42.350]
Is a force for good who must stop Ross Agu from destroying Gotham city

[01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:47.530]
Batman begins as a roller coaster ride from start to winces the source. It's the piece of the Batman puzzle

[01:51:47.530 --> 01:51:50.150]
That's been missing well. I probably could live without it

[01:51:50.150 --> 01:51:54.270]
But it's there if we do one or not. I could live without all the other ones. Let's hope this one doesn't suck

[01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:59.690]
Yeah, the movies. I mean the TV show we love right nobody don't like the Batman that the way sure

[01:51:59.690 --> 01:52:04.590]
You can even find it. I want to your retro channels. Yeah, that's always on it periodically. Yeah

[01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:10.850]
But the Batman and movies have all sucked big time each and every one of them on your what anybody says they've all been really

[01:52:11.230 --> 01:52:15.510]
In fact, it was one where there was wasn't even any Robin wasn't there? No, I'd like to argue with you

[01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:17.230]
But you're right, so I won't

[01:52:18.190 --> 01:52:23.330]
What do you mean by that they all sucked? Yeah, no, but I'm saying it was one where there was no and not even a Robin

[01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:28.630]
Well like the first couple I think had no Robin. Oh, well, what is that? What's Batman without Bert Ward? Anyway

[01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:33.250]
Lean detective reveals police police evidence. Oh, Jay. Jury never heard

[01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:39.430]
Yeah, the cause of getting pretty a week as this point once we start getting those people in here. You know that they're out of material

[01:52:41.630 --> 01:52:45.250]
So now I've got like about how many stories about third man

[01:52:45.250 --> 01:52:48.130]
This oh Jay business because there's one thing about South Florida man

[01:52:48.130 --> 01:52:53.110]
We can't express enough hate and discussing contempt for oh Jay to satisfy some of us at least I feel that way

[01:52:53.110 --> 01:52:56.950]
Just nausea than we've voted not not even so much by him

[01:52:56.950 --> 01:53:03.870]
But by the psycho fans the in fact this punk that called before what at the story how coming it was a guy asking for his autograph

[01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:10.370]
Always if Chuck Manson would have walked in there with you. Oh Charlie. Can I have your autograph? Yeah, actually

[01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:12.410]
How about Ted Bundy could we gotten him to sign

[01:53:13.410 --> 01:53:16.190]
Somebody's dress before they put them in the big house everything

[01:53:16.190 --> 01:53:21.370]
Has gotten like love letters while they were in prison. Oh, I know that every

[01:53:21.370 --> 01:53:23.930]
Everyone was slime-bothered for children. Right

[01:53:24.670 --> 01:53:26.970]
And of course don't forget them and his brothers right

[01:53:27.930 --> 01:53:32.670]
One of them was married. I think twice while in prison. I believe but anyway. Yeah, he has a wig, you know

[01:53:33.330 --> 01:53:37.990]
No, that's Eric and anyway if I can get to this eventually. I'll keep going because it'll kill it

[01:53:39.930 --> 01:53:44.670]
Retired LAPD lead homicide detective Tom Lang is step forward to reveal the inquirer

[01:53:45.210 --> 01:53:50.910]
Never before disclosed details of the oh Jay Simpson case including the shocking truth about the glove that didn't fit

[01:53:50.910 --> 01:53:52.950]
And how the prosecution blew the case

[01:53:53.770 --> 01:53:58.710]
Lang 59 joined the department in 1967 and spent 22 years as a homicide detective

[01:53:58.710 --> 01:54:03.990]
Where's that homo side he was notified of this home about the Simpson murders and arrived at the murder scene about 4.30

[01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.550]
And a.m.

[01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:11.550]
During oh Jay's infamous slow speed chase and that was another thing that just nauseated me those those morons go oh Jay

[01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:15.710]
You go those people needed to be shot. What the hell is wrong with people anyway

[01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:23.110]
Man it is the this hero worship this hole not just with jocks, but movie stars you name it

[01:54:23.850 --> 01:54:28.990]
It's it's a sickness the likes of which you just can't even describe. What's that all about

[01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:36.270]
Lifeless people low self esteem. I have no life. Oh no sense of self-worth during the slow speed chase

[01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:42.170]
It was lying her first contact that Simpson by a cell phone assumed the role of crisis negotiator and talked him in the surrounding two police

[01:54:42.650 --> 01:54:48.910]
The veteran detective who retired in 1996 now runs his own private investigative firm and conducts fraud investigations for an insurance company

[01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:55.010]
Detective Lang offers several startling revelations about the oh Jay case exclusively for the inquirer

[01:54:55.630 --> 01:54:56.050]
question

[01:54:57.830 --> 01:55:01.310]
What happened to the murder weapon bloody clothes and shoes answer

[01:55:02.250 --> 01:55:06.310]
Seven months after the murders a witness came forward and said that he had seen oh Jay and at the airport

[01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:08.790]
I'm not out of the murder. He was taking a late flight to Chicago

[01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:14.210]
The witness said that he saw oh Jay take his arm out of a trash receptacle put his hand in a flight bag

[01:55:14.210 --> 01:55:15.830]
And again put his arm into the receptacle

[01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:18.510]
That's where he dumped the bloody evidence that would have convicted him

[01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:19.930]
We learned that from garbage

[01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:23.890]
From those receptacles that the airport would have been uh, let me say it again

[01:55:23.890 --> 01:55:28.310]
We learned that the garbage from the receptacles of the airport would have been sent to one of two community dumps

[01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:29.250]
After almost eight months

[01:55:29.250 --> 01:55:33.270]
It would have been impossible to search through all that garbage the jurors never got to hear that information

[01:55:34.170 --> 01:55:35.910]
Question why didn't the glove fit

[01:55:36.970 --> 01:55:42.110]
Answer the glove did fit my partner Phil van Adder's hands were bigger than oh Jay's and he could get the glove

[01:55:42.110 --> 01:55:45.430]
There had been some blood some shrinkage from all the blood in the test

[01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:47.090]
But with a bit of work he could have gotten it on

[01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:52.370]
Additionally had on late test love to protect the evidence and that makes it more difficult to put a pair of gloves over them

[01:55:52.370 --> 01:55:57.850]
Remember this guy's an actor not a good one, but an actor just the same. It should have been done in chambers. It would have fit him

[01:55:59.530 --> 01:56:04.850]
Question yeah, do you remember the way he was tugging like oh who you have his fingers all spread out like he uh, yeah

[01:56:05.710 --> 01:56:10.410]
Question why didn't prosecutors end into a evidence oh Jay's attempt to flee in the white Ford Bronco answer

[01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:13.110]
I believe they felt they had sufficient case with the DNA only a

[01:56:13.110 --> 01:56:18.010]
So why take a chance and putting on evidence that was put together and obtained by the police because the police were on trial

[01:56:18.010 --> 01:56:22.950]
The prosecutors realized that from the Rodney King case the police were on trial so why getting bit with the police

[01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:25.610]
They were wrong in a murder case. You can never have too much evidence

[01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:31.050]
Question why wasn't oh Jay arrested or released a minimum held upon his return from Chicago

[01:56:31.770 --> 01:56:36.290]
Answer there was insufficient evidence to arrest him when he we questioned him when he returned from Chicago

[01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:39.750]
The blood evidence hadn't come back yet. In fact the blood evidence was still being collected

[01:56:40.150 --> 01:56:42.250]
We interviewed him and saw the cut on his finger

[01:56:42.250 --> 01:56:43.590]
It's on his left hand

[01:56:43.590 --> 01:56:46.990]
We knew the blood tailing away from the crime scene was on the left side of the foot impressions

[01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:50.150]
That was all consistent but not a bit enough for probable cause

[01:56:50.150 --> 01:56:54.210]
Did you even know that that the blood was lying on his left uh, you see that no

[01:56:55.670 --> 01:57:01.030]
Question why did prosecutor marsher Clark put detective Mark Furman who was known to be a loose cannon on the stands

[01:57:01.050 --> 01:57:05.650]
Answer she felt compelled to do that if she didn't it would have looked as if we were trying to hide him

[01:57:05.650 --> 01:57:09.170]
He was the one who found the glove was caused the search warrant of OJ's rocking and property

[01:57:09.170 --> 01:57:14.130]
Initially none of us knew of the existence of the tape or firmman repeatedly used the N word when defensive attorney

[01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:17.210]
L'Effley Bailey asked Furman if he'd used the N word in last number of years

[01:57:17.210 --> 01:57:19.290]
Everybody in the world knew he was being set up

[01:57:19.290 --> 01:57:23.350]
If he had said that he used the word and regretted it as anyone would that would have been the end of it

[01:57:24.850 --> 01:57:30.970]
Question why did former LAPD detective Mark Furman deny saying the N word which was proved only that he was a liar and persuaded the jury

[01:57:31.050 --> 01:57:33.530]
Not to believe anything he said answer because he's arrogant

[01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:37.870]
He was the only one in the world who didn't know he was being set up by the defense

[01:57:37.870 --> 01:57:42.170]
He was inexperienced and high profile cases, but it was his arrogance that did him in question

[01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:49.230]
Did marsher Clark and co-proncuted or Chris Darden's flirting and joking with one another affected jurors and ultimately the case

[01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:54.330]
Answer where there was never anything to show that laughing nothing about if that happened between them

[01:57:55.150 --> 01:57:55.590]
laughing

[01:57:56.430 --> 01:58:02.630]
Question why did the guilt our setting move the case from Santa Monica where it should have been tried to the downtown courthouse

[01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:05.950]
Answer my personal belief is that it was for political considerations

[01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:11.750]
We believe that certain persons in the DA's office met with the OJ defense team and they were concerned that if there were a conviction

[01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:13.590]
There might be riots in the street

[01:58:13.590 --> 01:58:17.030]
Considering that there had been riots after the Rodney King case. There was real concern

[01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:23.290]
Question why did judge Edo sequester the jury for almost a year answer who knows why he did that

[01:58:23.290 --> 01:58:27.850]
But he panted of the jurors too much whatever they asked for he gave them he didn't hold them to a standard

[01:58:27.850 --> 01:58:31.150]
They didn't follow his instructions. They were told to liberate and two and a half hours

[01:58:31.150 --> 01:58:32.790]
They did they come back with a verdict nonsense

[01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:37.630]
They didn't follow the evidence and the jurors relatives who visited them every weekend fill them in on what was in the media

[01:58:38.410 --> 01:58:38.810]
lovely

[01:58:39.670 --> 01:58:41.130]
Justice is served baby

[01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:48.670]
Bronco driving buddy a a C-speak for the OJ daily. Do you know that?

[01:58:49.090 --> 01:58:54.230]
No, I did not. Decade after OJ Simpson's infamous flight from justice in that white-forward Bronco with best friend A C

[01:58:54.230 --> 01:58:57.450]
Countings behind the wheel the two bodies still get together and A C still does the driving

[01:58:58.330 --> 01:59:01.430]
Even though OJ lives in Miami and A C's in Malibu, California

[01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:07.710]
They had a reunion march 11th at the Luxembourg Hotel when OJ was in LA to work on that reality TV pilot show called you been juiced

[01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:12.470]
OJ was waiting at the lobby bar when his old pal A C walked in said and I witnessed they chatted

[01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:15.410]
Then they went off the dinner and A C drove just like the old times

[01:59:15.850 --> 01:59:18.830]
And people running in the streets going you go OJ you go

[01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:24.330]
On June 17, 1990 four more than 95 American a million

[01:59:25.230 --> 01:59:30.950]
Millicans Americans were glued to their TVs watching the white Bronco as OJ and A C led an army of police on a slow-speed chase

[01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:35.670]
OJ was safely taken into police custody as Brent would mention A C was arrested on suspicion of

[01:59:35.670 --> 01:59:37.910]
Aiding a fugitive, but in the years since then

[01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:43.690]
A C has never publicly talked about what happened during that tense standoff despite rumors that OJ confessed to him in the car

[01:59:44.290 --> 01:59:47.690]
And that unwavering loyalty is why the childhood buddies are still best friends

[01:59:47.690 --> 01:59:52.630]
There is close now as ever even though they're on opposite coast said an insider A C's a busy executive with billionaire

[01:59:52.630 --> 01:59:54.230]
B Wayne Hughes company public storage

[01:59:54.230 --> 01:59:57.830]
But he and OJ talk on a phone two three times every day these guys are like brothers

[01:59:57.830 --> 02:00:00.570]
So at this point how many people as you confess to

[02:00:00.570 --> 02:00:01.590]
Not third man

[02:00:01.590 --> 02:00:03.530]
I'm not gonna look all this

[02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:05.190]
He's five six eight

[02:00:05.190 --> 02:00:06.490]
The radio's all yours

[02:00:06.490 --> 02:00:08.810]
Thank you Ian

[02:00:10.690 --> 02:00:11.150]
I'm

[02:00:14.710 --> 02:00:15.170]
Here

[02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:23.410]
Oh

[02:00:29.170 --> 02:00:32.410]
You like that? Yeah, I guess this is the love channel where I join

[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:35.100]
Yeah

[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:38.360]
All right

[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:42.220]
So when you have a cheap board this is the greatest

[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:51.880]
Was an sagittal man, well, I guess I have to find the disc book that I'm not gonna bother and any right there before we do that

[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:57.140]
Former senators offer harsh assessments of nation security. Here's one of our bed times. There is a needs to be read

[02:00:59.040 --> 02:00:59.760]
Okay, okay

[02:00:59.760 --> 02:00:59.760]

[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:08.500]
The next terrorist attack is coming in the United States as far from prepared two former senators who are experts in Homeland Security movement said yesterday

[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:16.620]
Myself my hair is on fire said former senator Gary Hart burrowing a phrase recently popularized by former White House counter terrorism chief Richard Clark

[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:22.060]
I for one think it's only a matter of time before an attack happens again in a devastating way

[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:26.680]
former senator Warren Rudman said the two spoke at a McGraw Hill Homeland Security conference

[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:30.920]
Hart a Colorado Democrat and Rudman a Republican from New Hampshire

[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:35.320]
oversaw commission that warned of imminent terrorist attacks prior to 9-11-2001

[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:40.660]
He said they tried unsuccessfully early in the administration to meet with President Bush and vice president

[02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:43.040]
Cheney they did meet with national security advisor

[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:47.740]
Combo Lee's a rice secretary state colon Paul and the threat secretary Donald Rumsfeld

[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:51.700]
But the ex-Senator said that beyond being respectful and taking notes little happened

[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:57.680]
Hart urged the public and private sector attendees not to fall into the Washington trap of gauging nations

[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:00.200]
Preparation by the amount of money being spent

[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:06.900]
Hart also criticized the administration of a report that shared database between the FBI and the custom service would not be operational until

[02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:08.420]
2008 that is

[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:10.380]
Unacceptably said we can't wait

[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:15.400]
Both senators said the federal government should act at home more like it's engaged in war

[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:21.680]
Hart said tax cuts should be curtailed on the private sector which controls most of the nation's critical infrastructure should be commanded to

[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:27.920]
Secure assets under wartime conditions what bothers me is the rhetoric of the administration doesn't match the performance he said

[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:33.900]
Some of the Hart-Rubman reports recommendations included investing more in domestic security and in math and science education

[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:38.500]
Which Hart said hasn't been done. They also urged the reorganization of national security

[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:43.520]
Congress and fighting ways to attract the best people to government the recommendations to create a domestic security

[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:45.420]
Department initially was opposed by Bush

[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:52.800]
Rodman criticized policy makers for being driven by events rather than foresight and said congress has seated too much power to the white house

[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:57.680]
He said the government's poured money into air travel security because the attack used that means

[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:00.760]
But if the attack had come out of seaport the spending would have been there instead

[02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:07.440]
He said the top priority should be to provide first responders basic equipment and allocate funding the localities based on threats

[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:08.140]
Not population

[02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:12.860]
Rodman says the presence creation of the terrorist threat integration center helped unactive

[02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:19.000]
disparate intelligence bodies he said he favors basic standards for chemical plants nuclear facilities and cyber security

[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.780]
Both senators said they backestablishment of the house and senate committees with permanent oversight of the new department

And set another chairman would have to relinquish your addiction

[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:31.680]
Rodman warned the policymakers. I think there'll be held a pain this country politically if something happens

[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:34.040]
And they're saying something's going to happen

[02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:35.740]
How do you like that

[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:38.280]

I'm not what I've seen. I mean what is that picture and it's still there

[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:28.940]
I checked a little while ago on the New York Post the website to see if they changed it if it was an error

[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:35.380]
Yeah, it is bizarre. We haven't had anybody guess at it or make a suggestion

[02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:40.680]
I guess it's just a mistake a newspaper making a mistake. Oh my god could be him

[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:03.740]
So maybe it's just a mistake

[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:07.640]
Not a mistake. Whose papers don't make no mistakes like the arrow for example

[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:15.300]
WQAM hello. Yeah, that picture is one of the stunts he does to choose the people that says that the costume he's wearing when he does it

Yeah, I think we've all been juiced

[02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:38.980]
Oh man freshly squeezed. Oh, I feel like it's been squeezed

[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:42.420]

He's dead. Okay, thank you Bob Keeshin. We want to put Captain Kangaroo put it on or whatever you like that

[02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:57.240]

Yeah, he wasn't you right. He wasn't one of these big you five people here

[02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:05.800]
You know these these people are starting to like a lose the perspective on us

[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:12.660]
We're talking about big gigantic fat people not just people with a little bit of a punch everybody in America's got a punch even kids

[02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:14.760]
Not got a punch everybody's got one of those

[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:18.660]
Even Kangaroo's got one. I've got a punch and Judy good

[02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:26.860]
But you know this idea that the people are a little bit Charlie are fat. We're talking about big gigantic humongous

[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:29.780]
You liked outblown. Oh boy right

[02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:34.100]
WQAM hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing?

[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:39.880]
Hey, I have to get you off the subject, but you were talking about the chefs and all that. Yeah, you remember Jess Smith

[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:43.220]
He's a progo ball man. Whatever happened to him the fruity girl man

[02:06:43.220 --> 02:06:49.360]
I remember the head of the real man. Now, now that you mentioned it. I wonder if that bit is one that we can still play

[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:51.380]
Probably not I think it is

[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:55.780]
Is it what does that call? I don't know. He went to he went to jail

[02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:04.320]
To where he's a child molester. He went to jail. What's this real man? What is this real man? Just miss I thought it was

[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:07.480]
The fruity gourmet was a child molester that

[02:07:09.860 --> 02:07:11.340]
Oh my god

[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:25.460]
There you go. You know, you know, you know, you never know. Never know. Thank you. No, I have a nice figure. Look at it. It's called frugal gourmet

[02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:29.420]
The frugal gourmet. I love that show too. Let's see

Hey little man. I have some lovely sausage for you

[02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:48.860]
The frugal gourmet cooks Chinese

[02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:51.420]
Today I want to make some young guy

[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:54.940]
And of course the frugal gourmet cooks Greek

[02:07:56.900 --> 02:07:57.500]
Oh

[02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:03.760]
Yes, it's your warm and fuzzy old friend the frugal gourmet like you've never seen him before

[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:06.940]
He may be frugal with his money, but not with his thoughts

[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:14.600]
The frugal gourmet cooks with boys only 1995 the video store near you and don't forget coming next fall

[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:17.580]
It's the frugal gourmet cooks with malt liquor

[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:21.260]
I'm Michael Jackson beat him to that one. I think

[02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:25.640]
That Jesus Jews. Yeah, the fruity gourmet. I love that show. Did you ever watch it?

[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:30.620]
No, now because you know like cooking shows correct you just like that stupid ass iron chef

[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:35.820]
That's the comedy show I see no, but the frugal gourmet you wouldn't have appreciated as much because he had like

[02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:38.460]
A lot of scenes from Italy. That's why I love that show

[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:42.440]
The Italian food which I'm crazy about but a lot of it filmed on location in Italy

[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:49.120]
What can only imagine who he was doing? I mean what he was doing there isn't the idea of a cooking show to actually learn how to cook something and then actually doing it yourself

[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:50.080]
Not necessarily

[02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:55.100]
No, and not only that but you're not a fat person see us fat people were so obsessed with food

[02:08:56.100 --> 02:09:03.360]
That's a no you're wrong. You're absolutely wrong. Okay, you know you're laughing, but it's the truth that just in there watching it kind of like

[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:07.960]
You know this in this elevation process starts in like your mouth is watering like yeah

[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:12.680]
You take your pants off to watch those shows. No, no only the fruity gourmet is that

[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:16.240]
All the penny I'm not see how can't make those sounds anymore

[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:20.540]
All the penny whether you're eating while you're watching the show with your cooking up the store

[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:29.640]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line. Well, it's either fruity gourmet. No mold. I've for a long time

[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:33.180]
He's doing some time. Wtf QAM. Hello

[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:34.880]
Yeah

[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:37.180]
Yeah

[02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:38.240]
Yeah

[02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:46.580]
Yeah

[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:51.740]
It's right off the court it's next to the

[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:54.980]
The star metropolitan hotel

[02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:01.940]
One more time the name of the hotel. It's next to which is to have a block away from is the star metropolitan hotel

[02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:05.000]
You go downstairs. It's a little trotteria. I think it's called

[02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:06.660]
Trotteria

[02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:08.260]
Amatrachiana

[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:12.480]
It is the most triana Amatrachiana

[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:16.780]
Get with that Italian or Georgia give us some Italian lessons. I hope you have a good time there

[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:20.540]
I yeah, it's got like two or three different names

[02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:23.240]
You know, I don't know why that is I've been going here for years

[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:28.360]
And I've never been able to figure out what the real name of the joint is it's one of those typical Italian family run trotterias

[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.180]
Just about all of them are

[02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:37.160]
Man is that a great I'll tell you the spaghetti tomato or which is very simple very plain or nothing fancy about it

[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:41.000]
No spaghetti with meatballs in Italy by the way. They'll kick your ass out say stupid Americans

[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:46.020]
But boys spaghetti tomato or maybe I'll present it's gonna have that while is there what do you think? No, probably not

[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:49.820]
They don't want them there. I have a massive protest in Rome. I should point out yeah there

[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:58.220]
But anyway, and I'll say it again the tomato sauce is so rich there because the soil in Italy is so old and the produce is so

[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:01.300]
Fabulous and it's not sprayed with artificial color

[02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:05.840]
We're gonna all that other crap they put in and then they take and they put the parmesan cheese in

[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:11.540]
The spaghetti after it's cooked and then they top it off with a little bit of sauce. They don't drown it

[02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:13.120]
And so then they toss it like all together

[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:18.140]
And it's just and then that's cheese like melts in the middle of it and then a little more cheese on top

[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:24.400]
Regiano parmesan and oh my god, it's just that's maybe on sex the meal in that place. It's the pepper or so

[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:29.340]
5 6 and I see right away you're starting at 10 that's any of just a little bit on egg

[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:35.440]
We're 20 and you weigh in

[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:41.780]
Do you like to set on color people

[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:49.640]
He likes to frame the color people

[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:54.960]
Oh

[02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:57.720]
This is just a meant to be you know

[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:01.420]
Oh

[02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:25.780]
Please

[02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:49.040]
Oh my god

[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:49.620]
But

[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:01.200]
Oh, well, at least that we came close to playing it there.

[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:02.600]
That was a better than the first time, right?

[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:07.060]
Well, I actually listened to it off the disc on and cue just to make sure it would play.

[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:07.860]
And it was fine.

[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:11.580]
And then as soon as I put it on the ear, it started doing little hip-hop.

[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:13.080]
Well, that's in these days, you know.

[02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:15.360]
1989 was 10 and a square.

[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:17.420]
Yes.

[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:20.340]
For those who care 15 years ago, 15th anniversary of that.

[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:24.640]
And the 10th anniversary of OJ coming up on Monday with a whole bunch of interviews.

[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:27.220]
And this Katie Korak is a scoop in this one.

[02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:29.300]
And great of an sister in scooping that one.

[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:30.240]
And it's all the big scoop.

[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:34.820]
As if anybody really should care other than let us know what he croaks.

[02:13:34.860 --> 02:13:36.380]
Okay, that's what we want to hear about OJ again.

[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:39.800]
Here's the fact that it says is the Hebrew hammer on the list.

[02:13:40.180 --> 02:13:40.780]
Not yet.

[02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:41.940]
I get him on there right away.

[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:44.400]
Hank Goldberg, get him on there.

[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:45.540]
We like Hank a lot.

[02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:47.080]
But boy, he's jargant.

[02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:48.940]
He's huge.

[02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:51.600]
Still don't know who Paul Prudom is.

[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:54.140]
Does he have a light here?

[02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:55.080]
No.

[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:55.660]
Okay.

[02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:58.620]
Family of OJ's forgotten victim is still feeling the pain.

[02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:01.360]
Ron Goldman is the forgotten victim in the OJ case.

[02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:03.500]
The handsome 25 year old was brutally stabbed.

[02:14:03.620 --> 02:14:06.560]
That's simply because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:08.960]
Not a good idea being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

[02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:13.320]
And in the 10 years since the tragedy, remarkably different fates have been fallen his loved

[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:14.280]
ones in Quarris Learn.

[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:17.660]
Ron had met Nicole Brown at a Brentwood gym and became a friend.

[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:21.600]
He worked as a waiter at the 20 Metzaloon of the Italian restaurant in Brentwood where

[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:23.420]
they don't have that great spaghetti pomegranate oil.

[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:26.480]
But nevertheless, when Nicole died with family members the last night of her life.

[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:30.380]
Her mother Judith and Brown phoned the restaurant leader that night to say she'd left her glasses.

[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:32.520]
Ron told, see that she's the one.

[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:35.480]
She was the chigger in a wood pile at Judith the Brown, right?

[02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:36.320]
Right.

[02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:39.860]
If she wouldn't have left her glasses there, he wouldn't have been going to the house.

[02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:41.100]
He'd still be alive today.

[02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:42.140]
Bitch.

[02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:47.620]
Ron told Nicole he would drop off her mom's glasses at her townhouse on his way to meet friends.

[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:52.360]
He kept his word and paid for it with his life, slaughtered in the darkness outside Nicole's home.

[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:57.440]
His father, Fred Goldman, who was an advertising executive, lived in middle-class LA suburb.

[02:14:57.800 --> 02:14:59.280]
Today he says of his shattered family.

[02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:02.340]
We've been doing fine, except for a reminder every day that Ron's gone.

[02:15:02.740 --> 02:15:05.100]
And in the happy times when they come along, we're missing Ron.

[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:08.320]
When my daughter recently gave birth to her son, she didn't have her brother there.

[02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:10.980]
Those are the moments that really strike home and make it painful.

[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:16.780]
The inquirer learned that Ron's sister, Kim 32, married her high school sweetheart, Mike Han.

[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:21.820]
She gave birth to a boy last September naming him a Samuel Ronald in honor of her slain brother, Samuel Ronald.

[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:26.960]
In an exclusive interview on the eve of the 10-year anniversary, Kim told the inquirer that she and her dad have kept

[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:33.360]
after OJ, who was ordered to pay the victim's families $33.5 million in that 1997 civil trial.

[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:37.440]
She charges that the disgraced football star has many out of the table money-making schemes

[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:41.540]
and successfully evades payments to the goldmins, which we have a story on that.

[02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:44.040]
OJ's got plenty of dough hidden away but victims get none.

[02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:48.320]
Coming up. But when we get wind of something, he's planning, we call our lawyers,

[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:49.960]
and they pursue it, Kim told the inquirer.

[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:53.200]
She's glad to report that her 64-year-old father Fred is doing well.

[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:55.780]
They probably should have gotten the money that would have paid for that plane ticket,

[02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:59.140]
that Greg Reed paid to fly me to our golf tournament five, six years ago,

[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:00.460]
when we didn't want any part of his ass.

[02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:04.920]
That was, seriously, if I had to write my memoirs right now,

[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:07.680]
that was the lowest point in the history of my radio life.

[02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:14.280]
Greg Reed, screw in, and a bunch of losers plotting behind our back here for charity no less

[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:16.560]
at a golf tournament to fly his ass in there.

[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:19.740]
And then they have Sam the sham call us on there.

[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:21.260]
Oh, we got OJ here, you want to put him on the ear?

[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:23.360]
No. Remember that?

[02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:27.680]
I remember that you said that you wouldn't talk about it because we were here in rumors that

[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:32.260]
OJ was going to be there and then you said that you wouldn't promote it if he was going to be

[02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:36.020]
there so everybody told you that he was not going to be there and it was a lie.

[02:16:36.020 --> 02:16:37.540]
I said I wouldn't have anything to do with that.

[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:39.780]
But he was going to be there, made that very clear adamant.

[02:16:39.860 --> 02:16:41.740]
So they said no, he won't be there and it was a lie.

[02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:43.540]
Sounds like a lawsuit to me, Duff.

[02:16:44.940 --> 02:16:47.000]
Anyway, getting back to the story,

[02:16:47.180 --> 02:16:52.380]
Kim says she's glad to report that her 64-year-old father Fred is doing well.

[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:55.920]
He has a company he's working with doing lobbying and making speaking engagements.

[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:00.280]
He's in good health, seemingly overlooked and forgotten is Ron's mother, Sharon Rufo.

[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:04.020]
She and Fred Goldman split up when the kids were small, Sharon's attorney Catherine Davis

[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:08.300]
told the inquirer, even now she's so emotionally fragile she can't talk to anyone about it.

[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:11.420]
She doesn't work, she's not received a penny from Simpson since he killed her son.

[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:15.580]
Sharon made headlines in February when OJ showed up in her hometown St. Louis,

[02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:20.360]
the pedal autographs and memorabilia, the bereaved mother and her lawyer tried to tackle some of

[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:25.060]
the widely running backs proceeds but failed. Sharon will never give up Davis told the inquirer,

[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:27.480]
will hunt him down wherever he tries to make a dime.

[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:32.580]
Now, this story which just makes you want to scream, makes you want to pee blood,

[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:34.720]
just ask Josh Beckett to tell you what that's like.

[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:38.920]
OJ has plenty of dough hidden away but the victims get none.

[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:45.820]
OJ Simpson's still owe is $33.5 million that was awarded in Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman's

[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:49.900]
families in that civil judgment but for seven years he's avoided paying them a cent

[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:52.480]
by cleverly hiding his money, says the inquirer.

[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:58.480]
The ex-football stars only visible source of income is the roughly 300 grand a year he gets,

[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:03.700]
poor baby from the National Football Ex-Pension Fund which is as a pension is exempt under law.

[02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:09.160]
But the inquirers learn that Simpson has also been raking in money through the sale of memorabilia

[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:11.380]
and keeps his fortune in offshore bank accounts.

[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:16.680]
OJ's got plenty of money and a high to keep secret bank accounts in the Bahamas.

[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:21.600]
He goes there frequently and insides the source said, I'm getting choked up about, I'm gagging on it.

[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:25.960]
And I don't think OJ doesn't have a good time when he's down there. It's always a party.

[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:30.420]
He celebrates the fact that he keeps the civil awards from Ron and Nicole's families. It's sick.

[02:18:30.900 --> 02:18:33.800]
In other words, this murdering son of a babbage and for him life is a...

[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:34.420]
Hardee.

[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:37.340]
Yeah.

[02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:42.120]
The blackbuster disclosure that OJ is pocketing thousands from the sale of personal sports

[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:47.080]
memorabilia comes in an exclusive inquiry interview with collector Al Beardsley who says

[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:51.340]
money for OJ sports memorabilia is handled through OJ's pal sports agent Mike Gilbert.

[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:52.740]
Gilbert.

[02:18:53.140 --> 02:18:58.400]
In the summer of 2002, I met Gilbert at the Halein in Burbank where he offered to

[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:03.260]
sell me some game balls that he had with him as well as photos OJ had taken with J. Edgar Hoover.

[02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:04.660]
J. Edgar Hoover.

[02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:09.060]
Some artwork done by Nicole Babichu in a junior sale. I'll be pissed about that.

[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:11.180]
Ask Josh Beckett.

[02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:17.720]
Photos OJ had taken with J. Edgar Hoover some artwork done by Nicole Gifts presented at OJ

[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:21.400]
by Lin Swan and a few Game War in Jersey's. These were all high value items.

[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:25.040]
Some of the balls have been signed by football players who were now deceased like Walter Payton.

[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:27.900]
That's something when you have football player signing your balls.

[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:33.080]
On another occasion, Mike wanted 25 grand for the suit OJ were when he was found not guilty,

[02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:38.180]
said Beardsley. He also had a ring specially handmade for OJ which he wore in jail. Ain't that lovely?

[02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:44.940]
Mike handles the money and OJ keeps his own hands clean. OJ doesn't turn over any bucks to

[02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:49.100]
the Brown and Goldman families. After the civil trial, auctions of some of Simpson's assets

[02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:52.840]
did yield a small amount of money, but beyond that, the amount the Goldman's and Brown's have

[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:56.580]
received is not a penny. Zipity Duda, zero, zero and zero,

[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:01.200]
Brown Goldman's father Fred told a reporter. I don't know why we should be honestly surprised. He

[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:05.200]
said you can't lose track of what we're dealing with. He's first and foremost a murderer. He's a

[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:09.820]
wife-beater. He's a dishonest person. He's a sociopath. So I would be ever expecting to do anything

[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:13.100]
honorable. He asked and that's a pretty good question. And the answer is we would not.

[02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:18.940]
What a slime bucket, man. What a piece of dirt. We hope you die, OJ, soon. In fact, on the

[02:20:18.940 --> 02:20:23.080]
Vern anniversary of your murders on Monday, how about blowing your brains out? That will be

[02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:27.600]
some good publicity, right? We promised to talk about it for days on end. But if you're this

[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:36.800]
due that for us, we'll take a seat. Yeah, table. Right. Man. So Teniman Square was 1989. When

[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:39.660]
we're going to liberate those poor press Chinese people, didn't we? Didn't we go to their

[02:20:39.660 --> 02:20:42.640]
rescue and support? No, we decided to start doing business with them because they

[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:45.360]
like to start real cheap. They're going to argue them because they're a communist country and we

[02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:50.400]
don't do business. Five six seven oh five sixty. That's only yours. Count five sixty on the AT&T

[02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:53.480]
and Verizon wireless line. And that's because your company don't have one of Bombak

[02:20:53.480 --> 02:21:02.520]
Grande. That's part of the problem. C WQ AM. Hello. Yes. Five sixty. It's five sixty. WQ AM. Yes.

[02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:07.020]
All right. I was just confident. The Roger says you're speaking to him.

[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:13.800]
All right, Neil. Yes, sir. What do you got? Well, how about the Dave game?

[02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:18.420]
Did we put him on air? I guess we left Dave Game Offerder. He was on a poll yesterday and he's

[02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:22.240]
on there right now. Thanks to you. Thank you, sir. Did you know he's still a channel four?

[02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:28.420]
No. He's in charge of their website. Oh, no wonder. He's a civil screen for

[02:21:28.420 --> 02:21:31.740]
nightly before. Exactly. Well, there you go. He'd at least he's still alive and he's still

[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:36.660]
got a job. Thanks, Ballet. All right, I got it. See you. Dave Game. Huh? People like Dave Game.

[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:43.520]
I remember what he looked like too. He was a huge and fat and real ugly. Yeah. Well, a lot of us

[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:51.200]
can relate to that. Your favorite all-time fat person dead or alive. John Candy 154, Jackie Gleesons

[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:58.160]
moved up 89. Chris Farley 72. John Belushi 52. The top four, they're all fat and they're all

[02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:04.040]
dead. Fat and the Arigers 46. Maybe there's a message in there, huh? For me. Since I'm right next

[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:11.240]
on the list. Crowley of the three stuages 22, Dom Delewese 17, Jerry Garcia 16, Kelly Craig 15,

[02:22:12.940 --> 02:22:18.720]
John Goodman 13, Big Wilson 9, Dusty Rhodes got 9, Buddy Hackett 8, N-8, N-8, N-8. He's dead.

[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:24.980]
Marlon Brando 8. Marlon Brando isn't just fat. He's just he's monstrous. He's just bigger than

[02:22:24.980 --> 02:22:29.460]
life itself. He's an island unto himself. How do you fly in a plane? It's a good thing he's got all

[02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:32.720]
the big bucks and he certainly wouldn't fly commercial airline. How would you fly in a plane next

[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:37.360]
to somebody the size of that? You have to buy a ticket to your own section. Have you ever had that

[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:43.540]
experience flying on a plane with somebody who needs the seat belt belt? I have a sender. The ultimate

[02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:50.940]
experience. Really? Yeah. When I was 9 flying to LA, I had a giant fat guy that didn't fit in his seat.

[02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:57.280]
Yeah. It's practically on my lap. Really? And they wouldn't move. How was it? It was great.

[02:22:57.620 --> 02:23:04.000]
Wonderful. And Dusty, he enjoyed it. Five or six seats now, don't they? Huh? Yeah, they make

[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.640]
you. Yeah, they make you. They make you. Somebody your lines not all, but somebody your lines make

[02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:12.320]
you pay for two seats and then they lift the arm rest and then you know you have one cheek on

[02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:17.600]
one seat and another cheek on another seat. If you have like a huge, huge, humongous gigantic seat.

[02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:22.600]
This is for 20 prices.

[02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:32.860]
Oh, these galleries in New York, where would be this into Orange and Mirages I want to have?

[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:47.900]
Bye, bye to American Idol. If I see another special, I'll become suicidal

[02:23:48.860 --> 02:23:57.840]
and no one cares which one of them takes the title. It doesn't matter which of them wins.

[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:02.240]
Take a look at play and ruin.

[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:11.960]
We knew that all was lost when Jennifer Hudson was rooted off

[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:22.340]
who the heck was casting for. Just Steven's thought he had it made but he was born in the wrong

[02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:34.440]
decade and Simon said he couldn't hit the nose and the toy had landed really soon but she's not as

[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:42.140]
big as William Hunt, when he sings it sounds so wrong. How do you run a Ricky Martin song?

[02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:49.160]
Real fintasia, or do I yet have we shown the door? Don't think I can take the show anymore.

[02:24:50.060 --> 02:24:56.860]
At least not until season four, till then. The music's dead.

[02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:05.680]
There's no more singing, bye, bye to American Idol. If I see another, I may go on a side.

[02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:11.500]
Randby fall a sign and go away for a while. I wish you were all given a rest.

[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:14.740]
And that includes Ryan's secrets.

[02:25:19.340 --> 02:25:22.100]
Poor hell is Nathan with video on what race is he driving?

[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:26.080]
You just emailed me this thing about his website?

[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:32.360]
I did. You didn't? Oh, I just emailed you something. Yeah.

[02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:39.280]
It's an website of naked people. Well, there was a story there that I was trying to email you.

[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.340]
Oh, but you didn't email me a story. You emailed me a website that links to all these

[02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:46.020]
and naked people which I don't see any of mine here. I see a guy's head.

[02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:52.940]
Let me try it again. It says dudes in organs. Oh, is this like a worlet'ser? That kind of organ?

[02:25:57.100 --> 02:26:03.260]
No, it's a joke telegram from El Presidente to Shalabi.

[02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:09.240]
I was speaking of El Presidente during that bit. I almost interrupted it because I wanted to

[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:14.420]
like most people are sitting by a TV set. But if you haven't, did you have CNN? I'm probably not

[02:26:14.420 --> 02:26:18.660]
because you would have been screaming about a binaugh. I've been flak. They showed a clip where Bush

[02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:25.740]
was sitting next to the Pope or crossman and the Pope is speaking like that. And Bush is sitting

[02:26:25.740 --> 02:26:30.800]
there looking like Alfredi Newman on a bad day with his head kind of cocked off to say, you know how

[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:36.840]
like a bird pops its head off to one side or a dog. But yeah, dogs sometimes they can make a

[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:41.380]
strange sound. A dog will do that too. But most often you see a bird do that or a dog. Yeah.

[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:49.240]
And like it was scary. I said they're like frozen in suspended animation. I just I couldn't believe it.

[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:53.980]
I mean, this is there are actually those of you out there who believe that this man is a president,

[02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:58.720]
that this man is going to intellect larger than your thumbnail. I mean, calm on now. There are too

[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:02.720]
many important things going on in the world and the idea that we've been suckered in and snucked

[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:06.540]
in by the Iranians should come as no surprise. But a bunch of Dodo birds we got run in this country

[02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:17.040]
right now speaking of birds, Dodo birds. There he is. There you go. Mr. Roger's secret baby

[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:21.700]
scandal. Bob it you didn't know I would I could do it. Did you know? This is a terrible story

[02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:26.960]
in inquiry, but he's dead now. So I guess we can pick on Fred Rogers. Anguished mom searching for

[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:32.560]
twins. She says TV legend convinced her to put up her adoption. Every day may have been beautiful

[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:37.060]
and Mr. Rogers neighborhood, but the beloved kiddie show host family was rocked by drug edition

[02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:42.340]
and affair and shocking baby scandal. It's been kept secret for nearly 20 years. The inquiries

[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:48.280]
learned exclusively in 1984 Fred Rogers son John fell in love with the woman he met in drug rehab

[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:53.380]
and she says he got her pregnant with twins desperate to preserve Mr. Rogers wholesome and

[02:27:53.380 --> 02:27:58.060]
she claims members of the family pressured her to abort the babies. But the TV legend that

[02:27:58.060 --> 02:28:02.280]
ordained Presbyterian minister convinced the anguished mom instead to put her son David and

[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:07.100]
daughter Eden up for adoption. She hasn't seen the children since giving them up and it's left

[02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:11.820]
a hole in her heart that's never healed. Now 15 months after Mr. Rogers death the children's

[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:46.460]
located just 25 miles from the White House many Americans think that terrorism is somewhere over

[02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:49.980]
there in the middle east in Europe far away from daily life in the US a member of the Justice

[02:31:54.440 --> 02:32:00.160]
here ought to be on fire ought to be burning so bad you're finding the intelligence information

[02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:04.000]
we're getting and the fighting of terrorist weapons here in the west puts the threat of terrorism

[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:07.860]
right at our doorstep right on your front door when somebody rings your bell you better take a

[02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:13.980]
close peek acting on crucial information supplied by Britain's MI5 in the Israeli intelligence agency

[02:32:13.980 --> 02:32:18.600]
Mossad members of the Justice Department special anti terrorism task force uncovered one cash of

[02:32:18.600 --> 02:32:21.980]
arms in New York and another in New Jersey they were being ready to buy the terrorist at a

[02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:26.640]
Justice Department source weapons discovered by the feds included automatic rifles bomb making

[02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:51.740]
source the papers maps and the papers show the terrorists have occupied safe houses in Virginia

[02:32:51.740 --> 02:32:56.060]
within 25 miles of the White House we've been on to these guys for years the terrorists are

[02:32:56.060 --> 02:33:00.100]
difficult to trap they stay on the move and frequently change locations but the difference now is

[02:33:00.100 --> 02:33:03.800]
that they're getting bolder and the more they show their hand the harder will come down on them

[02:33:03.800 --> 02:33:08.720]

stories that we have on the website they also have there for example because it's a fun time site

[02:39:44.390 --> 02:39:47.570]

telegram I hope that never have to send unfortunately this but all my efforts to prevent it

[02:40:14.510 --> 02:40:18.570]
America's annoyingly free presses we've reverted to its uncooperative habit of allowing facts to

[02:40:18.570 --> 02:40:23.430]
get it off message and so our special relationship must come to an end I'll always treasure the

[02:40:23.430 --> 02:40:27.350]
nights we held hands and fed each other popcorn at the White House G-Noughtry Film Festival

[02:40:27.350 --> 02:40:33.050]
while pickles loudly snored on the floor behind us but despite my personal affection from

[02:40:33.050 --> 02:40:37.730]
this point forward my administration must treat you as a radioactive pariah that's why I wanted

[02:40:37.730 --> 02:40:41.750]

patch on an e on ebay if allowed you to pay with a bloody broken corpses of 18 year olds I

[02:41:02.530 --> 02:41:05.770]

340 grand U.S. Treasury checks that I wrote you why you were hoodwinking us will help alleviate

[02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:42.630]
any emotional suffering your pal George W. Bush P.S. good luck with your continued evasion of that

[02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:47.450]
22 year old Jordanian prison sentence for embezzlement if this Valerie plane case keeps going the

[02:41:47.450 --> 02:41:51.810]
way it is it might just might bring you on as a consultant that's kind of cute not really good

[02:41:51.810 --> 02:42:00.710]
but it's okay told about two minutes yes something it's weak 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18th

[02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:04.550]
right as well as I do have some good news today for those people who are at the left of a

[02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:11.270]
total of the hunt and don't walk around with them a slap on mustaches jobs recapture congress

[02:42:11.270 --> 02:42:17.230]
question mark South Dakota triumph has Democrats thinking the unthinkable oh my god how do you like that

[02:42:18.530 --> 02:42:23.070]
policy pulls the bad wagon for recapturing congress good old Nancy she's pulling it

[02:42:24.430 --> 02:42:28.610]
a pure special election wins in strong republican states combined with president Bush's

[02:42:28.610 --> 02:42:33.590]
skidding national popularity as democratic leaders giddy over the once unthinkable possibility

[02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:38.830]
of taking back congress in November all right it's all about momentum San Francisco representative

[02:42:38.830 --> 02:42:43.370]
Nancy Pelosi the House Democratic leader said Wednesday we're on a roll let's roll

[02:42:44.010 --> 02:42:48.350]
a boy in Pelosi said Tuesday's win in South Dakota special congressional election and the

[02:42:48.350 --> 02:42:51.970]
Democrats House special election when it can tuck in February show that her party can win back

[02:42:51.970 --> 02:42:56.530]
the House and the Senate in November people who don't think the Democrats can win the House this

[02:42:56.530 --> 02:43:01.370]
year just don't understand Pelosi said will demonstrate district by district how we intend to win

[02:43:02.490 --> 02:43:06.430]
but Polo republicans deserve you that Pelosi and other Democrats are whistling past the graveyard

[02:43:06.430 --> 02:43:11.670]
which is where GOP experts expect the Democratic congressional hopes will end up I'm amazed at

[02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:15.330]
how Pelosi can draw national implications from a South Dakota race where the candidate almost

[02:43:15.330 --> 02:43:19.950]
blew a 30 point lead said Carl 40 spoke to him for the republican national congressional committee

[02:43:19.950 --> 02:43:24.390]
I know she has an obligation to wear members and donors to manufacture momentum but the reality is

[02:43:24.390 --> 02:43:30.470]
it's not there even after Stephen Stephanie Hercett's victory in South Dakota Republican still

[02:43:30.470 --> 02:43:34.630]
hold a 220 to two horses lead over Democrats in the House which also includes an independent

[02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:39.050]
that means Democrats have to pick up 11 seats to take back control they lost to the 94 elections

[02:43:39.050 --> 02:43:43.630]
the numbers are even tighter in the Senate where republicans hold a 51 48-age with one independent

[02:43:43.630 --> 02:43:50.330]
leads Democratic yadi yadi and a partridge new poetry well at least they're like little a

[02:43:50.330 --> 02:43:55.390]
little twinkling sign here in area and on set a little glimmer of array of sunshine we'll take it

back-to-ball and it's just a football town and I'm going to tell you right now let me say it again

[02:47:26.450 --> 02:47:30.430]
what I told you the other day you're going to be so sorry anybody who claims to be a dolphin fan

[02:47:30.430 --> 02:47:35.290]
when this come and see this over this crap that I think that the statement that wants that made

[02:47:35.290 --> 02:47:39.510]
which what much more embarrassing than the one of junior sale made about the greatest defense

[02:47:39.510 --> 02:47:46.010]
in history oh my god what kind of a huh it's pretty come I tell you rush must have given the

[02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:51.370]
coach a Wilmos phone number no question about he's got to be happens and have you do the crap

[02:47:51.370 --> 02:47:55.850]
to be poppin statements out like that the greatest dolphin defense ever I noticed both camera

and take you feeler with him if they think that this touchy feeling and you feelers their quarterback

[02:48:09.430 --> 02:48:13.630]
cancer the fact that Jay Fielder we're still on that team indicates to me it's just like okay

[02:48:13.630 --> 02:48:20.630]
forfeit we give we surrender I mean can you really honestly believe that Jay Fielder is going to be

[02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:25.890]
on that team again this year he's talking to you Josh it's nothing to believe he's there no

[02:48:25.890 --> 02:48:31.230]
no but could you believe it no no see that that's my point nobody can believe it that's how desperate

[02:48:31.230 --> 02:48:35.270]
they are that's how untoward they are the quarterback position that's how jealous they are

[02:48:35.270 --> 02:48:39.050]
the patriots in Tom Brady and anybody else has got a real quarterback which ain't the dolphins

of the song you do you know exactly what i'm talking about too much umpa umpa which is probably

[02:55:07.330 --> 02:55:10.270]
whether or not on the air anymore in poor studies you know he deserves a better faith

[02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:17.350]
yeah that's it that's hard as though i know misses block under colleagues hope the study would

[02:55:17.350 --> 02:55:21.090]
help understand american dietary patterns in order to reduce the trend of gigantic

[02:55:21.090 --> 02:55:26.070]
it won't it won't change a damn thing the researchers reviewed the results of a study of forty seven

[02:55:26.070 --> 02:55:30.210]
hundred sixty adults conducted nineteen nine and two thousand by the federal government titled

[02:55:30.210 --> 02:55:33.970]
the national health and nutrition examination survey wonder how much they spent for that

[02:55:33.970 --> 02:55:37.290]
those survey were questioned in the foods they had eaten in the last twenty four hours

[02:55:38.010 --> 02:55:41.850]
america's largest source of calories were regular soft drinks see i don't for the life of my

[02:55:41.850 --> 02:55:46.690]
understanding why like my mother for example she's a fat tub all right she's almost 91 but she's

[02:55:46.690 --> 02:55:52.890]
a fat tub she refuses to drink diet soda white i don't know she won't she don't like it

[02:55:53.610 --> 02:55:57.030]
so when i go to her house for lunch she's got diet soda for me and she's got a bottle of

[02:55:57.030 --> 02:56:00.470]
regular soda with sugar in it why do you drink i mean if you're going to have something with

[02:56:00.470 --> 02:56:04.050]
sugar when i have something at least is you know i mean like candy or something i'm not

[02:56:04.050 --> 02:56:12.170]
something good ma not soda regular soft drinks with sugar make up seven point one percent of

[02:56:12.170 --> 02:56:16.550]
their daily caloric intake that that's the this great now how can i be so fat i don't drink any of

[02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:27.010]
that you know once in a great way to go into a restaurant order a diet coke and they'll bring

[02:56:27.010 --> 02:56:31.830]
in years i mean i have to be out of my mind when i can make room for nestley turtle ice cream

[02:56:31.830 --> 02:56:35.070]
or something really good right find a world where i'd be drinking coke with sugar when i have to

[02:56:35.070 --> 02:56:41.850]
be a moron and man you drink that it's like oh yeah seconding you want a barf it's disgusting

[02:56:42.450 --> 02:56:47.770]
like those surveyed those surveyed consume sweets and desserts more than any other type of food

[02:56:47.770 --> 02:56:52.670]
this is 40 this is just not fat people these are five thousand average american slabs

[02:56:53.530 --> 02:56:57.930]
they consume sweets and desserts more than any other type of food my kind of crowd as a matter of

[02:56:57.930 --> 02:57:04.770]
fact followed by hamburger's pizza and potato chips cheese beer and french fries also high on

[02:57:04.770 --> 02:57:08.390]
list although they did not use mayonnaise in their fries because they don't live in Amsterdam

[02:57:09.270 --> 02:57:13.150]
the number of adults who are overweight or obese is still the increase in 1980 according to

[02:57:13.150 --> 02:57:18.670]
the american obesity association today oh my god these numbers are now so embarrassing i can't

[02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:27.310]
even read it guess what percent of individuals older than 20 are overweight 56 64.5%

[02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:34.630]
up from 46% since 1980 man are you people fat and me at 30 and a half percent the number of

[02:57:34.630 --> 02:57:40.430]
adults suffering from obesity is more than doubled so we're talking overweight 60 almost 65

[02:57:40.430 --> 02:57:47.370]
percent and obese meaning fat is a cow yeah and you know it's more than that growing by the minute

[02:57:47.370 --> 02:57:51.610]
and so is the number because they're eating so many junk foods you said americans are not

[02:57:51.610 --> 02:57:55.810]
choosing enough healthy foods fruits and vegetables are a little more than 10% of daily calories

[02:57:55.810 --> 02:57:59.890]
see that's because it's very difficult they don't make it easy i'll tell you one of my favorite

[02:57:59.890 --> 02:58:06.030]
foods is strawberries yeah don't you love strawberries have some like two days ago and if you

[02:58:06.030 --> 02:58:10.850]

[02:58:10.850 --> 02:58:15.250]
you could put like uh splenda or sweeten lower you know or you can actually put sugar on

[02:58:15.250 --> 02:58:18.450]
her if you don't have to watch your sugar but that's stupid but they're really good you don't

feik attorney sought a quarterly yesterday asking a federal judge to stop shell oil company

[03:02:59.590 --> 03:03:03.970]
from requirement customers consumers decide the way their rights when filing claims to fix

[03:03:03.970 --> 03:03:10.010]
fuel gauges then by tainted gas man oh man the only thing worse than it and duck for me this

[03:03:10.010 --> 03:03:15.810]
morning nothing worse than tainted gas is a tainted ass for lauderdale lawyer david scotsett

[03:03:15.810 --> 03:03:19.270]
shell imposed burdens and restrictions on consumers by requiring them to sign releases

[03:03:19.270 --> 03:03:23.890]
and have their vehicles undergo limited automotive inspections ordered to be reimbursed what kind

[03:03:23.890 --> 03:03:27.730]
of a bunch it's not bad enough to repay them like uh over two bucks a gallon per gas down well

[03:03:27.730 --> 03:03:33.870]
on the way to three no but now we're getting tainted gas in our ass by agreeing to the settlement

[03:03:33.870 --> 03:03:37.870]
to fix a bad fuel gauge scotsett consumers could be forced to pay for other vehicle problems that

[03:03:37.870 --> 03:03:41.810]
might not show up until weeks or months later well good screw these oil companies and by the way

[03:03:41.810 --> 03:03:45.990]
at a time when opek is saying this and the Saudis are panicking because of the attack last weekend

[03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:51.550]
all these other excuses they're making at that time same time it's going on the oil companies

[03:03:51.550 --> 03:03:56.210]
are reporting record profits again every quarter huh must be just a coincidence or maybe they're

[03:03:56.210 --> 03:04:00.010]
just being allowed to rate the public you think or they would let them do that just like your

[03:04:00.010 --> 03:04:05.130]
government would never lie to you would they one driver who called scots law office in the high

[03:04:05.130 --> 03:04:09.210]
sulfur content and the gas ruined his catalytic converter and additionally was fuel gauge with the

[03:04:09.210 --> 03:04:15.310]
repair time more than a thousand dollars a grand oh my god for the honor of using shell gas

[03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:20.550]
scots and some dealerships of full drivers that warranties on new vehicles don't cover fuel gauge

[03:04:20.550 --> 03:04:24.270]
repairs they've also told drivers that new car warranties will be voted if they take the credit

[03:04:24.270 --> 03:04:33.230]
another shop to get it fixed i use anico and uh mobile when i'm there okay and you use um i'm

[03:04:33.230 --> 03:04:39.050]
trying to think probably has probably has its real cheap no although i do uh hit the VP every

[03:04:39.050 --> 03:04:45.930]
now and then well the VP is anico right chevron typically oh chevron oh well what are you

[03:04:45.930 --> 03:04:50.590]
gonna do now it's okay chevron chevron's real gas as opposed to some of those like make believe

[03:04:50.590 --> 03:04:55.890]
kind of gas oh boy hit a mobile every now and then depending on where that shell sport oh and

[03:04:55.890 --> 03:04:59.530]
let me say this to you don't have a bit where they say at the end of the bit it says something

[03:04:59.530 --> 03:05:04.970]
about you're gonna have to pay for air we we've got some bit where they were already paying for air

[03:05:04.970 --> 03:05:09.370]
this is something i've been meaning to bitch and scream and holler about and i i don't know why

[03:05:09.370 --> 03:05:14.990]
we're such a bunch of schmucks what kind of a communist bunch of crap is it we're now paying two

[03:05:14.990 --> 03:05:19.610]
dollars and eighteen cents or two in a quarter whatever it is for a girl on a premium gas and you go

[03:05:19.610 --> 03:05:27.830]
into a mobile station and you have to pay for air um what kind of crap is that it's a new revenue

[03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:33.130]
stream yeah it's kind of like the abesley auction done the online auctions the rape the public out

[03:05:33.130 --> 03:05:37.370]
there the unsuspecting public with the insurgency and so the abesley people put these online auctions

[03:05:37.370 --> 03:05:41.030]
out there to probably a bunch of crap they got laying around a bunch of oj's old balls and stuff

[03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:45.270]
like that i mean why could why would they give you something for free when they can charge you for it

[03:05:45.910 --> 03:05:54.490]
i mean that would be like charging for water that'll be next selling water yeah oh i mean they

[03:05:54.490 --> 03:05:58.090]
do charge you to clean your car i understand that for the vacuum thing which is another ripoff

[03:05:58.090 --> 03:06:02.750]
that's just a rape that don't cost a man that's just a suction thing i mean scurrants it that's no

[03:06:02.750 --> 03:06:10.570]
big deal but the idea of charging for air that that's that's one step away from charging me to

[03:06:10.570 --> 03:06:15.250]
breathe the fresh air you see what i'm saying sure chair and i think one of the stations it was

[03:06:15.250 --> 03:06:21.690]
like fifty cents fifty cents we don't want no punk kids filling up their bicycle tires why not

[03:06:21.690 --> 03:06:23.750]
for free why not were they gonna get the air

[03:06:27.450 --> 03:06:34.510]
that was no raspberry okay that was absolutely i know my raspberries were talking strawberries

[03:06:34.510 --> 03:06:39.410]
raspberries another assorted fruit i know my fruit mister it was a part of no raspberry that was

[03:06:39.410 --> 03:06:42.650]
i should have reached right down here and dumped that baby because it sounded to me like you

[03:06:42.650 --> 03:06:46.690]
just did that yourself there's a bike tire and i think dump was the operative word there that

[03:06:46.690 --> 03:06:49.890]
that was bad enough you better stay better check the tape on that baby okay

[03:06:50.970 --> 03:06:56.510]
that was really better almost get to the weekend another fine week here on his show almost get

[03:06:56.510 --> 03:07:02.510]
