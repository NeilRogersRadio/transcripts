[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]
The other person...

[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.200]
...is John Brown.

[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.060]
Oh I hate you!

[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.920]
He's a fump in the fool, the heart is arrogant, fooling the powerful father.

[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.820]
He's don't give any truth when expressing his views.

[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.380]
He fought us for all.

[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.480]
He's got a wolf down on his head, he's got his head in his head.

[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.300]
He's got a wolf down on his head, he's got a wolf down on his head.

[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.080]
He's don't give any truth when expressing his views.

[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.260]
He's don't give any truth when expressing his views.

[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.680]
All the freedom he's bringing in everyone's death.

[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.840]
That's one of the half of the bad news.

[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.420]
Of the world's race.

[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.520]
And the traitor was most of the best president of the primilial.

[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.820]
And finally met her, loved the shirt, and the big jail.

[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.340]
If it ever was the worst, you got too much.

[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.600]
That on his house, final lesson was enough of a tragedy.

[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.120]
He's got too much.

[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.660]
That on his house, final lesson was enough of a disaster.

[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.680]
He's don't give any truth when expressing his views.

[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.140]
That on his house, final lesson was enough of a tragedy.

[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.120]
He's got a wolf down on his head.

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.940]
He's don't give any truth when expressing his views.

[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.020]
That on his house, final lesson was enough of a tragedy.

[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.960]
Martine P Tryna has, like, a maniac.

[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.760]
We're just talking about Steve, won't we give it in?

[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.500]
Indeed we work, that's hard because I started playing that listening to that before the show and you said, oh, sticks.

[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.820]
And still, they break my bones but don't comey short.

[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.380]
Anyway, so I guess we're all done now, huh?

[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.600]
Yeah, I tell them.

[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.720]
How long have I been telling this audience?

[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.080]
Take your radios and just put them in the bottom of the swimming pool and the bottom of the bathtub.

[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.580]
It's a real good idea, just to schmit canem.

[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.400]
You're good.

[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.880]
Why shouldn't I say that because they all earn a heart, junior, probably get another $25,000 fine.

[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.020]
Well, we'll get to all of that.

[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.520]
So bad news from Iraq again, though, where everything was, we thought was going pretty well.

[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.420]
Oh, where far?

[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.680]
I guess one, it ain't.

[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.760]
Two more US orders killed in separate bombings in Iraq.

[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.520]
Two killed and two others were wounded, one very seriously, by the way.

[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.760]
In separate bombings that occurred within hours, the US military said today, the attacks also injured and Iraqi translators.

[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.680]
The names of the dead soldiers were withheld pending notification of families as of yesterday.

[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.520]
1,064 members of the US military had died since the war began in March 2003.

[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.880]
Of those 809 died in hostile acts and the figure include three military civilians.

[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.580]
It's approaching 1100.

[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.180]
In the size of my election day, which is 3.5 weeks away, it'll probably be over 1100 or their bouts getting close.

[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.780]
And you have to wonder, what is the magic number?

[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.800]
I mean, what the...

[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.600]
About 30 men.

[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.480]
That should have been the number.

[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.640]
What's it got to about 30?

[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.640]
That should have enough to send off some warning, flashing lights and bells and stuff like that.

[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.700]
Oh, the first thing that we find out, that the latest report that came out early this morning, about 4.30 this morning, said,

[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.480]
absolutely positively beyond the shadow of a doubt.

[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.660]
No questions about it.

[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.500]
This is all about the crap.

[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.200]
How many more reports do we need already?

[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.820]
But anyway, there should be some...

[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.300]
There's a lot of news yesterday's poll and we'll talk about what we're going to do now.

[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.760]
What do we going to do?

[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.420]

[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.600]
Retire.

[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.800]
Yeah, that's something, or maybe...

[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.980]
You cannot let them learn!

[00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.760]
Oh, what do I want to do?

[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.620]
Yeah, we could do that.

[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.280]
What am I going to do?

[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.320]
1764 votes.

[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.660]
Actually, it's more than that now, but I'm not going to bother with it.

[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.860]
Which of these things would you most taping thought of as by others?

[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.740]
People's.

[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.040]
Dumb.

[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.440]
277.

[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.560]
You don't want to be thought of as dumb.

[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.780]
Dumb, like that.

[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.620]
Republican 275.

[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.600]
And of course, don't you see how these kind of like tie together?

[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.640]
Allows you lay.

[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.940]
Is that Tom Delay?

[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.280]
Allows you lay 249.

[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.700]
We'll get to him also.

[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.040]
This on is 227.

[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.240]
Be a freaking liar.

[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.560]
Well, I don't want to use that extreme word like freaking liar.

[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.640]
And that's what Kerry should have said.

[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.320]
No, I don't want to say you're a liar, you're a freaking liar.

[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.620]
He actually said the F word like chain you did.

[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.080]
How come it's okay for a chain you to say it, but not for John Kerry?

[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.760]
Shut up, buddy.

[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.720]
Religious fanatic 196.

[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.060]
Don't want nobody thinking to me as a religious nut.

[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.260]
Oh!

[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.560]
Firstly, when I'm walking around with my schmata on my head and my tits isn't my...

[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.980]
...tallus.

[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.920]
Am I to fill in?

[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.460]
Fat Slav 178.

[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.220]
Homo, 106.

[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.100]
Oh, no, Homo.

[00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.060]
Amahomo?

[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.480]
Boring 66.

[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.560]
Agri 58.

[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.480]
Dolphin 55.

[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.820]
Are there any Dolphans out there?

[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.420]
Any more.

[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.580]
Now, in fact, can you imagine the amount of Dolphin impersonated has been buried and burned

[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.840]
and...

[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.480]
That's the idea.

[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.820]
...that I'd be able to bring you that idea like Steve Dolphan with the disco in front of me.

[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.920]

[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.820]
Burning out the disco records.

[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.060]
How's that?

[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.900]
Sure, but those are collectors items out.

[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.000]
What's that?

[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.280]
The Dolphan's paraphernalia.

[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.100]
Yeah, all right.

[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.840]
Let's go put away.

[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.380]
I think I'm a great idea for somebody.

[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.820]
Not us, of course, because we're not a sports show, but somebody who does a sports show to get a thing over you.

[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.120]
Burn out your Dolphin jerseys and cap stuff like that.

[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.960]
Just as a way of protesting the organization, the way they've destroyed the whole freaking thing.

[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.340]
Dolphan 55, a Wimp 34.

[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.400]
Even Bush won, didn't want to be thought of as a Wimp, even though he was.

[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.420]
Old 32.

[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.300]
Ancient.

[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.120]
Short 11.

[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.100]
People don't mind being called short.

[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.020]
It's just the...

[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.920]
...separate they are, carry.

[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.320]
We met at the debate.

[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.400]
That was the first time we met.

[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.380]
That was the first time we met.

[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.320]
Yeah, the first time we met.

[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.600]
Here's Laura Boone.

[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.960]
Here reminds me a little bit of Lady Bird Johnson.

[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.460]
You know, that's Shrub, the Bullish Inn and the Three.

[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.720]
Yeah.

[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.340]
Oh, I've got such a great line for that, but the Secret Service will be very upset.

[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.440]
So I'm just going to smoke over it.

[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.720]
Yeah.

[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.240]
Carla Grunai is our beaded curtain chick today.

[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.880]
She was born December 23rd, 1968, which makes her 35, almost 36, getting a really ancient.

[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.900]
She was born in Torino, terminally.

[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.040]
And what does she do?

[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.300]
She was in late divorce, unzipped, paparazzi.

[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.980]
Or she played herself.

[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.000]
Catwalk, Shlunfraun developed.

[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.140]
And that's about it.

[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.300]

[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.640]
And Lomas Pus, Omrae, Lumieri.

[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.360]
She's a tough guy.

[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.200]
I don't know what that is.

[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.820]
So there you go.

[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.240]
That's...

[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.820]
She's on there.

[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.920]
Carla Brunai, whoever it is.

[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.880]
She looks okay.

[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.760]
She's on a model.

[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.340]
She's on a model.

[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.120]
She's been around.

[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.180]
She's got the right part.

[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.680]
She's got a couple of boobies on her.

[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.440]
If you're old enough and you're promised to tell several friends.

[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.760]
Just like what's his name?

[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.780]
On Popeye old, does you know?

[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.120]
If you're promised to tell a friend, we're going to give this to you.

[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.840]
These 85 pieces of cutlery for like $300 payments of $4.85.

[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.460]
If you're promised to tell a friend.

[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.880]
How do they know if you're really going to tell a friend?

[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.260]
Have you ever seen those in front of our shows?

[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.040]
They have this.

[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.080]
I see.

[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.320]
And of course, if you don't tell a friend, they want the money back.

[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.220]
But yeah.

[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.540]
Word and losers job over naked inmate flat.

[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.560]
Now, is that a three or a four minute break we are coming up?

[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.580]
I'm sure it's only three, right?

[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.880]
You'd be Idea say there's Fourthluding.

[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.880]

[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.880]
A short one means a week break.

[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.280]
What's your strategy?

[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.880]
What's your reward for a week's four extra extra strike with a extra strike break?

[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:35.940]
The Yelgar ain't here to catch these guys again.

[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.200]
He just against me.

[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:50.980]
Timmy just against him with his problem is corporate funders like the bad ones.

[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.980]

[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.980]

[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.100]
we

[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.240]
I was really glad to cry, filled with sorrow

[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.520]
I wanted things to move forward

[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.940]
I couldn't move like a kid, and I could be crushed

[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.980]
I could raise my head like a kid, I was my man

What's your name again? England How could I forget England? I'm trying to

[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.440]
5.67, here's the pool, what am I giving the number out? I haven't given the pool yet

[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:30.100]
I'm on my head of myself because of that $52.40 price for a barrel of oil, that is crude

[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:36.420]
Now listen, I noticed on our website we had that fantastic thing on there, Requiem for the offensive line

[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.900]
On our behind-the-scenes curtain thing along with Carla Brunai and a bunch of other pretty raunchy stuff

[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.760]
I didn't notice until last night and you had noticed it at all being the non-sport winner

[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.080]
that you are being Mr. Antisports, I'm Antinear, you're Antisports

[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.780]
that the cheerleaders there are the supposed cheerleaders are doing the ass to ask the

[00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.320]
back dome to back dome thing with a colorful that's a beautiful piece by the way there with the dolphin

[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.980]
flashing colors on there the aqua and orange if you notice but anyway if you look at the

[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.580]
faces you realize number nine there we have Jay Feele, number so easy touchy feeling

[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.460]
I did that you know what that those with their heads on there superimposed

[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.980]
no you didn't sure I did my talking about it before the show you pretending you didn't know we

[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.080]
just line or just uh just uh just uh just uh just saving face oh is that it?

[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.940]
I thought you let the whole day feel it let me tell you I don't have much of a face for the five

[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.620]
head ears I wouldn't save it I just started just toss it away like you did with the football

[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:38.700]
over there oh yeah just give it a toss just see where it lands okay it'll wind up something like

[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:47.120]
it fever is dumb and day one step is dumb yeah let's see it I'm gonna play it again because I

[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.440]
don't I don't like the way you uh edited that sorry no if it would have been me I might I might

[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:57.840]
do this fever is dumb and day one step is dumb yeah see that's it that's all you need here

[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.840]
we don't we don't need any rest of that anyway here's today's pool who should WQA and we keep

[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.060]
doing this all over and over again because once they blew up the first team and since that day and

[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:13.040]
I keep mentioning this because it's so embarrassing but since that day it's like to hump the dumpy

[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.900]
thing and they all the Kings horses all the Kings asses and all the Kings men couldn't put the

[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.160]
pieces of the morning together again I'm QA and they not be able to put the pieces of AM radio

[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.240]
ever again I've been saying AM radio has been dead for many years and now uh AM at FM according to

[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:32.240]
stern moisture and he knows his crap supposedly just asking uh AM and FM are big deep doo doo

[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:38.980]
because once the major personalities from any radio commercial radio wind up on serious XM

[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:44.740]
anything like that on the internet uh your regular radio is gonna be worth about a dime you'll

[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.400]
be able to buy radio as it crezies for a dime are they still in business crezies I doubted I'd

[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.660]
never heard of it nice news crezies five and dime all of those joints and probably all of the

[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:59.680]
belly up who should WQ and put on in the morning six to 10 a.m. when Stern veils out in January 2006

[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.980]
not granted 15 months away the good part about that for our listeners is that at least on January

[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:10.880]
one 2006 we got two one of a day it is we go back to attend to no more of this 10 30 10 40 what

[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.980]
was it today about 10 46 I do believe something like that they're about yeah so no more that again

[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.260]
I'm not that I'm complaining I don't want that old crusty fart from New York and have the ass

[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:27.620]
in calling in again oh yeah oh yeah I hope you get the run over by a freight train anyway here

[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:33.620]
there are only choices I put on there so far we don't have any on there yet do we no well I

[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.100]
gave you Bob and Tom right Rick and Sudd which is a property person is gonna be George and

[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.180]
Sudds tomorrow the first vacation show for me and Sudd will be on there to have some free food

[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.200]
and we don't care that Rick Roddy's a grandpa okay says don't pour the audience with Rick's

[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.260]
personal craft somebody like reasons that were delighted the end on the year anymore what somebody

[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:56.420]
like care no we don't why do you care no why don't you admit just right now on here that you

[00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:01.640]
hate Rick like poison and wish you would die a wicked death you run over by a truck or something don't

[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:07.960]
so I'm like that Bob and Tom are you following this now Josh on phone Rick and Sudds and I won't

[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.680]
listen period no matter who we put on the morning they either got some other station or they don't

[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.860]
listen before there's your whatever I won't listen for it and then they can add on whatever names

[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.240]
whatever choices they want you know I mean don't don't don't even him I don't care what you

[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.180]
want to put on sure well we ought to put him on there right now nobody more how I'll suggest that

[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.140]
okay more how we gave it well I was gonna let them have an opportunity to suggest that

[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.540]
absolutely more probably what a code and we got to put him on just by himself where is it

[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:34.200]
going to be like low and guilty like the old and you can put whatever you want I don't care

[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:41.060]
I'm easy more how we gave it low and guilty yeah and we'll see what else they got in mind

[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:47.840]
I'm listening I'm sure that which I find most of us are WNQA and hello

[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.460]
and with a little old man I put him on I'll be ready by then who is it

[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.360]

[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.920]
okay thank you Moe and Juan from little Havana that's good I like that

[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.840]
because that one is really great but see that's the one that I've always don't understand of course

[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:11.260]
we don't work for people who have any concept of what talk radio is all about so the idea that

[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.640]
they never ever said hey would you stop putting the same chronic people on here all the time we

[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.500]
don't want products on here for the death now we'll talk radio they don't get it they just don't

[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:25.080]
understand it or they're just to to justify to go and just say it I just it's just common sense

[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:30.100]
to anybody who's even got the tiniest clue do we have a clue no WNQA and hello

[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.840]

[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:56.260]
saying they're not no longer available so oh we got the real one that doesn't mean that's

[00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:01.060]
mean it's cancelled that means it probably sold out well I like I said I read yesterday that it

[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:05.100]

[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:48.420]
like that nothing could be finer than to beat up on Carolina I don't think they got Carolina

[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.780]
on the schedule they got Arizona which we thought Arizona was really weakened and last Sunday

[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:57.460]
they pounded the crap out in New Orleans so not that New Orleans is too good but we're just trying

[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.720]
to find the team any team that's it often's by when so how do we find out about that about the

it racked as some

[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.120]
weapons of

[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.740]
faster structure

[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.060]

Lane Kato's sum up there's no longer a

[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.260]
pension of

[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.280]
the name is lot and no but no it seems

[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.460]
it's a dull

[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.660]
of being complacent

[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.140]
believe in every word of this hard kill administration

[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.080]
that controlled us by fear through me and a

[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.820]
manipulation and the right

[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:52.360]
we

what santa trying to say

[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.080]

maybe air could do that

[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.560]
the fifth estate last night on cvc

[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.740]

of chan u this is so embarrassing

[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.560]
and it's getting a little bit of play

[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.860]
but you know when they ask grew up

[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.880]
against it's a little bit of your

[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.020]
play when uh... carry farce the wrong

[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.540]
flavors like big news headlines

[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.600]
all he wanted were the facts but digtania

[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.220]
end up generating confusion lots of it

[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.380]
in between all the lies

[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.840]
a slip of the tongue by the vice

[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.320]
administrators show after the debate into

[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.120]
they picked soros not only for his political

[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.420]
views very well said but because the

[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.020]
bayer could afford the costly den you

[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.200]
do hits the cell would receive

[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.960]
in the wake of the debate plus the site

[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.320]
administrators didn't want to point

[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.760]
surface of a candidate site that was

[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.580]
asking for money

[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.500]
soros was not advised that the switch

[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.780]

on the show why tv anybody any slump

[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.720]
even uh... anybody

[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.040]
even regis

[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.120]
even uh... what's his name the guy with the uh... oxycreen what else is

[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.520]
name

[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.000]
i don't know the guy does the uh... what about that

[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.600]
that is the information for whatever is

[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:37.880]
uh...

[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.760]
appeal would be great

[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.100]
that would be good one of those infomercials because they show over and over

[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.420]
and it's good any aridges dot com and get all the

[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.480]
right to make about the pocket fishermen

[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.280]
i'm using it there

[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.520]
well i got times jikkes column american a lot of stuff including former

[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.540]
intel kicker saw the shooting at the secret in

[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.680]
we have to take a lot of calls get this pull going here so far

[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.400]
rick and says are right away with it

[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.860]
and then i won't listen to my report

[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.660]
how come we don't have more in guilty and more in more bandy i don't

[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.100]
we got to get more in guilty on their again together again although

[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.300]
there's a chance of that because the two of them will never work together in

[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.000]
fact i'm sure that moment goes in for my dog today will be confirming that there

[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.800]
is on a scale of minus infinity there are uh... fifty chances

[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:25.520]
uh... them working together again and they are all none and the shades of less than

[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.160]
on whatever shade you want to get

[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.320]
that would be qa hello

[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.760]
ill yes sir

[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.740]
uh... you know i think you have to bring back in the morning

[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.520]
who that

[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.240]
you know

[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.500]
oh yeah fact i said your words is a good job over there at seven ninety

[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.400]
espn the ticket

[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.640]
nine to eleven a.m.

[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.360]
see there i mean

[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.760]
what's the point i'm not going to go off on this whole deal because we just

[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.920]
keep doing this over and over i mean once you break that big drug addict egg

[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.720]
like hunting dumpy

[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.980]
it's very hard to put the pieces back together again and just when we thought

[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.100]
they were all set and signed and delivered when we thought ster was going to

[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.000]
get us the giant ratings for five years to come and when we're going to have

[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.140]
this tremendous lead in and we're going to have like a real short show every day

[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.080]
and they get a lot of money for a little less work and all of a sudden about a

[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.420]
bing

[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.660]
it's time to get serious says howard

[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.160]
who's sick and tired of being censored and working uh... you know in this

[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.540]
horrendous business now where we've paved in see this is the problem i don't

[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:23.180]
i don't blame the fcc i blame the national association of broadcasters i blame

[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.100]
the weak need people in this business are all always peeing in their pants and

[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:26.980]
always cave in

[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.780]
as opposed to like taking this all way to the supreme court even these not

[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:34.100]
these we got in the supreme court would have to admit that the fcc was never

[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.580]
given this kind of power to like picking shoes a lengthy laundry list of uh...

[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.560]
words and interpretations and all the other crap that do to a now that's not

[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.000]
even a purpose of the fcc but don't confuse them with the facts

[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.740]
to the qa hello

[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.260]
uh...

[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.680]
uh...

[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.560]
that that that that that that that was one of my favorites

[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.360]
was that still walking

[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.900]
that's so funny you should mention that

[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.200]
why is that he's got a cd out

[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.860]
i can't wait for her to play a little bit of an omundi i think

[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.320]

[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.240]
raps you know

[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:12.660]
that

[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.480]
you probably never read any of his work

[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.640]
like his book theories of the universe but you might have seen his can you

[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.580]
appearance on the substance now for one night only stand up comedy at its best

[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:31.040]
white isn't a big and lost the road because the first and it's the n a told it to

[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.640]
that's right steven hawking stand up comic he's coming off his stellar performance

[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.660]
of the world physicist convention and he's bringing his act to you don't

[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.180]
miss this opportunity to laugh until you twitch

[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:50.280]
marz and chanetino have in common those are places no man have gone before

[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:57.200]
it's steven hawking stand up comic we are all going to hell and i am driving the bus

[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.360]
he's a panic any so what's the deal the giant element camp kuba revolves

[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:08.140]
constantly canceled so at least yours carlens go live last time we check

[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.460]
right so far so let's cross that out here

[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.080]
about all of the tickets are gone they are yeah everything's gone because that

[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.420]
possible they were good something of value and therefore right and so we had a

[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.480]
daydue indeed well that's amazing that's pretty much that's somebody out there might be

[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:28.140]
listening at least temporarily George carlin next to his

[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.000]
the dejectively she'd remind me and while they last and they don't last any more

Broadway it's Republican musical starring George W. Bush and Dick Taney we're a couple rich man

[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:37.260]
but we're nowhere near as rich as there is white Teresa Hines Republican the musical the great white

[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:45.060]
way has never been this life and the grand old party has never been this old 76 is the average age

[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:52.720]
in this room 76 to ever take a couple years listen to what people are saying about Republicans

[00:30:52.720 --> 00:31:01.860]
the musical I laugh I cried I worried about the Chinese help I've got a bad heart the doctors look

[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:10.800]
in at his chart and the odds are saying I'll never live to see our second-term star

[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.360]
it's George W. Bush and Dick Taney in the Republican musical

[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.700]
join them as they entertain inspired and explain their Mr. Policy

[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:31.580]
we'll borrow we'll borrow we sure love to borrow because that's how bad feels

[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:35.580]
to

[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:35.980]
you

[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.560]
the boss

[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:38.620]
Republicans

[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:44.220]
the musical now preparing for another four-year run at the Rose Garden Theatre

[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:49.260]
on the 32-28th till now we got Mohar David and did the filling in for man dog at two

[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.920]
a wrap because man dog desperately needs a few days off at least one of the hoppers on it for

[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.120]
this afternoon and then we got Hurricane Hotline and seven the beast from on I'm 10 to night

[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.540]
up speeds for itself 80k at 10 o'clock here's a fact that says

[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:07.040]
Neil I for one of them ecstatic about Howard leaving the only problem is that it's not soon enough

[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.040]
I can't wait for your show to get facts in normal lane suggestion for your pool and

[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.180]
his lane not the how it's moving to satellite radio are gonna first to say satellite system or not

[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:19.580]
uh reason I say it's lame is because it's been done a bunch of times the last couple of last two

[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:19.720]
days

[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:27.580]
yesterday morning and uh I think the Sun settled pool said like 42% of the people said yes they

[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:33.440]
love stirring and up to live the pay for the service and to get serious now that's a pretty heavy

[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.660]
duty number you think that 42% of this audience would pay to her the show now they're

[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:43.360]
hope much of them that I'm too crazy about it for free so he's got that loyal uh gathering out

[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.680]
there man millions and millions and it's it'll fly believe me he'll make the money he's got to

[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.160]
turn them around although I still say I don't understand how in their right mind the infinity

[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.600]
people how Viacom can let him go under for 15 months promoting the hell out of serious

[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.940]
which is going to be a direct competition to their commercial broadcast stations I don't get it

[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.580]
and yeah there's the rumor that well they're looking into maybe buying uh serious which would be fine

[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.900]
it would be great for them that would be a perfect fit that is especially as far as solving that

[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.460]
the limits concerned because then there's still repollumoney and the benefits of the steering show

[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.560]
and whatever other shows wind up being on there whatever other shows wind up being on there

[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.820]
you hear that no what say again anyway Tom jicker writes a and Tom call him here and let me

[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:27.260]
message wanted me to call him back and the answer is no last time I talked to you Tom he misquoted

[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:33.200]
me and uh you just I just you know have a great life the message was I'm actually writing a

[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.060]
story about radio like that oh god and like I should give him a gold star in a purple jelly bean

[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:43.940]
or something like that can you believe that yeah I believe it like I'm supposed to be excited

[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:47.260]
that he finally after all these months is writing a story about radio I'll think about Tom

[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.260]
stop it yeah but beside that so anyway this is what Tom jicker writes in these scum

[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:56.120]
sentel today stern headed to satellite radio we know that Tom chance at his news

[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.640]
Howard Stern's enemies have gotten the victory they have pursued for years

[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.880]
detractors of his risk a star like driving the nation's demo on morning radio host off the year

[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.160]
in the process they might be making him incredibly wealthy or wealthier in helping to popularize

[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:12.720]
an alternative form of radio which has no restrictions on content he left out one word there Tom

[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:19.160]
yet Stern who said he's fed up with the FCC crimping his freewheeling racy style announced yesterday

[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:23.720]
on his nationally syndicator radio program he's making a bold leap to the satellite radio subscription

[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:29.580]
service serious like cable TV satellite radio is delivered only two subscribers didn't use

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:34.560]
the public airwaves so it's not something to hear from its scrutiny yet the primary appeal

[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.200]
of satellite radio has been greater variety in programming more than a hundred channels

[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.760]
get it almost every niche taste and music newsports and talk much of it commercial free

[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.080]
serious also square to break through and obtain the exclusive rights to carry all national

[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.760]
footbally broadcast starting this season now what it what does that mean the exclusive

[00:34:51.760 --> 00:35:00.360]
rise i don't understand that i was hoping you'd explain i don't get it i guess as opposed and

[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:06.100]
i still don't get it maybe the networks don't care him like we used to have the cbs i don't

[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:10.880]
always talking about because certainly all the local uh fly to the flagship season they still

[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.880]
carry it and their fillets as well like us anyways as however it's never had exclusivity out of

[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.000]
town with the popularity of reach of stern who undoubtedly will be plugging the service until he

[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.740]
leaves the broadcast style when it's counter for the infinity broadcast he expires at the end of 2005

[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:28.260]
what's more stern said when's the hill attempt to recruit other popular national regional host to

[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:33.020]
serious serious will pay a hundred million dollars annually in production and talent fees to

[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.840]
stern they're also our incentive process for stern based on new subscribers he brings to the

[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.320]
service serious which charges twelve ninety five month in addition to the initial equipment fee

[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:46.140]
said it needs about a million new subscribers nationwide to make the deal viable sirs audiences

[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.700]
estimated to be as high as twelve million daily even though he's carried only about forty markets

[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:56.440]
including Miami for lower LWQAM and West Palm Beach WP using the buzz stern's demonstrated the

[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:01.640]
ability to bring his audience to new venues private parts a biographical theatrical film in which

[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.840]
he started more than forty million dollars at the box office the book on which it was based was a

bestseller as was a sequel miss America nightly television highlights from his radio show are the

[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:14.860]
highest rated programs on the e-cable network and in nineteen ninety four new year's e-specials

[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:19.500]
and read the greatest pay-per-view sales of any non sports programming serious was claimed six hundred

[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.820]
thousand subscribers is banking on stern the closed the gap between it and XM radio its main

[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.840]
competitor which most more than two million customers and charges nine ninety five a month

[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.920]
neither services during the profit their brief history serious reported a loss of one hundred and thirty six

[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.220]
plus million the second quarter XM said lost one hundred and sixty six plus million in the same period

[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.840]
walls we discussed confidence in stern serious shares on the nine's that the same closed yesterday at

[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:48.460]
three eighty seven a share of fifty two cents or over fifteen percent XM finish at twenty nine dollars

[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.900]
a share down forty eight cents or one point six percent by the way of price of crude oil fifty two forty five

[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.340]
money is not the driving force for the dealster and said he's making the move because of the FCC crackdown

[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.400]
stations have paid millions of dollars and fines for a decent-seek of plates against her in program

[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:07.260]
in june industry giant cheap channel agreed to pay one point seventy five million to settle all

[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:12.040]
complaints against her on the six stations owned by the company a payoff infinity's also paid

[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.900]
about two million dollars and fines for stern broadcast over the years the FCC is stepped up and

[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:20.080]
far while we know about that time as a result clear channel is dropped stern from its stations

[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.120]
and other stations that carry them have to put them on delay enabling them to delete what they

[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:28.100]
consider to be borderline material wqa in which picked up stern in august after he was dropped

[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:34.320]
by clear channels wbgg aggressively edits stern often assumption extent that listeners have no idea

[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.460]
what's being discussed that's quite in contrast to what tom wrote on just a week ago sunday in his

[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:44.080]
sunday questions and answers to him in his son sent a uh... uh... tv book when somebody suggested

[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:48.300]
that we're editing and slicing it up like a bunch of switches tom said well you know you can understand

[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.580]
what's going on and we have to you know you have to commend them her having the guts to put it

[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.980]
on with all the heat that goes on and now he says well it's uh...

[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.640]
we aggressively edits stern often assumption extent that listeners have no idea what's being

[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.820]
discussed which is a tom is it real or is it mammarack sweetheart

[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:09.480]

[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:14.480]

the qm executive said the implications to the students will be on just a season that carry him

[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.020]

[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.900]

Rick and Sudden could be on.

[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.760]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.800]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:03.800]

[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:03.800]

[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:03.800]

[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:03.960]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:03.960]

[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:03.960]

[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:03.960]

[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:03.960]

[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:03.980]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:03.980]

[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.420]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:04.420]

[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.400]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.340]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.200]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.700]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.100]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:23.240]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.140]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.960]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.520]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:27.680]
Well, that makes us feel like

[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:27.680]

[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:27.680]

[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:27.680]

[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:27.680]

[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.100]
maybe higher

[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:28.640]
Maybe higher

[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.800]
I'm not the star car racing fans

[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.920]
who heard they'll earn hard June

[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.260]
who heard they'll earn hard June

[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:31.360]
who heard they'll earn hard June

[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:31.720]
who heard they'll earn hard here

[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.060]
If theyhoo

[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.200]
That they would be there

[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.240]
If theyhoo

[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.940]
on a few seconds notice someone who does.

[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.680]
But Earnhardt became the latest victim of the self-sensorship that was unleashed by Janet

[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.620]
Jackson's famous, word-robemental function.

[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:55.660]
NASCAR fight at Jomestar, 25 grand in Dr. and 25 points in the Seed and Championship

[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.500]
race, dropping him into second place.

[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.520]
There's a certain irony here because Earnhardt's father, legendary Dale Senior, was one of the

[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.760]
drivers who helped make NASCAR the wildly popular national sport had become, and as his

[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.540]
nickname, the Intermediator Suggest, was no stranger to hard driving and hard language,

[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.420]
the elder Earnhardt was killed in that Daytona in 2001.

[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:17.820]
Just seconds after he climbed out of his car, TV as Dale Junior would have meant to have

[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:22.380]
now won five races at Telodeiga, his exuberant response, I don't mean Schmidt right now,

[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.620]
Daddy's won here ten times.

[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.500]
He said Schmidt.

[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:31.360]
So find his one thing, NASCAR's an incontestable success and just a probably, and just a concern

[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.800]
about its image, docking points is another, with seven races left to go.

[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.900]
If Earnhardt loses the championship by 25 points or less, the next tell a cup named after

[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.240]
the new sponsor with NASCAR so proud it will be tainted.

[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:46.300]
That was not lost on Kirk Borscht, the driver now and first, because of Earnhardt's penalty,

[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:49.780]
hopefully these 25 points will come into the final factor because we want to beat him

[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:50.340]
on the race track.

[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.420]
There's much talk that NASCAR's leaving behind, may even want to forget.

[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.300]
It's hard, scrabble blue collar roots in the Appalachian South, indeed two of their

[00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.800]
main races are in Kansas, in Arizona, and there's talk of building a track in New York

[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.180]
City.

[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.180]
But NASCAR isn't that far from its roots and it's hard not to agree with Dale Junior's

[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.060]
take on the controversy.

[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:11.080]
If anybody was offended by the four-letter word I said, I can't imagine why they would

[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.780]
have turned into the race in the first place you said.

[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.240]
We're going to have to get used to being a big time sports figure and learn to talk like

[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.120]
when we came to drive, we stayed focused, we tried to stay within ourselves, everybody

[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.560]
went out there did their jobs, thankfully in the end it all came together for us and

[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.280]
it don't mean Schmidt.

[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.880]
I'm sorry, does it mean Schmidt?

[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:27.560]
Don't mean Schmidt.

[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.540]
So there you go.

[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:29.860]
Dale Hardt, Jr.

[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.860]
Dale, whatever's name is, Ponymouth.

[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:33.220]
What a crocker.

[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:34.400]
Schmidt.

[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.340]
Listen, if Josh can say Schmidt, I can say Schmidt.

[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:45.000]
And speak out of that, former NFL kicker saw it in shooting at the home of Sigfried in

[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.580]
Roy, Las Vegas.

[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.700]
I never heard of.

[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:52.760]
I do follow my football, even though I don't care about the dolphins, and by the way, Schmuck

[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.400]
gets a new material.

[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:59.180]
See, there are some people out there that talk about a limited repertoire, like the guy

[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.100]
yesterday that New York, real out there.

[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:07.080]
The reason that so many people left New York, him, you're happy now that how it's leaving

[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.700]
the station because you're always bitching about coming out and saying what the same

[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.300]
career has made him, just they got out a three by five card.

[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.640]
A former play skipper for the Oakland Raiders is being sought in and drive by shooting at

[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:25.780]
the home of entertainer, Sigfried Fishbocker and, and, and, call the murder, never heard

[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.180]
of him, 31, whose three-year NFL career ended after he missed crucial kick during the

[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:33.600]
97 season, was named in a felony warrant stemming from the September 21 shooting sergeant

[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.540]
Chris Jones said.

[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:39.020]
Police identified four as the owner of a white minivan from which shocks were fired at the

[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.520]
compound, owned by the illusionist once known to Sigfried in Roy.

[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.600]
No one was heard from police at Chuck and Pellet Shatterd when there was a left-of-hole

[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.040]
in a wall.

[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.720]
Police have not said if the two men were home at the time.

[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.520]
Jones said police considered four armed and dangerous and said he might be living in

[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.840]
a hotel or camping in southern Nevada or nearby states.

[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.400]
Ford faces six-colony warrant charges of discharge.

[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.340]
I thought we saw Montedy this morning.

[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.520]
Is this the, what, this is from last night, 9 o'clock.

[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.040]
Did we see him on TV?

[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.180]
I did.

[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.880]
Well, anyway, he faces six-colony warrant charges of discharge in a firearm from a motor vehicle.

[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.760]
And two-colony counts of assault with a deadly weapon.

[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.040]
Initially, the case was labeled a hate crime after witness told police to gunmen shouted

[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.320]
that the entertainers could, should get out of the country, later police said it was

[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.300]
not bias-related.

[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:22.460]
And yada yada.

[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.600]
Oh, what's his name?

[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:23.940]
Horn.

[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.140]
That's a, and friends celebrate the 60th birthday on Sunday, a year to the day after the

[00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.800]
near-fatal tiger motornecorn partially paralyzed and forced a long-running sick-free

[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.160]
then church of clothes.

[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:38.620]
And speaking of ceremonies and anniversaries and the dates to a Dutchist Columbus Day, and

[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:40.640]
of course it's Thanksgiving Day of Canada here on Monday.

[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.800]
But guess what this week is the anniversary?

[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.300]
I don't know if it's today or sometime this week.

[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:47.240]
Let me give you a clue.

[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.280]
The acquittal of OJ of the Amchus OJ Simpson.

[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.940]
The much revered, I bet you when somebody left our sales department, you probably took

[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:56.720]
a lot of OJ pictures and blow up dolls with her.

[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.780]
It would seem fine, but there are a lot of choices.

[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.060]
I mean, people are there yet.

[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.780]
We haven't put them on there yet.

[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.120]
We're waiting for somebody to say that.

[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:06.960]
I'm sure he'll call.

[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.520]
Somebody QA, and hello.

[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.100]
QA, and.

[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:12.920]
Hey, that's beer meal.

[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:13.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:14.220]
Be me.

[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.440]
I got two great choices for you, Paul.

[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:18.340]
Different formats.

[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:19.680]
Sports format, right?

[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.720]
They always did a great job filling in.

[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.260]
But Joe Rose and Boot Chami.

[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:23.900]
Yeah.

[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.200]
Okay, forget about that.

[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.620]
Hey, Rose, Joe Rose has got a gig.

[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:27.180]
I don't like it.

[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.220]
I just had a moment to go.

[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.220]
Okay, so forget about that.

[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:29.600]
Good luck.

[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:29.840]
All right.

[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.800]
My other format, you need something we could open for you, even though you have to show the

[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.820]
naked picture of the greatest.

[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.680]
That's the worst it is on show.

[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:38.720]
Yeah.

[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.820]
He goes over it for you in the morning.

[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:40.440]
Okay.

[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.560]
Hey, that's a good idea.

[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:45.640]
Let's put your job on there.

[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.380]
I mean, I thought that I was totally loser, but let's put your job on there.

[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:48.960]
What do I not?

[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:49.560]
Huh?

[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:50.620]
Okay.

[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.180]
I think that was a bad idea myself.

[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:52.560]

[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:53.500]
WQA, and hello.

[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:54.960]
Oh, real?

[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:55.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.460]
That's K-Mart.

[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:57.800]
Now.

[00:50:59.540 --> 00:50:59.820]
Really?

[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.500]
Yes, that's K-Mars.

[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.040]
I used to do well.

[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.260]
No wonder they're going out of business.

[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.000]
Thanks for having good news.

[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.220]
Crescent, you turned into K-Mart.

[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:06.500]
That's where the K came from, huh?

[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.240]
I thought it came from K-Y.

[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.180]
I had no idea.

[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.400]
Because those K-Martsters, they're sure taking it up to you all well.

[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:13.620]
You know, they were that's going.

[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.360]
Oh, bad news.

[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.720]
Bagdad, Green Zone onward after bomb found.

[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.220]
We thought that everything was out of control.

[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.000]
We had like peace and tranquility over there.

[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.620]
And the elections coming in January and all that good stuff.

[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.260]
Well, guess what?

[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.080]
US authorities raised the security alert in the heavily guarded Green Zone.

[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:31.960]
After an improvised bomb was found in front of a restaurant and Bagdad official said today,

[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.340]
the explosive device, thank the Lord, was safely diffused.

[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.060]
Oh, God.

[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:39.840]
Following the security announcement, a loud explosion that was put across Central Bagdad.

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.500]
And white smoke rose from it.

[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.560]
Maybe they picked a new Pope.

[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.740]
White smoke rose from the direction of the Green Zone,

[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.040]
housing or Iraqi government offices.

[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.920]
And the US Embassy wrote his witness and said,

[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.980]
the interior ministry and the US military had no media comment on the cause of the blast.

[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.140]
All in front of it says that the Green Zone were closed down.

[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:55.940]
People working there said,

[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.820]
is there something that they blow that the smoke at the Vatican?

[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.300]
Locally, they select the new Pope and announce they're all way made of choice here.

[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.100]
That's one thing the Catholic Church is really good at is blowing smoke.

[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:12.860]
The Church of God is showing the Rogers mornings in the day and

[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:16.840]
the morning around the clock to fight the evil spirit.

[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.740]
Smart Morgan is the 12-1 hour on Q-8-L.

[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:34.200]
American girls and American girls who only listen to the message from the Uber ride

[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:39.240]
will have their tables offline as the troops come home dead.

[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:44.880]
They find it comfort of the night, hiding under the bed.

[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.500]
I never served in the army, I'm too afraid to fight,

[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.480]
so I sit right here near the TV far from the world.

[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.280]
I, under the troopers, yield the scurver,

[00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:58.980]
I'm a big Christian,

[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:03.760]
do it prepared at some butter, do the fighting for me.

[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:08.040]
Now this country I love is occupied and I ride,

[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:12.660]
and all the summers like me whose nicks are crad in the back

[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.720]
have our tongues all placed firmly.

[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.880]
In Pusha's dig brown eye,

[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.560]
the big mouth's ours of the world who gladly follows time.

[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.460]
Hey Uncle Shal, till afraid,

[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.320]
she might already list,

[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:31.700]
but you can count on me to watch TV and shake my fist

[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:35.980]
and my flag will fly from the back of my truck.

[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.880]
Knocked in any odd, extrude of hatred,

[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:40.320]
odd again, I'm not both-

[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:46.060]
And my view of the full ride world is what I see on Fox News.

[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.540]
Yeah, I'm an armed terror warrior,

[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.600]
who knows better than you.

[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:18.000]
I'm an in-bred jerk, who parrots anything they say.

[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:22.600]
Don't have a readerist or kid so much easier this way.

[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.140]
To watch TV or looking pictures.

[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.880]
In Pusha today,

[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.060]
with my-

[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.800]
I made desproportitics,

[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.660]
as I chingled my brain,

[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:36.960]
and Uncle Shal,

[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.100]
through his braid,

[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.000]
to battle and list,

[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:44.460]
but you can count on me to watch TV and shake my fist

[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.140]
as I know my flag,

[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.280]
so I can pull on my-

[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.060]
That's long advice!

[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.520]
They proudly show the spots they cut that chewed on my-

[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.440]
That's the right, the saw they saw our-

[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.200]
Back to brands in the world,

[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:58.380]
on those Iraqis or Jews.

[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:04.100]
Oh, I am, yeah, I'm an armed terror warrior,

[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:07.140]
who knows better than you.

[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:13.580]
I'm an in-bred jerk, who parrots anything they say.

[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.560]
I'm a little surprised that I'm in this big red-

[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.260]
I'm in this big red-

[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:19.240]
Go to lunch, George.

[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:20.640]
Go to lunch.

[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.660]
Will you go to lunch?

[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.200]
Take a look at that heavy gunfire,

[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.020]
and I had that story sitting here from, uh,

[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.320]
about nine o'clock this morning,

[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.360]
where we were confedulating.

[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.420]
And CNN just-

[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.300]
and I just got through talking about it only moments ago,

[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.360]
and I'll see him discovered that there's heavy gunfire

[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:36.380]
in Baghdad, and there's smoke, the blow and smoke.

[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.540]
Maybe like I said, the Pope is, uh, a-a-a-a-thorough-us.

[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.000]
But in any rate,

[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.160]
trace your fireflies past Baghdad Hotel,

[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.060]
and of course that's where many of the journalists

[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:45.840]
are staying right now.

[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:46.860]
Keep shooting.

[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.460]
You're at that despite our fight that's under way,

[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.480]
that has been under way outside the hotel.

[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.120]
We're CNN reporters.

[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:54.140]
Fuck, you're an idiot.

[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:56.880]
There's other CNN-

[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.140]
I'm exactly with the state.

[00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:59.340]
Look at this.

[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.260]
Let's watch this video.

[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:01.240]
Ah!

[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:03.560]
Watch it.

[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.580]
Yeah, you see, you see over there?

[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:06.820]
Yeah, the light-

[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.680]
Oh, light-

[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:09.580]
Oh, oh.

[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.420]
Yeah.

[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:12.460]
It's definitely green.

[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.920]
No, no, no, no.

[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.800]
You've got the light on.

[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:23.360]
What?

[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:29.860]
Skins, damage.

[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:37.280]
Again, man.

[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:40.960]
that video takes shot only within the past few minutes from Baghdad.

[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.320]
The voice you're hearing on the tape that a Brent Sadler is

[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.260]
directing everyone to turn off the lights.

[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:51.320]
Where we do our broadcasting from in Baghdad.

[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:53.700]
Fireflies are working really well.

[00:56:54.500 --> 00:57:00.060]
So many international journalists are are basing including CNN's.

[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:04.740]
Firefighter we don't have details on casualties or damage or anything

[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:05.520]
along those lines.

[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.580]
I expect to get someone from our CNN operation in Baghdad.

[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.460]
I'm told we're going to try to give us some more information.

[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.320]
Explorers in the Gulf are in Baghdad and they just discovered

[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.740]
maybe one of their CNN Miami people is listening to the show.

[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:19.920]
And he said, hey, we better check this out or something going on over there.

[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.380]
I mean, this is not breaking news.

[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:25.000]
This story's been going on for hours now and the CNN comes

[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:25.280]
to breakfast.

[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:27.500]
All breaking news and here's what's great with it.

[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.620]
The Abnaxis beard and that's sneer on his poise.

[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.240]
Hermon hearing junior.

[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.700]
House ethics committee speaking of Machi's

[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.980]
Abnaxis Tom Delay again, which we say.

[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.720]
Not again, huh?

[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.280]
Yeah, I'd rather late than never again, right?

[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:40.840]
All right.

[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.000]
For the second time in two weeks, the House ethics committee has

[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.820]
issued admonishments to majority-lead Tom Delay over his conduct,

[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.900]
warning the Texas Republican to temper his future actions

[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:52.340]
to comply with House rules and standards of conduct.

[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.180]
What I should point something out to you about this thing would be

[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.860]
a satellite radio before you get too excited.

[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.380]
They're already, as a result of the stirring announcement yesterday,

[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.180]
they're counseling others at the FCC already are advising.

[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:06.820]
And of course, I'm sure that in cooperation with many

[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.900]
of the Nazis in Congress like people like Tom Delay,

[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:11.060]
they're already accelerating.

[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.600]
Remember, they were going to try to do anything

[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:13.640]
with satellite and cable.

[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:14.980]
Well, they're going to accelerate that.

[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.700]
And I would be willing to suggest that before

[00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:23.160]
a stirring order is the very first word on serious in January 2006.

[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.700]
I hope I'm wrong, but I have a feeling that this is what they're

[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.520]
going to do as a shot across the bow,

[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.700]
as the legal type like to say, a shot across the bow.

[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.220]
They're going to regulate that.

[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.340]
And the Congress said, oh, yeah, we agree.

[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:38.780]
And Congress already agrees.

[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.300]
Look at the votes on the Indicency Bill.

[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:41.780]
My God, we're only three or four people

[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.980]
at a cajon's to vote against it.

[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:46.940]
So there you are.

[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:47.500]
I'll still believe.

[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:49.520]
That's what I'm thinking.

[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.320]
Is that before it ever even gets to that point?

[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.820]
So before you go out and invest in your serious radio,

[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.260]
I would kind of like to cover yourself accordingly

[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.900]
and keep an eye out like Colombo.

[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.660]
And see what's going to happen with us.

[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.100]
Because I don't think it's going to be what you think it is.

[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:04.780]
Anyway, the committee announced yesterday,

[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.240]
last night, that it had unanimously

[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.300]
had managed to lay in two counts of an ethics complaint.

[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.300]
filed against him.

[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:11.280]
I represented Chris Bell, a Texas Democrat,

[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.260]
who lost his reelection bid after Texas led

[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:13.980]
just like this past year,

[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.680]
redistricting plan engineered by the number two House Republican.

[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.480]
What are Wednesdays of management stem from the fundraiser

[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.180]
delay hosted for energy company officials

[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:23.320]
while Congress was considering major energy

[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:23.800]
legislation.

[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.800]
Sounds like those closed-door energy meetings

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.800]
that Dick Cheney had that he won't tell anybody about it

[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.400]
with whom or what.

[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.200]
Never had any of those.

[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.260]
The other concerned contracts the contact

[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:33.780]
his office had with the FAA during a partisan fight

[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:35.280]
over redistricting in Texas.

[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.920]
He's a crook just about every politician

[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.700]
who was ever born is a freaking crook just about.

[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.800]
Maybe they're a couple of honest ones,

[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.440]
which means they probably never got reelected

[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:42.980]
in the first place.

[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.380]
That's why you don't hear from them no more.

[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.120]
I'm almost thinking of changing that pool.

[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.020]
I don't think we're going to be allowed.

[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.440]
Oh, this is all going on at the Baghdad Sheraton.

[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.300]
I'm going to throw back Dad.

[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.540]
Yes, I just said well.

[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:57.680]
567-0560, Tom 562 on the Verizon and singing the Royal

[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:57.960]
Sun.

[00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.720]
And here I thought everything was under control.

[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:00.060]
Did you?

[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:00.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.620]
They kept saying, oh, we're fine.

[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.680]
And those elections coming up and things are great.

[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.720]
Let's start looking at the good things that are going on

[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.100]
in Iraq.

[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.900]
And that's just all these liberal nitpickers

[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.660]
along the point to a few brushfires and gunshots

[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:14.640]
and dead bodies and all dead kids and things like that.

[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.020]
And two more dead American soldiers today.

[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.160]
He's not a two more.

[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.020]
567-0560, Tom 562 on the Verizon and singing the Royal

[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:23.340]
Sun.

[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.660]
Who should WQ input on the in the morning, 610 when

[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.960]
Stern fails out January 2006?

[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.480]
What were you going to change the pool too?

[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:31.740]
I don't know.

[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.040]
I had a couple of things where I'm not going to change it.

[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.020]
Why the hell should I do that?

[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.800]
So you just want to, you just want on there.

[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.980]
We have a chance to get there.

[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:41.740]
You got five votes.

[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.460]
250 votes.

[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.340]
Ricken says 120.

[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.780]
I won't listen no matter what 65.

[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.680]
Bob and Tom look what they got.

[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.020]
Bob third man.

[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.240]
Moe Howard David was one from the little of Anna 19.

[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.480]
Moe Howard David and Jody Steve Geldt,

[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.720]
Yeldt Steve, Oliver.

[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:55.840]
And I don't know if you have breath.

[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.760]
That's never going to happen.

[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.200]
Don I miss 6, 8.

[01:00:59.420 --> 01:00:59.980]
Who do we appreciate?

[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.240]
And George has got five.

[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:02.020]
But he just went on there.

[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.000]
So give it a chance.

[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.620]
Give him a cut him some slack or not.

[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.020]
WQA and hello.

[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.440]
Great day, I am.

[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.000]
WQA and hello.

[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:12.840]
Hola.

[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:13.920]
Hello.

[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:14.760]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:15.840]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:16.340]
Neil Rogers.

[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.040]
Speaking.

[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.340]
Tell me if I'm wrong.

[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.040]
I thought I heard something about some shooting in Baghdad.

[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.100]
No, I think your wife has a major study rumor.

[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.600]
Yeah, well, it's only been going on for about a year.

[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:29.300]
Right.

[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.400]
And now it's in the Baghdad.

[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.220]
Wow.

[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.020]
I hope that nobody gets shot up too bad.

[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.040]
Yes.

[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.120]
Unless they're.

[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.220]
Unless, of course, they're evil doers.

[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.440]
That's what the key is.

[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.560]
You know, I mean, we hope that some people get shot up.

[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.220]
We are real bad, but especially the evil doers.

[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.800]
We don't seem to be having too much success

[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.820]
getting a hold of them.

[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.220]
WQA and hello.

[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:52.600]
This way.

[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:53.420]
Mexico.

[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.120]
Yeah, WQA and hello.

[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:57.600]
Q.A.M.

[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.940]
Maybe they could bring back.

[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.040]
Charlie.

[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:02.320]
Who is it?

[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:03.660]
Be State Charlie.

[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:04.760]
Yeah, be State Charlie.

[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.240]
I think he's going to be on a Monday morning

[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.680]
as a matter of fact, instead of the Stern Show.

[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.580]
We'll be State Charlie.

[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.380]
WQA and hello.

[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.040]
People run, heard you in Carolyn.

[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.160]
Oh, no chance on that one.

[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:15.580]
V-Pole.

[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.460]
Let's put V-Pole on here.

[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:16.940]
What do you say?

[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.380]
Get out for it.

[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.380]
Should have done it from the beginning.

[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:19.780]
Should have done it.

[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.960]
Now we shouldn't have done it from the beginning.

[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.720]
I was waiting for somebody to call in and for his along.

[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.360]
Now over an hour for somebody to call and suggest that.

[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.100]
Because he's just, well, he's many things.

[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:30.400]
But the one that really gets me is.

[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.740]
That's the one that really gets to me.

[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:34.160]
That whole engine business.

[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:34.960]
But that's OK.

[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.180]
Can't hold that against him forever.

[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.000]
And I would be surprised.

[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.460]
He was already being offered a job anyway, along with the

[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:40.780]
moment.

[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.480]
I'm thinking Mophaux is what I'm thinking.

[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.840]
Mophaux and V-Pole.

[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.140]
I'm thinking that's where it's going to go.

[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:48.980]
But that's a long way to go.

[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.660]
Who the hell knows what's going to happen between now and

[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.220]
January 1?

[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.940]
Lausier List is coming, January 1, 2006.

[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:55.800]
WQA and hello.

[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:57.260]
Hello.

[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.280]
Programming line.

[01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:58.520]
Yes.

[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.040]
WQA and hello.

[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:04.900]
Alvin and Harriet.

[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.240]
She's a little bit of a bit of a guess.

[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:06.720]
Great.

[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.680]
Never better, Palli.

[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:08.500]
Fantastic.

[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.360]
I'd like to ask you the monsters.

[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.340]
The morning comes out here from Orlando.

[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.000]
They're pretty much.

[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:13.920]
Monsters are the morning.

[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.240]
They're outside the run in the midday.

[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.680]
No, they were in the midday, not in the morning.

[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.080]
Oh, I heard they blow.

[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.600]
They're pretty funny.

[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:21.640]
They're all right.

[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.140]
They were talking about it.

[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.500]
You heard nothing but about them.

[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.860]
And again, maybe it's just some of our negative people out there.

[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:29.580]
But I've heard a lot of really hostile verbiage about the monsters

[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.980]
of the midday, what have they recalled?

[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.500]
And I got one more thing for you.

[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:32.760]
Yes.

[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:36.700]
I went to both in the, I guess, was the primary, whatever it was.

[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.500]
A couple of months ago.

[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.360]
I walked in in church.

[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:42.340]
And there was an old blue hair in front of me.

[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.400]
And a couple of blue hairs behind the counter there.

[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.940]
And the first thing they said to this lady when she walked in,

[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.400]
she said, Democratic Republican, the moment said Republican.

[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.740]
She goes, I thought so.

[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.120]
Really?

[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:53.820]
That was nice.

[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:54.400]
Wow.

[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.600]
I said, I said, I said, Democratic.

[01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:58.380]
I did.

[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.040]
I did see about a swastika tattoo on her forehead.

[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.220]
Was that the first one?

[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.220]
It was terrible.

[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.460]
And then I said, Democratic, I got a third shoulder.

[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.320]
There was anyone to show me how to use the machine.

[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.680]
Of course, they would buy it.

[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:11.040]
I think that's what we get to look for.

[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.560]
Do you want me to move into Georgia, far where you call?

[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.600]
I start moving up the coast.

[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:15.580]
Yes, I do.

[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.640]
The way saying time to look to you.

[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:17.460]
I'll see you at the border, man.

[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.240]
I'll see you there at the Niagara Falls.

[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.100]
OK, just jump right across, saying it that far.

[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.100]
Just swim right across.

[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:23.680]
You ever been to Niagara Falls?

[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:24.280]
Have I asked you that?

[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.340]
Yeah, no.

[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.320]
And you haven't been there?

[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:27.880]
No, no.

[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:28.780]
Well, don't waste you.

[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.920]
I mean, just too many other places.

[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:30.780]
What a word I'm going to see.

[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.980]
It's just, you know, I feel like water pushing

[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:33.700]
nobody into the thing.

[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.600]
Yeah, rather good.

[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:36.560]
Waterfalls, so I am.

[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:36.800]
Right.

[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.580]
I mean, it's not a big deal.

[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.080]
I mean, it can be breathtaking, especially early in the morning when there's the fog

[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.680]
and the steam and it's all like, hey, yo, I'm the mist.

[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.760]
In fact, you walk outside, it feels like it's raining.

[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:47.800]
Right?

[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.680]
Because it's misting.

[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.260]
You know what I mean?

[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:49.880]
It's misty.

[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.860]
And police when it's there, we just like a water, playing misty for me.

[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.440]
That's the movie.

[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:53.960]
Yes, it was.

[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.280]
But it's misting over there.

[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.700]
My eyes are misting, just thinking about, don't go there.

[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.120]
Because then you go to the casino, you waste all your hard earned money.

[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.640]
And especially that new one in Niagara Falls, a beautiful place.

[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.600]
But all brother, those machines are tighter than a witch's earlobe.

[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:09.980]
They are really tight.

[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.480]
Fire racking security forces.

[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:17.000]
Will they be able to quickly locate where this gunfire, where this tracer fire is?

[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.900]
They're in the dark, but they're in the dark.

[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:25.020]
And then launch their own Iraqi security personnel to go out and find something new and

[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.780]
unsettling today, boys and girls.

[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.160]
Violence and chaos in Iraq.

[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:50.820]
Layer foxes at the direction we will not stay

[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:56.900]
until we are the-,

[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.120]
at the sign沒有.

[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.040]
To it every day

[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:01.980]
You're

[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.380]
Third

[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.640]
I want to watch it on TV

[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.060]
I write

[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.440]
I write

[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.660]
The beginning was apparently a walk in the town

[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.200]
We did not know

[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.380]
It should take a day

[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.500]
You went off your spot on an Twitch

[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.100]
I write

[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.380]
I write

[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.000]
I write

[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.000]
I want to wake up

[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.380]
And she's as serious

[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.620]
Don't exist

[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.100]
Put in the air

[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.740]
And tell that

[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:40.340]
Saddamer saying

[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.120]
We're really pissed

[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.540]
You're under my skin

[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.320]
That little piece of shit

[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.200]
It gets away

[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:58.520]
I'll get the mob to make a hit

[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.920]
From the world

[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.680]
To the world

[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.460]
A wreck

[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:04.800]
You come

[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.600]
And stop

[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.420]
And you go

[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.620]
Off the town

[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.060]
We don't know

[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:14.520]
It's time to bomb

[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.540]
I write

[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.880]
I write

[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.260]
You're third

[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:30.580]
I write

[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:32.540]
I write

[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.780]
I want to wake up

[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:41.360]
And see that city is on board to fix it

[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.860]
I want to see that

[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.540]
And say that

[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.320]
Wind number one

[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.780]
That's all that he said

[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.860]
We can't be people

[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:53.600]
Again we have one

[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.740]
And

[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.520]
Spot

[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.460]
Coming

[01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.360]
I

[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.520]
I

[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.260]
I want to see that city

[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:04.740]
Wind number one

[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.060]
That's all that he said

[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.400]
Put in the air

[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.800]
Let's make your heart

[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.100]
And you are the best

[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.000]
Down

[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.680]
I write

[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:20.740]
I

[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.740]
I

[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:24.740]
I

[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.440]
Remember the points of their

[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:30.060]
I'll do a show

[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.560]
With that six chair

[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.000]
And say good bye

[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.420]
Oh, I write

[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.740]
I write

I write

I write

[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.020]
I wrote

[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.620]
Total certainly hits

[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:50.520]
Yeah, well I'm banged

[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:16.340]
I get out of your

[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.160]
Fancy

[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.040]

[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:52.560]
I

[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.220]
I

[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.080]
I

[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:55.080]

[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:55.080]

[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:55.080]

I

[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:57.880]
I

[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.360]
I

[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:58.360]

[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:58.440]
I

[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.140]
Would

[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:10.320]
that we can't do anymore. Frank says let's see now see you people your intent all right look

[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.100]
we'll put them on here even though he's already got a deal maybe I don't know what his deal is

[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:18.020]
I don't know if he's on a contract over there with the SPN radio I don't know how long it is or the

[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:23.440]
contract either but yeah we'll put your arrows on here. Sure. Now this suggestion here I'm going

[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.960]
to fly because Mad Dog already has been offered a chance to do mornings in these 85,000 changes

[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.000]
I've got on these generations since the first team got blown away and then I'm going to have

[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.780]
Mad Dog inked up before in the morning to come in and do it morning show. Nor is somebody else

[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:39.980]
I know. My hope would be a new morning show with Joe Rosen's in mandatory says being that they're

[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:43.720]
and they are and were the best personalities after you want to stay in the end for the river

[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.880]
together would be awesome. I agree that would be a great show but I ain't going to have them but

[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.860]
we'll put your arrows on there he'll go zooming up the ladder right? Yes indeed. Here's another one

[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:56.140]
that says for the pull Randy Rhodes this is also speculative speculating yeah because I like

[01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:02.020]
huh this is a fantasy pull after Carrie wins their AmeriCorps will cease to exist it's in I

[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:11.480]
didn't know that they still do exist as a matter of fact I just love that anything I haven't

[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:17.640]
been without Frank and I can't tell I am for what's her name? Catherine Lamford. Laying for I can't

[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:25.240]
get that name right I don't know what it is blazing it on my head I sing well at some pretty

[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:30.980]
compelling radio. Listen to this competing polls reveal Florida remains a toss up there are two

[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:36.100]
polls and so you'll gravitate to its other one you believe in president Bush leads John

[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:40.680]
Carrie in the battleground state of Florida 48-44% of Quinn would new poll release yesterday but

[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:45.420]
let's see Bush's lead is within the surveys four percent is point margin bear meaning the

[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:50.820]
sunshine states it'll a toss up this poll a 625 likely voters was conducted October 4 and 5 by

[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:55.820]
Mason Dixon polling research for the hero that several other Florida news organizations the survey

[01:11:55.820 --> 01:12:00.500]
also found that 2% of likely voters support third candy a party candy Ralph Nader in a 65

[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:08.020]
quartet 1% support other candidates and 5% still like Florida they don't know now a second

[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:15.060]
poll showed Wednesday yesterday that Carrie was leading Bush 47-45% well first it says Mason

[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:19.620]
Dixon pulls the Brad Coker says Florida clearly remains a battleground it's tight it is really tight

[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:25.480]
but the other poll shows Carrie 47 Bush 45 made her 2% 6% on the side that CC Nader continues

[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:30.480]
being a factor because some of you people are two things two of the are the SS crowds like the

[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:35.060]
president stupid and stubborn that's exactly Bush stupid and stubborn so you're going to help

[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:38.800]
to put Bush in for another four more years or hell as Teresa Heinz Carrie said four more

[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.100]
years of nightmare and you're gonna have blood on your hands when you vote for a Ralph Nader

[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:47.240]
I'm telling you that right there you go the American research group poll of 600 likely voters

[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.380]
October 2nd the fifth that margin error plus a minus four like the other one did too

[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:55.940]
Coker said polling in parts of Florida does such as the interstate four corridor across the

[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:59.620]
center of the state's ejection that Bush had opened up a double digit lead and voted before

[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:04.380]
the first presidential the late September 30th said Bush was up by a quick and personal

[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:09.020]
response to the hurricanes it's been a roller coaster coca coca said we've had two

[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:13.300]
conventions for hurricanes in a debate and now now we're back where we started

[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:17.320]
while Bush has managed to hold a small even the Mason Dixon polls and say pre-conviction

[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:22.080]
bounce in July he's still whatever this pre-conviction survey he's still well-short

[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.320]
of building a solid or commandingly to support main at the same at 48 percent but Carrie has

[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.480]
been able to gain in the states in summer losing two points since a July Mason Dixon

[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.840]
did that's in that poll you got it got it coca said there are fewer Nader supporters

[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.780]
than there were in 2000 more likely to oppose both both and Carrie well doesn't that's weird

[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.800]
these are voters whoever problem with both candidates the Nader vote isn't coming out of the

[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:49.380]
Carrie problem and wouldn't go yeah right right Bush as we would understand was strongest

[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:53.420]
in north Florida where he got 62 percent Carrie was strongest in southeast Florida where 57

[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.740]
percent of the voters favored him the two were more evenly divided in central Florida and on

[01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:02.560]
the Gulf Coast and now the audio among whites Bush led 51 to 41 percent among Cubans and

[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:10.440]
other Hispanics 64 to 29 percent Carrie led among blacks 87 to 6 percent Bush was stronger among

[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:16.300]
voters age 35 to 64 Carrie had an age among voters younger than 34 and older than 65 how do you

[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:24.720]
like that Carrie had an age among voters younger than 34 and older than 65 Florida men split 54 to 38

[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.800]
for Bush and women split 50 to 42 percent for Carrie so yeah believe whatever you want to believe

[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:37.620]
pick a poll you know pick whichever one suits your fancy makes you feel better 56705 60 pound

[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:24.940]
public that yes yes yes absolutely positive how do you watch this long before we have a civilized

[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:28.140]
country is around the rest of the world like here in Canada and the people are putting a hate

[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:33.420]
bush like poison and I mean to have an American like well here's a great leader nobody there's

[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:38.080]
nobody on this planet it hates Bush more than I you know what he is learning this country into the

[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:43.560]
ground yeah and with education health care and all the domestic issues right and all the people

[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:48.020]
that are dying in Iraq right now as we speak right yeah and lizard man who's probably running the

[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:51.900]
whole shield behind the war and the warlords who are running Afghanistan again but there's a

[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:56.060]
phony elections we have coming up in Karzai who's nothing more than a puppet for Unicael if they

[01:15:56.060 --> 01:16:00.160]
help over there who don't know they kid man you know why doesn't Bush do it old honest they did

[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.920]
go to the theater pal oh geez

[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:12.160]
still hit that button yeah couple of times just we have to be a tourist okay him although I

[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.000]
think he had a very good point or something something probably have to explain it to him

[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:22.560]
you are listening to Neil Roger how do you say it here on 560-16-2-8 and

[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:42.460]
I'm George Bush and I've proved this message America is facing some tough choices that's why

[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:49.000]
this November the best choice is John Kerry what hey this ain't the message I've proved because

[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.980]
John Kerry knows how to make the tough choices okay if I did approve it I did do it on purpose

[01:16:54.980 --> 01:17:00.840]
but John Kerry will do more than make the tough choices I got people shabbing papers in my face 24-7

[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:06.860]
times of time I don't even know what I'm saying it John Kerry will make the right choices I make 10,000

[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:13.580]
choices a day I think it can't I'll be right right now it's your turn to choose I choose for you to

[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:19.100]
cut me some slack and end this thing right here and this November the choices clear okay I'll tell

[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:26.700]
you what as your commander in chief I order you to stand down make the right choice both for John

[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:32.840]
Kerry no don't make the right choice both for me oh wait that didn't come all right give me

[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:39.360]
another round that what yeah come on I'm John Kerry and I approve George Bush's approval of this

[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:46.980]
message sugar com 32 of 560 of an EQ and Allison Miley sent me a very depressing fact because

[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:51.160]
after he goes through this whole thing about Glenn Beck said this and this one said that and about

[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:56.480]
how they lied about the war and all this stuff he says in the last sentence here I'm still on

[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:00.860]
the fence on this one unfortunately my profession benefits to my Republican president but I'm

[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:06.300]
turned between personal or national interests oh my god Alice that is so sad don't be like my

[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:10.460]
tell you I'm gonna vote for Bush because I get these have this big income and if I'm gonna get

[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:15.740]
these big tax cuts which I don't need number one number two I mean weren't happy to give back my

[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.240]
tax cuts and exchange for like a given a few freedoms back and they're gonna come through with

[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:24.560]
the same president or at least close to it we need a buffer baby Kerry and Democrats are a

[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:29.280]
weak and they're really weak but at least they're a buffer and at least they give us a chance

[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:33.920]
of something a little bit of hope a little tiny light at the end of the tunnel not much we're

[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:39.360]
still waiting information they're still waiting to find out oh look at this this a

[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:45.720]
tax was so good from Alice you sent it to me twice that's good I didn't intend to well at least

[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:51.200]
watch out a little bit okay don't be selfish like some people I know and believe me I know

[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.840]
many of those the money people hey these people are working finance all this other crap

[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.420]
for men dread man I'm tired of selfish people who just the too stupid to understand the

[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:06.360]
implicate and by the way let me just double check it again on the gambling channel let me just

[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.620]
take a flip over there to CNBC once again because I don't want to give you numbers there

[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:16.000]
oh 52 55 that's the highest I've seen all day for crude oil 52 dollar and 55 cent a barrel

[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.500]
I'm thinking maybe it's 60 what I like just go sit up there get that Fahrenheit 9 11 DVD

[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:27.100]
sit there and watch it especially the parts about the Saudis okay just sit there and watch

[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:30.420]
it the connection between the Saudis in the Abush family it's a cute little music

[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:37.000]
and our Bush yeah and take a look at the pictures of 15 to those slime ball terrorists from 9 11

[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.040]
Saudi nationals and then you kind of wonder well what's this all about what's

[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:48.540]
is read all about and again unicorn there's uh humming carzae or a big man in Afghanistan right he's

[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:52.780]
a wonderful man and the elections are all fixed already anyhow you can read about it on the internet

[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:56.840]
I think I put a story out there for tomorrow the elections are already rigged in Afghanistan so

[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.200]
what's the big simmits what's the big deal carzae will be violence like because he's our handpicked

[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:06.540]
puppet just like a lawi in Iraq same thing another CIA stooge just like they thought

[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:10.480]
would ask my child me until we find out that he was like a snitch in a given secrets to Iran

[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.260]
and of course we shouldn't know he was a crook because the rest of the world did already

[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:19.720]
but he was our man who's our crook see we hate it when that happens yeah get with it Alex and the

[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:24.220]
rest of you too how like the other color said before how is it possible that anybody could be this

[01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:29.020]
stupid you got a president who lied about his sexual phecutalism we went through an embarrassing

[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:33.680]
at least two years of impeachment hearings and all the southern garbage that went on a Kenny

[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:39.300]
star in his pornographic report all of this gnashing he had wasting of time and diverting

[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:46.480]
from the real issues at hand and now we got a guy who lies in order to get the neocons their way

[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:50.720]
so he can go into a rack and start going after the world and again when you see in fair night 9-11

[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:56.020]
the deal with a Taliban and you look right now at the pipeline you know how they informed the

[01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:59.260]
first things they did was open up the world pipeline through civil society Israel that was on the very

[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:04.800]
first things when they went into a rack I just mentioned that in passing to two more Palestinian

[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:10.180]
kids killed in Gaza strip but again like Kerry rather Edwards and Cheney said that I'm eight

[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:14.340]
the other night oh we don't care about that is what in essence they said nothing knows many words

[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:18.700]
but that's what they said essentially see Israeli kids that are dying for these terrorist

[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:26.000]
these suicide bombers the right no Palestinians dying just pandering and pandering and pandering

[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:32.820]
because that's what politicians do best they all do it all four of them and the panders WDQAM

[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:22.520]

[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:27.000]
politicians are all right yeah I didn't say they're all the same I said that they're all a bunch of

[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.100]
crooks crooks yeah liars right so does that go across the board for all of them jimsy's transgencies

[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:46.000]
one of those people to say oh I'm saying our president oh you know whichever what it is they're

[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.460]
all a bunch of losers man that's why Howard Dean didn't get the nomination because he was a

[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:55.220]
little bit too much on the outside of the he wasn't part of the establishment and he said too

[01:22:55.220 --> 01:23:00.660]
many things that they weren't too crazy about such as we're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma

[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:07.960]
and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico we're going to California and Texas and New York we're

[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:13.900]
going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan and then we're going to Washington and

[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:25.620]
Mexico way I got the perfect ticket for the Olympic Democratic Party Howard Dean the perfect

[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:31.080]
ticket Al Franken and Julie Bergman oh boy it's the win factor you've heard of the O'Reilly

[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:37.660]
factorist the win factor so we've been in Al Franken and we've been in California

[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:47.920]
cabinet oh brother 560 05 60 pound 560 on a Verizon singular wireless lines they're all

[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:54.360]
pathetic they're tragic and carry and he's grown a small pair but boy he sure is held back and

[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:58.280]
held back and hasn't really come out and told him like it is and now all of a sudden he's as they

[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:03.180]
like to say he's fighting his voice now that he's kind of been politically backed up against the

[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:06.800]
wall the last couple of months now all of a sudden he's grown a pair and they brought in the

[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.100]
Clinton people to say hey listen cut the crap nobody cares about who did what the

[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:14.900]
human be at non 30 years ago let's talk about what 30 years ago let's talk about what

[01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:19.420]
those going on now and let's rip these people and ask and what they really like I said just lost

[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:24.020]
the golden opportunity they could be double digit points ahead but they blew the golden opportunity

[01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:29.960]
to the Democratic convention oh well we want to be nice you know they're attacking them with

[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:33.380]
a bunch just like the thing with Edwards and Cheney the other night they're talking you know

[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:38.000]
she's asking her in seven questions and out of nowhere the one question was just I don't even

[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.840]
know what the question was but she asked a question and Cheney goes off on a tangent about

[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:47.480]
Edwards he never met him before which of course was a lie until the debate and his attendance

[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:51.400]
record was put he goes into this vicious personal attack with Cheney as famous for doing

[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.320]
that had nothing to do with the question and of course Edwards didn't bother answering

[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.180]
them the questions either like a question about AIDS you know he spent about a minute and a half

[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:04.480]
of his two minutes of a lot of time there going back to a previous question because he

[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:12.300]
did one of them ought to talk about certain issues okay yeah anyway here's the facts that says

[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:16.800]
it doesn't matter who replaces Stern in January 2006 because other than your show and Stern

[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:21.440]
show which is indicated anything great puts on locally will be 45 minutes an hour of spots

[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:27.860]
so what effing difference does it make ask this very first the case is uh caller or a faxor whatever

[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:32.340]
he is it is and it says can you play the audio of the firefighting Baghdad and our idiot child

[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:36.720]
president telling us how wonderful everything is going in that would be good we just enfranchised

[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:43.520]
by an elected president because their cities are still ungovernable and how they'll react to that

[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:49.500]
this enfranchisement the cities are still ungovernable what I thought everything was under control

[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:54.200]
mission accomplished baby right right and you're going to see Dan Stewart and George W. together

[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:19.380]
char shank finds redemption again on dvd i'd rather watch fair night night eleven four thousand times

[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:24.080]

[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:28.180]

gonna get a fan though if you want something fact no i didn't ask for it i know plus it's what

[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:51.140]
is it a book and a half or something two bucks for a uh video so who cares plus it wasn't the original

[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:56.520]
video i mean it was just you know a copy right with this unwieldy name and some high profile competition

[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:03.480]
from likes of pulp fiction and for his gump hello the char shank redemption kind of got lost in the

[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:08.600]
shuffle in nineteen ninety four but like it's a wonderful life oh yeah every time i think of the

[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:13.880]
char shank redemption i think of uh Jimmy Stewart but like it's a wonderful life the film found

[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:17.820]
new life after its original theatrical run although the prison drama underachieved at the box

[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:22.620]
or office it found its own redemption home video fueled by critical acclaim and positive word of

[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:29.700]
mouth that must be it i think it's some kind of a comic pinko plot right maybe the moonies have

[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:35.240]
something to do with it right to direct your frank dare a bond certainly knows the that char shank

[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:39.220]
owns oh it's the home video without that it would be a forgotten movie indeed it's something that's

[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:45.120]
very beloved by people instead so beloved in fact that it currently writes number three behind

[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:53.440]
only the godfather i didn't know no godfather and the lord of the ring is the return of the thing

[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:58.260]

weren't clear that over a couple or maybe you're talking about the people of mizuri who voted uh

[01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:31.400]
for john ascrop's opponent the dead man mel carnahan is wiped off the other team

[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:36.860]
maybe that's what he was thinking because if we weren't for that we wouldn't have the attorney

[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:44.820]
general singing uh let the eagle soar right right do we what what is that under ascrop is under ascrop

first avenue what are jackass what a nazi and then of course i still think it over the scene i

[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:11.800]
have forgotten because there were so many great things in fair night nine eleven but i was rewatching

[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:18.860]
it the other day and there's that tall wolf towards again sticking i mean oh god fat sticking the

[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:25.100]
Coleman is mouth to wet because his hair is like all like he was seeing that over his ugly forehead

[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:31.180]
he looks like he just came out of a dumpster and he puts the Coleman is mouth and what's it

[01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:35.140]
and then slicks back and he's laughing while he's doing this with the camera people standing there like

[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:40.540]
that oh god and then if that wasn't good enough because his hair is still like flopping around a

[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:47.320]
little bit and he can't keep it down in place he moistened his fingertips and like shwhose is it back oh

[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:55.720]
god and these are the people these are your leaders boys and girls this is a great i don't know if i

[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:59.520]
got time to read this i'm sure i don't very very long can we just a little bit of sun i website

[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:05.020]
why don't americans care by mark morford you know who how a burden is dick channey how about

[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:09.620]
carl roe alas most americans don't go back to answer the question of that a car who was lamenting

[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:13.600]
the fact that how can there be so many stupid people in bush have any points in the polls let's

[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.040]
be honest mark says percentage wise few people in america really give much of a crap about what's

[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:22.180]
going on in the hallowed halls of politics and power that's true that's why i would be good to

[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:26.680]
the elections over there we go back to talking about whatever we talk about anything but this

[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.040]
because most of the audience they want to hear about dikes and boobies and stuff like that

[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:33.540]
on there's a naked picture of tom brady it's on our website now

[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:38.860]
for those of you out there want to see tom brady well they close on i mean you're not going to see

[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:42.720]
of which maybe you think you're going to see unfortunately not going to see that so you don't

[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:46.880]
even have to go to the big curtain to see that it's on spin under for a while i bet you we

[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:49.980]
get a huge view and of course you'll be amazed that the kind of people are going to be watching

[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:55.220]
that too you know taking a puke at that yeah let me show i would be the football fans you know

[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:59.000]
that's a fact everything anyway so this is what we in the media maybe you and the media consuming

[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.680]
audience tend to forget too easily the country is simply jam packed with millions of people have no

[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:09.100]
time for interest in politics or media or environmental policy or education or global issues

[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:12.920]
or which presidential candidate light is ass off about which aspect of his military career

[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:17.100]
and which agent or which orange alert is totally bogus and how many soldiers are dying for what

[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:21.400]
in the select war it seems hard to believe but the general rule of thumb is that major cities

[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:25.220]
are slightly more attuned due to aggressive media saturation and how we should tend to make

[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:30.180]
themselves known more urgently more immediately whereas middle america is a scatter shot conglomeration

[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:35.300]
of the politically apathetic and the actively disenfranchised photo people far too busy with their

[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:39.900]
lives and kids and jobs and zoning out on fear factor and money and football you care about following

[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:45.080]
the elitist ever-died dramas playing out on nation's gilded stages most americans in other words

[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:50.920]
have no idea what the hell halibutin is or Carl rove or Rodani shriveled soul rumsfeld or a lot

[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.320]
he martin or a carlie group or have any idea that satam had nothing whatsoever to do with 911

[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:00.100]
or that wmds were never found or that president bush has taken more vacation time than any president

[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:04.880]
u.s history or that jesus things w sort of a dink or where iraq is on the map

[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:11.920]
can we say dink i just did fact is in the past decade tv news ratings cable that ever combined has

[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:16.580]
shrunk to a fraction of its former numbers newspaper subscriptions have been either fliter dropping

[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:21.720]
for just about as long news magazines radio historical nonfiction flat or dropping fast even

[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:26.420]
the internet that vast teaming customizable firestorm of news and information streaming and from all

[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:30.900]
over the planet even the awesome net draws far more people to its porn and gossip and shopping

[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:35.780]
departments than any e news do it could ever wet dream is this unfair does it sound elitist

[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:40.080]
advised it's not there have been studies and reports and alarming indicators of all kinds telling

[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:45.480]
us time and time again that for example fully 50% of eligible americans don't even bother to vote

[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:51.160]
a 15% drop since 64 and many have no idea who's on the supreme court what congress does and

[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.820]
many can't even point to france on a globe voter turnout comparatively in italy spade

[01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:01.400]
euk jr. m.i anywhere from seventy five to ninety two percent every time the sad fact is that the

[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:00.720]
floor the outside the panel's on hotels are like that gun fire blasts violence and bloodshed on the

[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:05.260]
highway Iraqi voters are losing interest in election schedule for January not because they're

[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:09.800]
worried about security instead for a sense of voters said they had no interest in or understanding

[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.880]
of the process according to a pool by the Iraq Center for Research and Strategic Studies

[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:20.040]
i wonder when that organization was developed the Iraq Center for Research and Strategic Studies

[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:26.220]
there's so many of these organizations you know it the pool conducted September 15 to 22th survey

[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:32.040]
3500 people nationwide in Iraq of those 66.8% said they very likely would vote in jane

[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.920]
where his elections for national assembly in june 88.8% said they very likely would vote just

[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:42.980]
over 8% said they might not have definitely wouldn't vote only 12.7% of those say that they

[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:47.440]
probably wouldn't vote citing security reasons a lack of information was said about 37.3%

[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:50.180]
almost 36% said they had no interest

[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:59.020]
they're busy watching the Iraqi fair factor in america you prepare a year before the election

[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:02.540]
since i do an al-dulamid exactly the director the organization that conducted the pool

[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:06.680]
and Iraq this is the first time and until now there's real no real preparation they got to get

[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:11.120]
them all pumped up in the field about it right we got to take that and allow a guy like

[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.400]
for pump them all up saying he didn't really shoot those guys in the police station

[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:19.240]
and if he did that shows how much we is he's gonna protect you he's a cowboy like a president

[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:24.120]
taking care of business you got it all of it he's not a drunk that we know of

[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:27.940]
and he says speaking of all sorts can you imagine what he smells like after a hot day of

[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:30.680]
Washington oh jeez i haven't even eaten lunch yet how do you think

[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:38.440]
god since i was looking at our old friend Phil Henry are you sure man does he like anyone i

[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:44.420]
must have been Brian Cox that made him that way does he like anyway maybe he's certainly now the

[01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:50.020]
a Henry might turn out that he's been outed as a turn coat as a closet right winger that who knows

[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:54.920]
where he ever really was you know he just sold out it says as for your picture of Tom Brady yes

[01:44:54.920 --> 01:45:00.960]
that's him being interviewed the naked dude is a kicker or the water boy what no i don't know

[01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:07.280]
trust me when i tell you the kicker is annavena theory that is not

[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:12.580]
i'll guarantee i will bet right now mani bel Greg read the water nazi i bet all their lives on

[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:16.440]
it right now let me go back to the home page and i wouldn't this would be bad if we made a mistake

[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:23.380]
where did that come from a contributor of course okay let me take a very close look at that

[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:30.340]
let me get my magnifying glass out let me put my magnifying glass on Tommy's ass

[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.700]
you know what he's right that's Tom Brady with a microphone in his face right

[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:48.640]
okay then oh no i really don't know you can't tell in fact it looks like twins i don't know

[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.780]
i might not be Tom in the back but if we label it Tom Brady question mark

[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:57.880]
or sometimes we're in the back there that's not a good way to do it it's close it's over

[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:01.640]
well what do we care okay let's just pretend we should probably crop out that thing or so that

[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:12.620]
just pretended Tom Brady okay the hair looks like him believe me when i run my fingers through his

[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:19.340]
hair i take very careful load of it i really can't tell maybe it's a yes stump double i don't know

[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:24.560]
anyway why do you have to ruin my day says that it's him being interviewed the naked dude is

[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.520]
the kicker or the water boy well definitely not anything to do i can tell you that they don't look

[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:33.820]
like Adams uh don't laugh all to me five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on either

would take me stand against the relentless iraqi and surgeon trying once more to turn the corner

[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.720]
in a war with endless corners mr bush's reminiscent of the protagonist of a plum in samara by

[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:18.640]
john ohera julian anglis the son of a wasp aristocratic renowned ineffectual father

[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:23.740]
julian's pals were these spenders and drinkers and socially secure who would thumb their noses not

[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:28.100]
have to answer to anyone except their own families bristling with filial tension and nurturing

[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:32.340]
the chip on his privilege shorter the summer refuses to follow in the proper father's footsteps

[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:37.960]
and instead engage his in a john upright put it impulsive bellicosity falling into self-destructive

[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:42.700]
spiral that starts when he throws a drink and when all eyes face at the club oh her a preface

[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:47.000]
the novel his most brilliant with a quotation from summer set mom about the futility of using

[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.460]
a reverse playbook to avoid your fate the servant of a bag that mercer runs in a death at the

[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:56.640]
marketplace and gallops off as fast as he can to samara thinking death will not find him but as

[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:00.240]
it turns out their appointment is not for back then on that day but for samara that night

[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:04.860]
w.a. his rock donation in the world as he gallops fast practically trying to avoid his dad's

[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:09.780]
electoral fate he no longer has to chafe this father's imposing shadow if he wants to go to war

[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:13.980]
with sedal would I even discuss it with his dad he can if he wants to keep his dad from having a

[01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:19.140]
speaking slot in the republican convention he can even though the president waving off any

[01:50:19.140 --> 01:50:23.360]
attempts to put him on the couch refuses to acknowledge any edible sensitivities john

[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:28.400]
carry artfully drilled into the sore spot in the first debate senator carry a hope the voice of

[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:33.320]
bush 41 to get under 43's thick skin the more mr. carry played to the square proper moderate

[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.900]
in internationalist war hero the more the president was reduced to childish scowling and fidgeting

[01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:42.180]
acting like a naughty little boy who refuses to sit in his seat and he just finished and do all

[01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:46.280]
the hard things appear once you do you know the president's father did not go into a rack into

[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:50.780]
bag that beyond bazaar mr. carry said is w blinked and burned and the reason he didn't is he

[01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:54.960]
said he wrote it in his book because there was no viable exit strategy and he said our troops would

[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:59.440]
be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land that's exactly where we find ourselves today there's a

[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:04.180]
sense of american occupation carry said mr. carry told the now and then guardsman about the

[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:08.160]
extraordinary difficult missions or troops in a rack i know what it's like to go out on one of those

[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:11.440]
missions where you don't know what's around the corner and i believe our troops need other allies

[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:16.700]
helping playing the daddy card was part of the carry makeover by the clinton east is boba i for the

[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:24.860]
brahman guy no great line boba i for the brahman guy in their 92 debate built it and used the same

[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:29.600]
psychological trick to rattle bush 41 objectivity republican pinko in the window about a trip you

[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:33.600]
taking as young man to masco mr. clinton reminded the first president that his father senator

[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:38.360]
press god bush of Connecticut had stood up to johm McCarthy your father was right to stand up to

[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:42.860]
johm McCarthy were wrong to attack my patriotism the bush is very agitated when confronted with

[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:46.980]
the spectres of fathers who made them feel that they never measured up and even the mr. carry is

[01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:51.660]
more of a stiff loner than poppy bush they share enough that paint that patrician dutiful son

[01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:56.000]
starved the class in the playing fields hero on the killing field stuff resume castle on foreign

[01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:05.960]
that he had to rely on his own dark for voting in pathologically unapologzed to surrogate daddy

[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:10.580]
dick taney to clean up his debate mess and get the red team back in the game the vice president

[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:15.360]
shielded the kid by tweeting john Edwards is even more of a kid mr. carry may take on the voice of

[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:19.560]
daddy bush again in friday's domestic debate pointing out that w's father tried to fix the deficit

[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:23.760]

29 now.

[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:01.920]
Towards 28, you and the little log got a battle.

[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:03.600]
Next to next, knows the knows.

[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:05.260]
Stand on a chair.

[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:06.040]
Yeah.

[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:07.480]
Randy Rhodes 26.

[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:09.780]
Mojave, David and Gelly Galstein 24.

[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.620]
And the big old just went on and he's got a well deserved.

[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:20.800]
5'6, 7'05, 60.

[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:24.240]
Tom 5'60 and the Verizon Wireless and singular wireless lines.

[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:26.200]
Line 9, we're quite today.

[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:26.680]
QAM.

[01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:27.900]
Hello?

[01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:28.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:29.760]
Is it Neil?

[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:30.720]
Yes, it is.

[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:32.500]
Oh my God, I'm trying to listen on the internet.

[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:33.340]
It's a long time listen.

[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:35.000]
I was in Miami listening now from college.

[01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:35.700]
It's so loud, yeah.

[01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:36.320]
All right.

[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:37.640]
That's right here, the pole.

[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:38.340]
I'm out the crow.

[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:39.760]
There you go.

[01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:41.060]
Crow is a magnificent choice.

[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:42.440]
How can we, as the crow flies?

[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:44.280]
Here we go.

[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:45.180]
All right.

[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:46.620]
Who we going for is November?

[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.340]
As we, she's a mom, fraught, brought problems.

[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:50.200]
What is that?

[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:50.900]
All right.

[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:52.220]
Who we going for November?

[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:56.520]
5'6, 7'05, 80, 5'60.

[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:57.500]
You talked me into a man.

[01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:58.280]
I'm right in the crow.

[01:57:58.720 --> 01:57:59.220]
There you go.

[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:00.740]
Thanks a lot, thank you for having me around.

[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:00.940]
I love you.

[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:01.520]
Okay.

[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:02.740]
80, 7'05, 60.

[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:04.260]
Stages for us up there in Philly.

[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:05.840]
That's an okay place, Philly.

[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:07.180]
There's like living and breathing people there.

[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:10.960]
Lots of Italians, lots of Schwarches, lots of Jews.

[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:13.320]
That's how many holios there.

[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:14.340]
I don't think it's hold off here, are they?

[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:15.140]
I wouldn't know.

[01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:16.520]
I think it's a...

[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:17.440]
About 30, man.

[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:17.680]
Yeah.

[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:19.820]
And then, of course, you know who was there?

[01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:20.780]
That was the man we were at, Maret.

[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:21.260]
Maret...

[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:23.160]
Man, many repeaters.

[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:26.680]
He just moved there to Philadelphia.

[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:27.780]
That's what I'm hearing.

[01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:30.300]
Where's rationale undermined once again?

[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:31.940]
Did you put the crown of folding his eyes?

[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:32.820]
I did.

[01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:33.380]
Good.

[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:34.660]
He's not going to get many votes.

[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:36.380]
But you know, the comedy vote there.

[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:37.220]
He sure smells good.

[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:38.100]
I'm sure sometime.

[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:40.260]
Not when he's into building, but somewhere sometime.

[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:41.300]
Maybe, at birth.

[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:45.080]
One by one, official reports by government investigator.

[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:46.180]
Statements by former men.

[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.320]
See, he's one of those very few people I've ever known

[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:52.520]
who smells too good. Not saying he smells bad, he just smells too good. Too much cash

[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:58.720]
mirrored cake for, okay? Unclean your act, down. One by one official reports by government

[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:03.620]
investigators, statements by former administration officials and internal CIA analises have

[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:07.600]
come by to one of my many of the central rationales of the administration's case for war with

[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:12.420]
Iraq and its handling of the post invasion occupation. The release of yesterday's definitive

[01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:16.120]
account on Iraq's weapons and its conclusion that Iraq no longer had weapons of mass destruction

[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:20.820]
years before the U.S.-led invasion is only the latest in the series of damaging votes

[01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:24.940]
of the White House's strategy of portraying the war in Iraq as being on the cusp of success.

[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:29.400]
The report also comes just a few weeks after Democratic presidential challenger John Kerry

[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:34.360]
gave new life to his campaign by emphasizing what he asserts as the gap between the president's

[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:37.980]
rhetoric and the realities in Iraq. In other words, he's a freaking liar. We don't want

[01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:42.880]
to use the harshest word, as Kerry would say. He's a freaking liar. And of course, the

[01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:46.280]
attorney and even bigger liar, and he also did a beta and then he kept going back and

[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:50.920]
gave it to him. Well, you know, it's just, I mean, wife and bother with him. And in

[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:55.580]
words, he didn't really nail him. You know, that's what pissed me off. He just kept saying,

[01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:58.400]
well, you know, if you listen carefully to the vice president's word, he should have

[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:01.660]
said you're a freaking liar. You silly old coup. He should have gotten up and shaken

[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:04.880]
his fist at him and said he couldn't do something hard to attack. He's got a 95-year

[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:11.760]
done that. And it had been great. Oh, me, him. Yeah. Have that ticker thing that pacemaker

[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:17.420]
tap out right on the table there. I can just see that bitch from PBS. Retro. We're

[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:22.340]
grounded. Oh, my God. I got the vice president's heart. My hand. Oh, my God. Yeah. Well, sometimes

[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:26.700]
it was just hard to miss. Leave. This week, president Bush has formed an administrator

[02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:30.960]
in Iraq called Bremer Broke with the Ministry of Justice. Officials have sent two few troops

[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:35.760]
direct and have allowed a culture of lawlessness to develop the CIA using information that they

[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:38.700]
had that act in the media and cast out last week. And whether it's Saddam Hussein aided

[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:44.200]
Abu Musab Zarqawi and Al-Qaeda, as the administration repeatedly alleged before the war and his

[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:48.940]
chainy kept trying to hawk into the bay on through the night. The CIA over the summer delivered

[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:53.440]
an analization that Iraq could be expected in the best case scenario to achieve a tenuous

[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:58.360]
stability over the next 18 months and in the worst case to dissolve into civil war. The

[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:02.080]
July assessment was similar to one produced before the war. Another in late 2003 that were

[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:06.300]
more pessimistic and tone than the administration's portrayal of the resistance to the US occupation.

[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:10.940]
They lie, they stonewall, they pretend that they don't get it, they never make mistakes,

[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:14.020]
they can't admit they ever made a mistake, which is why I think it was a good way to make

[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:18.660]
sure that first debate to say, you know, maybe I made a mistake. I'm the way I talked

[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:25.240]
about my support of the war and my vote, but this president got invaded Iraq, which is

[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:30.540]
worse. Which mistake is worse. Nice going, Kerry. He finally put stuff nicely, a little

[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:36.280]
bit, a little bit. Now tomorrow night, I want to see, I want some real actor, man. I

[02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:42.380]
want to see it right tomorrow there on TV. And don't forget tomorrow night, we will be

[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:46.340]
changing the poll to 1030 immediately after the debate. So even though everybody else in

[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:49.720]
their brother does, you can also vote online on our poll and find out who you thought one

[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:53.440]
and who did well and if you really care and that said, when so on, and if the crow really

[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:57.600]
smells that good, it'll be tomorrow 1030 and that'll be right after whatever silly as poll

[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:03.420]
you take tomorrow during the show. Got your poll yet? Yeah, Kerry, working at it. Oh,

[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:07.580]
here you go. This is a great choice. God for real. Now how come it took so long to

[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:12.040]
that? I think he was a great lead into your show, which is not true. He didn't at least

[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:17.960]
in the ratings. He did nothing for us. Remember that? Right. I don't know why. What that

[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:22.740]
was all about. I think he had a different kind of crowd around that. 34, 34, 34,

[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:28.640]
34, 34. Oh, that. So what's the story with him now? Man, I have never seen a guy anywhere

[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:32.540]
in his business. That maybe he had Greg Vidal, who's waiting tables at the burger king over

[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:37.520]
there in the sunrise. Yeah. I have never seen a guy change jobs and lose jobs and get

[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:42.200]
candy just to boss around this guy. How many days does he hold the average job?

[02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:46.980]
About 30 minutes. Now in this particular case, they changed the format up during the

[02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:53.060]
day. They went to Spanish language music or some crap like that. See. We'll see what. See.

[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:58.600]
And we have no idea what he's doing now, right? He's pregnant. Is he really? Yeah.

[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:06.420]
Well, I'll be damned. I didn't know he had it in him. It does not. Oh, here you go.

[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:10.540]
What's next? Dead babies? Yeah. And if I were going to put Bud babies on him or he's going to be great.

[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:14.940]
I'm going to tell him that we'll see killed up into jingles dead babies. 27 after one at five,

[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:18.220]
60, never to cue. Nobody sent unless you're from Detroit. No, Bud babies. Whatever

[02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:21.840]
any idea what dead babies is all about. I said, mobile, of course, mobile be out for the mad dog.

[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:25.460]
It took this afternoon. One of his rare appearances now. We thought that he's out on the street.

[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:29.500]

It makes me feel alright. I want to enjoy the time of the day and the whole day time of the day.

[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:38.680]
I want to enjoy it before I want to enjoy it. And then I want to go.

[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:45.520]
Oh, my head ain't worth your name. I'm using my looking man.

[02:05:46.100 --> 02:05:51.300]

I'm just going to sing one day. I'm a parent, a safe company, and safe.

[02:05:58.540 --> 02:06:03.540]
I want to enjoy it in the afternoon. I want to sing, sing, sing.

I hope to experience the time of the day, and the whole day time fall.

[02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:43.180]

One thirty-five hours left this class one of my favorites in a long time from Robert Cherten's way says how about Brooke Daniels for the pool?

[02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:35.820]
She was always good for her laugh

[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:45.980]
I think I was saying she belongs on Waxi

[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:51.660]
But that's another story it's a little inside thing there so to speak it was see you just get in deeper

[02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:56.960]
John Price says when you run and fans will leave in oh boy

[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:00.140]
Why don't you think what if I put it on there?

[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:03.800]
Just get a few different names on here. We're gonna get some of their kicking ass. They're like far ahead

[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.400]

Two of them will you be back from vacation because I enjoy says but George doesn't hold my attention

[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:15.720]
Sorry, we don't have to be sorry there people don't like George or many people don't like me that they people are like either one of us

[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:18.620]
And whatever you don't care. We just want the money

[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:22.280]
But I'll be back a week from Monday. What's the date on that? It's uh

[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:28.700]
Late-teenth, right? Yes. Yes October 18. I'll be back right in Bushy tail and

[02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:30.880]
Stern will be going on real long those days. I hope

[02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:35.920]
Also, it says you played a bit about Michael Jackson and the bloat funny, but that's time in Matholia

[02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:39.400]
Had heard it before but hadn't picked up on that line about the bloat

[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:43.220]
Having just had joy. Oh man. I had a oh

[02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:49.320]
A chicken sandwich and would buy a racetrack deal and I could just about kill me got the bloat

[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:54.860]
I got the bloat in fact that's all I could think about when I came home and oh I thought I wasn't I wasn't such a

[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:55.880]
Agonist I was gonna die

[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:00.000]
You want to know why cuz why you're gonna die because it's deep fry

[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:06.560]
Just like those french fries you like to you. Yeah, it's a deep fried batter and greasy. Oh, it was pretty good though

[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:11.720]
Anyway, it said damning head just had jaw surgery day before I knew I was playing with dynamite

[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:15.900]
But it truly sent me diving to the doubt of turn you off you couldn't hear about the bloat till he heals up

[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:20.360]
Says keep it up and do other vacation. It's good to know how it's turned safe and should be working harder to get naked pictures

[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:24.800]
And stop getting in the silly contracts normed contingent thing or two in normacenna said picture

[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:28.280]
We've been in huh of what Tom Brady no

[02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:33.420]
Are you sure positive? Okay good

[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:39.680]
Cuz I can't imagine who doing anything constructive for a new role for the show at any rate oil prices said a new record

[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:45.480]
A 53 bucks a barrel today on concerns over tight winner heating fuel supplies and news of an unexpected strike at

[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:48.860]
Nigerian oil terminals. It is really tight baby and the supply too

[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:57.220]
U.S. like crude feet a few two center record of 53 dollars of barrel marking a surge of 20 bucks a barrel more than 60 percent

[02:10:57.220 --> 02:11:02.240]
So far this year. Thank you, El Presidentay for those low gas prices, baby

[02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:08.300]
Lunch London's bread crude also is record record figure 49 20 before easing back to real bargain

[02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:11.740]
48 61 up 62 cents on the day wow

Thank you you and your Saudi friends those great robbers and I'll guarantee a wilder screaming about the hurricanes and about the shortage and all the sudden

[02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:27.020]
Guaranteed that each quarter the gas companies the world companies will come out reporting record profits like they do all the time

[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:37.620]
See what I'm saying I hear what you're saying. Yeah, the price doesn't have to be at that level, but they're just doubt you knew just on the reaping the world

[02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:43.660]
If we if we would have attacked Saudi Arabia, I'll tell you right now. I've been really happiest

[02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:50.540]
Huh if we would have gotten that free gas free gas all the gas you want unless you want to bring it one of the chicken sandwiches

[02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:52.840]

[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:28.800]
But did we we checked out the Eisen car alarm once upon a time did we decide that we can play that while spending the remainder of your

[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:36.300]
Yes in the land of death the one thing you have to depend on is your car with chukinu theft on the rise

[02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:43.680]
The people who brought you a big black guy named Ben car alarm now bring you an old Jewish guy named Eisen

[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:55.620]
We want to get a bunch of finish make white what's it cooler?

And hold Jewish guy named Eisen car alarm. How available it all there's stories

[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:56.880]
145 a QA and I'm curious that flower and antenna thing is that strictly a Florida thing the Elsa cockers and Florida new letters at

[02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:02.160]
Everywhere the only old to conquer is I know her here, so yeah, I don't see that anywhere else that I be going

[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.500]
I don't see the

[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:07.420]
Well, let me get a little bit confused you know and of course you know how I'm either talk

[02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:12.440]
I was thinking about that yesterday. I guess because we put the old as one of the choices that you don't want to be

[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:14.100]
Called by anybody

[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:20.800]
And I don't know what point but I guarantee I'm getting really close of course you've been called me the old man for what how many years now

[02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:25.600]
But I'm certainly getting close to her. I mean sit when you get to 62

[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:31.000]
Which will be in November for me you get 62 you're like and some price you're gonna see me sit in discount. I don't want it

[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:36.180]
You can't get afford I can afford to pay the full price. I don't want to see me sit in discount

[02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:38.440]
Well, it doesn't matter if you pay the full price you're still hold

[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:42.040]
Oh, I know that but I just I don't want them to reinforce it

[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:46.560]
In fact, I have gone into I'm trying to think of what drug chain they got a red salt

[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:52.860]
I've got it in the drugstore and like a bought prescription something or are you a senior citizen and looking at her like oh, man

[02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:56.560]
I'd like to get her with your old bitch Jack get OJ in there

[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:05.460]
Yeah, are you a senior said yes, honey? I'm a thing you said and give me a 20% discount please and a free bottle of polo bent

[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:11.320]
Or whatever the hell it comes there. This comes in a box and a polo then too

[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:19.400]
Charges drop against 227 protesters arrested the D. R. N. C. R. N. C. A man had in criminal court drug yesterday

[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:26.580]
Drop charges against 227 protesters arrested during the Republican National Convention after prosecutors said they would have difficulty proving the case

[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:38.040]
Assistant a district attorney William Beach told judge Catherine Fried that the administrators might have been confused by instructions given by cops and we've asked Catherine fried

[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.600]
It's F. R. I. E. D. Maybe Catherine is fried

[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:48.320]
Beach said it would have been difficult to prove that the protesters were deliberately defined police directives are intentionally acting in a disordering manner

[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:51.800]
Just before police raised nets around them in order and ordered them cuffed

[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:58.220]
And it carefully worded statement beach defended the arrest known in the police had good reason to believe that the group intended to violate the

[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:03.940]
The intent of the violates the log is 31st by marching with the department

[02:17:03.940 --> 02:17:06.960]
Where the hell was it in New Jersey somewhere we had a story a couple years ago

[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:13.160]
About the New D. O's if they think that you have the intent of breaking the law they're going to arrest your ass

[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:16.140]
Prefiling that's what I'm right. The mind police

[02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:22.620]
We don't just think it you didn't do nothing. I believe what you're thinking her boy. Oh John and Columbia South Carolina again

[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:28.160]
Oh my god, and you sent him both to me John calm down get a life. I have no life. Oh, I'm so sorry

[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:33.640]
I'm sorry to hear you're taking the next we're off. I'll be in Hollywood beginning tomorrow. That's why I'm going to take them

[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:36.340]
We go plus I'm not there anyway. Oh

[02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:44.500]
Yeah, I thought that you Georgian I could hang out together feed the pigeons play shuffle board. I just hang out

[02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:47.720]
See this. That's right in with what I was just talking about wouldn't that have been really cool?

[02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:51.760]
Oh, well, I guess I'll just have to wait until another day have a safe your thank you John you too

[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:56.080]
He'll be in Hollywood with the frogs. Do we have a big frog fest this year or not?

[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:02.080]
I don't know I would think so because another thing we can thank mr. Bush for not only those cheap

[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:04.900]
Or gas prices, but also that's strong American dollar

[02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:07.960]
You know, I'm gonna look at that right now, so this is so depressing

[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:11.660]
If you know how that impacts me not that I can't afford it you understand

[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:14.120]
Oh, let's see Canadian oh

[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:19.960]
70 938 the Canadian by you're gonna have to go the Canadian dollar against the American was like 62 cents

[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:25.080]
What a bargain it was for me with my American paycheck and now it's like almost 80

[02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:29.780]
Holy moly rat man. That is just unacceptable

[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:36.980]
Can you believe that in such a short period of time the euro is through the roof of British pound is just kicking American dollars ass

[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:42.000]
Everything is negative rate and we got about half of the American public's only four more years

[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.300]
It has to be paradise baby. We want more boot. Who's he gonna make it safe?

[02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:48.100]

[02:19:09.940 --> 02:19:11.200]

It's killing me really happened for the past week I said yeah, it sounds like a pirate station

[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:24.240]
I think or you know something maybe that's what that is maybe there's a pirate but how do they do pirate a and stays?

[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:29.200]
I guess they could I don't know I think they do I think it's more popular with like the

[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.200]
You know the Spanish

[02:19:32.020 --> 02:19:39.320]
Spaces. Yeah, you'll feel a empire it right. You know maybe it's an old exilio is trying to drown us out. That's possible

[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:41.100]
I think you need to get the

[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:44.900]
These are maybe Theresa LaPours behind it

[02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:50.340]
That's true. She's probably trying to block the show out because of the fact that we're not the bushlookers on this show

[02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:55.220]
That's true speakers. Oh good luck. Thanks for the bad news pal. We'll just talk louder

[02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:58.880]

[02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:15.380]
They don't know how to tackle they don't know how to block their coaches on it

[02:21:15.380 --> 02:21:17.900]
Tell them to put them in their truck

[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:22.740]
Then they would run much faster and even in the feet

[02:21:22.740 --> 02:21:26.360]
When we go to the stadium we'll see Miami

[02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:29.500]
They're the Miami dolphins

[02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:31.820]
Miami dolphins

[02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:34.420]
Miami dolphins number

[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:38.580]
How many teams in a week 30 Joe Miami dolphins

[02:21:39.300 --> 02:21:40.860]
Miami dolphins

[02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:43.460]
The team that hasn't got a clue

[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:51.640]
Miami has the dolphins but the dolphins have no fans

[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:53.800]
Just 50,000

[02:21:54.680 --> 02:22:00.720]
Sitting in the stance they watched the game and all they do is moan and gripe and bitch

[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:04.200]
I wonder how joe robby got to be so

[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:07.680]

Miami dolphins

[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:22.000]
I hear the crowd begin to boo

[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:30.340]
The dolphins have eight feet worth that quarter facts that you want

[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:34.440]
Run down the field and he will throw a pass over you

[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:38.820]
I'll never win a super bowl you shouldn't be surprised

[02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:43.880]
When he gets cut that doesn't mean that he was served on size in there

[02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:46.040]
Miami dolphins

[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:48.200]
Miami dolphins

[02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:50.800]
Miami dolphins number

[02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:57.240]
Miami dolphins

[02:22:57.800 --> 02:23:00.280]
Jake calls his signals in he room

[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:08.000]
But dolphins have no defense in their offenses at joke

[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:10.540]
Like George Bush even pretzels

[02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:12.600]
You know they're gonna choke

[02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:17.140]
They'll always disappoint you when they're in a playoff race

[02:23:17.140 --> 02:23:22.040]
Which fewer points than fireworks on my zingos ugly face in there

[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:24.100]
The Miami dolphins

[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:26.380]

[02:23:36.280 --> 02:23:40.860]
Miami dolphins now they're free

[02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:43.720]
I'm dying over here

[02:23:48.780 --> 02:23:49.900]
Go go go go go go

[02:23:49.900 --> 02:23:52.620]
Well said the most you're Howard David standing by

[02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:55.500]
Mo Howard David for Jim Anderson to the full

[02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:56.020]
I should go there

[02:23:56.020 --> 02:23:58.420]
American for him. Haven't seen him in so long

[02:23:58.420 --> 02:23:59.740]
Did he come in to say hi?

[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:01.400]
No I should go over there

[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:03.880]
Hey go over there and give him a rub on his ball spot for Krenna

[02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:04.720]

[02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:05.560]
I've had it

[02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:06.280]
Tell him that I

[02:24:06.280 --> 02:24:08.100]
So maybe in my other fact that he's getting

[02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:10.400]
It's paid for working like one day a month

[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:12.840]
Something like that plus there's often deal as a separate deal

[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:14.100]
It gets paid by the dolphins for that

[02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:16.160]
So he's got a better deal than any of us going right now

[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:17.540]
What's not to like huh?

[02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:20.820]

[02:24:33.620 --> 02:24:35.840]
You just it's like a rotating thing

[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:37.700]
