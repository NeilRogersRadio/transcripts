[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380]
I'm way too shy, shy, shy!

[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.660]
My nose glows when something stays

[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.280]
Almost every day I paint

[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.820]
And my veins suddenly start to tingle

[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.880]
My eyes annoy me with torture, torture me

[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.280]
Yeah, I love life to fall apart

[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.300]
And because I'm a criminal fine

[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.660]
There's no death spill with wiggle veins

[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.080]
Yeah, I love life to fall apart

[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.660]
And say it's an old discovery

[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.120]
I know I'm bleeding, wiggle veins

[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.460]
I'm out of sleep!

[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.160]
Sit down!

[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.980]
Sit on three at five, sixty WQM happy Wednesday to you

[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.380]
It's a great day

[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.020]
For hope I don't know for the Irish

[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.560]
The Jews, the Goyom, the Buddhists

[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.560]
Man allegedly assaults Taco Bell employee with Chalupa

[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.960]
Oh my God

[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.040]
I've actually never heard this story before

[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.040]
De Moin Iowa

[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.340]
A man who claimed he didn't get the Taco we paid for

[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.980]
Has been charged with a saw for allegedly

[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.820]
Pelting a Taco Bell clerk in the face

[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.160]
With a Chalupa

[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.320]
Nancy Harrison told police he was working the drive-through

[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.560]
Last Thursday night when Christopher on his name might be La May

[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.100]
But LA and me could be lame

[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.340]
And I think it fits here

[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.580]
Christopher lame, 24 ordered some food

[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.900]
Although at least he ordered the food

[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.600]
Unlike what's his name from a Baywatch

[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.260]
David Hasselhoff was sitting in the McDonald's drive-through

[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.540]
Saying nothing because he was drunk

[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.480]
But anyway

[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.140]
He later came into the store complaining he didn't get the Taco we ordered

[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.020]
Police records say

[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.980]
Harrison said that when she asked for a receipt

[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.660]
He went back to his car and brought back the bag

[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.380]
Harrison said he told him the store was closing

[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.560]
And as she turned away

[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.860]
A Chalupa hit her in the face near her right eye

[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.920]
She said she

[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.760]
She said she ran into the parking lot

[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760]
Took down the license number

[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.140]
Where the motorist was driving away

[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.460]
Lane was identified through a license number

[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.020]
A schedule appeared in court June 15

[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.940]
Don't do it again, Lane, man

[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.840]
Don't be attacking that poor bitch with a Chalupa

[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.880]
Although who would like to attack Scrooan with their Chalupa, you know?

[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.220]
Roy!

[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.280]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.380]
Just line her up against the wall there

[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.960]
Or a sailor right up to the wall, huh?

[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.060]
Or your Jimmy Chango would be good too if she liked that

[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.200]
Here's our poll result from yesterday

[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.780]
We had a staggering response almost 1700 votes

[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.180]
Who is the most overrated movie actor or actress of all time?

[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.300]
And for once I got the answer right I guess

[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.080]
Because I picked the Duke, John Wayne, Marion to you

[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.000]
John Wayne, 205 votes

[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.740]
I mean a legend in his own mind in the minds of every redneck from coast to coast

[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.880]
The Duke, you can't pick on the Duke

[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.640]
Next to be picking on Reagan again today

[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.420]
Oh yeah, I sure will, I got some more great stories

[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.720]
Yeah, oh I got a whole bunch of them

[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.200]
In fact my favorite one, what's it called again?

[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.100]
Let's see

[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.780]
Colin Shrey writes he was a madman, meaning Reagan

[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.080]
But anyway, John Wayne, 205

[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.980]
Cano Reeves gave the Duke a run for his money?

[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.540]
160 for Kiano, cheated pretty well

[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.100]
Kevin Costner, 141, bland is vanilla ice cream

[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.640]
Man, just boring, terminal, ponderous, coma inducing

[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.660]
Almost as coma inducing is the big deal

[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.660]

[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.560]
And Joseph Gatti

[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.120]
Jennifer Lopez was only one behind

[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.180]
JLo had a nice number there, 140 came in fourth place

[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.720]
Beating out James Deanhandley had 123

[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.020]
Julia Roberts 90

[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.580]
Will Smith 83, that makes my heart feel great, Vin Diesel 78

[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.340]
Ben Affleck 78

[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.640]
Arnold Schwarzenegger 71, Marilyn Monroe 63

[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.420]
Elvis 61, isn't it great that those two were right there paired together

[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.120]
Chuck Teston 46, Mel Gibson 37

[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.020]
Did I say Chuck Teston? I don't have time to do that whole thing

[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.060]
You son of a bitch

[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.960]
46, Mel Gibson 37, they nailed him

[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.660]
Richard Geerhead

[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.200]
About third man

[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.860]
Jerbels, John Kervolda 24, Brad Pitt 21, Tom Hanks 19, Marlon Brando 19

[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.040]
Burr Reynolds 17, Charlie Chaplin 15

[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.220]
See, I don't remember who I wanted

[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.120]
Won't waste my time

[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120]
Huh? How about Buster Keaton?

[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.260]
Yeah, how about Buster Keaton?

[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.000]
It's a time thing, it's not a time thing

[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.160]
He was back started in the silent movies, okay?

[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.180]
In their time they were great but nevertheless Al Pacino 13

[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.880]
Which we all love Al Pacino with Sephir when he said

[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.500]
Too much!

[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.780]
Then we turned on him like a rat

[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.840]
Rock Hudson had a dozen

[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.960]
Don't tell Ronnie Rock is sick

[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.120]
Frank Sinatra Harrison Ford Michael Douglas Andy Garcia each had 11

[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.240]
Bobby De Niro had 10, see you with little faith out there

[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.120]
Where it was George's vote for a long time it was the only vote

[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.200]
But then some people started thinking about it

[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.780]
And I said you know he has made a lot of crap lately

[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.620]
And they piled right on

[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.780]
Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep 10 apiece

[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.580]
Paul Walker 9, whoever said he was an actor by the way

[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.420]
I don't get that

[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.540]
Whoever said he was a good actor

[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.120]
Val Kilmer 9, Rock Hal Welch 9

[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.740]
Little Hayden Christianson 8, whoever said he was an actor

[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.120]
When he came right down to it

[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.660]
Denzel Washington 8, Natalie Portman 7, Humphrey Bogart had 6

[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.820]
Sir Lawrence Olivier 5, Gene Hackman 4

[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.960]
That's downright disrespectful if you ask me

[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.120]
He's no Jay Feeder

[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.140]
Dan Acquired 3, Dennis Hopper 2, Michael Cain 2

[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.740]
You and McGregor 1 and Vanessa Redgrave had only 1

[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.220]
I'll just about 17 revoked on yesterday's wildly popular poll

[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.740]
Author, now this is for Woody Graber

[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.980]
We got a few things to take care of here today for people

[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.720]
Author T.D. Alman who's latest book Rogue State, America at World With The World

[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.960]
It's a good book to its paperback

[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.360]
He'll be in a Gables tomorrow June 10th at 6 p.m. at Brooks & Books

[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.780]
265 Eragon Avenue

[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.900]
Is that where the Eragon Ballroom was?

[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.340]
Huh?

[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.260]
Books in Books 265 Eragon Avenue

[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.220]
He'll discuss his work and hold a question and answer session

[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.000]
As well as sign copies of his book, Alman is also author of

[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.300]
Miami City of Future, the highly respected book

[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.860]
Which is a bestseller in Florida for more than 3 years

[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.320]
Tomorrow June 10th, 6 p.m. Books in Books 265 Eragon Avenue

[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.100]
Be there or Woody Graber will be upset

[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.300]
And start flinging this ponytail action maybe a chalupa too

[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.400]
Dan Radher and Tom Broca

[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.220]
Worked for different networks as the New York Post today

[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.580]
But they agree on one thing

[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.960]
Coverage of Ronald Reagan's death has been excessively said

[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.360]
Absolutely correct

[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.120]
And you're gonna know already when the hell does it stop?

[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.440]
By the Senator John Kerry, the presumptive presidential nominee of this party

[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.960]
He paid his respects before Mr. Reagan's captive

[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.020]
See, there you go, you can't you just can't turn on any of the talking headroom

[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.600]
Even the regular networks interrupting us soap operas

[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.320]
And other very important programming day of the day

[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.740]
For more it is Reagan crap

[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.320]
Which is why I'm counterbalancing with the plenty of other kind of Reagan crap

[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.800]
The truth

[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.680]
Even though everybody is respectful and wants to pay homage to the president

[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.040]
Like does Goan Radher told the Philadelphia inquiry

[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.200]
That's what Danny Boy said

[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.460]
There is other news like the reality of Iraq said

[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.180]
The CBS evening news anchor it gets it got very short shrift this weekend

[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.620]
Networks have been going almost wall to wall with Reagan

[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.140]
Coverage since he croaked on Saturday at the age of 93

[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.300]
The former president was diagnosed with Alzheimer's nearly 10 years ago

[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.280]
And if you don't know that by now you probably have it yourself

[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.880]
Once the herd starts moving in one direction

[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.460]
It's very hard to turn it even slightly rather said

[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.000]
Nationally the herd has grown tremendously

[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.560]
Haven't you heard?

[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.120]
Volkow said I think just about everything is over nowadays days

[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.980]
Vokow who airs the anchors the emaci I only knows

[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.380]
The spectrum is so crowded with all the cable networks

[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.820]
It begins to have a video while feeling too what he said

[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.360]
News anchor with a bad bad speech defect unintelligible

[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.040]
Peter Jennings said he had mixed feelings about the Reagan coverage

[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.980]
Being the Nambi Pambi Canadian that he is

[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.400]
I'm more inclined to spare coverage come on the air to spare coverage

[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.940]
Come on the air do something meaningful and get away he said

[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.000]
Yeah get away Peter

[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.700]
Last time I had to do it was with OJ Simpson during the 94 car chase

[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.560]
I had nothing to say after a certain period of time

[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.280]
Coverage or Reagan's death will continue through Friday's funeral on all the news networks

[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.040]
Broadcast cable on your pop-up toaster

[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.900]
You'll have Reagan now they want to name the Pentagon after Reagan

[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.500]
They want to redo one of the bills first they want to do the dime and then she said that's a bad idea

[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:18.160]
FDR be pissed and now they want to do one of the dollar bills like a ten or a 20 or something like that

[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.180]
Three huh a three dollar bill would be good that would be poetic justice I think

[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.300]
And it's just there ain't no stopping it and that car yesterday had an excellent point

[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.480]
Why don't we have the Ronald Reagan turnpike in Florida

[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.340]
It absolutely no relationships of Florida whatsoever none zero zippity doodong quite frankly

[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.120]
Lot of the Latinos who moved into Florida over the years probably hated Mike boys and anyway and rightfully so

[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.860]
Especially if they're from like Nicaragua for example

[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.820]
Or Grenada places like that how many people from Grenada you think we got in South Florida

[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.260]
About 30 man at least

[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.260]
Here's our poll question today put on your thinking cap

[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.280]
I've actually get a lot of choices on here

[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.540]
Here's another one of those poll building deals

[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.680]
Oh poll building's boring poll building's boring

[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.400]
What retail place in South Florida do you hate the most?

[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.980]
Now I didn't put a choice on there none because I don't think there's anybody who doesn't

[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.820]
This spot huh?

[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.880]
No you'd have to be beyond human to not despise some retail place where they just treat you like crap

[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.900]
Or you just don't like the whole ambiance or their attitude or whatever

[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.340]
What retail place in South Florida you hate the most and I started out with three

[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.400]
Echards even though Jack Eckerd cropped I think I was on vacation when Jack Eckerd died

[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.200]
You covered that extensively no he was 91 which if you asked me that's old enough

[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.560]
Jack Eckerd boy did we hate him a real right wing always running for office

[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.560]
Another one of those like there's certain people in Florida over the years always running for office

[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:47.500]
Perpetual candidates Ellis Rubin Bob Coonst Jack Eckerd always running never winning

[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.040]
Just always on a ballot professional candidates kind of like Howard Samuels in New York State

[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.620]
Walmart who I know who's going to be voting for that who me yeah yeah a

[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:04.560]
Windixie Eckerd's Walmart Windixie does the first beat it came to mind I hate to say this because I'm sure that Windixie is a wonderful sponsor

[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.460]
And spends much money on our radio station but nevertheless I hate them like poison no I don't really hate them

[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.560]
I just would never shop there right so I don't think I would vote I hate them

[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.400]
I just wouldn't shop there unless maybe there was the only store open within about an 80 mile radius

[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.520]
You know what I'm saying right right there were a little worried about that meat

[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:25.820]
From minutes actually I like to yeah I know the bee people before I purchase it I like to be able to see my meat

[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.480]
You know what I'm saying I don't want to like have it wrapped in a tube that you can't see through

[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.320]
And then bring your home and find out that you've got the green weenie in there you should smell it too

[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.560]
Oh that's always a good idea

[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.000]
From minutes past 10 if I that's what my mom told me this morning always sniff it to make sure it's fresh

[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.060]
From minutes after the hour and this is a make good spot for those people who are keeping track and I want to thank whoever notified us

[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.280]
Because we had no way of knowing that the EBS test interrupted the a laser recharge live spot the other day

You started movies became president and then you turned into a tree

[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.420]
We held up our socks with writers like a big name

[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.380]
10

[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.280]
19 at 5 60 WQM on our beaded curtain today. We got Rebecca Romaine Stamos

[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:23.040]
Was born November 6 1972 birthdays a day after mine. How do you like that?

[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.460]
But a little a few a few years later like

[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.220]
30 man. Yeah

[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.300]
What did you say I heard what you said but

[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:37.440]
Anyways that makes your 28 and 5 33 not quite 34 I mean 31. I'm sorry excuse me

[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.080]
31 for Rebecca

[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:45.180]
She was born let's see oh yeah, oh yeah, sometimes they're regretted as Rebecca Romaine

[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:53.120]
She was in alibi all those dead Sinada that's in pre-product them will be up the next year God sin the Punisher

[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.520]
Tron 2.0

[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.080]
X2

[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.420]
Some of these movies every more I'll have the pronounciz S1 M01 what is that?

[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.540]
S1 M01 sounds like an SNM movie I think it's a moan, but it spelled bizarre

[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.740]
Thin Fatal Rollerball X-Men just shoot me TV series

[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.380]
Hefner unauthorized TV biography of Hefner Dirty Work

[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:24.160]
And a whole bunch of other stuff the 2000 MTV movie awards. Oh, we mentioned yesterday

[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.200]
They're not gonna let you see M&M's and the MTV Awards some our night. I just mentioned that in passing. Oh

[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.540]
There's probably a lot of people that want to see M&M's right though might frankly I'll pass on that El Paso

[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.100]
The Martin short show that Dennis Miller live playing herself in episode

[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:45.780]
1994 now that's interesting because Dennis Miller show is got a 0.2 share

[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.960]
He's right there scratching around on the bottom of the numbers

[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.220]
Dennis Miller show it's as close to being off the air as you possibly can be

[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:59.860]
It's almost it's like a half a step away from being on the light bulb or the old whammy one or the other and we can relate to that

[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.400]
Here's another one for the pool circuit city. It isn't spelled out that way exactly right there, but I get there drift

[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.320]
Oh, don't leave the beaded curtain yet. Why not?

[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:16.200]
Because that picture that I sent you is already there behind it. That mosaic that Jack mosaic that what do you call it the collage?

[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.260]
Well, what am I gonna do with it?

[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:24.260]
Beautiful portrait of Ashcroft you look on the beaded curtain and there it is and then the listeners we want to oh yeah

[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:30.180]
Because you actually can make out what that is that's great. That's perfect. Oh nice going and then if you save it then you can

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.440]
zoom and

[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.360]
Appreciate all of the individual little pictures that come

[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:40.180]
Already seen that when you had me take a peek out of the first time but you couldn't zoom back on mine here

[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:48.260]
But now that you got it like all together collage that it's a bunch of naked women little tiny pictures of naked women and the collage makes out John Ashcroft's face

[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.360]
That is

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:55.460]
It's not just naked women. Well, I didn't have time to cruise you

[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.840]
I'm sure you did I'm sure you did whatever else they're doing I don't want to go into detail right here

[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.320]
Okay, it's behind the beaded curtain you got to be over 75 you won't be seeing this any place else on her website

[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.360]
Okay, I think there's a couple billy goat pictures in there too. Well, I don't want to hear about that

[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:15.600]
Okay, you're just horse and around. Oh there it is right on his necktie. Oh, look at the signs of that thing anyway

[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.140]
So there you go you got behind the beaded curtain you got three for the price of one because we still got that

[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.280]
Whatever the hell she is the your love child honor

[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.500]
Circuit schmitty we got that that we got it. See I voted for records

[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.520]
I'm gonna tell you why when you come to thinking about what you're gonna vote for on this poll I don't want

[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:38.760]
Stop and think about a place that you wouldn't go even if they paid you to go in there now Walmart I see I'm not gonna vote for that

[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.360]
Even though I despise the organization

[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.760]
But now that there's no more came art out by me if I need something that I can only find in one of those kind of stories

[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.520]
I'll go to Walmart. I will bite my tongue when I do it and bleed a lot but I'll go there

[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.840]
But records well since I got a Walgreens right up to street and there's one on every street corner right now one of the other

[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.640]
I just won't go to records even if they pay if they give me free merchandise if they give me free drugs

[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.540]
I would not go in there on the opposite and it has nothing with what in other words you would go to

[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.480]
I'll go to records if I must but you won't go to a market or a market or a total of death

[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.520]
Really right well I know you feel a little bit strongly a little bit yeah well that's okay

[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.540]
That's why we're putting these on there so we got so far Walmart for

[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:23.380]
Windexy to records one and circuit city one we'll add a whole bunch more on there places that you hate like poison that you wouldn't

[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.600]
Shop if they paid you if they paid you to go in there

[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:33.340]
We have one call on it Q. I. M. Hello. Hey. Yeah, sir. I got one for your poll. Yeah rooms to go

[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.280]
Okay worst place I put about the furniture there came in damage I

[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.240]
Recited you know I bought it with the protection plan. Yeah, I selected some other furniture

[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:51.600]
Guess what I didn't want the protection plan for the other furniture I selected they told me I had to get it because I got it last time

[00:18:51.600 --> 00:19:02.860]
So I had it really I raised hell and my wife eventually I said listen you know what you sign the check because I'm not going to give it to you

[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:10.800]
But anyway, I think the motto is just say no to rooms to go you got it. Thanks. Thank you for taking my call you bet okay

[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.960]
Rooms to go let's get that on there. This guy just says no to rooms to go I like the way sound of that

[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.840]
Tampa Tribute apologize we should have talked about this yesterday

[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.320]
But nobody cares about it anyway, but I just mentioned it

[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.960]
They apologize to the readers in the Tampa Bay Lightning yesterday and for mistakenly writing an editorial saying the hockey team had lost

[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:31.280]
The Stanley Cup finals. Oh my god. What about your bozos but then again they're in Tampa what do you expect?

[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:40.060]
Publisher Gill Teelin said it was unclear how the mistake was made Monday night is the newspaper rushed depressed following the lightnings 2 to 1 victory of the Calgary Flames in games 7 the tribune

[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.340]
Prepare two editorials one for a win and one for a loss

[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.040]
But despite placing the correct editor on its computerized

[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.120]
Page making system the one prepared for a loss appeared somehow in the newspapers

[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.020]
275,000 copies and they apologize they said we took a puck in the guts and yada yada yada

[00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:02.520]
And the correct editorial which did not get in the paper a lot of the team and credit the team for generating private 7 in the community

[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:10.980]
And this happened in the our post last October when the early editions of the paper carried that editorial be moaning the Yankees lost to the red socks and the American league playoffs

[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:16.120]
But then the Yankees it staged late rally to tie game 7-1 at next trainings and they again the post had egg on their

[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:25.040]
POSPER well deserved it's a root per Murdoch piece of crap. So there you go just a little mistake there. Oh we lost and we feel so bad. Oh no you won. Well like I said we lost

[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:34.300]
This is kind of a disturbing story. Remember party at the same time and Judy comes back wearing Johnny's ring and so sings girl cry if I want to

[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:42.840]
I'll cry if I want to you would cry too if it happened to you. Well tears were not how one 13 year old Baltimore girl handles such a betrayal at a recent birthday party

[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:48.740]
According to the associated press when the birthday girls boyfriend kissed a 12 year old guest on the cheek at the party

[00:20:48.740 --> 00:21:01.220]
The birthday girls mother was furious and ordered her daughter to handle your business at which point the unfortunate guest Nicole Ashley Towns was savagely beaten by six women and girls including the mother and sent into a coma

[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.640]
It's tough imagining a Leslie Gortoon coming out of that story maybe a J Frank Wilson one but not less the Gore

[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:16.860]
But it does seem to fit with the girls gone wild phenomenon spreading across American culture according to AP around the country school police and teachers are seeing a growing tendency for girls

[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:28.780]
Deciddle disputes with their fists. I think it's Muhammad Ali's daughter's fault. What's her name? I don't know whatever it is. It is still true that violence among boys is a much bigger problem than violence among girls is measured by

[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:37.720]
Rest statistics but AP reports while it used to be the ratio was 10 to 1 now it's only 4 to 1 and while the surge of violence among girls has been seen primarily at the lower end of the social

[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:45.440]
economic scale is by no means exclusive there just flashback the news about the violent powder prop girls football game in an affluent Chicago

[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:51.900]
A suburb or one girl a group of girls brutalize another group of girls howled helplessly on the ground even to the point of breaking bones

[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.960]
A rat! My!

[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.580]
And look, this is 4 to 1.560

[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.900]
Way from way down

[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.060]
She don't win

[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.500]
Or if she played in the sledge

[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.540]
She plays slow

[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.480]
And both she does this scratch

[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.980]
And both she's so hot

[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.000]
And so in the hot up

[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.940]
Well I get this from her

[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.280]
Absolutely

[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.840]
Now I get this

[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.460]
Takes from her

[00:22:59.460 --> 00:22:59.720]
Ow!

[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:07.480]
A man looks or not for the sky

[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.300]
Licks the mole under my right eye

[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.980]
She's a stinky family player

[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:29.300]
But I get this from her

[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.680]
Alright

[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.960]
I get lost

[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.280]
All sex from her

[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.680]
For some reason we don't believe you but that's okay 1032 to 560 WDQAM

[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.420]
I wasn't in town yesterday I couldn't hear the show but by listening to your poll results I was shocked to hear

[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:48.980]
Shock

[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.140]
That Sylvester Stallone was nowhere to be found

[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:52.740]
Recount

[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.600]
Now see the reason he was in honors because nobody in the right mind ever said he was an actor

[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.820]
Right even as crazy ma

[00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.980]
Even soon she knows better

[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.660]
She'll take the cash but she knows better

[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.020]
Suggesting for today's poll from the same chronic

[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.140]
Macchrist giant horrible experience with him in the past macchrist giant got in court

[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.400]
Well like I said good

[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.960]
Here's one that says bird eyes macy's it's been crappy since the merger

[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:20.800]
I didn't even know there wasn't merger that's how to touch I am an addition to which I went into shop and eat the place anyway

[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.880]
Hate bird eyes

[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.020]
Right overpriced

[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.720]
Yeah overpriced and go to the get the same merchandise in a lot of other million other places

[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.540]
Plus I don't like their attitude

[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.740]
I remember back the first time to the casino gambling thing was on a ballot they were one of the prime fighter

[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:39.540]
The because they you know huh where they now yeah because they wanted to continue paying their help

[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:45.920]
A minimum wage or close to it and they didn't want the idea of casinos coming in and changing the whole economic base of the community

[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.360]
So as a result anyway I hate bird eyes like poison and they're overpriced

[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.040]
So we can put bird eyes or bird eyes macy's however you want to put it on there it's fine with me I'm easy

[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.860]
Gallop has carry ahead

[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:05.280]
A new Gallop pool finds senator John Kerry enjoying a slight lead over bush while bushes approval ratings remain relatively unchanged

[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:11.440]
But for the most part in negative territory all right the president's continuing strength is in the public's perception

[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.260]
It's a perception of how well he's fighting the war on terrorism while his performance ratings in other areas the economy

[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:22.620]
Forman affairs the situation in Iraq energy policy prescription drugs for older Americans all listed higher disapproval and approval

[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:29.040]
In the pool itself Kerry leads bush 50 to 44% among likely voters six points

[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:38.280]
So what does it say here enjoying a slight lead six points into shabby the way things were in a three-man race Kerry leads bush 49 to 43

[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.800]
Would they to get in five percent but it still sounds like six points to me if my math be correct

[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.260]
Okay

[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:51.160]
Okay, I like that. I still carry just by sitting back and being like a Herman monster and not saying too much he's again and by you know

[00:25:51.680 --> 00:26:00.500]
By default yeah right speaking of default yes, what's this word you wrote on the on the pole sheet that you faxed me painful deification

[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.700]
Oh, yeah, I'm glad you're minding me about that but see now you just by reading it it took the

[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:12.420]
Oh, sorry, it's funny. Yeah, because we're gonna have think I was gonna have a segment

[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:17.020]
We're gonna do about the oldest tributes to Reagan and Duff was Duff was gonna read the piece

[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.300]
It was gonna be titled painful deification. Yeah, this is all this what's happening with Ray it is

[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:28.540]
Waitful it is and and the course Duff being the expert back home in that area we thought he would mouth the

[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.760]
Story about painful deification at any rate

[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.100]
Court upholds Bible class ban

[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.980]
Yeah, I'm glad you're reminded me of that because I do write these things down and my Alzheimer's gets in

[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.780]
That's why I write them down in the first place, but I forget I wrote them down a

[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.480]
Federal appeals court is upheld a ruling that argued weekly Bible classes are unconstitutional in the public schools of Rhea County

[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:56.020]
That's Chattanooga the same County where the Scopes Monkey trial pitted the creationist against the evolution is 79 years ago

[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.240]
The Scopes Monkey trial a

[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:04.940]
Three-judged panel of the 60 West Church Court of Appeals and Cincinnati agreed Monday with a February 2002 ruling by US District Judge

[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.540]
R. Allen Edgar of Chattanooga

[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.400]
You ain't seen nothing till you seen Tennessee, mister. I'll tell you that right now Tennessee

[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:18.920]
Edgar ruled that the Bible education ministry program in Rhea County violated the first amendment clause calling for separation of church and state

[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.040]
The 30-minute classes

[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:26.840]
Third man or held weekly for about 800 students in kindergarten through fifth grade at the country three elementary schools

[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:32.580]
These are pubic schools no less ready ready for that parental consent was not required in students for a lot of

[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.260]
Participating alternative activities that they objected the classes Rhea County

[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:41.100]
Superintendent Sue Carter said Monday that school board members would likely discuss whether or appeal the latest ruling at their

[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:47.620]
Third denied meeting tomorrow Bible classes have been offered in Rhea County for 51 years and of course slavery probably till about five minutes ago

[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.880]
I'm disappointed not surprised though

[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:56.240]
The appeals judges ruled that all those school officials contended that the classes were valued driven teaching responsibility and

[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.800]
Positive morals they were also teaching the Bible as religious truth

[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.700]
Which of course only Neanderthals only morons would believe that religious truth this gobbledy

[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.420]
Gook written by primitive stupid people thousands of years ago passed on word of mouth on

[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:15.460]
Scratched on rest of them walls things like that right near the glory holes

[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:20.720]
The what that's what we have yeah, oh glory glory to the Lord

[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:27.540]
This county city of Dayton about 35 miles northwest of Chant Nougat's where orator and presidential candidate William Jennings

[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:34.940]
Brian and attorney Clarence Darrow squared off an agreement during that 1925 prosecution of teacher John T. Scopes for teaching evolution

[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:39.800]
Oh my god in the public schools instead of the biblical story the bubble my season of creation from the Bible

[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:44.240]
That is the jubilee Bible and not to be confused with the Muslim Bible or the

[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.220]
Anybody else's Bible the Hindus the

[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.700]
Christian scientists

[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.660]
all of these people the

[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:57.760]
Scientologist El Ron how about they to happy about it either I should point out remember El Ron how about sure

[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:03.300]
The only guy know that still writing books from the grave maybe Ron here write his autobiography got plenty of time now

[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.920]
Radio giant here's the story of the day. I saved the most important story for right now

[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:16.660]
Radio giant in record in decency settlement the federal communications commission the grave robbers that they are the bastards

[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.900]
They lunatics the maniacs that they most definitely are

[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:27.180]
The FCC has reached a record setting nearly two million dollar settlement with clear-channel communications the anti-Colestos

[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:33.300]
That would clear the radio giant of all charges of indecency lodges against it including on a remarks made by shock-talk

[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.620]
Howard Stern according to government and radio industry sources

[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.940]
Stern was the cause of previous record settlement between the FCC and a radio company in

[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.280]
1995 I come in co-owned infinity broadcasting which syndicates

[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:51.440]
Sir and show in 35 cities including Washington paid the FCC one point seven million dollars to wipe away indecency charges against the popular host

[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.180]
Clear channel drops during show from six stations in February as you know certainly

[00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:01.020]
The deal was could be announced as soon as today is the result of months of negotiations between the FCC and clear channel

[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.760]
The nation's largest obnoxious right-wing radio company with more than

[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:10.400]
250 stations according to the sources who declined to be identified because the details of the agreement have been finalized

[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:16.360]
Perhaps the most important deal one source said is that the deal would not cover only clear channels outstanding fines

[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.800]
But also dozens of listener complaints in the FCC's indecency pipeline that it hasn't even been ruled on yet

[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.360]
Now the resist kind of like washes everything away. You got it?

[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:31.260]
I got it 1.7 million that's a peanuts to them again multi-billion dollar company if those complaints were to be sold in fines

[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.160]
I can cross the radio company many more millions

[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.100]
But they won't now because they made kind of a backdoor deal to like wash all of the stuff off

[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.080]
You've got a couple of million and we'll you know, we'll say it's okay for old times sake

[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:51.240]
And it goes on after the FCC's enforcement bureau levies of fine a broadcaster can choose to pay it contested or negotiated settlement

[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:58.760]
It takes a majority vote of the FCC's five commissioner to demand a fire to accept the settlement such as the one crafted between the FCC and clear channel attorneys

[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.540]
Wiley Reinen fielding sources said the deal was approved by vote of 4 to 1

[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:09.220]
The FCC's three Republican commissioners of course chairman Michael Powell Kevin J Martin and Kathleen Q

[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:14.880]
Abernathy I wonder what the Q stands for voted for the settlement according to sources on both sides Democratic commissioner Jonathan S.

[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.840]
Edelstein agreed in part but Democrat Michael cops voted against the settlement according to FCC sources

[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.600]
Instead wanting each complaint against their channel to be examined rather than grouped into a universal settlement

[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:32.780]
In other words can't let them off the whole even for old times sake because Michael cops one of the Democrats on the commission is even more rabid than Michael Powell and arrest of these go

[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:33.540]
I'm how do you like that?

[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.140]
So if you think that it's party politics that ain't it

[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:42.400]
It's repression and depression and suppression in America freedom of speech forget about it

[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:55.880]
And

[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.500]
Gold there is a party girl party girl party girl

[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.080]
And culture is a party girl party girl party girl

[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.660]
Under back

[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:38.760]
Rory

[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.880]
More the smother of the girl who wants to be a media home for girls and on top Quiver

[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.760]
You want more on this lady?

[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:52.520]
Well, give you she's got a book to read about slammed the ring nobody knows more about slander and out with a big scoop about anyone to the left of

[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.460]
Mangala such a good Christian girl you want to strangle

[00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:01.000]
Fondificating who she's a political pond if on tip pick paintings from on the floor and

[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.140]
A Republican's can't keep home

[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:10.560]
She's a federalist in most making liberal a dirty word, you know in a many search your own can't go

[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.640]
And

[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.480]
Go to nose what they can be in a really skirt that spells fishy

[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.100]
She's a tall drink of water on the side of our daughter with the back alley look to be like your garage dollar

[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:25.500]
If you got the money she'll spread those names with a cigarette and a charge name and

[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.020]
Go there and tell her a little one that's the angel

[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:36.800]
I gotta have that to drop in that last sound there that that's whatever that was the slap no no the

[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.460]
Before that the well won't want whatever that was special

[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.880]
I'll buy itself anyway

[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.160]
Here's a diaphragm of lows that somebody that I mean a little a peyote about low

[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.700]
Because this is cute you are here way down in the bottom left hand corner

[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.520]
That's got the different aisles and then the employees are all I gathered way off like about two miles away

[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:00.780]
So I think that they want us to book lows on there. We already wronged is that that could be a picture of records

[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.260]
Except he raised all the employees and now why you asked and the records everything is a me

[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.480]
Well, that's not only the it's the way the whole concept that I could just set up the customers

[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.340]
You know they always have those coupons they bring in and that creates the end of the world

[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:18.760]
If you're like about the third person online at records and somebody's got one of those coupon books forget about it

[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.920]
You're never gonna live long enough to get the transaction done for a put your crap down

[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.320]
Just throw it on a ground and go to Walgreens now

[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:30.460]
Why are you asking me if we should do this other one or not? Why do you ask that on a kind of suits recent history?

[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:38.460]
That's got nothing to do with this okay just ask you know, it's paranoid time first of all that we're done with that

[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:43.140]
All right, I know that I know that and that didn't have to do with the organization that had to do with one individual

[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:48.940]
But nevertheless never less it's got to forget about that see nobody gets an all-time exemption

[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.020]
Well, I would not want say nobody

[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.840]
No, we've had you are we've had you are sanity so once in a while we give somebody a permanent exemption say

[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.160]
Let somebody else worry about you, you know just thought I'd ask but somebody says a brand's mark

[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:06.880]
They suck big time and of course I spent a lot of money in brands mark back in the day like one now now that I fought out to hate

[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.500]
Me like poison

[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.100]
Well guess what I wouldn't spend a dime there

[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.340]
I can be another one besides brand's mark to put on there and not for the same reason that's best buy

[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:22.440]
Okay, I'm not going in anywhere where I have to stand around waiting and waiting and waiting what is about a half a dozen idiots running around and

[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:27.460]
Like oh just go over there and stand at the counter and we'll get to you know like like you have to go step in there

[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.880]
Well, yeah, but what I know exactly what I want but it's right up there

[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.940]
Just can you please get something with the ladder and just grab it off of there

[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:37.900]

[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.060]
Eric all I did was just make a suggestion you have to write me back a book of your life

[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:33.880]
Stir understand times are tough. You're trying to make ends meet you got to push you Japanese wife all of these things

[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:40.920]

[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.880]
Oh, at least he's funny

[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:50.520]
Stephen King says the indecency who flies silly speaking of that SEC and cheap channel back door deal where they bottom out for a less than two million dollars

[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.840]
Stephen King on infinity broadcasting's

[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.540]
Mara Davis and Dunham in the morning show yesterday morning

[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.940]
Stephen King said I think it's nonsense what I think about it is a word that I don't want to use on the radio

[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:07.360]
I'll get you guys in trouble. It makes me angry and it's silly and what happened Howard Stern is silly

[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.280]
I don't listen to him

[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:12.000]
I think he's silly but at the same time I think you ought to have a right to be silly on a radio

[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]
This is America. It's a free country and we're supposed to have the right of free speech

[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.380]
That's the way it works in America or the way it's supposed to work in America if Stern is saying stuff on a radio

[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:25.360]
You don't like it. It depends you. You've got a hand reach out take hold of the knob turn it off. He's gone goodbye

[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.300]
You don't need a politician in your living room to see you've got got to put a band-aid over that guy's mouth nice

[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.920]
Go on Stephen King. How do you like that?

[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.200]
One American who's left who's got the balls to stick up her freedom of speech?

[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.260]
You don't like it turn it off. That's all don't give us this excuse

[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:45.840]
I was the children the children right the children are speaking words that you never even heard yet out there in the school yard

[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.600]
Who tell you can? Well, that's why see they learned it off the TV

[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.080]
Yeah, right sure they did they learned it from each other in fact they got together and made them up

[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.320]
Like in code so we don't know what they're talking about

[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.480]
Here's some good news though some great news before that. Here's line six Q. I. Am hello

[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.580]
Pretty good paly what's up?

[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.960]
You like it?

[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.040]
Yeah

[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:15.420]
I work with my hands and all the time I'm there and it's a big attack

[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:23.180]
Okay, thanks pal have a great and they'll see a home Depot not I agree home depots blow he say home Depot blow

[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.040]
Can I have a good list here and then I'm gonna say to you and we don't exempt anybody from this list

[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.080]
If you're one of our fine sponsors that great just have a nice sense of humor and not as a case maybe

[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.920]
But if there are people out there who don't like you they're entitled not to like you might be the best retail outfit going

[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.040]
But if they hate you like poison they're entitled

[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:44.320]
What retail place in South Florida you hate the most so far Walmart 54?

[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.140]
I think George has got a lock on that nobody likes Walmart evil

[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:54.040]
Well nobody likes it, but everybody's shopping in there all that dollars trailer party. Yeah, there you go those people

[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.760]
I've been in there a couple of times like for you know what they're good for like turl it stuff

[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.100]
They're good for crap

[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:11.800]
Really they have to get a toilet seat or something like that or and then the can I say that ball cock or whatever the thing is in there in the town anymore? Oh the ball

[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.300]
That goes in there right

[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:20.320]
And that's the kind of place where you go and get stuff like that now originally I would have gone to Kmart

[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.940]
But of course, you know the Kmart up by me is long gone. It's history

[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.080]
As Mary Schellenberger would say it's history, but that's just the way it goes

[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.920]
Because that's one of the reasons we hate Walmart is they come along to try to put everybody outside of business

[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.120]
Just like Wayne High Pingadid with his with his what you call it

[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.200]
What do you call it with his blockbuster? That's the same thing. Yeah, yeah

[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.520]
Put all the a mom and pop people out of business the movie the video store

[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.940]
And then of course he bailed out and took all his money with the tears and his eyes. Yeah

[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.960]
How's blockbuster park? Come on a my scene at only no

[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.040]
Walmart 54 when Dixie 38

[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.960]
Accords 25 rooms to go 11 circuit city 10

[00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:00.960]
Brandsmart 3 birdinds 2 macfers giant one best by one

[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:05.100]
Loes don't have any effort. I'm sure we'll have to all the artwork the after the way effort he made to make that

[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.320]
Uh sams club none and pet boys none 145 votes sams club

[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.520]
Yeah, I'm right out there by me, but I never been in it. Don't go. No, never

[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:20.100]
They're owned by Walmart, aren't they? I think they are they're owned by Walmart. They're one in the same. Oh my god

[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.460]
The antique least there's every way I

[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:28.020]
Don't know that. Sam always a little bit liry about these places. They're all over

[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.080]
It's a private club, but it's not a private club, you know what I mean?

[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.980]
In other words, uh, you can go in there and they'll hand anybody a little kid can go in there. Oh here's a card

[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:40.680]
You know you remember a sams club and they but I understand they sell stuff cheap

[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:48.780]
It's it's just like a Costco. They sell it in quantity and they got everything Costco's the same thing right? And so what's not to like about that?

[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.820]
BJ's I beg your pardon

[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.340]
T. P. J's

[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:54.660]
Wow

[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.120]
Yeah, I wish I know he'll be there by noon rectum

[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:08.900]
Anyway, radio shak. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. I forgot about this. Oh, yeah radio shlock. This is such a bad retail establishment boys and girls

[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:16.600]
Now if you want I don't like a little some kind of like a little electrical part that you can't find any place like some kind of a little dohickey or something like that

[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.940]
And maybe it's about a 79 cent piece of equipment and you finally find it or somebody finds it for you

[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.900]
Which is unlikely, but you find it hanging on a wall somewhere and you take it to the counter

[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.720]
That's the worst thing you can do

[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:32.880]
Because when you go to the counter and radio shlock what they want to do is have your shoe size your your whole life history

[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.000]
I mean they want it all I tell them I tell them none of your business

[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.420]
That's a quote says they watch your phone number even if you buy a battery from the

[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.480]
That's exactly right. I'll see what's your address in your phone number and

[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.120]
I don't know what's anymore. It's the last time you got laid

[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.040]
Radio shacks put it on there

[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.600]
For once when somebody says to me or you can pick that up a radio shak. I don't immediately

[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.840]
I'm never gonna throw that piece of equipment out whatever I need for it

[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.140]
Here's the good news. I was gonna give you a film industry gives controversial Iraq film ovation

[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.060]
Where's that Iraq film ovation?

[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.060]
Why don't they just say controversial film ovation

[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:11.580]
Director Michael Moore's controversial anti-Iraq war film

[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:15.820]
Firman Highton 11 when a standing ovation last night from an audience of film industry professionals

[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:21.520]
Attending its west coast debut at Academy Ward headquarters in Beverly Hills after an audience of more than 600 people

[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:26.500]
The theater of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences cheered whistle and laughed their way through the two-hour film

[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:30.100]
They jumped to their feet to give more a standing ovation as he took the stage

[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:37.300]
Clearly boyed by the reception Moore whose film is scathingly critical and mocking a president bush declared

[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.200]
There's been a shift in this country the average American is finally beginning to figure it out

[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.720]
We were dupped into invading Iraq. I hope this country will be back in our hands and a short period of time

[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:50.400]
He had it Republicans have denounced the film as unfair obviously because there's too much truth in it

[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.620]
Fahrenheit 9-11 with a strong attack on the US president who's highly unpopular in Europe

[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.020]
One of the top prize that they recently can film festival

[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:02.840]
But it was refused distribution by the Walt Disney company was Miramax film unit made the movie Disney chief Michael Eisner

[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.180]
Is it really worth the effort to do it? Michael

[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.560]
Eisner said the company did not want to distribute a highly partisan film in the middle of a presidential election year

[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.720]
What a cop out that is so he sold the rights to the film back to Miramax heads Bob and

[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:22.420]
Miramax heads Bob and Harvey Weinstein who formed a consortium to distribute the film and they'll have it in the theaters a week from Friday June 25

[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.360]
It's getting close

[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:29.800]
The dispute led to a spate of stories of bad blood between the battle Eisner and the Weinstein's including a recent one in the

[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.100]
York Times that speculated Eisner was seeking a buyer for the prestigious Miramax unit

[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.740]
There's nothing like having a buyer for your unit

[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:42.300]
Weinstein alluded that controversy when introduced the film and joke that he and his brother were taking out a classified ad saying

[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.340]
Two executives looking for a company to run resumes on request

[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.260]
He added if you know any of you know anything will be waiting outside

[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:54.340]
More one an Academy Award for his 2002 documentary bowling for Columbine about the Columbine high school massacre in Colorado

[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.460]
And the ease with which one could buy a gun in the US of age

[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:02.960]
In Zermark's last night more predicted Fahrenheit 911 will do three times as well as as Columbine movie

[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.840]
Which you're in direct at a month for a documentary film of 21 and a half million dollars more told Reuters after where that

[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:14.820]
Furnite would open in between 500 and a thousand theaters on June 25th and amazingly high number for a documentary and I wouldn't say that is

[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.540]
I'm gonna look all this

[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.360]
Is five six years

[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.540]
Radio's all yours

[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.020]
You win

[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.100]
Well

[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.100]
My

[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.280]
So

[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.100]
Eight

[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.620]
ล

[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.140]
Price is our high, sure our crazy

[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.500]
Such a simple, stupid, petty little thing

[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.880]
But the cost ain't just foreign, it's skyrocketing

[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.100]
And the reason it's so high, we're just short on supply

[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.360]
And to keep the price is high

[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.860]
There's nothing that they won't try

[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.160]
Would be watching me to buy a smaller automobile

[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.540]
Cost of regular and let it, it's just unreal

[00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.900]
Yeah, I know what's up yet

[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.700]
I know the deal, the oil companies that got a license

[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.000]
Steal a gallon, three bucks won't be enough

[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.320]
I bet that next week it will still go up

[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.440]
Yeah, these times are rough

[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.800]
It was lost, now it's found

[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.980]
I've been glad I've been keeping my sights been around

[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.380]
I don't deserve this, but I do get the message

[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.800]
You pay a premium when fuel is precious

[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.000]
If you don't like it, well then hey, join the crowd

[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.400]
Gonna keep going up so you'll be in, coming down

[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.820]
That's a pump, so late, me, pump, pump, so late, me

[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.000]
Price is our so high, sure our crazy

[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.500]
And the pump, so late, me, pump, so late, me, price is our high

[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.620]
Sure our crazy

[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.920]
We got one mark's got 71, which we know surprised

[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.480]
But when did she's got 49?

[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.620]
What retail place in South Florida?

[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.660]
You hate the most and when Dixie's right there in a solid second

[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:43.460]
Eckerds has got

[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.080]
About third man

[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.000]
Probably would have more except for the sympathy votes

[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.080]
Since the old man croaked

[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:48.800]
Can I kick it?

[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.100]
Yeah

[00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.340]
Now you emailed me a link there and I clicked on it

[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.220]
All it did was take me to ask jeeps.com thing

[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.620]
And, huh?

[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.400]
Yeah, it's from the transportation department

[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.400]
It didn't give you the story?

[00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.060]
No

[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.300]
Alright, let me try differently

[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.820]
What is this story?

[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.560]
Please don't come into about the Ronald Reagan

[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.040]
Yeah, about the Ronald Reagan

[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:08.100]
Turnpike

[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.160]
Turnpike thing there

[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:09.780]
Ten dollar bill

[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.320]
Pentagon

[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.580]
Nice research there

[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.720]
I'll get it to you somehow

[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:13.620]
Okay

[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.140]
That's scary

[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.160]
Everything in the world now is Ronny Reaganist and Ronny Reaganat

[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.400]
Reagan National Airport Reagan Turnpike

[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.440]
As we can write in our life time

[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.400]
See it's one thing to argue about religion

[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.740]
And things that happened like thousands of years ago

[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.100]
How about something that happened in most of our lifetimes

[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.240]
I mean most of us were alive

[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.220]
Like let's see what he left office in 88

[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:34.480]
Would have been his last year, right?

[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:35.380]
Right

[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.340]
And so that's 16 years ago

[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:40.560]
So unless you're like a little punk

[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.680]
You were at least alive when he left office

[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.360]
And probably let's see if he were like 10

[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.480]
Yeah, the overwhelming majority of these people

[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.260]
Like over 10 years old and Reagan left office

[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.880]
So it was at our lifetime these events happen

[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.600]
Now we see what revisionist history is really what it's all about

[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.640]
How they twist and turn and make crap up

[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.180]
But oh, he was the great communicator

[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.520]
And he was the greatest president of the 20th century

[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:02.580]
And he said, all this other crap

[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:03.540]
It's all bull crap

[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.980]
It's all garbage

[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.700]
And so the idea that we're supposed to believe stuff that allegedly was

[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.560]
Or written allegedly happened thousands of years ago

[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.780]
I mean you have to be a lunatic

[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.000]
You have to be a simple thing

[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.040]
You have to be desperate

[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.700]
You have to be like a little shy

[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.440]
Even little children were laughing that crap

[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.020]
If they had a chance to read it before they were brainwashed into it

[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.420]
Like sandy claws

[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.000]
I mean how to sand a fit down through that chimney anyway

[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.060]
Would have big puppet, right?

[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:30.800]
Magic

[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:32.920]
WQM, hello, Lard

[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.540]
Neil God

[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.440]
Yes, sir

[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.420]
Good morning

[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.320]
Buenos dias

[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.040]
Buenos dias, see you as well

[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.540]
Mucha

[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:39.980]
Buenos dias

[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:42.280]
Anyway, I don't know if I'm being redundant or not

[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.480]
Did you happen to see that article about the 100 million

[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.360]
Our beloved Pentagon has spent on airline tickets

[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.720]
Yes, son, it's on our website today

[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.280]
That they never use the tickets, sir

[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:51.620]
It's on there

[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:53.980]
Yeah, sorry for the redundancy, sir

[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.720]
It's okay

[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.860]
Have a great one

[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.460]
It needs to be said over and over again

[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.400]
Thank you and back to you

[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.380]
Yeah, they had a hundred million dollars worth of airline tickets

[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.000]
That they had bought and they never used them

[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:03.660]
The Pentagon

[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:04.660]
Great

[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.680]
I mean, what's a hundred million dollars here

[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.740]
And a few billion over there

[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.520]
And you know

[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:08.940]
It's not a bit

[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.180]
See the public just doesn't care

[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.020]
That's the problem

[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.400]
The public does not care

[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.980]
Here's a headline in the uh

[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.480]
Observer in England

[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.980]
And the headline says

[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.020]
Catastrophe

[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:20.940]
It's about the Iraq prison abuse scandal

[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:21.180]
And

[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:21.720]
Abu Gharr

[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.420]
And not just there but overall

[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:27.120]
It says the White House faced its biggest crisis over Iraq last week

[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.600]
But its origins lie in practices that may have been routine

[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.200]
May have been routine

[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.120]
Not just it

[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.140]
We reveal how the abusive prisoners began

[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.460]
Long before the sickening images which have outraged the world appeared

[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.980]
Now this is on our website

[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.880]
And the headline is Catastrophe

[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.400]
But uh it's much much too long

[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.100]
Even a ponderous old fool like me

[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.420]
That's a seven pages long

[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.160]
And even a silly person like George

[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.820]
Wouldn't encourage me to read all of this

[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.620]
Oh please

[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:53.040]
No no change

[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.540]
You're crazy

[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.180]
I will read a little bit

[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.540]
No not that reading again

[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.480]
Oh yeah wait till we get to the Reagan stuff today

[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.200]
Long over to all we're gonna speak in a Reagan

[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:02.720]
Our expression

[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.420]
Everywhere

[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.700]
Family members include

[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.540]
Oh brother

[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:06.480]
See this

[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.100]
You know I should have started

[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:08.820]
I screwed up today

[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.220]
What I really need to start with was

[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.660]
The media is sick and they talk badly

[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.300]
I mean even when Tom Brokhan Dan Reather

[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.780]
Is saying please please cracker please

[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.200]
And I'm far ready with a Reagan crap

[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.440]
And these people on these talking head networks

[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.160]
Especially they're just obsessed with it

[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.220]
I wonder what's on MSNBC right now

[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:25.820]
It's a matter of fact

[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.180]
I bet you they got something different on them

[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.020]
They come are saying

[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.280]
Michael Weber and a lot of them are saying

[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.820]
That this is really the last chance for

[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.720]
All of the old Reagan cabinet

[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.920]
Oh oh please please please

[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.680]
How about the BBC

[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.220]
How about you they got something different on

[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:41.880]
For the terrorists

[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.160]
Who demanded that the three signs

[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.520]
And strong Italian force in Iraq

[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.560]
Should be like that

[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.520]
They're showing the three Italians

[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.800]
Just got home to Fumacino

[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.880]
To a Leonardo da Vinci airport in Roma

[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.260]
They're home safe in the live

[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.920]
Hey are you saying they have a lot of big rack women in the pool

[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.060]
There you go

[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.340]
So what's not to like about that

[00:49:58.340 --> 00:49:59.940]
And I'm talking about I'm talking head networks

[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.020]
That's a different kind

[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.180]
And on the CBC

[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:05.480]
20 year liberal senator from Ontario

[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.460]
Oh they're talking about the abhorian Canadian elections

[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.720]
That are coming up June 28

[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.180]
And boy it's not looking too good for liberals

[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.560]
I'll tell you that Paul Martin man

[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.680]
I think he made me going down

[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.620]
So to speak

[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.680]
How do you like that?

[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:15.160]
That's shocking

[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.420]
Anyway getting back to this

[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.320]
There are two versions of what

[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.560]
Specialist Sabrina Harmon

[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.720]
US military police officer was doing with the camera

[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.960]
And the notorious Abu Ghra

[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.940]
And the notorious

[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:24.560]
Abu Ghra

[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:25.760]
Prison outside

[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.060]
Backed at he says it's so well

[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:27.840]
Why should I do it?

[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.940]
According to her mother the former assistant manager of Papa John's

[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.320]
Pizza restaurant in North Virginia

[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.000]
Was collecting evidence of improper treatment in the jail

[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.400]
I don't like Papa John's by the way

[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:37.760]
Okay

[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.680]
I don't think he's to bring us three pizzas at IOD

[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.800]
But I'm not big fan of their stuff

[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.100]
Robert Harmon told yesterday is Washington post

[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:48.500]
That when her daughter told her what she was doing during her two weeks leave at home last November

[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.440]
She told her to stop

[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.120]
We got into an argument about it at four o'clock in the morning

[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.820]
Sabrina said she had to prove this

[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.820]
I told her to bring the pictures home hide them and stay out of it

[00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:01.500]
It's not an explanation accepted by the military investigate is probing harmin's role in the abuse at

[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:07.000]
Neither is it an explanation seemingly born out of the digital photograph seat from harmin's laptop

[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.700]
Among the hundreds of pictures found is one taken before a unit got to

[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.400]
Abu Ghra

[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.920]
Last October a gruesome trophy photograph showing a harmin

[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:18.560]
Crouching by a decaying corpse giving the camera a thumbs up and a grin

[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.820]
Resolination is also in contradiction with the charges he faces

[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:25.980]
For what's harmin was emerged as a central figure in the abuse allegations at Abu Ghra

[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:31.040]
A figure involved in some of those shocking pictures to emerge from the prison

[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.180]
Oh my god

[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:37.060]
Harmon was one of two soldiers opposed for the now infamous photograph of a pyramid of naked Iraqis in the jail

[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:41.040]
She's charged with photographing and videotaping detainees ordered a strip and masturbate

[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:45.240]
And it is harmin who stands accused of attaching wires to a hooded prisoner stood on a box

[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.720]
And telling him that he'd be electrocuted if he fell off

[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.320]
Even harmin's witness statement to investigate his fails to stand up to the claim by her family and lawyer

[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.680]
That she was one of the good guys amid the bad. She makes it clear that she was a participant in the institutionalized torture

[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.820]
The person who brought them in would set the standards and whether or not to be nice said harmin

[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:07.300]
If the prisoner was cooperating then he'd be able to keep his jumpsuit macros and was allowed cigarettes on request or even hot food

[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:12.760]
But if the prisoner didn't give us what they wanted it was all taken away until military intelligence decided

[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:17.640]
Sleep food, clothing, macros and cigarettes, raw privileges and were granted with information received

[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:22.880]
The statement confirms what the international Red Cross committee has been saying for months

[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.580]
In visits to Iraq's US-administered prison that's been documenting abuse that was not the exception

[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:33.520]
But was close to the norm of use that was tethered onto a policy of torture and tolerated by coalition forces

[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:38.720]
According to harmin prisoners were stripped, searched and then made the stand or kneel for hours

[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.180]
At other times they were forced to stand on boxes or hold boxes or to exercise

[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:50.320]
Seatlessly and what's become increasingly clear in the past few days and interviews with the training special forces soldiers from Iraq was that the techniques employed at Abu Gharr

[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:55.000]
We're not simply for the cool entertainment of military policemen and private contractors running the prison

[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.300]
But an even cooler application of abusive interrogation techniques

[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.460]
front of both US and British special forces

[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:05.840]
What's also become clear is that concern over what was happening to Iraqi detainees have been circulating for months

[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:10.340]
Both within the coalition and within the Red Cross and human rights organizations monitoring Iraq

[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.960]
Suddenly an administration that seemed immune to bad news from Iraq has been forth on the defensive as the images of harmin and her colleagues

[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:21.820]
Cheerfully abusing prisoners in their charge have emerged as a metaphor for the coalition's failures in Iraq

[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:29.860]
That has been a catastrophe for US foreign policy is asserted by usually robot senior Pentagon officials who claim privately that Iraq policy is now

[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:35.520]
97% disaster and the war is no longer being planned by crisis managed from day to day and

[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:41.940]
Contastrophe was the word used by beleaguered secretary of state Donald Rumsfeld a defense secretary during his humiliating appearance before Congress

[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:46.080]
So there's just a little bit of that it's seven long pages and it'll make you want to puke your guts out

[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.080]
Contastrophe that's a headline got it. It's a catastrophe. We got it. It's a disaster

[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.080]
Disaster like what's his name Robert Duval said in network

[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.440]
Disaster death now

[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:00.780]
Asked crop refuses to give Congress torture memo

[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:05.000]
But do you watch yesterday and the eclipse from the hearings? They were just raking him Ted Kennedy

[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.480]
You know there's a raking him over the coals. They were just busting his balls man. It was great

[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.460]
He was covering him up with a towel, but they were busting them anyway

[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:18.760]
The US Attorney General refused to give lawmakers copies of adjusted department memo that allegedly advised the White House that tortured during the war interior

[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.360]
Interrogations could be justified

[00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:26.520]
The Washington Post had an August 2002 memo sent by the Justice Department in response to a C.I. request for legal guidance

[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:32.800]
Said the international laws against torture may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations conducted during the war on terrorism

[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:38.080]
But Attorney General John Ascroft refused to provide the memo to lawmakers on the Senate judiciary committee

[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:44.720]
We believe that to provide this kind of information would impair the ability of advice giving the executive branch to be candid forth right through and accurate at all times

[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:49.000]
Ascroft said ascroft to lawmakers that while the administration rejects torture

[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.160]
He said he could not provide specific details of communications between his office and a White House

[00:54:53.160 --> 00:55:00.260]
Congress has the right to ask whatever questions it wants he continued, but there are certain things that in the interest of the executive branch operating effectively

[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.840]
That I think it's inappropriate for the Attorney General to say

[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:07.620]
Democrats expressed outrage at ascroft's refusal to provide the document

[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:10.800]
You may be in contempt of Congresswoman Democratic Senator Joe Biden

[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.640]
You're not allowed not to answer our questions

[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:18.320]
He said adding that the justice department had better come up with a good rationale for refusing to furnish the memo

[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:21.960]
Meanwhile the Senate's top Democrat Tom D'Ashel said at a press conference

[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:26.640]
It's very important for Congress to have the documents say that any document that suggests torture might be permissible

[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.040]
Underminds the rule of law in this country and around the world

[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.900]
Senator Ted Kennedy said

[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:36.280]
Senator Kennedy drew a direct link between the memo and the abuse committed by US troops against inmates at the

[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.580]
Abu Gharram Prison in Iraq

[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.420]
We know when these kinds of orders

[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:46.020]
We know when we have these kinds of orders what happens Kennedy said that they're hearing holding now familiar photos of detainees

[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:49.440]
Being mistreated at the facility we get the stress test we get the use of dogs

[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.060]
We get the force nakedness that we've all seen

[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.160]
This is what directly results when he had that kind of memorandum out there

[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:59.100]
The Massachusetts senator said the justice department memo addressed the White House counsel L. Berkdoggenzalas

[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:08.460]
reportedly said torturing a suspect in captivity may be justified if the US government employee involved will be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the US by the al-Qaeda terrorist network

[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:09.220]
Yadi Yadi Yadi

[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:39.200]
Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Yadi Y

[00:56:39.200 --> 00:57:09.180]
But I just looked at it very quickly. It's a good picture too of Rebecca Romain Stamos. Yeah, but I thought I actually thought that there were hands on her breasts. Right. Well, they're the word. That's the input that I left. No, no, seriously. Well, you I never really realized you were so dark. But it's just like dark tattooed hands. Huh? They were dirty hands. They were dark hands. And then you and I thought my god there are warts on those hands. And then I really

[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:22.140]
realized those are warts. Those are absolutely something else. Yeah, they are. That's another one you have to look at fairly closely to kind of like figure it out. I look at it really closely. And to find out what's new. Well, there you go.

[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:36.520]
Or it's after a lot of good stuff on there for today. Just try to stay at least three or four feet away from your screen. Okay, at all times from your monitor. Please because they're monitoring.

[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:48.460]
You can't really drive concepts. As a matter of fact, your carpet is as bad as your sink when it comes to collecting germs. In fact, maybe even worse, because your kids and your pets and you and God only knows what's being not only dropped in there, but stopped on it with your feet, all out of the stuff.

And they'll never rip you off because they don't play any games. The dry concepts that white people are so excited to use them because they do a stupidest unbeatable job.

[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:47.820]
We're sports radio 560-UAM.

[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:57.780]
Name has changed over the years. What our commitment to serving kitchen fresh chicken hasn't because KFC stands for Kitchen Fresh Chicken.

[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:04.720]
Wait, I thought it stood for Kentucky Fried Chicken. And why do we call it Kitchen Fresh because that's the only kind of chicken we serve.

[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:11.780]
And that's why when people think KFC they think Kitchen Fresh Chicken. Well I still think Kentucky Fried Chicken.

[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:21.180]
There's only one KFC and it's the only place to go for Kitchen Fresh Chicken. Kentucky Fried Chicken. No, it's Kitchen Fresh Chicken.

[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:32.260]
It's Kentucky Fried Chicken. KFC. Now you got it. KFC. Kitchen Fresh Chicken. Never mind. Do you still have extra crispy? Sure.

[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:41.820]
But now it's called extremely crunchy and it's only at KFC. Kitchen Fresh Chicken. For gay. I'm going to Boston Chicken. Don't you mean Boston Market?

[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:49.240]
Ah! KFC. Where our food is just like our name. There's a little bit of chicken in there somewhere.

[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:55.760]
Or you can just take off all your clothes, hop in a car and go over to Vodhangels Drive-Thru. Well. And throw at your loopa atom.

[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:07.340]
Which retail place in South Florida you hate the most. That's our poll question today. Let it get out of your system. 289 votes. So far Wal-Mart's the leader but they're not off all by himself.

[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:10.900]
89 for Wal-Mart. Windixi 68.

[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:18.800]
Eckerds 44. Now do we want to put publics on there because I love publics and publics. I got a lot of friends there. Publics and it's a great store.

[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:24.320]
But I'm sure that there must be some of the Windixi people who hate publics. Right? Maybe you never heard anybody complain about publics.

[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.680]
The only thing probably that they don't like about publics is that A. It's owned by a bunch of goody Tushas, Born Again Christians and B.

[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:40.940]
And I don't know about the supermarkets because I only shop at publics when I'm home but they're very big on letting the pain in the ass people out front.

[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:53.200]
You know that the girls scout cookies and the salvation arm. Huh? That's everybody. Well, I bothers a hell out of me. Sure. And then if they don't get you going in there, they you know damn well they recognize you when you're coming out.

[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.400]
You go in and you buy two items. You in the express line. You get out of there in about two minutes and you come right out walk by the same people again.

[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:08.480]
They're like a hinting up for more crap. No, thanks. No, thanks. I'm diabetic. Those cookies will kill me. Windixi 68. Eckerds 44. Brandsmart 18.

[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:21.600]
Rooms to go 14. Radio Shack 14. Circant City 12. Pep Boys 6. Home Depot. This thing just flopped on me again. Home Depot has got the 7. Pep Boys 6. Best 5, 5.

[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:30.840]
Maxis Giant Force. Sam's Club 3 and Loes 2. Best 5's only got 5. Well, I guess so probably those people out there got a lot more patience than we do.

[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:43.340]
Number one. Number two. They don't mind standing around for hours to save a few bucks. They got plenty of time. I mean, their prices are you know, they're better than circuit city, but who don't want to stand in there waiting and waiting.

[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:52.300]
It's frustrating too because you just you just see all these people milling around and you wonder what are they doing and why do they keep hurting me over that damn glass counter over there?

[01:01:52.380 --> 01:02:07.040]
They want you in that line, man. They want you staying there obediently and they don't want you to move. Yeah. Bastards 5 6705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line. WQAM. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir.

[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:20.440]
I have one for your list. Why? Came art. Came art is came art still in business. Oh, there's a worst. Yeah, well, I don't know why, but yeah, where is there a came art in South Florida?

[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:36.280]
There's a good one in the university and. Still 84. All right. I'll be right over. Thanks. How do you like that? There's still came arts. I might realize it out all out of business. What? Yeah, there's a big came art right by the house. Well, aren't you lucky?

[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:51.680]
No, I'll go to target. Thank you. Yeah, came art is a schlock shop. There's no question about that. The merchandise is embarrassing. In fact, you know you deal with a real low rent kind of a human being when they're buying their clothes and came art.

[01:02:51.760 --> 01:03:02.820]
I mean, that's about as low as you can go. I will say this. I'll go to came art if I must. Right. Yeah, but I used to go to came art. The one out there by me for certain things. Like if you want to get like a.

[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:20.820]
That like you yeah, you're right like a bath mat or a towel towels or these stuff like that crap metal rod. Right. But anything like the cost more than three bucks. I would say forget about right. I put for some wrapping paper there once. There you go. Stuff like that. Yeah, if you're into wrapping five six.

[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:28.720]
I know a lot of people who are shopping at came art, maybe seem to be into wrapping five six seven or five sixty, which is probably one of the reasons about a business out there by the song.

[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:49.180]
WDQ am hello. Comp USA. Comp USA. Now what's not to like there? Oh God. Every time I go there to buy anything. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I'm going to buy anything. It never does what it's supposed to do. I try to bring it back and I never get it in. They never get it back to them.

[01:03:49.180 --> 01:04:01.080]
I'll be damn okay. I think. I don't know. I never had any bad experience here. Now what's the place by my I'm asking you. I should know it by public.

[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:12.160]
It's not there by me where as a matter of fact where came art used to be. I think maybe not in the same store, but I'm that that it's not office depot. It's where I got that great brother fax machine for my house.

[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:27.700]
The same one that I have here. Man, I think I was going to do a hot office max. Is it office max? Well, that's the other place. It's something max. It's max. Huh? No, seriously. Sugar snacks. Maybe it's called.

[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:42.560]
But that was a nice. That's what it is. No, maybe I guess it's office max, but I went in there looking for a printer and low and behold, they had this brother MFC 4800. Seriously, if I want to recommend anything that I've ever owned in my life, this is it.

[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:55.400]
You would you would just cry. You would weep if we had this machine there. It's in fact, maybe next time I come back, I'll buy it because of course they're not going to get it. It is so great. It's a factor. It's a printer. It's black and white, but then again, what do I need color for? Right?

[01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:22.900]
Right. Faxor printer scanner copier and it's just it's impeccable, man. It's just sensational. It just cranks it out. I've had this one sitting here for two and a half years. You know, a couple of times I've had paper jam a little bit, but I jam on it. You know, I'm an expert with it now. And so I got the same one for the house. What is not to like? It wasn't staples. Was it? No, I'm pretty sure it's office max 275 bucks. Don't that sound pretty cheap to you, mister? Yeah, they're cheaper, but they probably don't work as good.

[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:33.360]
What do you mean by that? Like there are cheaper units that do what yours does. Oh, there are cheaper ones. No, but I still say for one as good as this that does all of these different things.

[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:38.040]
No, it was something with something like that, a complex piece of machinery. Right.

[01:05:38.040 --> 01:06:07.840]
My is priceless. Right. And it was especially here. I mean, I can't afford to be in by lose this thing here. Forget about it. You're doing a show that day. I mean, I just between my computer and that machine near that brother. It's a mother. If I don't have that thing going 5 6 7 open. There's a little free spot for brother. MFC 4800 man. It's a lean machine. It's a great, a great piece of equipment. See, I actually can say something nice about something. If it works great like my beautiful Corvette. What's not to like? See, there's some things that are good and some things that are pure crap.

[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:22.860]
Like the equipment of QAM 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line WQAM. Hello. Yeah, hello. First time caller like to be able to speak to Neil speaking. Speaking. Speaking. Neil.

[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:52.700]
Well, I hate to have to be my first call because I love you show for a long time, but I have a little like disagreement about the torture thing. Yeah, I know it's a slippery slope. Okay. And we don't want to go down all the way to be like the people that we're trying to. We are already doing it. Well, we're already doing it. I know. But the thing is like some people in the mission which before before you go ahead, let me just caution you with one thing. Have you noticed that since the scandal erupted,

[01:06:52.860 --> 01:07:13.320]
I've had these bus loads hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that they've released and sent back in their cities from the abble graved just from that one place. It's all political, just to make people happy to show them something, you know, that. No, no, that's not political. The fact is that 70 to 90% of people rounded up didn't do anything wrong in a first place. Yeah, they were just common criminals, but.

[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:23.680]
Now, a lot of them weren't criminals. A lot of them were just rounded up because they didn't like the way they look. One of them was a cab driver. There were there have been ziggins of stories about these people and most of them weren't criminals at all.

[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:35.020]
If you could have stopped 9-11 and you had I taught right in front of you, what would you've done with him? Well, what does it have to do with this? First of all, what do the Iraqis have to do with 9-11?

[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:45.460]
What do the Iraqi people that were rounding up and torturing what do they have to do with terrorists to text against the United States or any of our allies? Can you tell me?

[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:54.680]
Those little people on the street absolutely nothing. I mean, who say? No, no, any Iraqis, name me any of the Iraqis who had to do with 9-11, please.

[01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:03.420]
It's all we get from the news. I can't believe it. I don't know what you know. It's like I can't believe what the news tells me today, no matter what they say.

[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:16.540]
Well, what does that mean? So in other words, it's the Iraqis. What about the Iranians? How about everybody? Let's just torture everybody. Anybody in the world who looks like one of those ragheads, we're going to round them all up in torture and we're going to squeeze the truth out of them until they tell us what we want to hear. How's that?

[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:28.080]
Oh, it's the news media. It's this. I don't know. I don't want to hear that. That was the one true thing you said, sir. I don't know because you sure as hell don't. It's everywhere. Yeah, they're just everywhere. We don't know.

[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:41.160]
And I know this, which I thought now since there's no weapons of mass destruction and since we know that they're not connected without kind of, I thought we're there to liberate the courageous Iraqi people from the evil dictator that Reagan put in their back in the early 80s.

[01:08:41.160 --> 01:09:09.280]
I thought that was all about. Huh? They're not letting us live. They're so evil. And if we have to torture everything out of them and round them all up, then somewhere along the little confused like this last caller, that's very sad. That is so sad. All you're doing is just to find the unjustifiable. If you want us to behave like barbarians, the ones that we can then, I mean, I wouldn't even dignify with more response. Good luck to you, sir. We'll all need it. But more people run in a mod like you want to lose. We do need it. Wow.

Right, he wasn't really a nice guy but then again he was Reagan. Reagan was just asked the Nicaraguaans okay they'll tell you.

[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.980]
Yeah those Indians. 74% say Reagan's image should not be placed on any of them.

[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:30.480]
How do you like that and those people are absolutely correct. How do you like that's a pretty good sign.

[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:34.040]
Yeah enough already with the Reagan crap. Dan Rather and Tom Broca are right.

[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.220]
Dan Rather and Tom Broca are right. Two goofballs like that can't always be wrong in this case they happen to be right.

[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.940]
We got the mad dog at two we got the hopper in the studio at for this afternoon look out if there's any food laying around.

[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:51.580]
Hide it. 630 Marlins on deck 705 Marlins at the engines and speaking of what you just said before they came from behind last night.

[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:55.560]
Yeah last night they'd one seven to five right Josh. Right.

[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.660]
Coming from behind just the way he deflikes it.

[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:04.140]
Florida Marlins at the Cleveland Indian 705 Eddie K after the game and by the way Barry Jackass saw a brother.

[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:12.780]
He's got an article in there was if today was it the other day about Jack McKeein listens to Eddie K show going home he doesn't understand what a fan second guests him in this night.

[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:18.460]
He will they're in first place near the World Series Champions because it's Florida Jack because it's off Florida they're never happy.

[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:30.220]
Making gestures associated with Nazism during a world wrestling entertainment match in Germany last weekend has caused a prominent performer his mood lighting job as a financial analyst on CBNBC his moaning job.

[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.920]
I guess maybe we can get him an end to replace him.

[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:42.720]
The network announced yesterday that John Bradshaw Lathiel I never heard of him did you know that's because I don't watch that crap anyway that's the propaganda network the gambling channel.

[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:56.300]
John Bradshaw Lathiel was fired from his job as CNBC contributor Lathiel was hired last month after serving as a guest analyst for the Fox Nazi news channel which began featuring a regular last year following a release of his book have more money now.

[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:07.380]
In an apparent attempt to draw a crowd response during his match against WWE champion Eddie Guerrero in Munich I witness reports that Lathiel goose stepped around the ring and raised his arm numerous times in Adolf Hitler salute.

[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:20.660]
Such actions are illegal in Germany although no criminal charges were brought against the 13 year wrestling veteran after the show in this maybe he was just doing something to please L president they hear now that could be it.

[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:31.360]
Maybe just think of the Bushmeister in a statement of CNBC spokesman said Lathiel was fired because we find his behavior to be offensive inappropriate and not be fitting anyone associated with our network.

[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.940]
The WWE also responded the incident through a statement on its website.

[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:48.180]
WWE and John Lathiel deeply regret Mr. Lathiel's actions in the ring at our event in Munich and apologize if it's offended or upset our fans Mr. Lathiel has been reprimanded for his actions and probably will be sent to Abu Garh Reb to be tortured by that last caller.

[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.240]
Such sanctions were not released although it's a bent and believe Lathiel was set to meet Tuesday with WWE owner Vince McMahon in other words so yesterday.

[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:10.700]
Lathiel pretty cis was most recently elevated to a main event position on the WWE Smackdown roster after his character was changed to portray him as an anti-immigration zealot with Mexicans usually the targets of his prejudice during weekly through the telecast on UPN.

[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:12.300]
Sounds like a lovely deal to me.

[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:13.600]
Hey by the way something.

[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.100]
Yes.

[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:22.360]
That story I heard this morning is up on NPR's site about Ashcroft about the memos and what does it say that our other stories haven't said.

[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.820]
Nothing but people might want to hear it and they can play it over and over again and hear them hit it.

[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.600]
Or is that a website?

[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.280]
No but I found it and I'm going to send a link to Eric and I just want to let you know about it.

[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:39.220]
Well don't now listen don't start overburdening Eric with all kinds of stuff because he's already whoa he's away he's got to make some money if they're in Orlando he's got to pay the bills.

[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:46.280]
He's got to support his very picky Japanese wife and family he can't afford to be spending all of his time with this marginal show okay.

[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:51.180]
What retail place in Southland I've got a whole bunch I might just I don't know.

[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:58.980]
Let's see I got one two three four just five more Reagan bashing stories just five.

[01:16:59.420 --> 01:16:59.900]
Yeah.

[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:00.780]
Oh come on.

[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:04.260]
Oh but before that so that you don't get carried away.

[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:10.800]
Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada decided yesterday not to go to Washington to attend the state funeral former US President Ronald Reagan.

[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:11.240]
Oh right.

[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:11.980]
I've gone Paul.

[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:18.760]
Two days after his letter of condolence raised eyebrows about whether he's distancing himself from the West during a hard fought election campaign.

[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:26.820]
The meaning of one here a let's say a lot of ambivalence came through a US official said yesterday the same issue over the weekend by Prime Minister Paul Martin's office.

[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.780]
It seemed to underscore things somewhat.

[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:37.600]
The letter referred to Mr. Reagan is one of the most influential leaders of the past 50 years and stated that he helped lay the foundations for the end of the Cold War and much greater cooperation between East and West.

[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:47.500]
But it was largely observational in tone steering clear of the kind of rhetoric employed by leaders such as French President Jacques Chirac who loved the 40th president as a great statesman who leave a deep mark in history.

[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.860]
Canada will be represented at the funeral by attorney by Governor General Adrian Clarkson.

[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:58.780]
I think the world will understand that we have an election going on into the Prime Minister's international commitments have been quite extensive already.

[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:07.360]
Liberal spokesman Stephen McKinnon said yesterday and of course since the Liberals here are in pins and needles and latest poll shows them trailing the Tories the conservative by two percentage points.

[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:10.240]
He don't have time to be didlin' around with some Tiska Tatskitt.

[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:11.640]
Let's go see Ronny's casket.

[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:18.820]
University of Toronto historian Robert Bothwell said yesterday it's entirely appropriate for Ms. Parks and Woodhead rather than Paul Martin.

[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:21.040]
That's what Adrian is paid to do he said.

[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:22.840]
In other words be like a figurehead.

[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.420]
Got it?

[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.080]
So Paul Martin won't be there. Don't be looking for him.

[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.200]
Boy he's boring.

[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:32.800]
One thing about Canadian politics man even though this is a wonderful country that is so boring.

[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.200]
Galton McGinty.

[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:35.540]
Oh brother.

[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.000]
Boring.

[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:38.080]
Ernie Eves he was boring.

[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.520]
Adam and Eve.

[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:40.240]
Adam and Steve.

[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.740]
They like Adam and Steve here a lot better than Adam and Eve I should point that out to you before you come up.

[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:49.960]
Author TV Alman who's latest book Roe State America at World with the World will be in Coral Gables tomorrow June 10th at 6 p.m.

[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:52.860]
At Brooks and books why do I want to keep saying Brooks?

[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:57.900]
Maybe a Gregor think it's a Brooks Brothers story will come by and get a suit.

[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.740]
Books and books 265 are on Avenue.

[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:05.120]
He'll discuss his work and old a question and answer session as well to sign copies of his book.

[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:10.920]
Alman's also author of Miami City the Future and how to respect the book which was best summer in Florida for more than three years.

[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:15.900]
He'll be there tomorrow at 6 o'clock in the Gables at books and books 265 are going on Avenue.

[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:18.560]
Stop by and to pull on Woody Graber's ponytail.

[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.780]
I'm sure Woody will be there right?

[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:21.160]
Right.

[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:21.680]
Give me the ink.

[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.260]
Exet sound.

[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:29.380]
If Miami Town at 560 WQA.

[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.360]
What 40 out would I say 147 band this is a quick show, wasn't it?

[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.480]
Wow, let's see those stories.

[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:45.420]
Yeah, 1147 at 560 WQA and here this fax must be from my good friend Ian Framowicz at Woodbind says how about our old friend our old Jumeil Asman?

[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:48.140]
Now, last man, the former mayor of Toronto, he was great.

[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:52.440]
Real character, real goofball, a lot of times very out of touch with reality.

[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:53.460]
But he was fun.

[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.380]
He had a great sense of humor. He's just goofy. Nobody took him serious.

[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.840]
As opposed to David Miller, our current mayor who's boring.

[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.920]
As says welcome back to Woodbind. Where's Randy Wapel's at Woodbind by the way in?

[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:03.980]
What's going on over there?

[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.420]
Best harness driver in the world today is beyond a shadow without Luke Willett.

[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.000]
Man, he is just unbelievable.

[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:14.360]
And there were a lot of rumors that he's also f***** up. That's beside the point. Nobody cares about that.

[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.200]
Whip him again Luke, come on smack him.

[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.180]
Clark, more reasons to admit he ran than he racked.

[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:25.520]
I hope that guy was, and you know people would say, see that's why people don't want to disagree with you because he hangs up on him.

[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:30.380]
I thought I had that guy in a fairly long time considering how in out of touch he was?

[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.920]
Yeah, waiting a long time for him to justify any harm.

[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:38.940]
I gave him plenty of opportunity to justify this insanity that he was trying to make and it just aggravating the fact that he had no way.

[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:44.000]
And then to go on about well, you know, the media, yeah, when in fact it's quite the opposite.

[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.820]
The media are the ones who are covered most of this crap up and have been for a long time.

[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:53.460]
His point is that's the only way we can, because he almost said it in your kind of mouth, but it's the only way that the only thing these people understand.

[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:54.940]
Is that what it is?

[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:55.620]
That's what he was talking about.

[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:56.660]
What do you mean these people?

[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:57.940]
Do you mean the ones who are liberating?

[01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:58.540]
Yeah.

[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.540]
The ones who are emancipation by the capitation that crowd.

[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:04.460]
You know, they're brown, they kind of hook nose, they wear rags on their heads.

[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:13.900]
It would have made more sense to invade Iran than Iraq's former US counterterrorism advisor, Richard Clark, who already has accused the Bush Administration of being soft on terrorism and wasting resources by the Iraq attack.

[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.880]
He said mere possession of weapons of mass destruction did not justify invading your country.

[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.600]
This was the US government's stated grounds for the Iraq war.

[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.740]
If you take the case of Iran, its nuclear program is far more advanced than Iraq's was, Clark told the Austrian daily newspaper, Dersstandard, and interview translated into the Choi-man.

[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:33.000]
There would have been far more grounds to invade Iran than Iraq.

[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:40.820]
US believes Iran's nuclear program is a front for developing atomic weapons to randomize this saying its atomic ambitions are limited to generating electricity.

[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:45.000]
Well, let's find a bunch of Iranians and tie them up and torture them and find out what really is going on.

[01:21:46.100 --> 01:22:01.220]
The US military has found none of the caches of Iraqi WMDs in Washington that the Washington said Saddam Hussein had possessed in abundance and has recently published memoirs against all enemies, Clark charged with the administration of Bush did not take the al-Qaeda threat seriously enough before the 9-11 attacks and needlessly attacked Iraq.

[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:14.060]
In a chapter entitled that almost war 1996, Clark says former US President Bill Clinton almost lost the war against Iran for what Washington says it's support for terrorism against the US.

[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.960]
By the way, speak at a clip and last on a biography that had Bill Clinton.

[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.700]
And I got to confess because I remember that call I had a few months ago and I said here like,

[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:31.340]
I had totally erased from my mind because we were so obsessed with Monica and with blue dress and penis gate and the stain on the dress and all that Ken Starcraft.

[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:40.740]
I had forgotten about the bombing of Iraq that devastating bombing like right at the D-Day there, right at the point where like Bush was coming to shove so to speak under the desk.

[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.300]
Hadn't you forgotten about that?

[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.260]
All forgotten.

[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.040]
Yeah.

[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.820]
And again, that's the news media thing.

[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:52.560]
Well, it's wagon the dog and you know something you probably was wagon the dog where he had to do something pretty sad.

[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.820]
He was doing some...

[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:59.120]
Oh, speaking of that, Mark Anthony says he may not be doing something.

[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:04.080]
This is so... can't that bitch just go away already that J-Lo?

[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.040]
Can't she just go away? Marry a whole bunch of guys.

[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:08.060]
Okay, go and have a great time. Screw your brains out.

[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.880]
I bet she's never even seen a penis that woman.

[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.200]
I really don't think she's seen one.

[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.540]
That's my honest opinion to you.

[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:17.800]
Okay. I'm not arguing with you.

[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.500]
I don't think she could even draw you a diagram.

[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:21.040]
At least Monica could draw a picture.

[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:28.980]
Deeming his personal life off limits, Mark Anthony dodged questions Tuesday about whether he and J-Lo got married this past weekend.

[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:39.240]
The Latin singer performing in Rockefeller Plaza for NBC's Today Show repeatedly deflected questions for most mad Laura about the widely reported nuptials.

[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:44.520]
Anthony could be seen wearing what appeared to be a wedding band on his left hand while performing two.

[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.000]
It's got a picture. If it's not a wedding band, it sure is hell.

[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:50.920]
Maybe he got in a box of crack reject because it looks like one to me. Maybe it's a rubber band.

[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:57.000]
That might be it. Maybe he's got hemorrhoids. Maybe he got one of the spare rubber bands on his finger in case it pops up again.

[01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:02.180]
Lopez and Anthony reportedly tied the knot Saturday in a small ceremony at a Beverly Hills, California home.

[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:04.380]
Anthony's publicists were not coming Monday.

[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:09.240]
Lopez is represented not immediately. We turn it called Monday but told the AP on Sunday. He had no comment.

[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:13.580]
Oh, I don't tell me this is going to be another one. Oh, not again. Are we getting sucked in again?

[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:19.300]
Oh, my God. I'm telling you.

[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:22.820]
Can you imagine all the starving people in the world we could feed just with her?

[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:25.880]
Just fry it up, man. Come on. It's a lot of greasy.

[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.480]
So, you say, huh?

[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:27.960]
A greasy fire.

[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.780]
This people can go on the Atkins, the high fat, high up protein diet.

[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:31.540]
The Atkins.

[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.420]
Right. The Atkins, the JLo Atkins diet. I like it. They're asking for it all over the world.

[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.720]
God. What a what a force. What an...

[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:44.360]
I guess it's a hell of a lot there than having talent.

[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.060]
Or if you don't have a new talent, you come up with some kind of bull crap like that.

[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.700]
Who am I going to marry this week? Nobody cares. Okay. Bitch get lost.

[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:57.160]
Some people are saying the way Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice are portrayed in the ad for the new

[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:01.300]
Stepward Bives film is distasteful even out of rages. You ready for that?

[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:02.460]
No.

[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:10.740]
The spot shows an image of rice made to look nude from the waist up and a picture of Clinton that morphs into what looks like a cookie-baking steppered wife.

[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.880]
It's got the pictures right here.

[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:16.480]
Oh, I think we got this on our website. I'm pretty sure we do. You can see the pictures.

[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.160]
I hope we did. I'm sure I did.

[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:25.940]
The pictures move across the screen very quickly, but they caught the eye of a Kansas City woman who recorded the spot to make sure what she was really seeing.

[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:31.140]
Becky Randall said when she taped and watched the ad again, she realized it was even worse than what she'd suspected.

[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:32.600]
Oh, you've got to see this.

[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.300]
We must go immediately right now to our website.

[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:43.400]
Okay. And shame on me if I didn't email this to Eric yesterday.

[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:47.100]
Let me just take a quick peek if I can ever get to it.

[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:55.960]
It says it's just inappropriate. It needs to be stopped. Becky Randall said for those who haven't seen the 1975 thriller by director Brian Forbes.

[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.980]
The 2004 version is pretty much the same, but with the national technical wizardry.

[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:05.340]
Let's see. Let me drop down here. What's the headliners controversial stag? I guess it's pretty clear what the hell it is.

[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:08.760]
Is it on there? Do you see it? Churchill.

[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:09.460]
I don't see it.

[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:12.360]
Oh, no. Oh, no.

[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:21.320]
It's not on there. Like I said, my bad. Sorry, Eric. Well, I'm going to email the two of them right now during the break.

[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.800]
Okay. Because at least you'll be able to see the picture.

[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.520]
I can't wait. You will just pee in your pants. I'll guarantee you.

[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.740]
And then Josh can get his buddy Josh Beckett to come by.

[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:41.080]
Anyway, both films are based on a book by Errol Levin about a small Connecticut town where they win and act too perfectly because their husbands have replaced them with robots.

[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.680]
But Randall says the less than perfect images in the ad for the new film will keep her out of the theater.

[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:51.480]
Pat Gray who works with North Star marketing group says the ad shows bad taste toward rice and Clinton.

[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:55.140]
In today's media environment, I don't know whether it's unacceptable morally or not.

[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.420]
This tasteful for sure, Gray said if I were them, I'd probably sue.

[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:03.160]
Gray said the ad wouldn't drive him to the theater. That certainly wouldn't stimulate me to go see the movie.

[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.560]
He said, and of course, who the hell wants to see companies and make it anyway or see.

[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:15.900]
What's your name at all Hillary Nancy Kirk Packard. He spoke for Paramount picture said the film studio hasn't received any complaints about the spot.

[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:18.700]
Paramount hasn't heard from rice or Clinton either. How do you like that?

[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.060]
So I'm going to pull the same scam today that I did yesterday. I'm seeing those.

[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:28.560]
I saved all my Reagan bashing columns for the new to one hour because all the Reagan lovers, they're going to be turned over to rush anyway, right?

[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:32.260]
Right. Listen to him pop a few oxies right on the air. They're between noon and whatever he's on.

[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:40.260]
This is fine. That's okay. Have a good life. Listen to all that bull crap that he makes up as he goes along. I write when propaganda about how Reagan was the greatest things since sliced halva.

[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:46.700]
And have a good life. Right. Right. And it's good for lunchtime anyway.

[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:56.740]
So if there's anybody who wonders how come it is that there are so many people buying into whatever the media feeds them because this is the way it always is because it was uninformed people like that tragic guy that collar we had.

[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:04.040]
I just want to cry. Now you think maybe that there's any chance that was a put on he was just no no no no no.

[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:08.800]
Oh God. How depressing.

[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:14.740]
Three minutes till noon at 560 WQM nobody wants to talk about having cancer or heart disease yourself.

[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:22.120]
But guess what? It can happen just about anybody. And it's a proven fact that disease responds extremely well to treatment if you detect it early enough.

[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:29.120]
Hollywood Diagnostic Center is proud to announce their virtual colonoscopy which is so much less intrusive than the traditional style of colonoscopies.

[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:39.400]
The coronary heart scoring and full body screening exams that like a little virtual trip right through your body that could detect cancer or the life threatening diseases in their early stages while there's still time to do something about it.

[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:46.540]
Doctors before this need even needed for our imaging exams call Hollywood Diagnostic Center at 9.5.4.966.3600.

[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:55.940]
For a test doesn't take a lot of time. Don't even have to get naked to do this thing. All they do is pop in that machine and in a matter of minutes you're out of there and you find out the result can give you and your family tremendous peace of mind.

[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:59.820]
And if you do find something wrong like I said you can take care of it while there's still time to do it.

[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:07.040]
And Hollywood Diagnostic Center they offer you state of the art imaging equipment with open MRI high speed CAT scan nuclear medicine and much much more.

Hollywood Diagnostic Center they've been serving South Florida for over 20 years. Their facility also provides a complete mobile diagnostic service that can come right to you.

[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:26.400]
For those imaging exams that could be lifesavers call Hollywood Diagnostic Center today at 9.5.4.966.3600. That's 9.5.4.966.3600.

[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:39.520]
My life and local this is 4.5.60. This is Mark Morgan. It's the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.

[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:44.060]
Oh, what did you find out? I got a call here. There's a number one rated in Moe Highland in David and his home.

[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:49.460]
At least according to my aspirations. Stay away from it. I don't even know how you have children.

[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:53.600]
Bera Ma, hello. I want to take on J.P. Durr.

[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:59.680]
Oh, J.P. Durr is a great court of acting a good joke. I like J.P. Durr.

[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:04.820]
Well, in that dimension he's got extraordinarily smooth pectops.

[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:05.920]
Oh, yeah.

[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:07.740]
I'm going to be given what you say here.

[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.460]
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.860]
No, no, wait a minute. Don't go.

[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.220]
But I have nothing else to say.

[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:16.340]
Look at how about this. I was the weather down there in the Mera Ma.

[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.140]
I'm right down the street from you.

[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:19.760]
I have to go.

[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:20.980]
Oh, wait. By the way, something.

[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:23.320]
No, no. I have to go.

[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.420]
Look, I tell you what. I'll hold you over in a break. How's that, man?

[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.640]
I'll give you one of my old tantations.

[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:29.180]
How's that?

[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:30.840]
No, wait.

[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:33.120]
That's the only call that we have.

[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.820]
The things on your nose is growing again.

[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.940]
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.860]
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:40.920]
Wow.

[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.060]
Don't go, don't go.

[01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:44.460]
Wow, wow.

[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:45.780]
Don't go, don't go.

[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:46.340]
Wow.

[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:49.880]
You got thick, with a stain.

[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.960]
I know that I have a stain.

[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:57.480]
And around those losing pimples.

[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:00.740]
You call my, wow, wow, wow.

[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:04.880]
If you go look, then down here I don't see.

[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:08.800]
A road map of YSL&D.

[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.020]
You got your happy son.

[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:14.240]
Way to die, die, die, die.

[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:14.800]
Wow.

[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:18.460]
My nose glows when something stays.

[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.860]
Almost every day I take.

[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:25.540]
And my veins, as they start to tickle.

[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:29.140]
I add an oil to the door to door to door.

[01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:33.760]
Yeah, I look like the flower of a bird.

[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.040]
That's what comes out of the cremary of fire.

[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:41.320]
The little sex field with wiggle veins.

[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:42.720]
Yeah.

[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.480]
And then fly into the door to see.

[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.800]
And say it's kind of a strawberry.

[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:55.580]
I know that I'm leaving wiggle veins.

[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:08.020]
I'll tell you what, here ain't nothing like the moment

[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:08.620]
Gully's show.

[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.340]
Not the real one, but the Bokobryon one.

[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.720]
I keep telling these people if they would put him on the air

[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:15.540]
like for a couple of hours in, like six to eight, we'd have a 40-year.

[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:19.560]
Put that pollen in the back of the old folks home, you know?

[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:22.880]
You know what I'm saying is true.

[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:31.120]
It'd be great because the Bokobryon, Mo and Gully are just 50 million times more entertaining than the real ones who are busy.

[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.560]
I guess they're like bonding again now.

[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.180]
They got no choice.

[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.020]
Okay, here's the way this result of our poll.

[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:37.400]
We don't want to forget about that, but I got a lot of heavy-duty stuff here.

[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:41.280]
I didn't email that to Eric during the break and I'm sure it will be on there momentarily.

[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:43.700]
The story will be stupid.

[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:44.420]
He got it.

[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.160]
He got it and you'll get it.

[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.100]
And then you can take a look.

[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.100]
I mean, it's not a big deal.

[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:53.680]
Actually, you can see you can view because the link is on the story to the actual video.

[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:57.840]
So not only would you see the pictures being watched the video too.

[01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:00.000]
Well, you'll see for yourself.

[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:00.920]
It's amusing.

[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:05.280]
And speaking of that, yes, the link to that NPR audio story is on there.

[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.260]
So you can hear Ashcroft getting grilled.

[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:08.140]
Oh, great.

[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:12.220]
I was trying to hear Ashcroft sing on our website, but for some reason I can't get it to play.

[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:12.560]
Can you?

[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.720]
I didn't try to play it off the website.

[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:15.700]
I heard it in the original.

[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:19.360]
If you want to check out the Fahrenheit 9.11 trailer, don't forget it.

[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:21.760]
So we got a link to that right on our website, NeilRodgers.com.

[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:22.500]
Here's the poll.

[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:24.120]
What retail place in South Florida?

[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.220]
You hate the most.

[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:26.340]
Hate the spies.

[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:27.960]
You wouldn't go there if they give you a hundred dollar bill.

[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.700]
Well, Walmart, 137.

[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:31.480]
Windixie 101.

[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:33.060]
I'm really amazed at that.

[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:34.740]
You think that's because so many.

[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:39.840]
And I noticed that Windixie's been running spots about how they're cleaning up their stores and they're refurbishing and the others.

[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.660]
Because Windixie, I think, has a reputation.

[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.620]
There's a lot of other stores being kind of schmutzy, you know?

[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:44.500]
Yeah.

[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:44.780]
Yeah.

[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.240]
As opposed to those sparkling, beautiful public stores.

[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.500]
Anyway, Walmart 137.

[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:52.780]
Windixie 101.

[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:53.580]
Eckerds 55.

[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.000]
Brands, Mark 48.

[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:56.940]
Radio Shack has got...

[01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:57.860]
BOT-30, man.

[01:33:58.340 --> 01:33:59.240]
Rooms to go 18.

[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:00.820]
Circuit City 18.

[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:01.780]
Came, Mark 14.

[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:02.800]
Best Buy 13.

[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:04.320]
For those of us impatient folks.

[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:05.280]
We like to merchandise.

[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:06.220]
We love their prices.

[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.000]
But we just don't have all day.

[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:09.740]
Home Depot 9.

[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:10.540]
Bird Eines 8.

[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.400]
Pet Boys 8.

[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.700]
Sand's Club 7.

[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:13.940]
Maxgers Giant 4.

[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:14.740]
Loads 3.

[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:15.240]
And Compu.

[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:15.780]
Wednesday 3.

[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:17.080]
Out of 476.

[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:17.360]
I'm here.

[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:17.860]
There's some more.

[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.180]
And we'll get to them or not.

[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.060]
And we'll get to some more.

[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:20.760]
A little later on.

[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:21.400]
Good, right?

[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:22.360]
I hope.

[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:23.420]
Like maybe right now.

[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:24.060]
WQM.

[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:24.320]
Hello.

[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:25.240]
Neil.

[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:26.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:26.680]
How are you doing today?

[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:26.980]
Great.

[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:28.600]
You were talking before.

[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.840]
I remember you mentioned the gambling channel.

[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:31.820]
Yeah.

[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.380]
And I hate to mention this.

[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:36.720]
But I was flipping the channel last night and I came across Dennis Miller.

[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.780]
And on his panel, he had Phil Hendry.

[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:40.840]
Oh, no.

[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:44.080]
Are you straighting in and trying to tie Reagan and put it together?

[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:45.420]
No, no.

[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.160]
No wonder Dennis Miller show us about a 0.2 share.

[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:51.260]
He's got his numbers are so unique that he can't fight him on a mat.

[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:53.600]
Dennis Miller is so smug.

[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:54.340]
Yeah.

[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:58.000]
And I just can't well after that call you have before.

[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.540]
Who has no problem with the torture.

[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:03.620]
And I guess he probably has no problem with people getting swept up here

[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.900]
from minor offenses and being killed in jail.

[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:06.280]
Oh, sure.

[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:09.040]
I'm sure he's waiting for Patriot Act 456 coming along.

[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.460]
Or when our soldiers get captured.

[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:10.820]
Right.

[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.820]
They can do that to our soldiers in humiliating degrees.

[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.480]
I know he's spread the films all over the world.

[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:18.720]
As long as we're taking out the evil doers, I guess anything goes.

[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:19.540]
Amen.

[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:21.000]
Have a good day, Neil.

[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:21.480]
Thank you.

[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:21.760]
No, man.

[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:22.180]
Thank you.

[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:23.380]
Okay.

[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:25.540]
Anyway, it's, well, what's the use?

[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.640]
You know, you deal with the American public in this Reagan thing.

[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:28.140]
There's Phil.

[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.280]
Born again right-winger now.

[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:29.900]
How do you like that?

[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.100]
Is that incredible or what?

[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:31.540]
Okay.

[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:34.600]
Born again right-wing, uh, licky, licky, licky, kissy, kissy.

[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:35.300]
What a suck up.

[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:37.240]
Can't complain about his credibility.

[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:39.120]
Not that he ever had any, but that was his act.

[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:43.240]
You know, his act was intentionally sticked, but just what a turnaround.

[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:46.520]
But if he wants to be on those clear channel stations, I guess.

[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.360]
And if you missed the story, clear channeling FCC have kissed and made up for about $2 million.

[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.000]
The FCC says, oh, well, this will wipe the slate clean.

[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:55.240]
All these other complaints we got.

[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:56.240]
We're not even going to look at them.

[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.020]
We're just whatever you did wrong, screw it.

[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:00.580]
You know, it could be like maybe, who knows?

[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:03.200]
It could be hundreds of millions for all we know, all the complaints that they've had.

[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:04.820]
But they will wipe it all off the slate.

[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:06.140]
They will take to a million, thank you.

[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:08.940]
Is that incredible or what?

[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:09.680]
No, it's credible.

[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:14.320]
Robert Scheer in the LA Times, one of my favorite columnists, writes,

[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.040]
a nice guy's nasty policies.

[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.420]
He says, I liked Ronald Reagan, despite the huge divide between us politically.

[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:25.240]
Reagan was a charming old pro who gave me hours of his time in a series of interviews beginning in 1966

[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.580]
when he was running for governor, simply because he enjoyed the give and take.

[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.680]
In fact, I often found myself defending the gipper whenever I was confronted with an East Coast pundit,

[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:37.100]
determined to denigrate anyone, especially actors from my adopted state.

[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:40.840]
Yet looking back at his record, I'm appalled that I warmed to the man as much as I did.

[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:46.920]
The fact is that Reagan abandoned the Roosevelt New Deal, which he admitted and saved his family during the Great Depression.

[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:50.560]
Let me say it again, which he admitted had saved his family during the Great Depression,

[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:53.400]
in favor of a belief in the efficacy of massive corporate welfare,

[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:56.460]
incoctated in him by his paymasters at Warner Brothers,

[01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:58.900]
General Electric and the conservative lecture circuit.

[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.660]
Though Reagan's man was hardly mean-spirited,

[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:04.920]
Reagan the politician betrayed the social programs and trade unions,

[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.420]
as he once believed in so fiercely.

[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:08.880]
Let's start with his leadership of California,

[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.000]
where he launched attacks on the state's once-incoperable public universities

[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.200]
and devastated its mental health system.

[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:18.320]
For shadowing, future Trumped up invasions of tiny Grenada and Nicaragua,

[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:21.340]
he sent thousands of National Guardsmen and tear gas burglary.

[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:26.080]
It also became increasingly clear that all the man wasn't unintelligent

[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.480]
in his ability to mingle truth with fantasy with frightening.

[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:31.700]
At different times, Reagan, who infamously said that,

[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:35.880]
facts are stupid things, falsely claimed to have ended poverty in Los Angeles,

[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:39.660]
implied he was personally involved in the liberation of Europe's concentration camps,

[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.800]
argued that trees caused most pollution,

[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:45.380]
and said that the Hollywood blacklist to which he contributed names never existed,

[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:49.740]
described as freedom fighters the contra-thugs and the religious fundamentalist in Afghanistan

[01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:53.020]
who would later become Al Qaeda, and claimed that fighting a limited nuclear war

[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:54.160]
was not an insane idea.

[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:58.620]
But the Cimony is a bumpkin as some did with very much to underestimate him.

[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:02.120]
Like Nixon, the Teflon President was a survivor who'd come up the hard way

[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:04.780]
and many journalists and politicians who didn't understand that

[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:07.200]
and variably were surprised by his resiliency and savvy.

[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:09.840]
Although he generally was compliant with his hand-versed,

[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:12.080]
whenever the campaign pros-origin ideologues

[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:15.000]
vat in the way of his or Nancy's instincts, they were summarily discarded.

[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:18.600]
Even when his ideas were silly, his intentions often seemed good.

[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:21.540]
For example, one of the dumbest and costliest pet project,

[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.160]
the Star Wars Missile Depends Program, which he first announced when I interviewed him

[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.180]
in for the LA Times in 1980, was touted by Reagan as a piece offering to the Soviets.

[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:33.580]
And his legendary ability to effectively project an upbeat, confident worldview

[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:38.500]
managed to obscure to project that, to obscure many of the negative consequences of his policies.

[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:42.940]
For example, he made the terrible mistake of willfully ignoring the burgeoning AIDS epidemic

[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:44.840]
at a time when action could have saved millions.

[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:48.240]
Unlike many conservatives, however, he wasn't driven by homophobia,

[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.880]
instead Reagan allowed AIDS to spread for the same reason he pointedly savage programs to help the poor.

[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.480]
He was genuinely convinced that government programs exacerbated problems

[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:59.640]
unless they catered to the needs of the businessman he had come to revere.

[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:03.220]
In the White House, he ran up more death than any earlier president,

[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:07.400]
primarily to serve the requests of what Republican President Eisenhower had with the alarm term

[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:11.400]
the military-industrial complex, George W. Bush, by the way, has broken his record.

[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.000]
A apologist for this wait argued that throwing money at the defense industry

[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.220]
broke the back of the Soviet Union and ended the Cold War.

[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:23.440]
But the Soviet Union was already broken as Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged quite freely when he came to power in the 80s.

[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:27.280]
Rather, what Reagan does deserve considerable credit for is ignoring the dare warnings of the hawks

[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:30.680]
and respawning enthusiastically to Gorbachev in their historic wake of its summit,

[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:32.860]
where the two leaders called for a nuclear-free world.

[01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:36.060]
Let it be remembered, then, that in the closing scene of his presidency,

[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:39.680]
Reagan embraced the peacemakers, rejecting the cheerleaders of Armageddon

[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:43.220]
and was then loudly cascaded by the very new conservatives,

[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:46.360]
the most vociferously Richard Puril, who have claimed the Reagan and the mantle

[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:49.080]
for the post-war Cold War militarism and the current administration.

[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:56.080]
Richard Puril, Paul Wolfe, what's there? Sluppet him all out again now, man. You'll see him all.

[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.140]
Each and every one of them.

[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:00.840]
I saw that trailer. It works. It's on there.

[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:03.920]
The trailer, you're step-for-wise.

[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.960]
Oh, the step-for-wise thing is on there, and how does Condoleezza look?

[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:07.900]
Uh, well.

[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:10.880]
Never better. How's that?

[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:14.800]
She never looked better, old Condoleezza. Maybe spruce that bitch up a little bit,

[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:19.080]
and Hillary, man, with that apron on, making them muffins, they even fixed the gap between her teeth.

[01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:22.220]
Oh, Condoleezza, I thought maybe even Hillary.

[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:22.840]
Yeah, the gap.

[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360]
I see. Well, Hillary, that's another story.

[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:28.760]
Like, above us, he's had a lot more women than he has, meaning Hillary.

[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:33.900]
Trump and his past known at 560 WQM, if you're still a little bit nervous about picking up the phone

[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:35.780]
to make up an important purchase like buying a mattress.

[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.020]
Have no fear because Dalmatris is here. I've been doing it for years,

[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:42.180]

[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:53.780]

when you waste your time and gas schlepping from showroom to showroom,

[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:22.940]
subsidizing those expensive and overpriced bedding and apartment stores?

Dalmatris has the complete line of C. Lee, Sirta, King Coral, Simmons,

[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:28.780]
Tempour, Peter, even Stearns, and Foster Hewitt.

1-800-MATTRES, or check them out online at macrus.com.

[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:48.740]
My life and local, this is sports radio 560, keep way and way ahead.

[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:52.540]
The Gwiley is an ambassador.

[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:57.400]
Coming up tonight, on inside the behind the TruHollywood celebrity music biography profile story,

[01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:02.480]
they were from Canada, where everything is so much better.

[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:04.940]
They were Len.

[01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:08.300]
I know that it's all better for me.

[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:10.160]
It's more like a song.

[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:13.760]
Our music was a boot like positive and upbeat things, eh?

[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.620]
Len's founder, Marcus Stanzo.

[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.320]
Basically, Canadians are like happier than you Americans, eh?

[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:22.360]
We got like a healthcare system that like works, eh?

[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:25.220]
And like the crime rate is much lower here, eh?

[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.280]
And nobody in the Middle East is like mad at us, eh?

[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.320]
We trying to say.

[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:30.380]
Oh, nothing, eh?

[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:33.840]
Just nobody calls us the great Satan or anything, eh?

[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:36.520]
Look, that's enough, you Canadian.

[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:37.740]
Oh, it's okay.

[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.060]
I know what the hostility is a booty.

[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:44.100]
But like, we're this close to legalizing marijuana here, too.

[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.640]
You are? How's anything?

[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:46.960]
Oh, any day.

[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:49.820]
Eh, listen, you think it could put me up for a few weeks?

[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:51.540]
You know why? Let's go about a place to live.

[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:52.380]
Oh, sure, eh?

[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:54.600]
Great. Sorry I got bad before.

[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:55.220]
Whoa.

[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:56.740]
An apology, eh?

[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.900]
I've never heard an American do that, eh?

[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:05.220]
Len, there upbeat positive music has shed new light on a place that just might decide not

[01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:07.020]
to put me in jail for getting high.

[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:12.280]
It's a big, juicy, sobbing-wit-look-it-show business tonight, uninside the mind.

[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:15.160]
You got a right, eh? 1217 and 516 here.

[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.880]
Just watch that, eh, myself, the video.

[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.260]
And you're right, Condoleezan never looked lovely.

[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.380]
Even though it's just a quick flash, so to speak.

[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:24.760]
It will flash in a pan, and there's Hillary with those muffins in the apron.

[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.420]
It's a beautiful thing.

[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:31.400]
Anyway, that story that I got called about before I knew I had it, and it was in my pile.

[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:32.580]
If I can say, can I say, pile?

[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:32.840]
No.

[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:34.980]
It was in my, uh, bunch of stuff.

[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:39.500]
Pentagon pays for unused airline tickets, so we can digress from Ronnie for just a moment or two.

[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.000]
Can we do that?

[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:42.060]
We're a great men, very, very close to Mrs. Reagan.

[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:42.500]
Oh.

[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:46.100]
Uh, we got a new format now in America.

[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:48.140]
It's all Reagan all day, every day.

[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:51.920]
Now Fridays at National Holiday, we've got the stock market closed, the banks will be closed.

[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.580]
Everything's going to be closed it down on Friday, because it's Ronnie Reagan day.

[01:43:57.460 --> 01:44:03.120]
Anyway, the Defense Department spent an estimated $100 million for airline tickets that were not used over a six-year period,

[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:08.920]
and failed to seek refunds, even though tickets were reimbursable, congressional investigators say, easy come, easy go.

[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:12.680]
Even though tickets were reimbursable, that's enough to piss off the Pope.

[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:18.740]
The Department compounded the problem by reimbursing employee claims for tickets bought by the Pentagon the investigators said,

[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:23.940]
to demonstrate how easy it was to have the Pentagon pay for airline travel, the investigators posed as defense employees,

[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:27.780]
handed the Department a ticket and showed up at the ticket counter to pick up a boarding pass.

[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:33.680]
Congress's general accounting office issued the findings in two reports on the Pentagon's lack of control over airline travel,

[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:35.740]
copies of which the AP obtained yesterday.

[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:44.600]
A prior report issued last November found that the pay-lion Pentagon bought 68,000 first-class or business-class airline seats for employees, who should have flown coach.

[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:52.540]
At a time when our soldiers are patrolling the streets, they were wrecking unarmored humbys when a Bush administration is asking for wrecking defense spending,

[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.980]
Secretary Rumsfeld is lighting hundreds of millions of dollars that could be used to protect our troops in our country, go to waste,

[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:02.780]
said representative Jan Shakowski, Democrat of Illinois, one of three lawmakers who ordered the studies.

[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:12.380]
The GAO estimated that between 1997 and 2003, the Defense Department bought at least $100 million in tickets that were not used or used only partially by a passenger,

[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:14.260]
who did not complete all legs of a flight.

[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:20.300]
The waste went undetected because the Department would allow the individuals to report the unused tickets and guess what, they didn't.

[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:21.840]
How do you like that?

[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:25.940]
Not that we want to get you, uh, surely, it's, you know, not that enough other problems going on.

[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:27.580]
Especially that Reagan funeral, man.

[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:28.760]
Yeah.

[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:31.760]
What? You're not upset about that?

[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:33.380]
About the funeral? Oh, just that I'm not in the right place.

[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:35.360]
No, about just about the coverage, not so much the funeral.

[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.840]
When is it ever going to end? Ever?

[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:37.140]
No.

[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.520]
This goes on and on.

[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:45.420]
Here, oh, no. Oh, no. This is the worst news I ever heard in my life.

[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:45.880]
Are you sure?

[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:48.340]
This fact you just sent me, I'm going to like upchuck right now.

[01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:51.600]
Just, uh, I can't stand it.

[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:53.180]
Oh, no.

[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:57.020]
Do I dare read it?

[01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:59.320]
You know the one I'm talking about. Yeah, yeah, you have to read it.

[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:03.860]
It's, uh, this is so sick and I just, it's beyond belief.

[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:05.180]
You know, it's one thing to sell out.

[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:06.380]
Mm-hmm.

[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:11.620]
But to do it to such a degree, Phil Henry, not as a regular segment on the Dennis Miller show,

[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:17.340]
it says, so sad, he also does a sickening pro-Boish pro-war rant for the first couple of segments of his show,

[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:19.100]
pretty much every night I had to stop listening.

[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.200]
How do you like that?

[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:20.640]
Okay.

[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.100]
Oh, geez.

[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:25.800]
Good, golly Miss Molly.

[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:27.920]
That's sick.

[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:28.800]
That is really sick.

[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.820]
That's enough to encourage me to continue reading all these bedtime stories.

[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:36.760]
I know I'm doing a lot of this stuff this week more than you lately, but I don't really care.

[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:37.460]
Okay.

[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:42.460]
I'm so nauseated by the, by the public being indated with all these lies with his bullcrap.

[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:46.140]
Oh, God.

[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:49.860]
Now this real player is trying to like do stuff on my, I don't want to do it right now.

[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:50.380]
Okay, later.

[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:50.940]
Later.

[01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:54.120]
Except I said, whatever you want, I said, next.

[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:55.040]
Here you go.

[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:55.700]
Oh, geez.

[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:57.220]
Don't you hate it when that happens?

[01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:57.620]
Yes.

[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:00.140]
And it's your fault because you don't want to make me watch that video.

[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:01.320]
All I was worth it.

[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.780]
It was well worth it.

[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:08.140]
Lots of good stuff you can, and I see it with all the respect to you, the NPR, which you're obsessed with NPR,

[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:09.980]
the audio of that story about Ascroft.

[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:14.720]
That's the same story that I read beginning of the show, but in the story that you read, you don't hear him,

[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:18.120]
you know, having and hawing and getting grilled by those people, which you should be sure to listen to the audio.

[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:19.580]
Oh, well, I can start to be sure and listen to the audio.

[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.040]
It's on there.

[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:21.960]
Boy, you got a lot of assignment.

[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:23.320]
This ought to keep you off the streets today.

[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:24.300]
Folks, keep you out of trouble.

[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.220]
You got the, uh, beaded curtain with Rebecca Romaine Stamos.

[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:32.540]
And those very suspect hands on her, well, they're not real hands.

[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:39.220]
And then you got the fantastic montage collage of nudies that create the picture of John Ascroft.

[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.780]
That is, where did that come from?

[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.340]
Somebody faxed the link to us.

[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:44.920]
Thank you very much.

[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:45.480]
Whoever did that.

[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:47.480]
I think I saved it.

[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:50.080]
Well, thank you so much.

[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:53.500]
Paul Corbman writes in the New York Times, the great taxer.

[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:54.940]
This is his take.

[01:47:56.260 --> 01:48:00.100]
He says over the course of this week, we'll be hearing a lot about Ronald Reagan, much of its false.

[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:05.100]
A number of news sources have already proclaimed Mr. Reagan, the most popular president of modern times.

[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:12.480]
In fact, though Mr. Reagan was very popular in 1984 and 85, he spent the latter part of his presidency under the shadow of the Iran-Cutler scandal.

[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:18.060]
Bill Clinton had a slightly higher average gallup approval rating and a much higher rating during his last two years in office.

[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:21.580]
Oh, we want you back, Bob, please, please, with or without that dress.

[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:23.960]
I'll leave a kind of cute in it.

[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:28.040]
We're also sure to hear that Mr. Reagan presented over an unmatched economic boom.

[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:33.980]
Again, not true, the economy grew slightly faster under President Clinton and, according to congressional budget office estimates,

[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:43.020]
the aftertax income of a typical family adjusted for inflation rose more than twice as much from 1992 to 2000, as it did from 1990 to 1988.

[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:52.040]
But Ronald Reagan does hold a special place in the anals of tax policy and not just as the paper-in-stative tax cuts, to as credit he was more pragmatic and responsible than that.

[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:59.320]
He followed his huge 1981 tax cut with two large tax increases. In fact, no peacetime president has raised taxes so much on so many people.

[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:06.880]
This is not a criticism. The tale of those increases tells you a lot about what was right with President Reagan's leadership and what's wrong with the leadership of George W. Bush.

[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:14.980]
The first Reagan tax increase came in 1982, but then it was clear that the budget projections used to justify the 81 tax cut were wildly optimistic.

[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:21.220]
In response, Mr. Reagan agreed to a sharp rollback of corporate tax cuts and a smaller rollback of individual income tax cuts.

[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:30.560]
Overall, the 82 tax increase on did about a third of the 81 cut, as a share of GDP increase was substantially larger than Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase.

[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:37.180]
The contract with President Bush is obvious. President Reagan confronted with evidence that his tax cuts were physically irresponsible,

[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:42.300]
changed course. President Bush confronted with similar evidence, has pushed for even more tax cuts.

[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:48.820]
Mr. Reagan's second tax increase was also motivated by a sense of responsibility, or at least that's the way it seemed at the time.

[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:55.000]
I'm referring to the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which followed the recommendations of a commission led by Alan Greenspan.

[01:49:55.660 --> 01:50:00.020]
Its key provision was an increase in the payroll tax that pays for Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance.

[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:05.800]
For many middle and low-income families, this tax increase more than under any gains for Mr. Reagan's income tax cuts.

[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:15.280]
In 1980, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, middle-income families with children paid 8.2% of their income in income taxes, and 9.5% in payroll taxes.

[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:23.460]
By 1988, income tax share was down to 6.6%, but the payroll tax share was up to 11.8%, and the combined burden was up, not down.

[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:29.700]
Nevertheless, there was a broad bipartisan support for the payroll tax increase because it was part of a deal.

[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:36.680]
The public was told that the extra revenue would be used to build up the trust fund dedicated to the preservation of Social Security benefits securing the system's future.

[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:43.120]
Thanks to the 1983 Act, current projections showed that under current rules, Social Security is good for at least 38 more years.

[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:57.700]
But George W. Bush has made it clear that the intents to be nigg on the deal is officials insist that the trust fund is meaningless, which means that they don't feel bond to honor the implied contract that dedicated the revenue generated by President Reagan's payroll tax increase to paying for future Social Security benefits.

[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:06.340]
Indeed, it's clear from the arithmetic that the only way to sustain President Bush's tax cuts in the long run will be with sharp cuts in both Social Security and Medicare benefits.

[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:21.980]
I did not and do not approve of President Reagan's economic policies, which saddle the nation with $20,000 in debt, and as others will surely point out, some of the foreign policy shenanigans that took place on his watch notably the Iran Compreh scandal for shadow of the current debacle in Iraq, which not coincidentally involves some of the same actors.

[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:26.980]
Still on both foreign and domestic policy, Mr. Reagan showed both some pragmatism and some sense of responsibility.

[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:31.440]
These are attributes, sorely lacking in the man who claims to be his political successor.

[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:37.780]
So not quite as hard on Reagan, all those good points, and just again scathing on the Bushmeister and rightfully so.

[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:38.960]
I have no life.

[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:41.220]
Can I tell you? The Bushmeister.

[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:43.620]
It's America for you, baby, Zined America.

[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:46.980]
Now let's see, am I done with this thing over here on my computer?

[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:49.060]
A wreck of God.

[01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:54.100]
Finish. Finish. Please. Finish. Swedish. An origin. This can out of my life already.

[01:51:55.060 --> 01:52:01.060]
What retail place in South Florida? Do you hate the most? That's our poll today, which we're kind of ignoring right now, but we got some bigger fish to fry.

[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:04.240]
Okay. You can smell them. Walmart 151.

[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:19.040]
When this he won 13, Eckerd 64, Brands, Mark 57, Radio Shack 33, came March 26, rooms to go 21, circuit city 20, circus city, home Depot 15, best by 15, bird eyes or bird eyes macy's are what they do.

[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:29.000]
Whatever you want to call them 11 overpriced pet boys 10, Sam's love seven mattress dry and seven, Comp USA 7 and lows has got three, but I still do like that diagram.

[01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:29.940]
That was a beautiful thing.

[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:34.600]
Or a share had a lot of good artwork today. You know, it's a good day for it.

[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:38.960]
It's a great day for art. Link letter. He turns 110 today. He's still alive. Any.

[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:46.640]
I guess I don't know. He's going to live. He's out with Larry once in a great while. They shove him in.

[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:53.940]
Prop him up in the seat. And you watch those two dead men making conversation. That's a lot of fun. 27 past noon at QA.

[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:58.240]
I'm summertime in South Florida guarantees three things. Heat humidity and hurricanes.

[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:56.820]
I'm in the local. This is 560. The radio is on yours now.

[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:58.600]
QA.

[01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:02.260]
I'll spray you all over the joint. You hear?

[01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:05.640]
Bob Slobitingi cares about our environment.

[01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:12.240]
These shores here are precious to our environment. It's my job to monitor their majestic beauty while it lasts.

[01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:18.220]
The concerns of this oil rig group chief may not surprise you. What might surprise you is who we work for.

[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.020]
Shell.

[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:26.600]
We work hard to keep the bay of hair clean. We throw the coral and tropical fish back in after spray paint it back to its original color.

[01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:29.960]
And mine grew as plenty of chloroxic cleaning oil ducts.

[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:33.020]
See? Panging higher prices at the pump is a good thing.

[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:40.120]
These shores should stay pristine for the next three or four years, once we massacre the savages and dispose of their bodies properly.

[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:50.720]
The efforts of good folks like Bob provide the luxury of giving your SUV enough power to intimidate smaller cars in front of you before having to fill up again at the next available shell station.

[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:54.480]
It goes without saying. I like that city bank K-check every week.

[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:00.960]
We represent what Saudi America is all about all around the world. If you don't like Shell, go to hell.

[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:04.040]
And we don't care if we mess up your Agastinic anyway.

[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:08.400]
1232 or 560 W.H.M. Are you ready for the worst story you've ever heard in your life?

[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:11.100]
Even worse than Phil Henry is sucking up with Dennis Miller?

[01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:13.340]
I'm ready. It's not about that problem, is it?

[01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:14.780]
No, it's about Laura Bush.

[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:21.040]
Just in, only moments ago. You ready for this? I don't think you are or ever will be.

[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:25.120]
Laura Bush, I want you to listen to every word of this very carefully.

[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:25.280]
Right.

[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:29.040]
Laura Bush, whose father died from Alzheimer's disease,

[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.460]
said today that she admired Nancy Reagan's devotion to former President Ronald Reagan until his death,

[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:38.500]
but could not back her call for relaxation of stem cell research restrictions.

[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:46.720]
58 members of the Senate, I figure what the number was, I think a couple hundred members of the House have already signed onto this.

[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:48.360]
They've hopped on board.

[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:53.940]
But not Laura, not the Bush's man, Reagan the 40th while we know he died.

[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:59.640]
Mrs. Bush, whose father died in 1997 of Alzheimer's, said she had great respect for the former First Lady

[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:02.980]
and that she was an excellent role model for family struggling to cope with the disease.

[01:56:03.500 --> 01:56:06.420]
I know how very difficult it is for the patient, obviously, but also for the caregiver.

[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:11.420]
It requires unbelievable strength of character to take care of the first few love as you see them slip away like that.

[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:16.420]
The long goodbye they call Alzheimer's, the First Lady told the CBS early show from Seattle and Georgia,

[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.180]
where leaders of the group of eight countries are meeting.

[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:29.100]
But Mrs. Bush said she did not endorse Nancy Reagan's call already re-bucked by the White House to allow greater stem cell research to proceed in the hope that it would provide some answers to the disease or possibly even a cure.

[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:35.720]
The Bush administration has placed restrictions on embryonic stem cell research and opposes using stem cells for most embryos,

[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.600]
as Stan Mrs. Bush said she supports.

[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:46.200]
These there are stem cells to do research on and we have to be really careful between what we want to do for science and what we should do ethically, the First Lady said,

[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:51.880]
stem cell is certainly one of those issues that we need to treat very carefully in between torturing all those prisoners.

[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:57.940]
Pressed and whether she was prepared to endorse Mrs. Reagan's impassioned call for restrictions to be lifted, she replied, no.

[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:10.180]
More than 200 members, like I just said only moments ago of the US Senate and the House, have also urged Bush to allow researchers to use embryonic stem cells to eventually provide brain cell transplants to Alzheimer's patients.

[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:17.280]
They also hope to use embryonic stem cells to treat Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, heart disease, diabetes and a range of other illnesses.

[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:25.400]
But just like Nancy Reagan said almost everything else, the answer from Laura Bush was, please take Nancy's advice, just say, wow.

[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:41.240]
They also hope to use embryonic stem cells to treat Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, heart disease, diabetes, a wide range of other illnesses including Alzheimer's, first and foremost of which Laura Bush's father died and Ronald Reagan just died but nevertheless the answer is still no.

[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:48.340]
Because we have to continue pandering to our right wing base and you can't get much more base than them.

[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:55.600]
Isn't that even shock us? No, it's not incredible at all, it's very credible, they're heartless evil people.

[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:01.920]
Yeah, this is compassionate conservatism. Oh man, I hate to see what happened if they were much of hard asses, you know what?

[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:10.220]
Right, this is callous cold blooded and typical anti-human. All they know is just pandering that right wing base minute and that's all they know.

[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:23.320]
I have no life. It's pandering a bunch of religious nuts. By the way, a painful short life is nothing compared to the eternity in heaven that you will miss out on if you use those stem cells.

[01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:33.040]
Oh, I see that's right, forget about that. Now is that with or without the seven virgins? That's right, that's a different book. I'm afraid I'm not right. No, in heaven you get nothing.

[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:41.840]
This article from Colin Shea who writes for Prague TV, this is long, but it's great. I'm not going to start right now, do the break first. He was a madman.

[01:58:43.460 --> 01:58:52.700]
I mean, how can people this start? I'm sitting here, like I said before, this idea that we can believe things. Yeah, I have to look at everything with 50 grains of salt.

[01:58:52.700 --> 01:59:01.380]
If that your Morton shakers sitting right there have to be shaken because this revisionist history that we get fed that we get spoon fed is such garbage.

[01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:12.540]
And of course, now with the power of television to brainwash the masses instantly. I mean, all they got to do is change the caption on there. Oh, and a racquetack. No, now it's operation Iraqi freedom. No, now it says something else.

[01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:19.440]
And the public says, oh, yeah, that makes sense to me like that poor tragic guy that called about an hour ago there. That was so sad. I made you want to cry.

[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:37.860]
Oh, the news media you just do you know what to believe? Yeah. Right. If we could have prevented 9 11 by torturing Mohammed Ata, the fact that a matter is we knew we knew him. We knew who he was. We had this picture. We had him. Right. He wasn't an Iraqi. Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:59.680]
And let me say it again to anybody who has any doubts the Saudis are the triggers in a wood pile. Okay. The sand triggers in a wood pile make no mistake about that. The Saudis don't try to deflect it. Don't try to change it. The bushes and the bin Laden's man the sound of a house of sod that connection. That's where you need to be looking sticking in those in real real deep. The Carlisle group all of these things.

[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:11.820]
All those Saudis that they flew out of here like man like they had wings. They couldn't get them out of here fast enough after 9 11. So what the other Iraqi people after the 9 11. What do they have to do with spreading terrorism around the world?

[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:27.580]
Oh, and what are we doing at the story about the poll? Don't tell me I forgot that one too. Geez. I'm slipping man. Am I old age? I think I've read that too. How about the Saudi poll? I'm oh, didn't I put that on our website? Please, please come here during the huh? We've got to better get you some stem cells. Oh, brother.

[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:39.640]
Laura said no, not for that old bag. No, seriously. I mean that was that story about the Saudi the poll of the Saudi people. Here's the one about genital cutting losing signs of favor in Africa.

[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:51.520]
You can't just see that. Did you read it? Yeah. Oh, well. But where is that story about that poll in Saudi Arabia where more than 50% of the people maybe I forgot to print it out because we had so much crap going on here. They so much stuff to put on there.

[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:57.820]
More than half of the Saudis in a poll taken recently think that Osama bin Laden is a great leader.

[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:03.820]
And I can hear what the percentage was, but it was more than half would like to see him as leader of the country.

[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:09.700]
How do you like that? What are the world family is peeing in their pants and rightfully so they deserve to be peeing in their pants?

[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:16.380]
Josh Beckett might don't even want to go there. How do you like that? He said he wouldn't wash with the best of them. Whatever they got.

[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:27.460]
Did nobody say Josh? Yeah, something like that. He's heading to rather wash with the oil they got. That's what we ought to be washing our hands in that Saudi oil.

[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:34.280]
We ought to be up to our neck in oil. We ought to have to be paying like 20 cents a gallon. A nickel a gallon like the Iraqis are doing.

[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:41.600]
Instead of letting this royal families bunch of grave robbers these Saudis. And is it any wonder that over 50% of their country loves Osama bin Laden?

[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:53.680]
Since they're the ones who started all these madrasas, all of these Wahabi wasabi, with these Wahabi instructions teaching their kids to hate the West, to hate anybody who isn't one of their Muslim fundamentalists.

[02:01:53.740 --> 02:02:02.420]
That's their whole brand of education. That's what they're all about. They preach all of that crap while they're busy living a good life with all those billions of dollars in oil money that we're funneling over there to them.

[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:09.320]
Not to mention all the proceeds from all the land that they bought up here and all over the stinking damn world. The damn world.

[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:18.100]
Just like in that scene from network, man, we talked about the Saudi deal. They're also calling the White House. We want the Saudi deal. Stop now. It's all true. It's all true.

[02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:27.780]
And if there was any country we should have been invading and very quietly, because it wouldn't take much with them. I'll tell you that right now. Real quietly. Like in the middle of the night. Guess what? We're taking over. You're out.

[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:32.500]
Turning your tunic at the counter and get lost. Ghost air pumping gas.

[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:43.480]
In fact, most of those schmata heads over there that are running that country, they're not even qualified to pump gas. They're too busy pumping each other from what I hear or apple. They're pumping ethyl.

[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:53.840]
And she's not too happy about it. 1241 at 560 WQM if your hair is gone to have on a hand vask. In fact, if your hair is just on a way out, nobody wants that beast look.

[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:54.180]
Absolutely.

[02:02:54.180 --> 02:02:56.280]
And nobody wants that beast look and peace. Absolutely.

[02:02:56.580 --> 02:03:00.960]
And the top of your head, man, people just follow all of themselves laughing their ass off when they see one of those phony pieces.

[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:06.020]
Like Aaron Brown, you can spot that muskrat a million miles away. And the mowmice to well. What's there to say about that?

[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:07.540]
The less said the better. Absolutely.

[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:16.800]

[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:22.660]

[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:29.720]
No dangerous pills to take. No animal on top of your head, but a great looking head of here that looks like it's real because it looks like it's going out of your scalp.

[02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:36.060]
The hairline is undetectable. That's why it looks so great. And Charles gives you no problem guarantee. That's right.

[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:38.720]
Nothing to lose because you tried system for 30 days.

[02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:44.720]
After a month of you know, the way it feels and smells and all that stuff, return it for a full refund. What's not to like?

[02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:49.560]
And Charlie also services and repairs existing hair systems, including shampoo and trim.

[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:56.800]

We're support radio 560-2AM.

[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:48.500]
We could chase and round forever with our tanks and all our troops.

[02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:55.720]
But special forces are so tired of jumping through them who's.

[02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:00.520]
You don't need another plane.

[02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:08.480]
So let's cut out all the nonsense and go blow up Pakistan.

[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:16.600]
All right. Now quit and ease the nuclear tank.

[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:26.260]
Oh, why don't we stop pussyfoot and blow up Pakistan?

[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:31.740]
Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.

[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.200]
Publicize one more.

[02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:40.560]
1246-560 WDQM. Here's a fact from Gary who says like that one year pool.

[02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:46.660]
We don't want to forget about that pool of businesses that you hate. Albrechtens says I have a publics in an Albrechtens near my house.

[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:49.480]
And while back we had a big rain storm and a parking lot in public got flooded out.

[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:53.940]
So I had to go to Albrechtens. It was by far the most disgusting groceries to have ever seen.

[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:59.660]
This is a great line. They make when Dixie look good enough to eat off the floor.

[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:06.940]
Wow. I think we just read the ultimate shot. Are you ready for that or what?

[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:09.120]
Yeah, I know. What can you say?

[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:17.760]
I just emailed Eric another story that I found by accident while I was searching for a thing about that Saudi pool about the Bush, George W. Bush and the Bin Laden's man.

[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:23.300]
It's I. It's long. So I just emailed the Eric. Put it on there. Whatever you feel like it. Eric whenever you're through making all that money.

[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:27.360]
Colin Shea and the prog TV rights about Reagan. He was a madman.

[02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:33.420]
Ronald Reagan is dead and the world is nowhere soft for it. At the best of times he was an ineffectual dunce.

[02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:40.160]
At the worst, he was a dangerous madman who threatened humanity's very survival. He destroyed any residual respect for the presidency left over from Nixon.

[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:46.500]
His moral predecessor. He created unprecedented deficits while simultaneously gutting the principles of the New Deal and the Great Society.

[02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:54.220]
He presented over a white house famously unable to govern properly because of his abysmal ignorance and tolerance of a Byzantine mess of corrupt internal fight thief.

[02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:07.900]
His endless rotation of advisors with a contemptible assortment of thieves, quacks, hypocrites and imbicils who regularly broke the law of the land, lied changelessly to Congress and the American people and hopelessly ensnared themselves in ugly webs of shady and illicit dealings.

[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:15.540]
Reagan claimed to be leading a conservative revolution but he left the presidency with America mired in death, more authoritarian, militarized and centralized than ever before,

[02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:31.680]
and with a foreign policy that was the life stock of the civilized world. It was a morning in America but the dawn was black indeed. A black dawn where Christian greed was celebrated over comic compassion where a family man could now walk out of church and taught a homeless family, securing the knowledge that their property was their own fault.

[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:52.600]
A black dawn where a lie repeated five times could become a simple truth, a black dawn where the attorney general could commit crime after crime without consequence, where the national security adviser could sell weapons to terrorists in order to finance more terrorists, where be grade science fiction movie served as policy papers and see grade far served as the script for governance in the halls of power of the mightiest nation the world is ever known.

[02:07:53.360 --> 02:08:05.240]
As I write the men as being canonized as a saint by the press and the political establishment, the bright moments are being recalled, the fall of the Soviet Union, the monumental arms reduction treaties, the resurgence of conservatism as a credible political philosophy.

[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:13.520]
These stupendously dangerous evil empire days of the early 1980s when as a child, I lay in quivering fear of imminent nuclear emulation are conveniently forgotten.

[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:31.760]
The astonishing case of White House amnesia sing during the Iran country hearings is mostly topic non-grata. That's a pity since I would enjoy sing rerun footage of a smoke-weat, imperturbable poindexed or murmuring cryptic non-responses like some sort of delphic oracle and edmese hissing and spitting and snarling like a disemboweled jackal.

[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:40.540]
Together they managed to say I don't know 524 times in seven days of collective testimony and reprise of every college student's worst classroom humiliation nightmares.

[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:51.940]
My name Nicaraguan Harbers of violation of federal law and inactive war is nowhere mentioned. Michael Devers indictment on multiple counts of perjury is just an elf footnote as our Paul Thayer is years in the pen for obstructed justice.

[02:08:52.480 --> 02:09:00.200]
I doubt there'll be speculation as to whether William Casey was fortunate to croak when he did thus being spared the ignominy of being frog marched out of the CIA headquarters and handcuffs.

[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:14.320]
Elliott Abrams, one of the darlings of the current administration will probably not be seen acknowledging that misleading Congress may have been a mistake, not to mention misplacing $10 million which mysteriously ended up in a Swiss bank account instead of financing central American debt squads like it was supposed to.

[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:28.540]
I doubt we'll see edmese puditive attorney general claiming that the Supreme Court does not set the Supreme Law of the land or James White blightfully stating during his confirmation hearing that conservation ought not to be a priority since he didn't know how many generations we can count on before the Lord returns.

[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:39.040]
Not to mention Alexander, hey gripping the podium lukin and fetamine crazed baboon screaming at reporters that he was in charge after the assassination attempt on Reagan was this good or what it's good.

[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:51.920]
Then there's George senior toasting Ferdinand Marcos for his adherence of democratic principle and processes when he wasn't being forced out forced to fire practically his entire campaign staff amid allegations of anti-Semitism he was dishing it out himself.

[02:09:51.920 --> 02:10:05.720]
I hope I stand for anti-abigotry anti-Semitism anti-racism. He also wanted to be remembered for a complete and total ban on chemical weapons their destruction forever though it's more likely he'll be remembered for casting several time-breaking senate votes to resume production of nerve agents.

[02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:15.940]
After the USS Vincent Blue and Iranian airliner out of the sky killing nearly 300 people he set the standard for accepting responsibility in that in future Republican administrations with his memorable howl.

[02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:19.320]
I will never apologize for the United States. I don't care what the facts are.

[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:31.700]
The Reagan revolution looked as though it was on a way to becoming a Nixon SP asco by 1986 countless members of the administration were languishing in prison fleeing to perigway or being consumed in the toxic flames of rand contra.

[02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:40.960]
Even the chittering rats of the Republican own senate had to abandon all duchess leaking ship of state over South Africa when he started yammering about how they've eliminated the segregation we once had in our country.

[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:50.540]
They say a person's character is defined by the company he keeps and Reagan's gamut of buddies from Edmiste Ferdinand Marcos to the savage apartheid enforces of South Africa did the man no favors.

[02:10:51.280 --> 02:11:00.960]
Those who say that the unjustifies the mean that these criticisms pale into indignificance next to the achievement of winning the Cold War and toppling the Berlin Wall like Ahmed Chalabi is one of the great heroes in error.

[02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:10.860]
But tough to use and it rings howl equally howl always Chalabi's like who say in the rack the first in Soviet B. M. Roth was crippled crippled husk by the 1980s already in death throws.

[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:19.940]
The best that can be said for Reagan is that may he have slightly accelerated demise and worse they may have veered crazily close to nuclear holocaust and wrecked the American economy for no reason at all.

[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:27.640]
It wasn't Reagan who won the Cold War for America but Stalin. As with so much of his career Reagan was just an empty vessel acting out of script written long before.

[02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:36.440]
Some say it's cool and needless to assault the legacy of a crippled old man who ultimately wanted the best for his nation but the spear him this would be to show compassion he never demonstrated himself.

[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:44.080]
Time and time again he insisted the homeless somehow wanted to sleep on sidewalk grates that the poor the hungry the indigent were there because of their own laziness.

[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:50.680]
In the strange refracted light of Reagan's black dawn soup kitchens were full because eating food there is easier than paying for it.

[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:56.460]
His $155 billion deficit was the result of some demonic collusion between Congress and the press.

[02:11:56.460 --> 02:12:08.780]
A gaggle of drugs, mugglers and assassins in the Nicaragua in jungle were the moreland equivalent of the founding fathers and trading arms for hostages that the same people who had just killed hundreds of Marines in Beirut was somehow inexplicably something completely other.

[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:13.840]
No one including the vice president the presidential spokesman could say exactly what it was but it sure wasn't that.

[02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:23.280]
Truth be told I could forgive the old man all of this but what I'll never forgive him is that in spite of all of this in the face of overwhelming evidence that he should have been run out of town like a syphiletic dentist.

[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:31.860]
He left office with the highest approval ratings of any president ever leaving aside Roosevelt croaking in the arms of his mistress in a hot tub God bless the old man's lurcharous soul.

[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:38.560]
The true crime in sconce within the sastanishing bit of black magic with the genesis of the monstrous creature that is the modern Republican party.

[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:47.000]
It's been morning in America ever since Reagan's genial smile flooded our living rooms with warmth 25 years ago and our minds have steadily softened in tandem with his.

[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:53.220]
Joe six pack fervently believes that if he just lands that third job or gets the right break that Hummer will soon be his.

[02:12:53.500 --> 02:13:04.320]
The blacks of all conveniently been turned into felons and thrown off the voter rolls hundreds of billions will wash through the Pentagon and a grotesque charade of Kony capitalism and whenever the anemosir plus builds up too high we go and find some pathetic

[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:11.580]
regid excuse for a country to bomb the smithereens so we can plant the flag in the smoldering ruins and congratulate ourselves on transplanting democracy.

[02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:26.960]
Bush to is Reagan redux in its most awful sense the ball face lies without any hope or even attempt for justification is a surveillance a simple press a public which forgives and forgets and yes even loves while their leaders deliver powerful kicks to their genitals again and again.

[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:40.100]
Cross-eyed apocalyptic madman once again roam the halls of power while slimy political hacks sharpen hook knives in back rooms both had to make obligatory pilgrimages the Bob Jones University to kneel at the altar of Nixon's southern strategy and claim.

[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:47.720]
All know it's not about racism at all. It's about states rights and religious freedom nudged nudge wink wink. Catherine did you finish scrubbing the Florida voter rolls yet.

[02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:57.060]
The same well-known policy apparatus is in place once more Bush's blind man in the room full of deaf people is today's equivalent of Reagan generating policy ideas from trashy sci-fi novels.

[02:13:57.060 --> 02:14:10.320]
Don Quixote, silky at windmills had nothing on these guys just as Reagan was prepared to throw away a decade of arms control for the sake of his non-existent space lasers. Bush insist on implementing a non-functioning missile shield to defend against a non-existent missile threat.

[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:25.900]
Reagan's doomed American medical students and Cuban military airfields on Grenada set the stage for the desert mirage of Iraqi WMD and whether it's around country or oboe grade that's a cause of an in rage congressional scrutiny both Reagan and Bush had the sense to hunker down in the undisclosed location in shrug.

[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:34.820]
Hey, don't look at me. I'm just a present. These guys don't tell me anything. But for all of that Reagan even had some limits. He funded non non-killing death squads from El Salvador to South Africa.

[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:40.260]
But he even he couldn't stomach aerial sheroan tearing through Lebanon and engineering made for TV massacres of women and children.

[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:44.900]
But he set the stage for those who could and now the hard boys are back in the saddle calling all the shots.

[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:52.260]
Sheroan can wait and blood if he wants while the American people sit back and right checks to pay for the bulldozers squashing peace activist and raising refugee camps.

[02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:58.460]
Ronald Reagan was not a great man. He was a dangerous and incompetent president who brought dishonor and disgrace to his office in his country.

[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:04.680]
The adulation and reverence being heaped on him today isn't of seen a front to truth history and the millions who are worse off today because of him.

[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:17.320]
The modern Republican party's new muscular conservatism with its nutty imperial dreams, voodoo economics, a worldwide gulag archipelago, content for the constitution and the rule of law and blind and bubbly ignorance of fact and history is his creation.

[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:22.060]
And so in this time of crisis we must not let our memory of Reagan be shrouded in sentimentalism and glory.

[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:28.960]
He takes with him to his grave, inelectable responsibilities that he would never accept during his tenure or indeed in his life.

[02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:31.980]
The seats he sewed so long ago come to monstrous fruition.

[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:41.800]
Let us use this poignant moment not to create a false none worthy idol in the pantheon of American democracy but to carefully consider how we'd come to this dreadful past and whether and how we may yet turn back.

[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:46.800]
What a great article for a Prague TV by Colin Shea.

[02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:47.860]
Yeah.

[02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:52.100]
He was a madman and well said.

[02:15:53.520 --> 02:16:01.800]

Just anyone only good Christian sheet and no heaps.

Start paying on the Bible and change your body human public into.

[02:17:57.980 --> 02:17:59.920]
Car.

[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:03.640]
A sister comes where she has a wife.

[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:05.940]
Growing.

[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:09.320]
Work out.

[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:12.700]
It's all good here after all.

[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:21.660]
He takes all your clothes off because it has in your name.

[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:30.380]
Not much of you have been so confused, so cable TV, TV.

[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:34.100]
Get things like you need to.

[02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:38.460]
And need us as just as voting as you.

[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:46.700]
I've been sent to God when He has a rapture.

[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:48.980]
Feel good.

[02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:54.680]
With all ten arms, you go to rapture.

[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:57.140]
Oh my God.

[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:01.940]
What do I do now?

[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:03.100]
I don't know.

[02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:05.220]
You got a magazine or something?

[02:19:05.580 --> 02:19:06.780]
But you have eight new wings.

[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:09.200]
Can I fly with work that way?

[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:09.540]
So.

[02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:12.420]
Org and other Thursday, a G8 meeting in Savannah, Jojo.

[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:14.820]
And there's the Bushmaster with one of his smatha friends.

[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:15.400]
Look at that.

[02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:16.360]
One of the raghead buddies.

[02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:17.260]
What's your name?

[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:19.080]
Shaking hands, kissing, holding hands.

[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:19.760]
Shake hands?

[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:22.240]
Yeah, the shaky, he's shaking his shake hands.

[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:23.000]
They're shaking it.

[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:23.920]
Shake your booty.

[02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:28.400]
Anyway, there was a word in that last story, which I always try very hard,

[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:31.660]
because Marine Dowd is the one that usually scoops me up with words that I never heard of before.

[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:33.180]
There was a word toward the end of the story,

[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:35.960]
ineluctible responsibilities who would never accept during his tenure.

[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:38.060]
He takes to his grave, ineluctible.

[02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:39.060]
I have no idea what that means.

[02:19:40.180 --> 02:19:40.760]
Do it on me.

[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:42.620]
And I was going to look it up.

[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:43.660]
I'll do it during the next break.

[02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:46.040]
I was going to look it up on the dictionary search on here.

[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:50.280]
But of course, my computer, I've had to like reconfabulate because of that damn real player thing,

[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:50.880]
because of you.

[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:51.840]
Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:52.420]
But it was worth it.

[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:53.920]
That was worth it.

[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:54.640]
It was all your fault.

[02:19:54.780 --> 02:19:55.080]
But it was worth it.

[02:19:55.080 --> 02:20:00.480]
It was what they were showing that story on that trailer, including the morphing part on MTV, as I was flipping.

[02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:01.220]
All right.

[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:02.140]
Oh, there's kind of Lisa.

[02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:03.420]
Really Palestinian issue.

[02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:03.800]
Yeah.

[02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:06.260]
Yeah, we got your issues all right right here, sweetheart.

[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:08.160]
Chevron, bitch.

[02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:12.260]
Jimmy, Brazlund writes, well, I tell you, we're getting like backed up here.

[02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:13.340]
How did this happen to me?

[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:15.280]
I don't get all the Reagan stories in.

[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:15.480]
Good.

[02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:16.420]
And some others.

[02:20:16.820 --> 02:20:17.820]
How's the poll coming along?

[02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:18.520]
Let's take a look at that.

[02:20:18.580 --> 02:20:20.040]
We don't want to forget it all, though, quite frankly.

[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:22.020]
What retail place in South Florida?

[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:24.860]
Do you hate the most Walmart 175?

[02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:26.380]
They're pulling away in the stretch.

[02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:31.520]
Windixi 129, Eckerd 71, Brandsmark 68, Radio Shack 35.

[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:34.280]
You got to be on crack to Shabbat Radio Shack.

[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:43.840]
K-Mart 31, Rooms to Go 29, Circuit City 22, Home Depot 20, Best by 18, Bird Eines 13, CompUSA 13,

[02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:49.140]
Pep Boys 12, Magcress John 10, Sam's Club 8, Lowest 3, and Albertsons 3, which is one under,

[02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:50.560]
out of 660 votes.

[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:52.600]
Well, we're getting close to 6.6, so you know what?

[02:20:54.180 --> 02:20:58.600]
Jimmy Brazlund writes in News Day, and hopefully I won't blow any words in this.

[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:00.860]
Scientific Methody, Loads President.

[02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:06.660]
What a Ronald Reagan's great desires was to have an anti-demistal defense that would knock everything out of the sky

[02:21:06.660 --> 02:21:08.120]
from a fly to a huge missile.

[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.980]
He has left us with George Bush, who is also sure can work.

[02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:17.600]
Explanations of this defense were best explained by the late Columbia Psychics Professor, I.I. Rabie.

[02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:18.440]
Psychics.

[02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:20.100]
I beg your pardon?

[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:20.940]
Did you say psychics?

[02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:23.120]
Did I say psychics?

[02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:23.440]
You did.

[02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:24.760]
Physics, Professor.

[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:25.740]
I was thinking of Nancy.

[02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:27.760]
Come on, be sure of all the compassion will you please.

[02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:28.440]

[02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:29.560]
I was thinking of Nancy.

[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:32.180]
Psychics, Physics, Professor, I.I. Rabie.

[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:32.960]
Rabie.

[02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:33.480]
Rabie.

[02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:36.360]
He came out of Hopkins in Avenue in Brownsville in Brooklyn.

[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:40.240]
In his first years in grammar school, he collected scraps of wire and used the developer radio.

[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:48.160]
He was a man small only in size who used to sit on Riverside Rabbit, occasionally a bar stool at the old Castellos on 44th Street and talk about anything he had on your mind.

[02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:51.000]
He was a Nobel Prize winner for his work on the MRI.

[02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:57.760]
During WWII, he was at MIT working on a sonar that was to cover the ocean with the bodies of dead German submarine sailors.

[02:21:58.140 --> 02:22:06.120]
Then he would say nothing to his wife and leave the house and take long train trip to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where he lived in secrecy and was the consulting engineer in the first atomic bomb.

[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:09.760]
He won the pool on the size of the first explosion ever of an atom bomb.

[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:11.920]
He was a psychic physics professor.

[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:19.600]
He was white eyes and hour science advisor after that he came to Columbia as a prize physicist, which is how he got to Riverside Drive and Castellos on his 44th Street.

[02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:25.280]
One afternoon he spoke of the Star Wars missile defense that Ronald Reagan then president urine for so earnestly.

[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:27.700]
Don't get private old man of his dream, Rabie.

[02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:28.520]
He said, let him have it.

[02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:29.960]
You mean the thing works? He was asked?

[02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:31.560]
Yes, I'll tell you exactly how.

[02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:36.760]
A baseball pitcher is on the mound. He has the ball on his hand. You have to shoot the ball out of his hand at the instant of release.

[02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:42.360]
You can't shoot it before that and you can't shoot it after he's released the ball. You must shoot at the instant of release.

[02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:46.040]
So the pitcher stands there and holds the ball and you're looking at him and ready to shoot.

[02:22:46.480 --> 02:22:49.200]
And the pitcher stands still forever and you watch him until you go crazy.

[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:53.620]
We spend our money on it. It has Russia crazy. I know the scientists there. They know it's nuts.

[02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:58.960]
But the generals come up and say America is spending huge amounts of money on it. They must know something. We better catch up.

[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:03.620]
Oh, catch up. Isn't that a vegetable? Yes. Oh, no, that was Reagan. It was the vegetable.

[02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:09.060]
That is the same system that Reagan's inheritor George Bush advocates so strongly today.

[02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:13.700]
We've tested our missiles and they've hit nothing. Still we spend and work on them. They enchanted Reagan.

[02:23:13.900 --> 02:23:18.820]
So George Bush and her order is enthralled with the glorious experiment of technology that with the enthusiasm of the unwashed.

[02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:22.700]
He hurls as the answer perhaps is early next week to the most diabolical of enemies.

[02:23:23.260 --> 02:23:30.140]
Among the crowded streets of Washington Heights and there are two lines of grammar school kids coming out of a church which I recognize is Saint Elizabeth's where I've attended a funeral.

[02:23:30.660 --> 02:23:34.500]
That was when they buried a marine named Ryan A. Taheda dead in Iraq.

[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:42.160]
It was there because George Bush's administration showed the nation a great scientific fact that the worst weapon of mass destruction is a lie told by government officials.

[02:23:42.900 --> 02:23:46.520]
Sodom who's saying had weapons of mass destruction ready to use against us any moment now.

[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:56.840]
They told to the country in every way they told that from the White House where Bush made a state of the Union address scaring us all to the United Nations where George tenants at the on colon pile who said see these two trucks in the photographs.

[02:23:56.900 --> 02:24:04.300]
There are rackies moving weapons of mass destruction. The pictures were frauds. They had been taken two weeks apart and inspected by the United Nations man Hans Blix.

[02:24:04.660 --> 02:24:10.060]
Paul today explains it is being muddled by the CIA or something like that. He was my vote for the first non-white president, Paul.

[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:12.220]
Today I want him to quit as he should have months ago.

[02:24:13.060 --> 02:24:20.560]
Inside this church at the hottest funeral the New York mayor Bloomberg got up and continued to lie saying that they had a died because of trying to locate weapons of mass destruction.

[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:29.820]
It was a falsehood issue without a thought because the president Bush said so and it is so and Bloomberg doesn't have the sense to stay clear of Bush a low IQ stumbling around science.

[02:24:30.380 --> 02:24:34.240]
People get killed because of this a huge street sign at 180th and St. Nicholas red.

[02:24:35.040 --> 02:24:44.680]
There were selling clothes and trumps and music shouted from stores and two doors in from the avenue was a display of four lighted candles and a milk box and color pictures of Tejada posted on the wall alongside the doorway.

[02:24:45.220 --> 02:24:55.940]
Few on the busy street spoke English nobody knew what the pictures stood for to be known. You must be on television. Then a woman said as she walked by 51 fifth floor that she remembered Tejada's apartment number paid him a high honor.

[02:24:58.700 --> 02:25:00.380]
How do you like that Jimmy Brezlin?

[02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:03.020]
You go quite huh?

[02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:07.340]
You'll not quite as good as that other article but no but nothing's going to be as good as that.

[02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:15.100]
Of course that was on Prague TV when you see it on American TV. I don't think so. I don't think you'll be hearing any commentators are given up the comment here on American TV.

[02:25:17.060 --> 02:25:23.420]
Ivan Castro writes Reagan legacy as a dark side in Latin America. This is for Reuters.

[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:36.440]
Managua Nicaragua. Ronald Reagan is drawing glowing praise worldwide since his death but in Central America many remember the former US president is a quote or radical who support for right wing leaders and rebels caused tens of thousands of lives.

[02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:44.900]
The impoverished countries of Central America erupted in violence in the 80s when Reagan was president and his administration spent millions of dollars in vicious civil wars.

[02:25:44.900 --> 02:25:56.460]
In the name of fighting communism in America's backyard Reagan supported country rebels against the revolutionary send an East of government in Nicaragua and help prop up repressivators that faced leftist insurgencies in El Salvador and Guatemala.

[02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:00.120]
Since Reagan's death on Saturday the reaction in Central America has been mixed.

[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:07.660]
We don't celebrate any death but we must be honest we're not starting now the president Reagan respected international law that he treated Nicaragua well.

[02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:12.580]
We're not going to lie said Daniel Ortega is sent an East of president led Nicaragua during the war against the Congress.

[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:20.200]
Miguel de Soto the former sent an East of foreign Mr. added there's not the least out that president Reagan did Nicaragua much harm and caused many deaths.

[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:26.340]
An estimated 300,000 people died in Central America civil wars about half during Reagan's two terms in office.

[02:26:26.660 --> 02:26:35.780]
Many were civilians tortured and murdered by army troops or death squads linked to armed forces that received heavy US support human rights groups say that torture and murder stuff ain't brand new is it?

[02:26:35.780 --> 02:26:36.020]
No.

[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:37.640]
Abu Gharr Raib

[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:48.520]
A lot of extremely nasty things were going on and the Reagan administration really defended and even actively supported some of the war human rights violators in the hemisphere said Daniel Wilkinson of human rights watch in New York.

[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:59.140]
Reagan sent to America policy him under criticism at home when the Iran conference scandal unfolded exposing US secret sales of arms to Iran to help fund the Congress for bid in specifically by the US Congress.

[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:10.140]
There was no issue and probably has been the issue since Vietnam that has divided the American public in Congress more than the Reagan administration policy in Central America said Russell Crandall at the US based console on foreign relations.

[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:17.020]
Reagan did not create the crisis in Central America the San Anises seized power and revolution once before he took office.

[02:27:17.380 --> 02:27:21.680]
El Salvador was already falling into chaos and Guatemala Civil War been going on for two decades.

[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:27.880]
The critics said his hard line against communism killed off any hopes for negotiated settlements polarized the region and fed violence.

[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:35.760]
Ronald Reagan's name is linked to the darkest dictatorships in the history of Guatemala said Mario Polanco who heads a group set up by families of many who died.

[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:47.300]
Reagan does have admirers in the region who say his tough stance halted the communist threat ultimately brought democracy is 1983 invasion of the Caribbean island of Grenada to house the Marxist government and rescue standard Americans was very popular.

[02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:55.240]
Nicaragua and President and Mickey Bolano said Reagan was a great defender of Nicaragua's return to democracy and all Nicaraguan's who believe in democracy recognize that legacy.

[02:27:55.660 --> 02:27:59.920]
And El Salvador president Tony Soca said Reagan helped the company in its most difficult moments.

[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:06.900]
Allies say the proof is in the ballot box since the end of the region's civil wars voters have repeatedly elected conservative pro-Washington governments.

[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:15.540]
The region however remains sharply divided in the leftist leaders that went to war with the West back forces in Nicaragua and El Salvador still pull in more than 35% of the national vote.

[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:31.840]
Following all these things kind of a mixed bag mostly negative. Yeah, Ronnie Reagan which you never get from this falling in sanded it goes on on CNN and MSNBC and Fox Nazi news just round the clock 24 7 baby all Reagan all the time.

[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:42.520]
And I realize you're not supposed to speak ill of the dead but for number one he was dying for 10 years and for number two when it go this far overboard in one direction it needs to be a little counterbalance.

[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:47.360]
You know what I'm saying and our little corner of the world. Yeah, and it's fun and tasty. Yeah, that's right.

[02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:54.540]

Let me tell you right now about a great place right now if you're starving to death lunch dinner late nights next it's the world famous pizza lot in Davie on university drive between Griffith and 5 95 right beyond here when imports tons of free parking.

[02:29:26.060 --> 02:29:36.620]
They got lots and lots of seats you don't have to stay on lines even on the weekend and boy the prices are unbelievably low on the label even after all these years Jeff has barely even raised a little notch on

[02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:45.140]
at menu because he likes to keep the prices way down there so you can afford to keep coming back over and over again the food is always fresh delicious it's cooked order three different kinds of great pizza the best

[02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:53.680]
garlic rolls in the world every kind of a tad in February ever heard of and lots more to every Monday you buy one lasagna dinner and the second one is only five bucks and don't need any stupid coupons either.

[02:29:53.680 --> 02:30:01.800]
Every Tuesday when you buy one eggplant dinner the second is only five bucks again no coupon needed and on Thursday they offer a special where you buy any

[02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:09.580]
on train the second one is only half price at the world famous pizza lot no microwaves nothing like heated up to access everything like I said cook fresh if you want

[02:30:09.580 --> 02:30:20.020]

I can in case you have it but you're I ran 100 criminals every turn.

[02:31:04.980 --> 02:31:11.700]
I think this song any time somebody famous time will hear you go again.

[02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:18.960]
It's time for all the go no matter how many times you just say no.

[02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:32.720]
Just go.

[02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:41.720]
And get my regards to Nixon.

[02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:46.520]
And I recall back to no Italian days of the Bonso films

[02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:49.620]
Before June Allison wore a di-dai pants.

[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:54.500]
And I had both my hands and my smith with porraxo.

[02:31:55.420 --> 02:31:57.860]
Now, be joining us soon, and we'll have some fun

[02:31:57.860 --> 02:32:01.300]
With our own pals, Everett Durtson and John Lund.

[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:05.240]
And Bob Doltz has no matter how big a star

[02:32:05.240 --> 02:32:09.160]
Or how famous you are, you still wind up dead.

[02:32:10.660 --> 02:32:15.840]
You started movies, became president, and then you turned into a tree.

[02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:21.120]
We held up our socks with garter as like a big name.

[02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:26.160]
I'm here just grabbing facts.

[02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:27.520]
That's all right. Just relax.

[02:32:27.760 --> 02:32:28.300]
We're gonna be a peggy.

[02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:29.800]
I knew it was ending, I saw it.

[02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:33.600]
So I looked up ineluctable, which I've actually there.

[02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:35.220]
How many people do you think know what that word means?

[02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:36.100]
Third man.

[02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:38.120]
Talking about our audience, I think in the entire world.

[02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:38.920]
Is it anything like?

[02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:41.340]
Ineluctable means inevitable, not to be uploaded or escaped.

[02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:43.200]
I thought it was so real like, delectable.

[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:43.960]
Oh.

[02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:46.660]
They had a Florida's elections division resign Monday.

[02:32:46.760 --> 02:32:50.520]
They admitted reports he was feeding political heat over a push to purge thousands of suspected felons

[02:32:50.520 --> 02:32:52.740]
From the state voter rule, the Sun Sentinel says.

[02:32:53.560 --> 02:32:56.460]
The same Pete Times notes that Florida's 67 election supervisors

[02:32:56.460 --> 02:33:01.380]
Or at the annual conference are feeding the pressure of intense public scrutiny, thank God,

[02:33:01.380 --> 02:33:04.420]
That increases as another closely fought presidential election draws near.

[02:33:04.860 --> 02:33:10.920]
The rest of the country seems convinced that Florida will screw it up again and believe you me, if anybody can, we will.

[02:33:11.700 --> 02:33:16.160]
If anybody's got all the experience to do it, if anybody knows how to do it, we can do it, man.

[02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:19.700]
We're the little, uh, penis shaped state that could.

[02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:23.400]
Anyway, here's a fact from somebody's obviously p-oated Walgreens.

[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:24.660]
Probably this person works in records.

[02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:25.480]
I guess.

[02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:26.960]
What's the other one is it C-S?

[02:33:27.300 --> 02:33:27.800]
C-V-S.

[02:33:27.960 --> 02:33:28.640]
C-V-S.

[02:33:29.340 --> 02:33:30.800]
This is C-V-S.

[02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:32.280]
Oh, that's right. C-V-S.

[02:33:32.780 --> 02:33:34.720]
And they're open 24 hours and they're all over the place.

[02:33:34.900 --> 02:33:35.580]
They're popping up, right?

[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:36.020]
And they're right.

[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:36.780]
Nice car.

[02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:37.060]
Are they really?

[02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:37.680]
Yeah.

[02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:39.320]
They are.

[02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:42.420]
Well, I'm partial to Walgreens because I have that one right nearby where I live.

[02:33:42.740 --> 02:33:43.240]
And I like two.

[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:45.400]
And number two is a fine store.

[02:33:45.580 --> 02:33:46.360]
They got whatever I want.

[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:48.560]
They're, uh, they're open 24-7 now.

[02:33:48.700 --> 02:33:49.760]
And what's not to like?

[02:33:49.900 --> 02:33:50.600]
I just like to store.

[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:52.420]
And they're not on the other hand, I despise.

[02:33:53.140 --> 02:33:54.520]
Anyway, this one says.

[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:56.660]
What gives Walgreens the right to be on every court in America?

[02:33:56.940 --> 02:33:58.540]
It seems that they've taken the place as the drug dealers.

[02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:00.940]
Well, that's one of the things they sell as drugs.

[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:02.760]
It's very scary.

[02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:06.720]
Walgreens is secretly trying to take over the world and crush any other pharmacy in their

[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:08.200]
plant like a drug dealing gang.

[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:11.680]
It's also very scary taking my film there.

[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:12.760]
Something I'll never do again.

[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:16.280]
They put up a great front with their new shiny stores, although it's a shini here.

[02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:19.240]
Shiny stores, but with the huge spread of stores across the country,

[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:21.760]
knowledge there is very, very thin.

[02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:22.660]
Whatever that means.

[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:23.580]
Film processing?

[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:24.680]
Yeah.

[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:26.720]
It's going to be pretty smart to put your thing in there,

[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:30.100]
put your name on it, envelope, and stick it in the thing and send it off to where they do it.

[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:33.080]
Still processing film, the old fashioned way, are they?

[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:34.180]
No, sure.

[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:37.120]
They're not going to go out and get no digital camera stuff like that.

[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:38.700]
Are you crazy on everything now, though?

[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:39.820]
No, no, no.

[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:41.580]
They're not going to do that in the amount of vending machines.

[02:34:41.660 --> 02:34:42.620]
Nah, you can't do that.

[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:44.760]
Even on your pop-up toast, you can take pictures of the bread.

[02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:46.780]
Walgreens on the inside, frying.

[02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:48.940]
In fact, in a Ronnie's casket, what else bad?

[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:49.580]
That's terrible.

[02:34:49.940 --> 02:34:52.020]
Well, I still think it's an empty casket.

[02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:52.640]
I don't think he's in there.

[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:53.300]
Yeah.

[02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:54.160]
I agree.

[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:56.420]
Fine, this doesn't make sense to you.

[02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:58.860]
What if some wine test goes up there and tries to pop the thing open?

[02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:02.780]
I mean, you know, he's going to be like, remember the eye tolo fall out of the helicopter?

[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:04.020]
Yeah, that's fine.

[02:35:04.580 --> 02:35:05.020]
Not good.

[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:10.240]
Anyway, Norma Kent, in fact, me this earlier, or email this earlier,

[02:35:10.820 --> 02:35:12.900]
while the rest of the nation mourns the death of Ronald Reagan,

[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:14.980]
this is his legacy to me, his Norma.

[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:18.560]
Although AIDS was first reported in the medical and popular press in 1981,

[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:22.380]
it was only October 87, as two years after Rock Hudson died,

[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:25.500]
that President Reagan ever even publicly spoke about the epidemic.

[02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:30.020]
By the end of that year, 59,572 AIDS cases have been reported,

[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:33.060]
and 27,900 of those women and men had died.

[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:33.920]
How could this happen?

[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:37.720]
How could Reagan not say anything through all these years of death and spreading disease,

[02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:39.420]
affecting so many gay Americans?

[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:44.060]
In practical terms, Reagan's long sums, men AIDS research, was chronically underfunded.

[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:47.680]
When doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute for Health

[02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:50.860]
asked for more funding for their work on AIDS, they were routinely denied it.

[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:55.640]
Between June of 1981 and May of 1982, the CDC spent less than a million dollars on AIDS,

[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:58.040]
but nine million dollars on Legionnaires' disease.

[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:02.240]
At that point, over 1,000 of the 2,000 AIDS cases reported resulted in death.

[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:04.720]
There were fewer than 50 deaths from Legionnaires' disease.

[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:08.300]
This drastic lack of funding would continue through the Reagan years.

[02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:12.720]
When health and support groups in the gay community integrated education and prevention programs,

[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:16.460]
or instigated those programs, they were denied federal funding.

[02:36:16.460 --> 02:36:20.160]
In October of 1987, Jesse Helms back with Reagan's support

[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:23.940]
demanded a federal appropriation bill that prohibited AIDS education efforts

[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:28.680]
that encouraged or promoted homosexual activity that is telegay men how to have safe sex.

[02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:31.320]
Throughout all of this, Ronald Reagan did nothing.

[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:35.520]
When Rock Hudson, a friend and colleague of the Reagan's, was diagnosed and died in 1985,

[02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:39.980]
one of almost 21,000 cases reported that year, Reagan still did not speak out.

[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:42.900]
When family friend William H. F. Buckley in March 1918,

[02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:48.220]
1819-16 New York Times article, said that HIV plus a positive gay men should have this information,

[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:50.900]
forcibly tattooed on their buttocks, Reagan said nothing.

[02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:54.120]
In 1986, after five years of complete silence,

[02:36:54.240 --> 02:36:58.320]
when Surgeon General C. Everett Cooper released a report calling for AIDS education in schools,

[02:36:58.940 --> 02:37:02.560]
Bennett and Howard did everything possible to undercut and prevent funding

[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:04.160]
for COOP's two little two-layed initiative.

[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:10.140]
By the end of 1986, 37,000 AIDS cases had been reported over 16,000 people had died.

[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:16.460]
The most memorable Reagan AIDS moment was that the 1986 cemetery reded occasion of the Statue of Liberty.

[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:21.900]
The Reagan's were there sitting next to the French Prime Minister in his wife, François and Daniel Mitterrand,

[02:37:22.320 --> 02:37:24.480]
Bob Hope was on stage, entertaining the All-Star audience.

[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:27.100]
In the middle of a series of one-liders, Hope Quipped,

[02:37:27.380 --> 02:37:29.360]
I just heard that the Statue of Liberty has AIDS,

[02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:32.800]
but she doesn't know if she got it from the mouth of the Hudson or the Staten Island Ferry.

[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:37.120]
As the television camera panned the audience, the Mitterrand's looked appalled,

[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:38.500]
the Reagan's were laughing.

[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:45.120]
By the end of 1989, 115,786 women and men have been diagnosed with AIDS in the U.S.,

[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:46.780]
more than 70,000 of them had died.

[02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:51.860]
We've learned today through research science and the process of medicine that AIDS can be controlled and contained.

[02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:55.660]
The great communicator, the right wing and the churches he supported next to nothing

[02:37:55.660 --> 02:37:59.340]
to facilitate this process or enhance those discoveries or promote this research.

[02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:03.680]
This is the legacy he leaves to the thousands of aid victims whose graves are marked by a silence.

[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:08.540]
I heard on the news this morning that we're being encouraged to overlook the occasional shortcomings or gaps

[02:38:08.540 --> 02:38:11.020]
and focus on the accomplishments of Reagan's life.

[02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:14.920]
I find the death of hundreds of thousands of human beings damn hard to overlook, can you?

[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:19.680]
The point is that Ronald Wilson Reagan took an oath to defend and protect the people of the United States,

[02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:22.100]
gay or straight, black or white, well or ill.

[02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:24.520]
An honest review tells us he could have done better,

[02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:27.760]
and if we had the courage to own up to a present success and his failures,

[02:38:28.260 --> 02:38:32.980]
Mr. Reagan failed when it comes to fighting a disease that still spreads across the world today with frightening breath.

[02:38:32.980 --> 02:38:38.100]
Who knows where he might have been today if Reagan had launched the battle when he had the chance to do so a quarter of a century ago.

[02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:39.920]
Pretty good stuff, Norm. Excellent. Good job.

[02:38:40.260 --> 02:38:42.960]
By the way, Norm Kent's on Saturday in some August station again now.

[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:44.840]
Does anybody care? No. I just thought I mentioned it.

[02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:48.000]
Well, he wanted me to mention it. What do you feel about the fight?

[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:50.540]
What's that? I don't know the station.

[02:38:51.260 --> 02:38:55.520]
The light bulb junior, I don't know. I have no idea. Is it that 14 hundred thing?

[02:38:56.860 --> 02:38:57.820]
You're not asking me, right?

[02:38:58.400 --> 02:38:59.780]
I'm asking, I'm asking Josh.

[02:39:01.980 --> 02:39:05.760]
I'm sure Josh listens a lot to the Joyce Kaufman show and all of that stuff, right?

[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:08.900]
All the door Riley. Don't you, in your spare time?

[02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:11.880]
Oh, yeah. Probably taking notes.

[02:39:12.820 --> 02:39:17.160]
In fact, Josh, I'll probably start putting some of his own bedtime stories on the website pretty soon once we turn that over.

[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:19.960]
Keys are the kingdom over to him once Eric stops being such a hard-ass.

[02:39:20.220 --> 02:39:25.880]
I mean, I didn't say that, did I? Come on, Eric. Turn those keys over to Josh doing to help a job.

[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:30.040]
Okay, we didn't get him that computer so we can sit around and look at all kinds of crap on there.

[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:37.300]
All right. All we probably is all kinds. Well, but what retail, but not like Beaner Boy though, but we don't want to go into that.

[02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:42.560]
What retail place in South Florida? Do you hate the most? Like I said, Walmart, 192.

[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:49.740]
Believe me, when Dixie 142, Brands, Mark 72, Eckerd 72. Read it. Watch yourself.

[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:53.400]
Radio Shack 36, K-Mart 34. Rooms to go is God.

[02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:55.480]
But turn it man. Maybe it was Josh.

[02:39:56.160 --> 02:40:03.740]
Kara Circuit City 22, Home Depot 21, Best Buy 20, Bird Eye and 16, Comp USA 16, Pet Boy is 15,

[02:40:04.260 --> 02:40:11.120]
Max is Giant 12, Sam's Club 8, Lowest 4, Albertsons 4 out of 716. Got that, you found that? Yeah. Good. Right it down.

[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:15.620]
126 at 560, QIM. Press that button.

[02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:19.280]
And we got my life and law. This is for free.

[02:40:23.300 --> 02:40:24.740]
Get alive.

[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:52.460]
Don't forget author TD Alman, whose latest book, Rogue State, a murky at war with the world would be in Crowgables on Thursday, June 10th.

[02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:59.820]
That sounds like tomorrow at 6 p.m. at Books and Books. 265, Ergon Avenue. He'll discuss his work, hold a question and answer session as well as sign copies of his book.

[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:06.620]
It's a paperback at his excellent. He's also author of Miami City of the Future, a highly respected book,

[02:42:06.700 --> 02:42:11.040]
which was the best seller in Florida for more than three years. He'll be there in the Gables tomorrow night at 6 p.m. at Books and Books.

[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:15.020]
And Woody Graber will be there and go there and say, hey, Woody, look at that. Get a haircut.

[02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:20.160]
Speaking of people in South Florida, more OJ controversy says the Sun Sentinel. No.

[02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:29.200]
We've port circulated on Tuesday that OJ Simpson's attorney had saw cash as a condition for interviews on NBC Fox News Channel and court TV.

[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:33.240]
Executives at ABC and CBS yesterday confirmed that he'll go Lanter.

[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:39.220]
Simpson's attorney had approached the respective networks about interviews, though different slightly on what conditions have been set.

[02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:48.400]
According to one scenario reported in the New York Post, the Miami-based attorney reportedly sought to be retained as a consultant for 100 grand, thus circumventing network pay for play rules.

[02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:56.600]
And an ABC News spokesman said yesterday, a Glender pitch was rejected that was outside our standards. A CBS spokeswoman declined the comment.

[02:42:56.600 --> 02:43:02.100]
In a phone interview, Glender disputed the post reports on ABC's contention that he had approached them. They're full of Schmidt.

[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:11.820]
And you can quote me on that, he said. Each network request in the interview, we added saying that Katie Kourik, whose interview aired Friday, was chosen because she brings an incredible amount of credibility and stature.

[02:43:12.540 --> 02:43:16.560]
An NBC News spokeswoman said NBC News did not and never will pay for an interview.

[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:26.580]
Anyone who says otherwise is clearly disappointed that they got scooped. A Fox News Nazi News spokeswoman, a letter that not one dying was paid, and that Glender had been a frequent guest on Greta Van Sustern Brown's show.

[02:43:26.580 --> 02:43:33.700]
Where Simpson was interviewed. And you know the good news about all of that? What's that? With him appearing all over the place. I never saw one second of it.

[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:41.700]
Oh, you know me either. All right. Josh, you any of it? Now, all right. Excellent. There you go. No, OJ for us. We'll leave that to SCRUAN.

[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:49.720]
The Water Nazi. Greg, all of his other sickle fans around the QM building, all those other jock sniffers. Oh, OJ, OJ, we love you, OJ.

[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:57.320]
In fact, you know something I'm thinking that maybe SCRUAN and the Water Nazi. Well, nevertheless, I don't want to go into that. Maybe OJ can pay them a visit.

[02:43:59.140 --> 02:44:08.480]
5670560, pound, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. What retail place in South Florida? You hate the most. Not only been what about 50 hours since I took that last call.

[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:16.960]
I think that guy just kind of like soured me on calls for a. Oh, he was. He want to make me cry. That's typical. Yeah, WQAM. Hello.

[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:25.160]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, it's Robert. I've asked you this morning or George that link to that. Thank you. Thank you. I love you.

[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:32.700]
You're the one. Well, thank you. Profusely. That's the best. Oh, well, thank you for that. Where did that come from? I found it on a site called fun.org.

[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:42.580]
PHUN, six little point of sight or something. But anyway, I found the link there. And as well on there, there's a link for Bushgame.com. I don't know if you've seen this bush game, but that's.

[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:51.300]
Is that I think that's related to that Dave game.com. Well, I don't know. Yeah, probably on the web. Anyway, put my vote in for Walmart.

[02:44:51.300 --> 02:45:01.540]
I hate them profusely like poison and I would ban from one in Palm Harbor. So, why is that? Well, a little situation once when I went in there to buy some led

[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:11.380]
additive for my old car and an antique car and didn't want to sell to me. Oh, there's this law and this and that. And I got an argument with the manager and this guy and I was about 16 at the time.

[02:45:12.620 --> 02:45:16.780]
So he's asking me for my ID and I was 16, 17 forms, my shoe size, so security number.

[02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:23.260]
What other words you had to be of a certain legal age to buy led additive for the gas land in my car? What are those?

[02:45:23.380 --> 02:45:30.020]
What are those? They're Nazis. But I can go anywhere else. Auto parts store discount here there and no problem whatsoever.

[02:45:30.020 --> 02:45:35.520]
I guess you learned your lesson and go any place else. Any place else. Thanks a lot Rob. Thanks for all the good stuff.

[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:43.020]
I'll hang up on it and put him on the head. Hold on. Okay. He wanted my email because he's going to send more stuff, which is good. Great. Oh, excellent. This guy finds more stuff like that.

[02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:52.480]
If you haven't looked at that picture today of John Ascroff, man, he would be foaming at the mouth to see that for somewhere. Wow. I probably at the back. Yeah. I hear he's got a problem.

[02:45:53.780 --> 02:46:02.680]
Wait till you see that collage of naked flesh. Yeah. You can follow. Looking at all the little polywitches combines to make the push of John Ascroff.

[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:10.600]
In fact, he probably like to get that drape that cloth to like cover it over with that whole thing. Watch cloth. WQA Am hello.

[02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:20.380]
Hi, now I know. Yes sir. Great. Just wanted to ask if you hear Jeff Greenfield that it's a good thing that Reagan died when he did.

[02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:33.200]
Otherwise you'd have to hear about OJ all week long. I like that line. That was just about time he came up with something good. Okay, he got the good work. Thanks. Love you. That is a good lines for Jeff Greenfield.

[02:46:33.340 --> 02:46:44.440]
He usually has absolutely nothing to say on these certainly not news network, but that's pretty good. Good thing Reagan died so we didn't have to be in the day with OJ. See you're out of stage again. OJ. Nobody cares about your sorry old ass. Okay.

[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:56.100]
Whether it's real dark black like time, magazine made it or kind of like mocha. Nobody cares in your daughter hates you like poison and you're a real slime ball. Nobody's fooling anybody murdering piece of turd.

[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:12.980]
Even mad dog you turn to want to be a concerning with you. WQA Am hello. There's that thing again. Yeah. Just makes you kind of wonder line nine. We know who that is. WQA Am hello.

[02:47:12.980 --> 02:47:28.940]
What is it? Okay. Thank you. It was him. WQA Am hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I've been going. I saw I thought it was not on P&N today that they're thinking about naming the Pentagon after Reagan. Yes, that's correct.

[02:47:28.940 --> 02:47:39.080]
Thank you. Oh, my God. And we're going to name every street in America after Reagan to the Reagan drive Reagan Parkway, Reagan Avenue, Reagan Uranus. Everything's going to be renamed after Reagan.

[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:50.260]
Oh, that's from the guy. Thanks. Welcome to Reagan world, pal. Five six seven O five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. We thought you'd do that story about

[02:47:50.260 --> 02:48:01.620]
a general cutting losing favor in Africa. We'll get to it. WQA Am hello. I have a suggestion for your full. Yes, sir. Alex. Get off the JAPO.

[02:48:01.620 --> 02:48:02.360]
Yeah.

[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:17.600]
WQA Am hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yes, I just want to see if you read that or heard about that Al Gore speech about a week back at New York University.

[02:48:18.260 --> 02:48:28.140]
What speech was that? He gave a. How dare they drag the good name of the United States of America.

[02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:43.340]
There's a lot of Saddam Hussein's. Is that the one you're talking about? No, I don't think that was it. Oh, it's it's the text is on. I know you're not a big fan, but I'm Bruce Springsteen.net.

[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:56.640]
They have the whole copy of the speech and it's just a great speech. Just wanted to make you aware if you want to. I'm sure I'm sure that's the speech that came from. I'm positive. That's when you're talking. Yeah, but the whole the whole speech is on as on that website.

[02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:01.400]
Okay, great. It's a great speech. What is it? Springsteens.com Bruce Springsteen.net.

[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:06.660]
That net. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. See you. 20 till two at five sixty Q.A.M.

[02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:13.020]
And I'm in local. This is 420 by 60. Q.A.M.

[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:25.400]
Oh, God. What motivated me to get Hussein finally exposed my sends an ability to read. Prison's like Abu Garib were symbols of death and torture.

[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:32.100]
When you first went how to read a book, I read a set of your reader. You did it. Presenting the newest version of hooked on phonics.

[02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:45.040]
Prison's like Abu Garib were symbols of death and torture. Call now 1-800-ABC-D-E-F-G. We're making progress. Abu Gar, Abu Gar, Abu Gar, Abu Gar, Abu Gar, Abu Gar, Abu Gar, Abu, Abu, Abu, Abu, Abu, Abu, Abu Gar, Abu Gar, Abu, Abu.

[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:47.960]
144 or 560 WQM at dog at two

[02:49:49.100 --> 02:49:50.580]
Laura Bush opposed to

[02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:56.000]
Stemsel research expansion that that's the way just leaves me flowed, you know

[02:49:56.900 --> 02:50:00.320]
These we want to just puke and he roll over the plate. What did you expect?

[02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:04.540]
The least shut up or yeah, okay, at least don't send us an haul

[02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:12.680]
So in other words if this comes to a vote and Congress in house and Senate pass it over when we he's gonna veto that is that what they're telling us

[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:13.420]
Wow

[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:15.580]
It's pretty on good

[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:24.040]
General cutting shows signs of losing favor in Africa. There are some good news. Oh man

[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:30.120]
And Sino Shuriye still remembers the price he felt years ago when she leaned over each of her three daughters

[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:33.720]
knife in hand and sliced into their genitals

[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:40.740]
Each time as the blood started to flow she quickly dropped the knife and picked up a needle and thread quickly

[02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:43.740]
expertly she sold her daughters vagina's almost shut

[02:50:45.180 --> 02:50:49.640]
I was full of pride she be called recently. I felt like I was doing the right thing in the eyes of God

[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:53.300]
I was preparing them for the marriage by sealing their vaginas

[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:59.540]
Now she feels like a butcher a sinner a mother who harmed her own flesh and blood not to mention the thousands of other girls

[02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:05.300]
She says she circumcised in the last quarter of a century as part of a traditional right still common in Africa by the way

[02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:07.920]
Slightly

[02:51:07.920 --> 02:51:11.180]
General cutting is losing favor. It's losing its grip

[02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:18.160]
Parliaments are passing laws forbidding the practice which causes widespread death and death and this figure

[02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:21.820]
When girls are fleeing their homes to keep their vaginas intact wouldn't you?

[02:51:22.340 --> 02:51:30.160]
Yeah, I had one and the women who have been curing out the cutting and who have been revered by the communities for doing so every game to lay down their knives

[02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:32.800]
Remember that's all by the court. That's lay down your knives. No, it wouldn't

[02:51:33.710 --> 02:51:35.770]
Miss a vegetable cabrindas

[02:51:35.770 --> 02:51:40.110]
Miss Shury a not only mother of eight is known far and wide in northeastern Kenya Kenya

[02:51:40.110 --> 02:51:45.570]
Can you believe it for her expertise is a genital cutter is one of them? Well, what do you do for living? I'm a genital cutter

[02:51:46.870 --> 02:51:48.510]
The gentle genital cutter

[02:51:49.290 --> 02:51:54.870]
When local members of woman kind Kenya a grassroots group opposing the practice visited Miss Shury is hot outside

[02:51:54.870 --> 02:51:57.730]
Garisa two years ago. She chased him off her property

[02:51:58.610 --> 02:52:03.970]
This was something her mother had done before she started as an apprentice while still an adolescent by holding down

[02:52:03.970 --> 02:52:06.650]
Girls legs for her mother to perform the right which opponents call

[02:52:06.650 --> 02:52:11.190]
General mutilation. I thought my mother would curse me from the grave if I didn't carry on the traditions

[02:52:11.190 --> 02:52:16.250]
She said it was a tradition in the family kind of like you know with a mafia they carried on from one generation to another

[02:52:17.390 --> 02:52:21.890]
The retangible benefits as well. She had pressed each and her community earned a good income more than her husband

[02:52:21.890 --> 02:52:24.390]
It is a camel herder before we doubt if tuberculosis

[02:52:25.570 --> 02:52:29.010]
She said she had no use for those people who came around denouncing her way of life

[02:52:29.010 --> 02:52:30.710]
But her opponents were determined a lot

[02:52:30.710 --> 02:52:36.510]
They knew that Miss Shury was one of the longest serving genital cutters around and that she held sway over the community

[02:52:36.510 --> 02:52:43.530]
If only she could be converted they figure others would certainly follow Miss Shury a frail but feisty grandma who wraps her head in colorful smathas

[02:52:43.530 --> 02:52:47.430]
Was rather sent in her ways again in the game. She refused to hear their arguments

[02:52:48.190 --> 02:52:53.470]
It was so difficult to change her mind since Sophia Abdi Nour the founder of woman kind Kenya which worked with the

[02:52:53.470 --> 02:52:59.450]
Ethnic Somalis who live in Kenya's rugged northeastern province and is attracted local supporters throughout the region

[02:52:59.450 --> 02:53:02.250]
We knew she was respected. We wanted her on our side

[02:53:03.170 --> 02:53:07.450]
Finally the anti-cutting advocates tried a different tack. They showed up with religious leaders

[02:53:07.450 --> 02:53:10.290]
Miss Shury a religious Muslim could not chase them away

[02:53:10.830 --> 02:53:16.690]
She sat down with some influential clerics in her community who come to the realization that the division was harmful and not dictated by her

[02:53:16.690 --> 02:53:18.610]
Consistent with the teachings of the Quran

[02:53:19.790 --> 02:53:23.210]
The imams denounced the practice they told her that they vagina was part of the body

[02:53:23.210 --> 02:53:28.810]
Just as important in the eyes of God as an eye a finger or a limb in fact some of you guys probably think even more important

[02:53:28.810 --> 02:53:35.910]
Yeah, cutting it they argued in their long session outside her home is a sin cut it out when it doubt cut it out

[02:53:35.910 --> 02:53:42.370]
They went even further they told her that her sins required her compensate the girl she had maimed each of them was do 80 camels

[02:53:42.370 --> 02:53:43.950]
They said but spoke is bad for you wow

[02:53:47.970 --> 02:53:48.330]
each

[02:53:48.330 --> 02:53:49.770]
Each of them was do 80 camels

[02:53:49.770 --> 02:53:53.530]
Miss Shury a prosperous by local standards, but not that prosperous was shaken

[02:53:53.530 --> 02:53:58.750]
She sobbed then she prayed finally she pleaded with the imams for a way out of her impossible situation

[02:53:58.750 --> 02:54:03.690]
They said the only way to avoid paying the compensation was to seek the forgiveness of each of the girls she had cut

[02:54:04.310 --> 02:54:06.630]
This is when she turned from a cutter to an active opponent

[02:54:06.630 --> 02:54:10.430]
She began making house calls on the girls from an undergone or knife many of them were women now

[02:54:10.430 --> 02:54:14.690]
She explained her conversion and pleaded for their forgiveness. She cried each time she said

[02:54:15.290 --> 02:54:16.190]
Why did she we

[02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:21.070]
Because camels are cancer sticks and they'll kill you

[02:54:21.830 --> 02:54:24.410]
Especially 80 of them. I like this article

[02:54:25.710 --> 02:54:29.590]
Oh, you're not gonna read anymore from capital Hill blue no less thanks again to Eric for finding that website

[02:54:29.590 --> 02:54:32.830]
Man, that's great. We got a link to it now in the whole deal capital Hill blue

[02:54:33.850 --> 02:54:38.050]
On the day George Tennant resigned as director of the CIA his counterpart on the domestic side

[02:54:38.050 --> 02:54:43.770]
FBI director Robert Mueller was asking Congress to consider creating a new agency within his own to handle all the homeland counterintelligence

[02:54:43.770 --> 02:54:44.450]
Activities

[02:54:45.090 --> 02:54:49.890]
The Mueller proposal was actually offered by representative frank wolf of Virginia republic in several months ago

[02:54:49.890 --> 02:54:55.410]
As a means of preserving the bureau's counterintelligence responsibilities rather than creating an entirely new agency

[02:54:55.410 --> 02:55:00.430]
Pattern after Britain's MI5 which the FBI and the district department opposed for quite obvious reasons

[02:55:00.430 --> 02:55:05.270]
The MI5 proposal would diminish the bureau's power and relegate it to just another law enforcement agency

[02:55:05.270 --> 02:55:10.490]
Which is what primarily it is anyway wolf cheers the House appropriation subcommittee that oversees the FBI

[02:55:10.490 --> 02:55:15.970]
And would lose some power and influence of the bureau's downsides. It's a good bet the FBI had a hand in hatching his plan

[02:55:15.970 --> 02:55:20.490]
But as the mistakes pile up it's becoming more and more evident that the bureau may be incapable of

[02:55:20.490 --> 02:55:24.050]
smoothing out its intelligence collecting wrinkles and just establish an independent

[02:55:24.810 --> 02:55:28.150]
Director it for that task within and so on borders would do nothing to solve the problem

[02:55:28.590 --> 02:55:34.130]
The two latest public highly publicized goofs came in a false fingerprint ID in the spanish bombing case poor guy

[02:55:35.110 --> 02:55:39.190]
Setting up a new bureau within the bureau would allow Mueller once again to add to the FBI's numbers

[02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:44.210]
The force already has nearly 12,000 agents and thousands technicians clerks and support personnel

[02:55:44.210 --> 02:55:50.330]
Will create a bureaucracy within a bureaucracy and probably result in worse rather than better cooperation with other federal and state local agencies

[02:55:50.330 --> 02:55:54.690]
After all of this crap with 9-11 and we're gonna cut that out and no more this not committing it

[02:55:54.690 --> 02:55:56.590]
There's still the same thing. They're all protecting their own turf

[02:55:57.770 --> 02:55:59.590]
How can you say that because it's true

[02:55:59.590 --> 02:55:59.830]
Ha

[02:56:02.230 --> 02:56:08.350]
Take a look at that pool what retail place in South Florida do you hate the most the spies at Walmart 208

[02:56:08.350 --> 02:56:12.610]
But when Dixie are very surprisingly strong second 158 aren't you a little bit surprised?

[02:56:14.270 --> 02:56:15.230]
No actually

[02:56:15.850 --> 02:56:21.790]
Does the word schmutz come to your mind? We think of Dixie spend the long times since I've been in one right those for good reason

[02:56:21.790 --> 02:56:27.510]
Yeah, clean up your act when Dixie once upon a time they were the store back in the day, right

[02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:32.010]
Walmart 208 when Dixie 158 Eckerd 77 we hate them

[02:56:32.710 --> 02:56:39.790]

[02:57:02.150 --> 02:57:06.170]
Hey, you know, this is a me would have been a big star by now

It's a bit sweet voice and you can't take it anywhere a little beauty

[02:57:10.090 --> 02:57:12.370]
We take you

[02:57:19.250 --> 02:57:19.910]
Yeah

Hey

[02:57:51.910 --> 02:57:53.270]
I

[02:57:53.270 --> 02:58:03.610]
I know my smell attracts you, but unlike that you, you still got such a...

[02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:13.390]
I feel just like that you are my brother, and one year to another.

[02:58:15.690 --> 02:58:17.270]
That's why you're so much higher.

[02:58:22.530 --> 02:58:27.370]
The joy, joy, joy, joy.

[02:58:28.930 --> 02:58:31.230]
The joy, joy, joy, joy.

The joy, joy, joy, joy.

[02:58:36.630 --> 02:58:43.230]
I'm on a show and with you in a cowboy.

[02:58:43.950 --> 02:58:44.290]
Yes.

[02:58:44.290 --> 02:58:46.710]
It's great to let so many.

[02:58:47.890 --> 02:58:49.250]
All right, that's enough.

[02:58:50.250 --> 02:58:51.410]
Oh, what a good fight.

[02:58:51.410 --> 02:58:53.390]
I've got a call here in the number one rating.

[02:58:53.590 --> 02:58:54.990]
And Moe Hallett and David are in his own.

[02:58:55.210 --> 02:58:57.090]
At least according to my aspirations.

[02:58:57.430 --> 02:58:57.910]
So what?

[02:58:58.090 --> 02:58:58.850]
Stay away from me.

[02:58:58.950 --> 02:59:00.390]
I don't even hire you up children.

[02:59:00.770 --> 02:59:01.490]
Birabah, hello.

[02:59:01.670 --> 02:59:04.330]
I want to take on J. Bieber.

[02:59:04.530 --> 02:59:06.030]
Oh, J. Bieber.

[02:59:06.650 --> 02:59:08.710]
Is that great, Kodab? I can a good joke.

[02:59:08.950 --> 02:59:10.450]
I like J. Bieber.

[02:59:11.210 --> 02:59:15.450]
Well, not to mention, he's got extraordinary, never-lease smooth beatboxes.

[02:59:16.370 --> 02:59:17.010]
Oh, yeah.

[02:59:17.150 --> 02:59:18.650]
You're going to be good for what you say here.

[02:59:18.690 --> 02:59:19.370]
Oh, shit, though.

[02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:20.350]
Thank you, Moe.

[02:59:20.410 --> 02:59:21.310]
No, no, no, wait a minute.

[02:59:21.410 --> 02:59:21.750]
Go, go.

[02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:24.030]
But I have nothing else to say.

[02:59:24.250 --> 02:59:24.750]
Look at that.

[02:59:24.750 --> 02:59:25.290]
How about this?

[02:59:25.630 --> 02:59:27.350]
How's the weather down there in the mirror, Moe?

[02:59:27.390 --> 02:59:29.030]
I'm right down the street from you.

[02:59:29.110 --> 02:59:30.690]
I have to go.

[02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.950]
Oh, wait.

[02:59:31.290 --> 02:59:31.870]
By the way, something.

[02:59:31.890 --> 02:59:34.190]
No, I have to go.

[02:59:34.310 --> 02:59:35.090]
Look, I tell you what.

[02:59:35.310 --> 02:59:36.450]
I'll hold you over the break.

[02:59:36.570 --> 02:59:36.910]
How's that?

[02:59:37.490 --> 02:59:39.570]
I'll give you one of my old tank t-shirts.

[02:59:39.570 --> 02:59:40.190]
Just that.

[02:59:40.770 --> 02:59:41.750]
No, hey!

[02:59:42.030 --> 02:59:44.010]
That was the only color we had.

[02:59:44.190 --> 02:59:46.590]
The things on your nose is blowing again.

[02:59:46.930 --> 02:59:48.370]
It's blowing, it's blowing, it's blowing.

[02:59:49.830 --> 02:59:51.330]
It's blowing, it's blowing.

[02:59:52.870 --> 02:59:53.370]
It's blowing.

[02:59:53.370 --> 02:59:54.050]
It's blowing, it's blowing.

[02:59:54.630 --> 02:59:56.770]
It's blowing, it's blowing.

[02:59:56.910 --> 02:59:57.230]
Wow!

[02:59:57.730 --> 03:00:00.690]
We got things with all things.

[03:00:01.890 --> 03:00:04.350]
I can know that I can face.

[03:00:05.210 --> 03:00:08.190]
And around those posing pimples.

[03:00:08.190 --> 03:00:09.650]
You're crazy.

[03:00:09.910 --> 03:00:10.670]
Wow!

[03:00:10.910 --> 03:00:11.010]
Wow!

[03:00:11.650 --> 03:00:11.650]

[03:00:11.770 --> 03:00:15.830]
If you go look at the fear I don't see.

[03:00:16.530 --> 03:00:19.010]
A road map of the obsolence.

[03:00:20.270 --> 03:00:21.890]
You got your heavy sun.

[03:00:22.650 --> 03:00:25.150]
Way to die, die, die, die.

[03:00:25.430 --> 03:00:25.670]
Wow!

[03:00:26.210 --> 03:00:29.190]
My nose glows when something steams.

[03:00:30.350 --> 03:00:32.790]
Almost every day I see.

[03:00:33.490 --> 03:00:36.430]
And my veins as many start to tickle.

[03:00:37.430 --> 03:00:40.130]
I had the noise, the door to door is yours.

[03:00:40.610 --> 03:00:44.230]
Yeah, I've pulled like a falling apart.

[03:00:45.230 --> 03:00:47.910]
And my heart's all cramped in your fire.

[03:00:48.810 --> 03:00:52.330]
The way that I don't get spilled with people's veins.

[03:00:53.210 --> 03:00:58.410]
And in life I'm too hot to see.

[03:00:59.390 --> 03:01:02.690]
And science cannot describe where we are.

[03:01:02.690 --> 03:01:06.510]
I know I'm bleeding, I pull pain.

[03:01:07.690 --> 03:01:08.010]
I'm bleeding, I pull pain.

[03:01:08.050 --> 03:01:12.050]
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding.

[03:01:12.070 --> 03:01:14.070]
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding.

[03:01:14.790 --> 03:01:19.450]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:01:22.950 --> 03:01:24.450]
I'm flying, I'm flying.

[03:01:24.470 --> 03:01:27.630]
You see that great looking piece of ass over there in Section 127?

[03:01:28.210 --> 03:01:28.670]
Oh!
