[00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.740]
I'm sorry.

[00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.780]
I didn't get started yet.

[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.120]
Goodbye.

[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.240]
Goodbye.

[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.260]
Goodbye.

[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.660]
Goodbye.

[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.180]
Did you see our ratings for the last book?

[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.480]
Yeah, I know what that is.

[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.980]
Sure.

[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.700]
Couldn't possibly be us.

[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.920]
Watch your backs, Zach.

[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.520]
When you won't wait for no more.

[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.940]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.240]
Watch your backs, Zach.

[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.860]
When you won't wait for no more.

[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.560]
Oh, no, no, no.

[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.020]
I got enough.

[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.220]
I got to think about it,

[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.480]
at the top.

[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.160]
I get in the rate.

[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.740]
And I don't need a rating that's a minus eight.

[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.240]
Don't care what you do.

[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.460]
Long as the sun does snow,

[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.300]
you got to wake a little hotter on the guests you love.

[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.140]
A ruse you've got to go.

[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.900]
There's a lot of fat producers, you know.

[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.840]
That's right.

[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.980]
Watch your backs, Zach.

[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.040]
When you won't wait for no more.

[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.040]
No more, no more, no more, no more.

[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.440]
Watch your backs, Zach.

[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.280]
When you won't wait for no more.

[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.860]
Oh, I brought a whole lot of love, I don't understand.

[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.900]
Now you can eat from a trough while you're in both areas.

[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.720]
That big, that touch you made a rating small.

[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420]
You just like clinton, it's all you are for.

[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.460]
And it's straightened your fat ass out.

[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.860]
That's right.

[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.160]
Watch your backs, Zach.

[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.240]
When you won't wait for no more.

[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.880]
No more, no more, no more, no more.

[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.500]
Watch your backs, Zach.

[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.700]
When you won't wait for no more.

[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.620]
Listen what we say.

[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.860]
When you're back, Zach.

[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.020]
When you won't wait for no more.

[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.160]
No more, no more, no more, no more.

[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.420]
Watch your backs, Zach.

[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.520]
When you won't wait for no more.

[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.580]
You'll play out.

[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.540]
Yeah, lucky enough.

[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.620]
I'll play out.

[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.260]
And I want more time in your life.

[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.840]
I'll play out.

[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.440]
It never ends if Kiuya and boys and girls hit never ends.

[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.580]
The hits, the schmit's just keep on coming.

[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.680]
Yeah.

[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.440]
Zach gets blown off the morning show, the Mohawar David had shown.

[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.360]
Now, did you give me some bum information about that?

[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.980]
Is that correct?

[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.280]
I gave you no bum information.

[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.140]
Because he's still there.

[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.000]
See, nobody actually ever gets completely fired at Kiuya and we're talking about this before the show.

[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]
People there for the time being, he's still there on Joe's show, right?

[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.420]
Well, what do you mean for the time being?

[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.900]
What does that mean?

[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.440]
In other words, they don't have a replacement lined up.

[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.880]
So he's just, you know, he's a lame duck, coasted along.

[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.760]
Still doing the job until they can find replaced it.

[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.100]
Hey, you better book up on that free food in the morning there's Zach.

[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.740]
Not that you need extra encouragement from me, but I really take advantage of that.

[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.880]
Because you could see some lean times.

[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.860]
He could be doing some lean cuisine for months and years to come.

[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.680]
Yeah, I keep trying to tell you folks.

[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.140]
You won't believe me.

[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.560]
In fact, Geltie was just, in a first time I spoke to Geltie in quite a while before the show.

[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.000]
I said, what do you really think about Mohawar?

[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.120]
And he said, he's an asshole.

[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.500]
Yeah.

[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.080]
He wants off that Joe bad.

[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.520]
He wants to be on with his buddy Joe.

[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.420]
The only problem is Mohawar is ready to blow him out yet.

[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.380]
And he said, he said, not out.

[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.500]
He said he blew me, but not out.

[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.280]
I'm going to leave that poll up there a little while longer to give Mohawar a chance to pass that encoder.

[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.880]
Now that you people are starting to see your little slow on the uptake.

[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.860]
You think that it's stick.

[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.420]
You think we're exaggerating.

[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.400]
You think it's like a personal thing.

[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.540]
It's, it's just the fact.

[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.620]
It's just true.

[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.160]
I've never encountered anybody like this.

[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.820]
Not just in radio in my life.

[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:22.500]
If anybody is divisive and hateful and obnoxious and can tankerous and whiny and bitchy and he's like a bitchy old queen is what he is like a bitchy old lady, the moment.

[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.400]
You do raise the bar.

[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.360]
Absolutely.

[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.980]
He sure does.

[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.240]
He is just a piece of turd on two legs.

[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.460]
First it was, let's see, it was Carolyn and then it was the beast and then it was a, and now it's Zach and how many others have been through it.

[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.400]
See, nobody wants to work with him and nobody is good enough for him.

[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.140]
So it's a match made in a rubber fever.

[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.960]
He's bailing out.

[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.040]
He's been on the station in the city in years.

[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.960]
About third man.

[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.380]
No, I don't think he's been there 30 years.

[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.460]
I think it's more like about.

[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.700]
Yeah.

[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.300]
Yeah.

[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.820]
But anyway, it's been a long time.

[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.040]
And he's bailing out because he can't handle a man.

[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.260]
It's just, I mean, what kind of crap is this?

[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.960]
What kind of a business operation is it when you got one guy who's a find everybody else is the scapegoat?

[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.200]
And I don't know what he's scapegoat now for the, I guess it's just like anticipatory.

[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.920]
Because the book doesn't come out until a week from tomorrow.

[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.980]
We're the ones that are going to take it up the SNF book.

[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.400]
It's going to be really bad midday.

[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.500]
We already know that.

[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.420]
It's going to be weak.

[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.960]
But he's already covering his ass just in case he's really weak himself in here because he knows for Elle got blown out.

[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.800]
So that's going to like bring him right back down where he belongs and those two and three share numbers.

[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.860]
So now let's have blow out Zach.

[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.880]
He's not good enough for me.

[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.500]
And he, I want my own producer.

[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.060]
I want somebody dedicated to this show.

[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.960]
I don't want somebody who hangs around with Joe Rose and is on all these other shows.

[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.000]
I want somebody who's going to do the Mohawar David a show and be dedicated to me and give me the best guests and do all of this good stuff.

[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.880]
And maybe a superstar that I really should be.

[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.920]
Oh look at that.

[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.100]
He just hopped ahead and colder.

[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.140]
All right. Nice going guys.

[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.860]
All right.

[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.300]
Oh, what a piece of crap man.

[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.660]
And the bad part, the worst part of the whole deal is that our impotent management they just kind of like lay back like a Lala landed.

[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.660]
Let him just run rough shot over everybody else's life.

[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.320]
They don't give a crap.

[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.060]
And because Zach who happens to be a good guy by the way, even though he's gigantic and fat.

[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.920]
Because of the fact that he's not part of Clarence's inner circle of boyfriends there, that's the reason that he can get blown out.

[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.260]
And he's going to be looking for another job.

[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.980]
See, unless it's Robert Gryper or the Beast, I mean you haven't got a trineman's chance in here because that's Clarence's bunk butt buddies.

[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.820]
That's his boyfriends.

[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.500]
And so he'll go to great lengths to protect them and move them around from one show to another show to make sure that they stay on a payroll like Sam.

[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.760]
Things like that.

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.860]
And Donnie B.

[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.980]
Oh yeah, there's people that have been in the building in five to seven years.

[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.060]
They're still on the payroll there.

[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.040]
You wonder why the beesleys are crap in their pants?

[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.220]
That's the Greg Reed fugin way.

[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.240]
So anyway, I guess we can give the results of yesterday's poll now that we finally got Moa hopped ahead of Anne Coder on there and deservedly so.

[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.620]
Poll question wise, politicians excluded what well known living person.

[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.860]
Would you love what well known living person's grave?

[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.480]
Would you love to dance on?

[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.100]
A lot of dancing going on.

[00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.800]
I'll tell you that.

[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.120]
Rush Limbaugh wins.

[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.900]
I mean, there is nobody like Rush.

[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.080]
He wins hands down your old pantaloonies hands in the old pill jar man.

[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.340]
There's nobody even close.

[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.660]
I'm up.

[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.480]
I'm up.

[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.700]

[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.320]
I'm up.

[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.720]
I'm up.

[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.540]
I'm up.

[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.860]
I'm up.

[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.400]
I'm up.

[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.760]
I'm up.

[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.500]
I'm up.

[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.040]
I'm up.

[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.320]
I'm up.

[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.700]
I'm up.

[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.700]

[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.700]

[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.420]
I'm up.

[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.920]
I'm up.

[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.960]
I'm up.

[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.960]

[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.760]
I'm up.

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.760]

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.760]

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.760]

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.760]

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.080]
Oh, Jay Simpson 207.

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.800]
Now in previous days, I guess before the Pill incident, I think OJ might have come out on top, don't you?

[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.260]
Moa Howard David, like I said, hopped right over Anne Coder.

[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.740]
They're all words changing again on me.

[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.900]
He better not fall back.

[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.660]
Uh-oh.

[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.440]
Now they're in a frenzy.

[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.760]
Okay.

[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.840]
Now he pulled away.

[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.780]
Now that they heard about what he did.

[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.320]

On the morning we're David to show they just falling like flies on there because nobody is good enough and guilty wants off of their real bed

[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.400]
We thought that's how the image holds that bit

[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.820]
Yeah, watch your back so I couldn't that something weren't we a little pressure to be playing that for a long time

[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:43.840]
That wasn't based on you know, we just pulled that out of our ass. We heard the rumbling back then absolutely because

[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.580]
You know, that's always looking for a scapegoat nobody has ever got enough to work with the the moment

[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.360]
They might have to bring somebody in from out of the market for both the producer and

[00:10:53.900 --> 00:11:00.160]
Maybe in the position maybe on the rover can find somebody on Mars. It's good enough to work with mom. Oh

[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:00.460]
Oh, man

[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.180]
Maybe they'll find somebody

[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.940]
In the ghetto

[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.080]
On a rock

[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.200]
Our audience hates Elvis so I don't know what they're on doing but that facts inspired me to kill some good time

You know who I am I'm the king of paradise

[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.880]
I came down here after losing my child

[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.820]
To be a big fish

[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.800]
In a little pond

[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.940]
When they kicked me off the espion they told me don't come back again

[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.520]
I had some problems with wise guys who advised I move to paradise

[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.180]
Fire

[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.900]
That day late all the way nine

[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.340]
I was fucking you're out of fire and I hope that just goes like dice

[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.180]
I hope he dies and I hope you all die

[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.900]
I'm a big fish in a little pond to see you

[00:15:51.660 --> 00:16:07.880]
I think fish in a little pond

[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.720]
Find the angel in disguise is because there's no such song and I knew there was no such song. It's called

[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.180]
See in disguise how do you like that? I got some songs that he didn't even record yet

[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.000]
Yeah, that he's still working on like that one at they were least in Germany that they went to the top of the church

[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.900]
What was that awful song conversation?

[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.640]
Yeah a little less conversation a little masturbation a little palpitation a little crepitation

[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.660]
See the reason I can't remember song titles like that anymore is because

[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.300]
I

[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.060]
Like you guys the bit title and I see that's wrong

[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.300]
Anyway a bad news to start we'll get it out of the way

[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.000]
Because Americans we don't want to hear no bad news no more a US black-oct military helicopter came down

[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.060]
There's a volatile town of Fallujah west of Baghdad today killing all nine people on board US military said first

[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.140]
It said eight I think the store on our website says eight when outs nine

[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.800]
Helicopter made an emergency landing near Fallujah

[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:07.560]
There were four pastures and five crew members on board no survivors a military spokeswoman said she said the black hawk was on a medical evac

[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.500]
Evacuation mission when it came down noted tales of the pastures. She didn't know if it was hit by enemy fire and

[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.640]
anti-American insurgents fired mortar rounds at a military camp killing one American soldier wounding 34 others

[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.400]
Around 645 last night at logistical base sites west of Baghdad

[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.640]
So there you go. They keep on dropping like flies over there and

[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.920]
Public is it more like that? Oh look at that. That was up again. Yeah, and once that michael tangent for our start and all this other crap

[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.060]
You know there's there's no point because like I said you're preaching to choir

[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.560]
And now this whole dean thing is looks like it may come on rambling at the last second here big time

[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.640]
They've been attacking and and the new Republican dorses jew Lieberman

[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.200]
Which is just really staggering. I mean I must be doing real big mushrooms over there. It's unbelievable

[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.620]
On a more positive note

[00:17:54.620 --> 00:18:00.320]
For sure. Well, I was speaking of devil ed disguise. What a perfect day if I were one of them believe in folks

[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.300]
If I were a man of the cloth so to speak

[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.640]
If I really believed in hell there's a special place in hell for you mo

[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.140]
Make no mistake about that you make Pete Bolger look like a good Samiritan by comparison and that's saying a lot

[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:12.380]
Yeah

[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.720]
Because he's the assassin but you make him look like a piker like a beginner like a Sunday school kid

[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.440]
And the antics that you and of course muff comes in and plays stupila. Oh here

[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.520]
He fired Zach off his show all clearance didn't tell me that

[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.260]
I guess maybe he was like sleeping. There's probably a little bit of pillow talk going on there

[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.820]
But maybe you know what one in one ear and out the other ear. I said

[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.700]
Look at that 115 votes for the moment on there right now

[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.860]
Is somebody who they like to dance under his grave. I'll tell you one thing. You'll have to push me out of the way

[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.000]
And it won't be easy

[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.340]
No, I got first dibs on that

[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.920]
I'll be dancing up a storm on I'll be doing the masked

[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.280]
Taters on his grave about if we just hold the date

[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.440]
What I'm gonna do is eat a bunch of mashed taters before I do it and then drop a load right on his

[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.260]
Tombstone you piece of crap in fact you know

[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.940]
I'm gonna eat a whole bunch of tombstone pizza

[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.440]
That'll do it

[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.820]
And I think that'll come you all up

[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.420]
Anyway speaking of food here's the fact that says heard you talking about the new subway wraps

[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.760]
And they're great, but I found an even better solution to my new low carb dance is my you know the low carb thing now

[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.280]
I saw a piece on one of the newscast last night might have been CBS news

[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.600]
And uh every damn restaurant that's ever come down the pipe now

[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.040]
I don't think it was apple bees, but it was one of those similar kind of chains

[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.900]
And now even McDonald's and Burger King are are uh they're mulling over like I told you about the subway thing

[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.140]
Mm-hmm do in a low carb menu

[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.400]
Anyway, it says I found an even better solution to my no low a low carb that blimpie. Oh, I hate blimpies, don't you?

[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.260]
I can't remember the last time or the film I ate it

[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.660]
Blimpies has come out with a new low carb menu that's got sandwiches and wraps

[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.580]
But unlike subway they've also got low carb chips desserts a great zero-carb brownie and even low carb drink

[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.260]
Like I said, I love blimpies

[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.920]
Says I'm kind of new to low carb things so when I went to subway I found the other

[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.420]
Other than the wrap they don't have anything else bake lays have 25 grams of carbs for god's sake

[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.660]
Oh, yeah, don't be eating them tater chips new. Oh, yeah, I had a low carb wrap with a bunch of

[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.460]
chips. No, that's not gonna cut it

[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:14.040]
It says that blimpie I had a lot more choices and the food was awesome. Give it a try. It says Mike. Be thanks

[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.020]
Mike will give it a shot

[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.660]
In fact, maybe when I'm there blimpies will bring in some low-carb stuff although we don't want no food, but no

[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:25.100]
Anyway for the passions crowd. I just looked on their website. I don't want possessed me to do that

[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.360]
The power prize. I'm a I'm a day ahead here with a global hazard they had

[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.520]
Uh, let's see Thursday January the 8th K learns of charities deal with death. I saw that yesterday

[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.260]
Simone John Reese and Jessica

[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:43.820]
Which that isn't the real Reese. That's his twin brother the actor prepare for a ski trip and Alistair is a place with the progress of his plan

[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.080]
Good old Alistair

[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.760]
Tomorrow K demands that Ivy get help get her Miguel

[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.400]
Gwen is suspicious of Ethan and Sheridan is a piece with baby Martin interarms

[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.740]
Well, that's gonna be maybe something because she's in a straight jacket and they got her locked in the old nut house again

[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:07.040]
Monday Whitney comes face to face with Chad and next Thursday a week from today Luis sneaks into seats Sheridan

[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.420]
He's in the loony bin

[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.540]
At the direction of her father Alistair

[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.560]
We never we have a character around passions that you never see his face

[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:20.940]
Okay, let me see the back of his head and usually his suit and also his a big fat chubby hands always with us

[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.200]
A cigar a lit cigar

[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.420]
It's just part of the insanity of the show you have to be there

[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:33.960]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT and T look at that one 16 from Mo pulling away from encoder like she's laying still

[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.140]
Here's today's pool. I love this pool. I was inspired by that one bit that bokeh brine bit

[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:40.960]
Which one is it?

[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:42.600]
Oh

[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:48.060]
In what American city will you find the highest percentage of goobers now if you don't know what a goob

[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.120]
Is and when I'm talking about the ones you eat at the movies

[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.680]
If you don't know what goobers then you're not qualified to vote on this polar participate

[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.760]
Okay, in what American city will you find the highest percentage of goobers

[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.760]
Who put the goober in goobin atori? That's another bit that he's got that in there for Ann about that

[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.920]
What bit is that tell Hatsunati? Oh, yeah, let's play that soon

[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:14.280]
I'm kidding. That's beyond the list so far and of course there's zillions of others because America generally speaking is a goober-filled country

[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.200]
Tampa that was my first choice by far

[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:24.340]
I mean I can you just have to really search high and loadify anybody even looks like they've got all the right parts to be qualified to be human in Tampa

[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.160]
It's really bizarre

[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.420]
Tampa which is strange because they got those good restaurants in like Bernstake House and

[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.480]
Donatello's and a lot of good the eats over there, but I guess mostly the tourists are eating them

[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.220]
Nashville you'll just love Nashville

[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.500]
And the George votes for Jacksonville those are the first three

[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.840]
Been through there drove through new ball county real fast many years ago never stopped

[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.220]
Never stopped for a snack or two or like a little a verbal intercourse

[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.880]
Here's the fact that says early this morning Mo accidentally said

[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.600]
When referring to how many complete games the baseball player from the blacksocks had thought it would make a good drop straight

[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.840]
out of the horses ass

[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.580]
Happened around five o'clock or so

[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:07.060]
Well, we got bigger fridge to fry with Mo today because he blew Zach off the morning show

[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.420]
So Zach ain't good enough for him nobody is good enough for the moment

[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.260]
And the ironic part of the whole deal is the one that wants off there the worst

[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.200]
Well, Robert Creeper wants off too, which is why he's leaving the station soon

[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.520]
But the one that wants off there desperately the worst is guilty and he don't want to blow him out yet

[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.020]
I asked guilty this morning. He don't want to blow you and he said no

[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.900]
I said I wish he'd blow me out

[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.520]
That's exactly and you were there that's exactly what he said

[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.700]
Come on Mo blow guilty out of there. He wants to be back with his buddy Joe and away from your smell

[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.260]
He asked these tear to looking out your bag twice a morning too

[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:43.580]
26 past 10 at five 60 WQ might just can't outweigh to be back with all my close personal friends and I

[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.920]
Oh, man, the atmosphere the ambiance in that building

[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.780]
Feel the love feel the love I'm feeling it now

[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:51.720]
Oh

[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.500]
It now so was that actually still in the building?

[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.020]
He pop his head in there or what what's it?

[00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:01.280]
Oh, I don't know if he's here right now, but I'm sure I heard him there toward the end of Joe show

[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.060]
He popped his head in the beginning when you played the bit. Well, there you go. See he's still around

[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.100]
He'll be there. He'll be okay. Actually what the deal is he's not gonna be on the payroll

[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:14.280]
No, but he's gonna be allowed to come and eat to free food every morning. So that's okay. It's all he cares about anyway

[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.800]
It's the last mortgage you'll ever need the only one mortgage from financial group the benefits are incredible

[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:26.280]
Like I said zero closing costs zero application fee zero credit bureau fee zero discounted points

[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:32.580]
Get the new low interest rate of just one point 25 percent if you have a hundred thousand dollar loan your payments are a mirror

[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.960]
Three hundred and thirty four bucks a month if you have you a two hundred thousand dollar loan your payments are only

[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.200]
Six sixty eight a month the North forget once you refinance or get you a new home mortgage from financial group

[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.620]
You will never pay closing costs again

[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:48.180]
So find out all about it by calling one eight hundred nine four o'lenn get the low rate mortgage you deserve

[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:54.520]
And then move to your next property with any further cost or expense zero underwriting fee zero doc fee zero closing cost

[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.000]
Even when you move to another property get the new low rate financing

[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.440]
It's just one point twenty five percent with the only one mortgage from financial group for details

[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.520]
You know what to do call one eight hundred nine four o'lenn did never ever never pay closing costs again

[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:13.940]
The financial group at one eight hundred nine four o'lenn be sure and tell them that the fashionable Todd Dreck told you to call

[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:19.660]
The Renekville housing lender restrictions apply rate subject to change monthly four point two one APR

[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:24.620]
Five and a local this is five six years the rate is all yours

[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.220]
You

[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:26.980]
Spiderman

[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.520]
Got sat down in the fight

[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:40.340]
And he looked really weird with long hair and beard he was

[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.640]
Fighting just like a mole

[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:53.340]
Take a sip smell the stench you might almost think you French his facial hair is not so nice check your care fully for life

[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.700]
There goes the great seductive

[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.640]
Yeah, the doctor said

[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.880]
But done open wide

[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.240]
But he couldn't find anywhere

[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.440]
Inside

[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:14.860]
Spider-hole spider-hole that is where we found this troll raises hands and weapons out very soon

[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.860]
He will rock and help and last

[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:23.660]
President Bush is so glad because they found this gong back down in the spider-hole

[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.560]
Do you think when I kept going on looking and looking and looking down his push that they were looking for weapons of

[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.100]
Mastication

[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:36.420]
Oh, that was anyway they showed this on CNN little while ago a foul a crime was caught on tape and calm

[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.260]
So how you really have to see the video they'll be shown it all day a

[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.260]
Foul crime a man dressed in a bright yellow chicken suit robbed a cougar grocery store

[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.820]
Don't you see it? Yeah, it says the suspect flew the coop before the police could pluck him

[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.420]
But the crime was captured on a store surveillance tape you'll be seeing it

[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.140]
Just turn your TV on even on

[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:59.380]
Discovery channel will be on there all over the place national geographic it'll be everywhere all those lines laid an egg

[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.040]
We can put the new pole up there will be adding lots to it

[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.160]
I'm sure because there's so many red necki or goober places until a little time speaking of goober's

[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.720]
I actually like the um non-parallels myself

[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:11.460]
Yeah

[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.060]
To pull my to pull your cavities out

[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:20.120]
Sure because you can't go to the movies without you're getting a big huge tub of buttered popcorn or

[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.520]
Preferably some real good sweet candy

[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.700]
But they have ours cookie. No, but no juju beans right

[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.860]
Juulieberman likes them juju beans julieberman endorsed by the new republic that is shocking man

[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.900]
It's enough to make you want to just burn that thing

[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.600]
Anyway, we can change the pool Eric anytime you get you around to it

[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:42.460]
Erick's been just working up a storm feverishly nice going Eric. Thank God for you man

[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.080]
He's no boner boy. Thank the Lord. Oh, yeah

[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.400]
This article by Tom Boswell in the Washington Post and I said we wouldn't talk

[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:55.020]
It's very long to him. I'm gonna read the whole thing. It's long and you know what too bad in fact it'll be a two-parter

[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.320]
Rose owes sport more than hollow confession

[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:04.480]
The hit king has hurt baseball badly no sign disgraced star truly reformed. He said that's those are the

[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.000]
85 headlines

[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.940]
Before you forgive Pete roast for stealing the china you should always count the silverware

[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.360]
And before baseball let's rose into the hall of fame much less back into a big league dugout

[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.640]
He should do more much more than ask us to take his word that he's a changed man especially

[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:27.120]
When his confession after 14 years of lies arrives between hard covers with the promise of piles of money for rose

[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:33.240]
And most tellingly when rose cannot bring himself even now even once to see an honest heartfelt. I'm sorry

[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.340]
Roses finally told the truth

[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:39.080]
But he still hasn't seen the truth that his sins go far beyond gambling on baseball games

[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.760]
And that his contrition must go far deeper than any TV quote or book excerpt available so far

[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.620]
And of course today's the book is being released they're making the big simous tonight

[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.340]
At the most elemental level rose owes the profoundest of apologies to the sport itself which he injured badly

[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.980]
And he needs to get down on his knees if not literally then figuratively to those like john doubt

[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:05.020]
Who got the facts right in their investigation yet have endured more than a decade of lying accusations from rose and every media venue he could grab

[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.320]
Before fans grant their forgiveness or commissioner bud sealant decides whether rose should be reinstated to the sport

[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.380]
Perhaps we should listen to a story told by former commissioner fave vinson

[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:21.840]
When rose was a player he went to japan signed a bad endorsement contract collected a hundred grand in cash and put it in the suitcase

[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.060]
So we could sneak it in through customs without paying us taxes

[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.220]
Rose was caught but the story never got out no charges were filed a few years later

[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:35.660]
Roses bad contract expired. He went back to japan got another hundred grand in cash put it in the suitcase

[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.640]
Maybe the same one and tried to get it through customs again

[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.340]
Bzzz vinson said on monday

[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.240]
Imitating the sound of a buzzer going off they caught rose again

[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.500]
Now the feds were really livid a two-time loser. They wanted to indict him

[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:55.180]
But he had a good lawyer who got him off nobody found out nothing happened to rose those are facts you can quote me

[00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.000]
So when you look at rose today you have to realize where it fought too says vinson

[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.700]
We teach great athletes their whole lives that they're above the law

[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.800]
We create the monster then we have to go out and deal with it

[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:11.020]
Only a man who was lived by his own version of the law or no laws at all could make his hollow and attempt of confession and

[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:17.460]
Restitution as rose has one book excerpt to appearance sports illustrated this week should be enough to make any person of conscience

[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.340]
Which is never included rose see red

[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.580]
Once you send something like this to the printer you have to live with it. No rewrites next week pete for ghost-rooted. It's still yours

[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.940]
I'm sure that I'm supposed to act all sorry or sad or guilty now that I've accepted what I've done that something wrong

[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.840]
But you see I'm just not built that way wrote rose. So let's leave it like this

[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.060]
I'm sorry it happened. I'm sorry for all the people fans and family had hurt. Let's move on

[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.600]
No, let's stay right here rights time abas well

[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.280]
Let's do a little exeges exeges exeges. How do you say that? I don't know

[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.680]
Of the text as the old-time hellfire preachers used to say

[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.860]
Rose says he's not built to act all sorry or sad or guilty

[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.200]
Well, if he can't even act that way with his whole future hanging in the balance

[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:06.680]
We can be sure he's incapable of actually feeling that way our prisons are full of people who aren't built to feel remorse or guilt or sorrow

[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.540]
What the damage they've done this attitude is a pathology peat not a bragging point

[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:17.720]
Even more chilling as roses using the word it twice instead of I the truly contried person would instinctively say

[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.200]
I'm sorry

[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.820]
I did it and then I heard people and said rose says that it did the damage and what is it?

[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:27.900]
Well, it is the investigation the exposure of his gambling the scandal in other words like any unrepentance

[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:32.640]
A scoundrel he's mostly sorry that he got caught. He still hasn't come to terms with the deed itself

[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.560]
The more Rose talks the more he exposes rather than redeems himself during the times I gambled as a manager

[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.940]
I never took it on fair advantage

[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.680]
I never bet more or less based on injuries or inside information

[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:46.020]
I never allowed my wages to influence my baseball decisions rights rose

[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:51.480]
Swin my mind. I wasn't corrupt. That's like a bank robber asking for parole because he didn't scare the tellers

[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:56.620]
In another excerpt from his book rose admits to placing bets on baseball games four or five times a week

[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.120]
But ads I never bet against my own team never made any bets from the clubhouse

[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.440]
But the latter assertion was disputed yesterday by two of his

[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.460]
Reputed betrunners

[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:12.140]
Tommy joyosa who once shared a house with Rose and Paul Jansson both said rose routinely placed wages from his clubhouse office

[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.540]
I just wish he'd come clean with everything jurosus said. I just wonder if he'll ever tell the whole story

[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:20.820]
baseball has only one cardinal rule you can't gamble on the game in any form ever

[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.680]
It's posted in every clubhouse

[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:27.060]
Everybody died with a densest rookie understands it if you take drugs and become an alcoholic

[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.500]
That's entirely different. It's a personal problem you deserve and get rehab

[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.800]
But if you gamble on the game let alone good lord bet on the team you're managing

[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:39.720]
You've stabbed a dagger into the heart of the game's competitive credibility yet rose in this damning attempted rationalization

[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.300]
Shows how the mind of an ecotist and amoralist works

[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:47.420]
Rose set up a completely different code in his own mind so we could get around the rules that apply to everybody else in baseball

[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.400]
This isn't how you get reinstated

[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.460]
This is how without knowing it you make the case against reinstatement

[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.680]
Mercy should always be the order of the day, but in this case balanced against enormous skepticism

[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:02.580]
This week America will talk about rose now baseball's all-time leader in both hits and lies

[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:09.960]
But we ought to be talking about Vincent Dowd and a Bartlett Jemadi men who paid a high price to dig out a hard truth and stick by their guns

[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.900]
But the sinner gets the headline doesn't he the prodigal son gets the feast what allows he parable

[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.360]
Perhaps the valuable story this week isn't that rose finally admitted what we all knew that in one season

[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.240]
He'd bet down on more than a third of all the games in the majors

[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:28.000]
The tale that matters a parable in its own right is that for 14 years in the face of sentimental public opinion

[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.840]
A legion of pedopologist and attacks on the games leaders baseball didn't buckle the sport kept the scoundrel where he belonged out of the game

[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:42.840]
Now we'll see if Selig who gets high grades for his consistency for a decade can stand one final test of character from rose

[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.060]
With millions of fans chanting forgive

[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.720]
We'll see like demand that rose show true contrition and Jemadi's words

[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.800]
reconfigure his life rather than merely reshape his image with a book tour

[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.480]
So far Vincent doesn't see any signs of reconfigured rose life

[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.320]
In fact, he says there's every evidence that rose is still a conspicuous gambler

[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.900]
We were misguided in 1989. We just thought he would be contrite. It just wasn't in him

[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.880]
I wish he was more contrite even now

[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.500]
For Vincent the story of roses always ultimately a story of money

[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.960]
He's always been struggling because of his gambling

[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.300]
His decisions are usually acts to protect his financial situation

[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.980]
He wouldn't admit he gambled on baseball because he was afraid it would cut off his baseball related income

[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.420]
So Vincent now he's writing this book for the money

[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:28.760]
Why don't some of the profits from this book and account of how he damaged baseball go back to baseball say the some of the indigent

[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.340]
Negro league players what you're seeing now are economic calculations

[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.080]
It's all about him coming back financially

[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.840]
It would be scandalous to allow him back in the game if what we've seen so far is an indication of his lack of contrition

[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.720]
How could he trust him in any capacity

[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:45.960]
I can take a lot, but that would be beyond the pale Vincent said let's wait a couple of years and see how he behaves

[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.480]
baseball shouldn't roll over for this but I'm afraid seated we'll play with the gallery

[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:55.380]
Tom Boswell says let's reserve judgment see the whole book the interviews the whole nine yards

[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.820]
But the bar for reinstatement something that's never been granted

[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:02.260]
Shulis Jojax and there any other player banned for life should be said very high so far

[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.800]
Rose has done very little to help himself through that hurdle. He's a scumbag like I've been saying

[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.560]
How do you like that story about the hundred drain in the suitcase twice?

[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.920]
That's a good story and even though I don't care about him yeah

[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.740]
That's intended the lengths the kind of kind of sounds like the governor's wife

[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.700]
Right smogrums stuffing through customs

[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:25.060]

That woman who claims she lost the winning mega millions lottery ticket and assuming the block payment to the ignobs winner

[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.040]

[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.760]
So and then they try to find out they weren't returned the gross thing all over again

Why not we'll get loaded up. It's in one American city now Loots. I don't know if Loots is picking up a beer city

[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.100]
But we're not going to nitpick about it

[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.980]
We're not going to nitpick pick you can have a list of a thousand different names on here. What do I care?

[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.980]
Okay, so Eric will have a lot of work to do a big deal. Keep more from the refrigerator

[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.680]
Just like what's your name and recommend for a dream just like Sarah Goldfarver. It'll keep him away from that refrigerator

[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:12.040]
But I haven't put locks on it or even locks in it

[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:19.520]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line QAM. There's nobody there QAM hello

[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.220]
Moe Howard Davis. I'm busy

[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.960]
Thanks for the bulletin. Oh, that was that was that was acting in a voice

[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.580]
That is so that is so scandalous and so outrageous. It's not unbelievable

[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:37.400]
It's very believable, but just outrageous and the fact that the middle and upper level management people in that radio station

[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.520]
Just to allow him to run roughshod over everybody's life who comes along including some really good people

[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.300]
It's just unacceptable. I mean if this is a guy that really brought a lot to the table

[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:51.600]
Which he doesn't if he had gigantic ratings if he brought in enormous amount of revenue if he was top here in the community

[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:58.400]
If he did such a sensational job on the dolphin games they really would forget about Rick Weaver and Dill's infer none of the above all of Mark

[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.800]
He fails the test on every one of those

[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.780]
The fact is he's got a hot shot attorney who you know is keeping his career going through

[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:11.240]
You know threats and blackmail basically is what I'm going to and as a result they just uh, you know

[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.580]
It reminds me of Rebecca on passions. I

[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.260]
Want you to call it freeze all a shirt and zassets right now Julian no matter what she wants

[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:24.940]
He's got she's holding that thing over Julian's head about him and uh, you and so as a result if every instant

[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.780]
It's another black man. You know, okay, whatever you say dear. Come on pookie

[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.940]
Now seriously do you think you think when Mo wants something done? He goes to Greg and says well listen pookie

[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:39.900]
I want you to do this. I think he says that. I think he calls it in junior. What's this obsession with pookie?

[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.200]
WQA am hello

[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:49.700]

[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:55.500]
That was a well-run article, but I do take exception to one thing. Yeah

[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:04.260]
When this when the uh when the writer said that he compared alkydits to you know

[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.940]
What's the same kind of call me on Monday with the same song and dance about another article I read

[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.700]
No, okay. All right. I think it is all right

[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:19.560]
Is alkydits killed about 5,000 people. Yeah, September 11

[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.680]
And you know, it's this is more that you know these guys if they have a chance, you know

[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.840]
You know they'll do a dirty

[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:34.000]
So what's your point? I don't understand. What does he disagree with? So the guy is comparing them to the mafia

[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.100]
This is a terrorist organization that needs to be dealt with every day. I mean

[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.320]
So why don't we're gonna start doing it? Well, that's well

[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:47.880]
My what do they have to do with Sodom who's saying what do they have to do with Iraq? What do they have to do with the nine Americans that died

[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.460]
It's last night in this morning

[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.800]
Well, I believe that Sodom saying would have hooked in with these guys

[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.580]
Oh, sir, please would I'm not gonna start wars based on your crystal ball. He would have hooked in with these guys

[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:02.780]
He had plenty of opportunity to hook in with these guys. They're violent enemies. Okay. They're there

[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.880]
They got different the headguer. All right. I think that guy would have yeah, go get him

[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.880]
Oh, I mean these people I think he would have done this and what are they gonna?

[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.000]
Sir, you're one of those people one of those bush liquors who would rationalize anything

[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.700]
There's no there's no dealing with people like you because you would rationalize anything that their fewer would do

[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.740]
To make it palatable to all the rest of us and then we're not buying it

[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:29.300]
We're not buying it. We're not buying his lies your lies and your crystal balls. Okay, sir. That's the same guy to called Monday

Well go right ahead. We just don't want to be bored by your every dundet horse crap. All right. We'd rather hear Elvis records

[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.380]

[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.960]
This is what kind of real is this

[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:57.120]
What is this I know the song but oh that

[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:04.540]
Isn't that a stranger in this never heard that neither that was unbelievable

[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:11.480]
Oh

[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.660]
Okay, that's enough

[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.900]
Let's keep these calls gonna we need more of goobers like that last guy. He's a goober wqa. I'm hello

[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.820]
But $250 you get to see Dan marino and he'll sign your ball

[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:32.580]
WQ. I'm hello. Yeah, hi. Yeah, sir. Yeah. Yeah. I just wanted to add a city to your list go right in place

[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:37.780]
I spent a little time in Houston, Texas and I've got to tell you it was incredible

[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:43.460]
I mean, you know if you're in the areas where you know the big hotels are you know people that work there are very professional

[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.800]
When you start like migrate out of those areas

[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:52.240]
Really you know you're almost like in a backwards environment and it was really incredible the time I had to spend there

[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:57.800]
But I just also wanted to add something regarding Pete Rose. Yes, all the defenders of Pete Rose should realize it

[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:06.180]
Suppose Pete Rose was working for a company at a representative and knocked on your door to pedal whatever a product or a service

[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.500]
How much credibility would you give to Pete Rose none exactly? I mean, you know

[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.980]
He's just been lying time and that's that's why I said the other day and I'll say it again

[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:17.260]
Just because he says he never better gets the reds

[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.040]
Why do we believe him on anything and what I got it's been lying admits

[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.860]
He's been lying and brags about the fact he's been lying for 14 years

[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.760]
And now we're supposed to believe that he says he never better against this team

[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:30.700]
I mean again way back when he wrote a book saying he never bet on baseball right that's right

[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.320]
The one lie after another it's gone to the point where he can't even tell the truth from a lie

[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.340]
I mean the man needs some real help

[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:41.820]
He's a real scumbag and he's a total denial. All he wants is the cash in on his now. Oh no question

[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:47.180]
I mean whether he's in the hall of fame or not. I couldn't care less, you know because there's a lot of bad people in the hall

[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.560]
Well, there's an interesting thing though and as I was reading yesterday

[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:53.140]
Which I never paid too much attention to that Hall of Fame crap because most of it is political anyway

[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:58.020]
Oh yeah, but there there are qualifications and could a moral character and things like that that

[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.740]
Disqualified people from being in a Hall of Fame, which nobody seems to be talking about these days

[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:04.800]
But you just so just so you know, I'm like there's some people in the hall of fame

[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.600]
I don't know if you're familiar with Kenna saw mountain land. Yes

[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.420]
Here's a man who was a slave owner who said as long as he's a commissioner

[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.800]
They'll never be a black ball player, right? You leave it and here he is

[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.160]
He's glorified. You know that his plaque rests up there in Cooper's town

[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:24.640]
It's really it's such a good thing about that is his bones are still rotting so there you go

[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:29.360]
Yeah, listen, it's always a pleasure to have a great day and back to you five six seven oh five sixty yet the

People as it's the jock thing he was Charlie Hussle. He was a great player. He got the hits record all of the Southern crap

[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:39.860]
He's a scumbag

[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.760]
He's an absolute scumbag and they shouldn't be any separate set of

[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.700]
Rules just because he happens to warn a docks trap for a very long time a real scumbag

[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:57.260]

It's always the same.

[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.600]
They're just looking for fame.

[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:49.720]
And they love the abuse.

[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.460]
Very like the chronic phonics.

[00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:14.020]

[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.720]
We don't want to ask these kids on the radio.

[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.280]
Right. And you know you don't have to.

[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.840]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you sound like Dan Baby now.

[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:03.280]
Are you in Looser? Are you an Aintry sir? I think you've been up in Aintry and there wasn't a Dan Baby.

[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.920]
You wanna admit it now or wait till tomorrow.

[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.920]
Some people don't.

[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.060]
They don't have a clue.

[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:21.740]
They walk all around with their head up their blues.

[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.200]
It's always the same.

[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.800]
They're just looking for fame.

[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.080]
And they're lovely of youths.

[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.540]

[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.200]
He's the chronic from loose.

[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.400]
Looser's doing real well by the way.

[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.320]

[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:53.720]
Yeah.

[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:59.020]
In what American city would you find not the most because obviously that would depend on the population.

[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:00.900]
But the highest percentage of goobers.

[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:09.280]
National 36, Jacksonville 24, Tampa 23, Gainesville 9, Loots 9, New Orleans 1 and Houston 1.

[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:12.240]
Yeah, somebody says, most of all, the entire nation is New Orleans.

[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.660]
Since they may not be goobers, what the hell are they?

[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.020]
They're Cajun goobers, but they definitely are goobers.

[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:17.980]
And they are dumb.

[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:18.700]
Cajun.

[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:20.580]
What's that movie again? Southern comfort?

[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.300]
Yeah, good movie.

[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.580]
Excellent movie.

[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:25.380]
If you haven't seen it, go out and read it by it, steal it. Southern comfort.

[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:26.000]
It's a great movie.

[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.260]
It'll give you a real good idea what I'm gonna.

[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.080]
Cajun Yahoo's are in all in.

[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:30.640]
It's education.

[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.600]
Yeah, they don't have counties.

[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:37.320]
They have perishes perished the thought that you've got all these people had rave about, oh man, it's great man.

[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.360]
Marty Grah.

[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.580]
And all of it's a slimy place.

[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:43.360]
If you want to go to a slimy place and get drunk, go to Key West.

[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.920]
Why do you have to go all the way to New Orleans?

[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:47.740]
They have nothing there, but a lot of dumb people.

[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.300]
In fact, why leave town?

[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.260]
Now here's one that says, and I put it on there, even though you won't.

[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:54.480]
Why won't I?

[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.320]
Because I won't get any votes except from maybe this factor.

[00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:58.980]
Stanyansville, North Carolina.

[00:54:59.140 --> 00:54:59.740]
Yeah, well that's the point.

[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.760]
See, I could name 100 towns that nobody ever heard of that are 100% over there.

[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.440]
But the point is it's a poll where asked in the audience.

[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:06.420]
So maybe we'll find out they did hear of it.

[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.580]
You might be surprised, mister.

[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:09.180]
You think you know what all, don't you, mister?

[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.140]
Yes, I do. Just out loud.

[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:10.940]
Well, what do you know?

[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:11.700]
Everything.

[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:12.360]
Oh.

[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:15.800]
Stanyansville, North Carolina just outside of Greensboro.

[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.400]
If you're Jewish, black or in North America, it says good luck.

[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.400]
Well, that's true of any of these.

[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.060]
In this, I said Greensboro.

[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.600]
Okay, let's say Greensboro.

[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.060]
That's a better than Stanyansville.

[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.280]
That would be like saying, Canada, they wouldn't New York.

[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.600]
Although I don't think the people that came to that.

[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.080]
I don't think that Canada, they are the people.

[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:35.280]
See, let me make the distinction for the benefit of our poll today.

[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.520]
I don't think the people in like small towns and upstate New York are goobers.

[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.320]
They're just farmers.

[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:40.020]
Right.

[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.000]
There's either difference.

[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.220]
They're very much so is a difference because farmers don't live in trailer parks.

[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.580]
But there's a difference between rural and a goober.

[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:47.200]
Right.

[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:48.500]
Now you're talking.

[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:52.300]
So like Geneva, New York wouldn't qualify or candidate because they're just small

[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.760]
hick towns with a lot of farmers in them.

[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:57.020]
But a place like Greensboro, I guess, has a lot of goobers.

[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:58.180]
Like lutes.

[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.300]
I'm glad to see lutes is doing so good.

[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:06.900]
Well, speaking of assholes, all three Roman Catholic diocese in Washington are a full compliance

[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:11.660]
they say with a policy established by US bishops in 2002 to protect miners from sex abuse

[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:15.620]
by clergy according to a national report released yesterday, breathlessly by the nation's

[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:15.960]
bishops.

[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:20.940]
The report conducted by the Gavin group and independent Boston based organization headed

[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:25.220]
by former FBI official William Gavin surveyed the progress bishops are making and carrying

[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:27.680]
out a charter they agreed to in June 2002.

[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:33.160]
Victims groups, however, said the report was flawed consisting mainly of self-reporting

[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:33.980]
by church officials.

[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:38.300]
They said the victims interviewed in the audits were not representative in that auditors only

[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:42.540]
interviewed victims who came forward after June 2002 and were not involved in lawsuits.

[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.600]
The auditors said they didn't want to interfere with legal proceedings.

[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.160]
They also criticized the audits for not examining personnel records.

[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:53.280]
The Gavin report says auditors didn't review those files because of state's privacy

[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.520]
and confidentiality laws.

[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.280]
I also said auditors didn't have the civil or criminal authority to demand documents

[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:01.740]
for record searches, but pertinent records policy and information were generally provided

[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:03.000]
as requested.

[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.500]
David Polhese executive director of Survivors Network of those abuse by presaid the bishops

[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.980]
have essentially defined the rules of the game determined who plays, who gets played

[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.080]
with, who got paid the umpires another thing they're winning.

[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.200]
Polhese also said he found it pretty disturbing that the bar is set so low with dice he's

[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:25.200]
getting commendations for having codes of conduct for priests and a formal diocesan communication

[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:25.780]
plan.

[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.040]
No priest molested the child because he had an inadequate code of conduct.

[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:33.580]
We always maintain the problems not with the bishops right on paper, but what they do in

[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:34.080]
reality.

[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.660]
Nice going David, you go boy.

[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.140]
The whitewash continues and of course we've got bigger fish to fry now like that bits

[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.440]
is we're worried more about Michael Jackson in the Middle East and Al Qaeda and this

[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.580]
is not any oddity and about the you know Scott and Lacey Peterson.

[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.200]
The important things in life as opposed to worrying about little kids getting molested

[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.740]
and people that want to alter boys.

[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.840]
Well speaking of people that want to alter boys, did I print out that story about that

[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.160]
teacher?

[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:57.500]
I don't know.

[00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:58.920]
We're talking about it.

[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.700]
Don't let me forget the one about the S factor.

[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:02.860]
Okay.

[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:07.460]
The S factor explains Bush's popularity.

[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.500]
I don't give it away.

[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.920]
Boynton teacher 49 charged with having sex with 11 year old student.

[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:20.000]
I mean that's a little you know I'm saying a little bit it's very much ridiculous.

[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:24.760]
A music teacher at a Boynton Beach Elementary School was a rest of his that he accused of

[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:29.100]
having sex with a young boy she used to instruct Carol Lynn Flanagan, a 10 year teacher at

[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:33.020]
Role and Green Elementary is accused of having a 19 month sexual relationship with a boy

[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:37.060]
that included encounters in such places as an airport parking lot of park and hotel

[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:37.400]
rooms.

[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:42.440]
Because the boy was 11 when it started in June 2002 after he finished elementary school

[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:47.720]
investigators say Flanagan 49 of Bokeh faces six counts of sexual and mood battery charges.

[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:51.880]
It's not the first time she's been questioned about a relationship with a young boy although

[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.040]
she's never been prosecuted.

[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:58.140]
Flanagan was investigated in 2002 by the Department of Children and Families and Bokeh police.

[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:01.840]
She was accused of romantically and romantically kissing a 12 year old lake worth middle

[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.660]
student and letting the boy sleep in her room.

[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:06.260]
Oh well if it's good enough for Michael Jackson not to be good enough for her.

[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:06.840]
Right?

[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.840]
They slept, she slept on the floor, he slept on the bed I'm sure.

[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:14.780]
Many of the details of the two cases are strikingly similar but the sheriff's office would

[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.800]
not confirm if the two cases involved the same boy now 13.

[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:24.380]
The 2002 investigation was launched after Flanagan's husband Douglas De Pueh told a marriage

[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.940]
therapist he had concerns about his wife kissing a young boy.

[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:31.560]
He told investigators that the boy is too brother to slept over 12 to 15 times although

[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.260]
he'd never seen her in bed with any of them.

[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:37.220]
That case was dropped after the boy told investigators that the two had only tap kissed on the

[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:38.880]
mouth and never engaged in sex.

[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:39.840]
Tap kissed?

[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:42.240]
Have you ever heard that before?

[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.380]
Is that like a peck?

[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.100]
Like a little peck around the cheek.

[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:46.860]
They've only tap kissed.

[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.360]
In all my 100 years I never heard that before.

[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:49.920]
Me either.

[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:17.160]
I've heard ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex ex

[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:47.160]

[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.840]
Greensboro North Carolina one out of 128 in what American city will you find the highest percentage of

[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.660]
Goobers

[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:59.920]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line WQ I am

[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.100]

Your maribus now where's that I

[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:15.580]
Take 75 you run right into it by the North Lane break the center is like 30 miles above Knoxville

[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:21.460]
But I'll tell you something I lived there for two years. I was there a rebot on a campground for a time sharing resort

[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:25.440]
Yeah, and you want to talk about y'all is I mean is it's a old coal miners town

[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.080]
It's got 80% unemployment rate in the town, right?

[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:34.700]
And everybody in there's a welfare. I mean there's girls from 13 is 16 years old with two and three kids

[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.440]
Just against extra welfare money pop it out here

[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.820]
And I'm talking about his the hickies to get out I've ever lived it in my life is

[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:47.780]
All right, you got it man. I want to say deal. Yes, I want to do the grocery store and both of me

[01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:56.020]
Go to store a weekly quickly couldn't break my hundred dollar bill

[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:02.140]
Thanks for good news. Apparently have a great day put my your head Lake City Tennessee. What do you say? Let's get it on

[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:07.000]
Okay, and here's what you sound a little bit the reluctant. Yeah, whatever. I know Lake City Florida

[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.780]
Mm-hmm me too. I know Lakeland Florida. I know two egg

[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.600]
See, but we don't know any of the people in two way how many people are there in two way

[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.400]
30 man got a stoplight and that's about it

[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.700]
I mean really seriously Florida a lot of people don't like considering it a mugwomps day

[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:25.360]
But boy you take out you take out date Broward in Palm Beach and

[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:30.520]
Monroe counties in New York got nothing you can't name me another county in a state and no tell me orange County

[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:35.440]
Okay, I want to hear about all them Yahoo's and then trailer trash in Orlando. You got to be kidding me. Wow

[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.780]
What's that what's that is that orange blossom trail is in it? That sounds right?

[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:46.060]
That's the main drag to their all man in the main vein bunch of Bible thumpers and

[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:47.560]
strippers and

[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:53.420]
trailer trash and pretty much the same people. I don't know who you're talking about that does it consider Florida Yahoo's state

[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.520]
Well, and then the people who live there

[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.140]
I mean if you talk to the people in Tampa they would trade take great that they probably shoot your ass

[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:03.680]
You said you're a bunch of mugwomps and Yahoo's and goobers. They get the gun off their gun rap

[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:08.080]
They don't cut you that too good mister. I tell you that right now. They got the best strip bars over there

[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.780]
They got a monster penis and they got the

[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.880]
Burn steak house. It's really a bundle of contradictions

[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.500]
And it's another one of those places like Montreal remember I told you about Montreal

[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.880]
Montreal is a great city, but they need a people transplant and

[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:27.340]
The same is true with Tampa Tampa's got beautiful right on the golf there and they got some nice beaches and

[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:28.980]
It's a beautiful area

[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:35.800]
It's a great there and the I don't know about the hotels, but I mean the restaurants did have a lot of reverb. They even got a crystal over there

[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.800]
What's not to like and

[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.140]
Stake and shake they've had stake and shake a long before ever showed up in South Florida

[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.960]
And what's the other one they got hearties right well and parties

[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:51.480]

[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:40.760]
Not that nothing's any great chasing date and brow. We got our share of a trailer trash, but believe you me

[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:45.420]
The rest of the state is just an amoeed and we haven't even talked about the panhandle yet

[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.680]
Now you mentioned talent has to be for never been there driven through it

[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.480]

[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:01.860]
27 past 11 at 560 QAM. You're a red necky station for the innu-millennium

[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:08.300]
God

[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:19.920]
Friday night is in the White House doing all his presidential bill

[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:27.220]
He's there in the overlapped this though. It's not sure what an old

[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:36.500]
Practice in his speech that he's been working on for weeks should be a breeze

[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:45.100]
But it's not for a man who thinks that if you're from around your ear and ease

[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.720]
Saturday he's still no smarter things what's in the center central

[01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:02.460]
You could say his brain is useless kind of like the Chinese clopped up banter

[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:02.800]
Go

[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.200]
Now he goes to give the speech with words his vocab cannot reach him

[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:18.760]
But he won't tell you how he feels instead he'll talk about some bad mistakes

[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:25.760]
He can't spell

[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:29.640]
You can't run out

[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.180]
He can't speak

[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:38.900]
So what he says is always in doubt

[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.680]
Don't ever clue no

[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.260]
Bring it in his head

[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:47.700]
So he just

[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:51.700]
Babbles on

[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.640]
I'm sure that's not the physics I wanted but I thought it that's what you knew what is that bush meets the press

[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.600]
It always it you probably already stuck it in your shish then there I queued it up in case you want it now

[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.240]
Bush meets the press seat. Oh, I don't got that in here. Let's hear it

[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:19.960]
Oh, hey, as you know, I work for Sun Young Moons Washington Times. It's your paper Mr. President

[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.540]
So you don't have to worry about my question. Oh

[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:30.060]
They're out here. Is there any truth to Howard Dean's hateful leftist liberal rantings that you had previous knowledge of 9-11

[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.460]
Excuse me, she's checking your pieces of working there sting

[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:54.960]
He will be brought to justice and

[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:02.740]
And the Tristors wedding new state bc's dismal ratings

[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.960]
Don't not work

[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.220]
Give me milk

[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:17.360]
We've been coming in now

[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:17.720]
Uh

[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:19.620]
Shagal

[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]
Let me ask you a question. How long does it go on?

[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:28.020]
It just goes on I don't think I want to hear it. No, it's not on my DCS because I never played it never was gonna play it

[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.280]
Thanks a lot pal. I take back whatever good things I said about you

[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.440]
Wasn't that the guy with the cigarettes in the weed or whatever?

[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:38.640]
Crawford Texas somebody says place for the most goober is I stay just show the cover of the national review

[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:45.220]
Build Buckley's right-wing rag and it's got a picture of Howard Dean on the front and it says please nominate this man

[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:52.100]
See the crime desperately to paint him is another Michael Duke caucus has been totally unelectable and now all of a sudden now

[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.920]
Who do they say the whistleblower the in-run whistleblower she just endorsed Wesley Clark

[01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:04.800]
It's really fascinating to me how Wesley Clark all of a sudden is coming from nowhere and especially with a minimum lately of other than the

[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:08.120]
Eraskelhouse the deli then and sloyneys a minimum of

[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:13.740]
Public appearance and all of a sudden he's just the skyrocket. You see that yeah, what was that all about? I don't know

[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:20.940]
I mean I don't have a problem because if he's the guy that can win. I mean great, but I just I'm a little bit suspicious

[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:30.240]
Because it's pretty obvious to me that Howard Dean isn't the choice of the establishment which is probably why he's so damn popular with so many people who don't like the establishment

[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.620]
Which is most of us?

[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:39.680]
But boy oh boy well he's he's temperamental and he's this and he stole a freight train and he's got his records from Vermont sealed and

[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.740]
He's a scumbag and he's yeah, and all these other things

[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.860]
Let's see here's somebody says the entire state of South Carolina what we can't do that

[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:49.860]
But let's put Charles and South Carolina on there

[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.200]
Crawford Texas the way to see how fast Crawford moves up that list

[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.140]
It's gonna skyrocket guaranteed and

[01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:03.600]
Somebody says e-ha junction just basically because of the name all our guarantee it lives up to its name

[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.080]
What do you think? Absolutely name the TV show after e-ha

[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:12.920]
E-ha junction I was called at Yahoo junctions for so long that I look at this thing on paper somebody fast

[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:17.960]
And I can't really bring myself to believe that it is e-ha junction, but it is e-ha junction

[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:22.000]
I bet you they got a good stuckey's up there. Yeah, get you some p-can pie

[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.580]

[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:41.760]

Come on for the whole state

[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:04.920]
For the whole state. I mean Florida's I don't want to say it's so beautiful because it really I mean the beaches here

[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:10.000]
You know there are a lot of nice beaches like Panama City and they got those springs with those weeping willows up there in the North

[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:10.540]

[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.500]
Yeah, we had that on yesterday. Are you did have that on yesterday? Okay?

[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:10.240]
Well, I just think in the ending plan of the news broadcast. They said

[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.620]
They hate to seal that see them kneeling during services

[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:24.520]
Welcome, okay, thanks for going to okay 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 well, you know if you got a little like load

[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:27.600]
You can always drop a wide to kneel and reel the screaming quick

[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:33.080]
You know somebody was asking me the other day about dogs about how come dogs don't have to you know if you have a dog

[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:39.000]
You have to wipe them you don't have to wipe your dogs ass no, I never heard of such a thing now if you have a cat

[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.180]
Like those one of those long-haired cats the ones with the others

[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:48.320]
Not huh persons no Persian cats don't have long hair sure they do they do

[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:55.980]
What are you talking about persons are short-haired cats aren't they all right? I'll take your word for it not everyone I've seen I

[01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:03.360]
Thought the persons are the gray short-haired cats am I confusing that with something else a psyme's oh, yeah, psyme's cats

[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:10.740]
So Persian have a lot about whatever they are I hate cats. I can't stand them all a psyme's I will say some of them are kind of interesting

[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:15.500]
You know they're not friendly. They look cool. They make a nice sound but still they make a nice sound

[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.700]
Yeah, well they're up against your leg and all that static electricity is going off

[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:22.840]
I guess if you're real lonely, you know right and if you don't and there's no human if there's no human

[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:28.580]
Right up against you maybe like a putty cat, you know, they'll eat you which is as close to the putty as you can get

[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:31.940]
Yeah, they will eat you if you fall on the ground and play dead play possum

[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:37.980]
They're disgusting, but anyway if you have a like a long-haired cat, which is what I started getting to then you might want to get like a nice

[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.900]
Moist outlet or something and get ready

[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.200]
Oh, because I've heard those stories

[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:46.420]
Of course the whole concept of cats crap it in the litter boxes

[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:50.760]
So I don't want to get started on that again. It's just I'll never be as long as I know that's one thing

[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.960]
I'll never be able to adjust to I don't buy it if you have a pet or a child or a

[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:02.240]
Mall Howard David it or like what's your name Mrs. Wallace on passions just because they're in cotton

[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.660]
It doesn't mean that they can crap in a house, okay?

[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:10.560]
I just never heard all well we can go away for days at a time and of course they have those feeder things

[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.140]
You know we're a limited amount of food comes automatically down to be a little thing into the bowl

[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:20.080]
And so you can go away for days on end and leave your putty cat right in there all alone to like your crap in the box

[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.160]
By the way, here's the message to the cat people who think that their houses don't smell they do they do they do

[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.820]
They don't know what you buy they stink

[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:31.260]
And I say that the dogs think too when you walk into the house

[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:37.200]
Of somebody that has dogs and as much as I love dogs and I had the two but it smells no matter what you if you

[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:42.700]
Every day they still smell that's that true. It is true. All right. They have a doggy smell you're wrong

[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.260]
Okay, I'm talking about not you not when you live there

[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.760]
But I'm talking about somebody that's coming in a stranger in a house

[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:54.420]
Which is a good way to get them out anyway like when if your hope is witness is coming just open up the door and oh man that'll do it

[01:25:55.340 --> 01:26:01.940]
Just hold tiny up right in front of their face. That's a tiny nice going baby. I got to get me a dog, you know, no, I don't do it

[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.520]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:08.320]
I don't know when you've had dogs for a long time and then they croak and it's like

[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:14.460]
There's a nice robotic dog you turn it off when you're not there. There's so many more negatives than positive

[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:19.040]
But the fact of the matter is it like leaves a vacuum, you know, that's another reason I'm so happy not to be there because

[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:24.320]
It's like there's a vacuum in that house robo dog you can put it in your suitcase and take them with you. Yeah

[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.500]
But it's no fun. Sure it doesn't crap in a house

[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:32.780]
Doesn't crap in the house and it doesn't fall into pool and things like that with the remote control. It'll go crazy

[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.160]
Just like action George

[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:39.560]

Yep, who always every time she fangs at Suzanne always lets me know she's the woman from homestead married to the mexican

She's a nice Jewish girl

Anyway, she says you want to know about Yahoo's she comes from a holly, Pennsylvania

[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.680]
Full of Yahoo's and drunks in the polka nose

[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.360]
Well, it's a little bit too obscure to put on our list, but uh, out of respect for holly

[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:40.140]
I played that for her and speaking of playing something. I cannot believe

[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:47.080]
That you put that bush bit in the DCS. I can't believe in the wildest dreams, huh? I did not I found a good disc

[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.940]
Well, I can't believe that you actually dug it up and played it

[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:55.880]
Don't do it again. Okay, that is god of it. Nobody loves bokeh brine more than I do

[01:29:55.880 --> 01:30:00.360]
But every once in a great while he'll do when it just uh doesn't go anywhere. Do you know what I mean?

[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:07.100]
Yeah, it doesn't go anywhere. It should go somewhere like in the old

[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:09.700]
Schmidt can but doesn't go anywhere and that's one of them

[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:11.180]
And that's probably why I couldn't remember what it was

[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:13.720]
Steve has a fact with a great idea here

[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:18.600]
How about a state pool of goobers? I think what we'll do is we'll change the pool at one

[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:20.620]
Right at one

[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:26.220]
What do you mean at one? Why do I say we have a chance to build it?

[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:28.640]
That's just a weird time to change the pool

[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.080]
Are we speaking the same language speeding glaze see

[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:42.080]
Well, that's changed the pool at one because this is one that we don't we don't have to have the audience contribute to

[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:46.500]
That's my point see the first one they're calling in joints and places and things and whatever

[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:51.700]
I mean nobody's gonna catch Nash really even Crawford Texas whilst moving up like I said it's got 11's got a shot

[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.840]
But I think that's a good idea Steve

[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:58.000]
How about a state pool of goobers which state has got the most goobers

[01:30:58.460 --> 01:30:59.640]
We don't want to say that though

[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:02.080]
I don't wish it wishes the most red-nucky state something like that

[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.680]
The highest percentage is a good kid

[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.940]
What is it the highest percentage like you did on this one here

[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:10.180]
Florida

[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.380]
Georgia

[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:14.600]
North Carolina South Carolina Virginia West Virginia

[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:20.240]
Kentucky Arkansas Tennessee Texas Louisiana Mississippi Alabama or what Steve has listed here

[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.560]
Now do you think that maybe we ought to like add some on air?

[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:26.840]
I will think about it

[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:30.800]
Because you don't have Montana on there for example. In fact, I started to say Montana

[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.080]
No, Idaho right

[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:36.060]
Those are boobers. What are they retards?

[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:42.180]
Those are not that they're like rejects human reject. I'd like to differ

[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:43.780]
Did he leave off?

[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:52.760]
Okay, five six seven oh five sixty we'll work on it pound five sixty on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line new suspected SARS case in

[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:54.200]
China oh my god

[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:59.920]
As China's I see I don't want to get another thing we talked about cats a little while ago in dogs

[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:04.120]
As China's older confirmed SARS patient is declared recovered and released from hospital

[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:09.080]
State-run media reported in a Hong Kong a new suspected case of the potentially deadly virus

[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:15.960]
A 20-year-old waitress has been hospitalized in place in isolation in Guangzhou in Guangdong province

[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:22.060]
The news agency zinhua reported that today dozens of people in contact with a woman have also been placed in quarantine

[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.540]
But nobody has shown in these SARS symptoms yet

[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:33.740]
Meanwhile Hong Kong three TV reporters are being tested for SARS after displaying some symptoms of the virus upon returning from visit to Guangdong

[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:39.000]
Yeah, they made a visit to long dong and other get the virus

[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.260]
Though the men have been listed the suspected SARS cases yet

[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:45.040]
They've been placed in isolation wards and are in stable condition

[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:50.240]
They initially had fever, cough and respiratory infections, but chest x-rays were normal and queer clear

[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:52.440]
More test results expected later today

[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:58.160]
And come to find out that this woman who's in quarantine now come to find out she was a

[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.220]
Wild game animal eater kind of person

[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:05.180]
You know what I mean? Yeah, no in other words Chinese

[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:12.260]
As researchers work to understand the virus scientific evidence of a possible link between SARS and animals from wildlife markets

[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:16.460]
Popular in the region has forced long a Guangdong authorities into a mass culling

[01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:19.380]
I love the way they say that like when they had the when they had the

[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:27.160]
Mad counting in England, uh-huh, well, we have to call 20,000 cattle do they call that kill call not kill but call

[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.640]
And that sounds so much cuter right?

[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:38.360]
Thousands of civet cats considered a local delicacy are being slaughtered after researchers named the animal as the possible source of the virus before it jumped to humans

[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.200]
The government says it wants to slaughter

[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:46.840]
10,000 civets by Saturday they want to get it done by Saturday despite concerns from the who the WH

[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:47.500]
Oh

[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:51.380]
That the massive stimulation could destroy evidence of the origins of the disease

[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:56.020]
The culling is also something of an embarrassment for Chinese officials who last year

[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:58.180]
Outlawed the trade civets for four months

[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:02.580]
But beging later rescinded the ban after pressure from consumers farmers and sellers

[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:07.240]
So what if we're spreading SARS all around the world and killing a bunch of people we got to do business here

[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:07.780]
It's yummy

[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.260]
additionally

[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:15.560]
Want gang Guangzhou officials have launched a major disinfection campaign a bit of an off-ide potential outbreak of SARS

[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:21.120]
Did you see the tapes on TV on the news of the the culling their scrubbing their scrubbing we're scrubbing

[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:28.540]
Everything I mean they're wiping and scrubbing and the as well as street cleaning officials aboard today large scale rant extermination program

[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:29.580]
Damn it there goes dinner

[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:37.240]
They tend to the star the SARS-Keyesan China's forced much of Asia and the full alert increasing health checks at transit entry points

[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:42.180]
Such as airports and sea terminals man. It is terminal. I know what that how's wrong with people

[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:48.280]
I guess when you got a feed of billion people the rice gets a little bit old after while I'm not joking about the rats either the rat yes

[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:52.600]
I'll be damned why why don't you tell me that when I had the rats in my attic

[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:58.860]
Oh, see I wasn't gonna put them in the freezer and had some nice delk because he's waiting when I get home or just invited nice family of

[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:00.480]
Chinese people to stay there for a while

[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:09.060]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line and what American city will you find the highest percentage of

[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.540]
Goober's red necks Yahoo's nose pickers

[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:19.620]
WDQA him hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. Great poll today brings back a lot of memories

[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:26.240]
You still have a caller that from loot loot from loose. Do you guys have any recording to that?

[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.120]
I just got through planet a little while ago chronic from loops. Oh, I didn't hear it damn

[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:35.660]
Damn, happy news. Okay back to you

[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:40.820]
Yeah, we got that chronic from loot spit. I don't know you ought to dig it up haven't played it all the time

[01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:43.480]
I'll tell you one thing

[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.480]
I would have played it again as opposed to if I didn't know which bit that was you were talking about oh god

[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:52.940]
In fact, if I had to pick the worst bit that Volker Brian ever did

[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.900]
Ever I mean ever ever and there's a few he's done it. I never played

[01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:58.900]
But that would have to be it. It's just

[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:04.360]
Just goes on like that forever. Yeah, so in other words, I may be accurate, but it's a little bit ponders

[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.100]
Kind of like the president himself

[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:11.400]
A little ponders help us this birthday today. What do you say anybody here? No, huh?

[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:13.540]
Let's show some respect to the king

[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:21.300]
Absolutely do you know tell you one thing there's a guy's gonna be low

[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:25.080]
They keep firing everybody that works with him and he's gonna be real only in that studio

[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:31.840]
Casey to the late Zach got blown out by the moe master absolutely off the morning show as he continues

[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.320]
And of course people could turn around and say well you guys can't be your boy

[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:41.480]
I don't think we can't it. I think he can't himself right the only person ever got came off of this show

[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.160]
And I said very proudly with Scott junior

[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:45.820]
Who went who will look you straight in the eye?

[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.340]
Well, no, he looked at the ceiling and with one eye and the other eye maybe look you in the eye and tell you that he deserved to be fired that

[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:54.360]
He's a nutcase a nut job. Am I right?

[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:59.500]
He's in fact he may be from one of these plays. I don't think he's from Jersey at all

[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.520]
I think he's from one of these places we got on the pole today

[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:07.120]
But Zach gets blown out a good guy like by everyone a great eater

[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.200]
Always a cleanses plate

[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:13.580]
Right

[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:20.100]
You won't find a drop a crumb on that table out there and that food counter out there in the hallway by clearance is orifice

[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:22.520]
you won't find a drug on a day that the

[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:25.300]
Zach is there he cleans it up

[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.800]
But no he ain't good enough for moe no mo

[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.820]
As he just continues playing fast and loose with the entire radio station and Greg is a little bit like that

[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:36.780]
Greg is just you know just hands off

[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:42.420]
I mean the fact that we can't even and let me also point out this not only can't we find out about whether hang's gonna be on today

[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:48.820]
Not only are we got any tickets to give away on this show like all the other shows on the station because of sports because of that

[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:56.340]
Did we get any input or output or up your ass put from muffler clearance today about the fact about our Wednesday one to two hour

[01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:01.300]
Of course not because it's not a sports show they don't give a crap. They don't care if we sit here going like

[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:03.040]
Like that for four hours

[01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:04.820]
There's an idea

[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:12.600]
No, but seriously what does that tell you you would have thought there'd been some kind of commentary some kind of opinion some kind of something some kind of input no

[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.160]
That is grace

[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:20.020]
So we'd like to use Zach you'll need it. We told him for a long time watch your back Zach and he knew it

[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:21.340]
He knew it was coming

[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:25.340]
You know it was just a matter of time before the grumpy old man were finally stabbed him

[01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:27.480]
Just stick it in there and twisted

[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.180]
WQ a and hello

[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:32.620]
Yeah, I want to talk to Neil speaking

[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:34.540]

Parks from I think I think I've had it with Orlando Orlando in Vegas

[01:38:56.460 --> 01:39:00.400]
I don't think I have any need for either one of them ever again Orlando

[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.260]
Won't see him no more. I wonder what ever happened to him

[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:08.020]
Don't you sometimes wonder what happened to some of the interesting people and even some of the boring people

[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:14.360]
So the kid huh some of them like that kid from Cincinnati that did the rap song what that was in any of that song he did

[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.120]
The rap song yeah

Close this out right

[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:32.260]
No one

[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:39.940]
Why do you say that just to be contrary? No, I think I think they've laid it out there for us 261 votes

[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:44.100]
What American city would you find the highest percentage of goobers? I mean we can you know push it till two

[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:48.040]
That's it. We're just pushing to our what's the point no pushing don't push it

[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.940]
Loots is just lead to the top all right. I am sight now, man

Loots 47, which has got to be double the permanent population of that town at Yahoo place

Nashville 46 Jacksonville 43 Tampa 39

[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:06.420]
So another and gainsville 28 sort of the top five for our Florida

[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:12.740]
Crawford Texas is moving up nicely 19 who's making a big move Tuscaloosa, Alabama 13

Maybe they don't have access to a computer right now they call in they get us to suggest and then winds up with no votes

[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:45.420]

I'm from a alien

[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:04.620]

[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:12.520]

過 этом

[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:40.500]
And there's a smell that makes you cry.

[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:51.100]
So bad I can barely see my knees as I make my straightened fingers squeezed on it for the age.

[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:59.280]
It's not hard to hold the stand in a diabetic big fat man.

[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.140]
It can't really wise up me and be no deceit.

[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:06.320]
It's so goddamn embarrassing.

[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:10.400]
Every mother's making fun of me.

[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:13.320]
An ancient with a fancy gate.

[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:16.420]
Ever thought through its doll of a day.

[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:19.640]
Ain't too personal that night.

[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:19.640]

[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:22.680]
But I had to try it once.

[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:23.140]
It takes about 10 days to be finished and finally eat.

[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:28.400]
When you do daily inside my holy senate basement kinslu rocking roll,

[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.420]
your tummy twins 4.

[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:39.700]
Oh

[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:44.940]
That's enough of a thanks

[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:51.120]
You just remind me why I really didn't like all this for long. Oh you needed that song. Oh God

[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:59.640]
Anyway, let's change that pool. Give me the final result of this one. I don't know it was a good idea

[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:06.000]
But I mean you had a good point in the beginning we could name like 50,000 different small hiccups because that's America for you baby

[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:10.700]
How many sophisticated places are there in America when you come right down to it?

[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:16.360]
But third man. Yeah, I think that's pushing it. Where's that? That's pushing it? Oh, I'm sorry the left coast

[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:17.440]
New York

[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:22.140]
Frisco Seattle all in fact places Seattle Portland

[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:23.460]
Chicago

[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:25.880]
Philadelphia, Washington

[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:27.980]
Right, right

[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:30.520]
I guess LA and some respects

[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:34.160]
That's it

[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:38.600]
That's it

[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:41.740]
I'm always getting everything in Boston

[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:46.320]
I'm a Boston's got like all those places of higher yearning and learning

[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:52.200]
Well, that's the Catholic Church for you man. See that's another place like Montreal Montreal great city

[01:43:52.200 --> 01:44:00.360]
Really I'll need interesting stuff just grotesque people needs a people transplant Boston got all these colleges and universities living in

[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.760]
Reading people and Harvard and MRT and all this stuff

[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:08.500]
But the Catholic Church runs with an iron hand like they do with the Vatican and so they always abandon this and ban and

[01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:12.320]
Tinney clubs and this and that and so everything has to be banned in Boston books. You name it

[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:14.900]
And on the one hand you got the Kennedys

[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:20.140]
And then you got like father Cushing that used to be in charge of the he used to be the Archdiocese

[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:23.320]
The head man father Cushing he used to give the head

[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:28.060]
Anyway, all we got to do is change one word on this poor Eric make it real easy for it plus of course all the names

[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:33.280]
In one American state will you find the highest percentage of goobers wasn't that a act of

[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:33.460]
In the

[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:38.340]
Added a few on there that I thought was right so we can just leave that up there

[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:41.440]
So means in the last two hours I can do all my bed times through is which have a lot

[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:44.860]
I'm gonna think of you, huh? I mean we'll take a few calls also

[01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:49.400]
We can talk more about goobers and rednecks and Yahoo's nose because I'm sure we have many of them listening

[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:54.000]
Right now well what you laughing about yeah, I mean, it's not like we're talking

[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.900]
We I noticed that when we named the bastions of great intellectualism

[01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:58.660]
We weren't talking about anywhere in South Florida

[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:05.560]
I noticed we didn't name like Miami or higher Lea or sweet water or a plantation acres or Pembroke pines or

[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:11.800]
Pembroke Lake or cemetery village or sunrise or Pompano Beach. No, we didn't do any of those things

[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.560]
Because let's face it

[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:16.220]
It's a big hicktown

[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:20.540]
What about Wilton manners while don't pick it on in now

[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:23.000]
They're not goobers you pick another not

[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:26.540]
They're neighbors they're like tubers. They like shooting you to

[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:34.060]
Oh, I'm what I what are you must be psychic look at this story Dean says faith sway decision on gay unions

[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:39.520]
How do you like that? And what did I tell yesterday about him?

[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:44.140]
Groding how he's gonna start playing the religion card now because he's been pushed into it with a special

[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:47.520]
Especially in the South where all the Bible thumpers are don't do it how he

[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:49.580]
He's already doing

[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:54.580]
Muscatine Iowa. I love that name muscatine muscatel

[01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:57.580]
Muscat here don't rather to smear it on or drink it

[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:04.660]
Democratic frontrunner Howard Dean said yesterday his decision is governor to sign the bill legalizing civil unions for gays in Vermont

[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:12.340]
Was influenced by his Christian views as he waited deeper to be growing political religious and culture debate over homosexuality and the

[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:14.780]
Vibles view of it. What about those homosexuals?

[01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:19.240]
The overwhelming did I ever tell you that story about WLAC in Nashville?

[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.780]
I've told you that for a long time ago. So it's worth telling again here. I'm doing

[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:26.320]
I guess the hours would have been like

[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:32.980]
Seven I don't know six to ten or seven of 11 at night on WLAC in Nashville November of 1980

[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:36.340]
What would Dick Casper dick was great? I like dick then I like dick now

[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:38.060]
My problem is he's dead

[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:44.120]
But no and WNW West was going down the tubes already at that point because of Luke Cron

[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:48.100]
I shouldn't pick on that cuz his kid works for our station for power, but nevertheless lose an asshole

[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:55.060]
But anyway, so I went off to Nashville and Bill Cauter went up there with me and Charlie campus and of course WLAC has got

[01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:59.060]
50,000 watts. I forget what the frequency is 1510 I believe

[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:02.760]
WLAC John R. used to be on her John Richmond, Richburg

[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:07.940]
Back in the days in the 50s and 60s playing rock music and the soul and all that other crap anyway

[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:14.800]
And so here I'm doing a talk show with like in a station that could be here in 48 states because at night time of course

[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:19.440]
There was big 50,000 watt stations boom all across the country at least they used to anyway

[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:26.300]
And I come in do the for and from the very first show I was there for a month, which is as much as I could take

[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:28.840]
talk about goobers and

[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.620]
The very first night I'm a punch up the phone

[01:47:30.620 --> 01:47:32.840]
Hey, Neela. What do you think about the homosexuals?

[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:38.220]
And then come to fight out I didn't fight on till after I left that it was somebody from Miami who was like a set up job

[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:42.900]
You know as an inside people I love the show, but it was just you know with their idea of humor like the people would say

[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:45.780]
Shamba those people they love the show, but that's their idea being

[01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:47.060]
like that

[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:54.940]
Anyway, the overwhelming evidence is that there is a very significance of Stancho genetic component to it Dean Sedman interview yesterday

[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:59.620]
From a religious point of view if God had thought homosexuality was a sin. He wouldn't have created gay people

[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:07.040]
Dean's comments come as gay marriage is emerging as a defining social issue of the 2004 elections and one that's

[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:12.020]
dividing the Episcopal Church in the US many other Christians and non-Christians that have a scapegoat all

[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:16.180]
Yeah, I mean what's life without a scapegoat? Right what's religion without a hell and without a scapegoat?

[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:25.420]
Driving the debate is a theological dispute over the Bible's view on homosexuality and a political one over the secular and spiritual wisdom of allowing

[01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:33.080]
Gays to marry Dean said he doesn't often turn his faith when may uh doesn't often turn to his faith when making policy decisions but

[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:37.120]
Sighted the civil union bill as the time that he did

[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:42.560]
My view of Christianity is that the hallmark of being a Christian is to reach out to people who have been left behind

[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:43.640]
He told reporters Tuesday

[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:47.260]
So I think there was a religious aspect of my decision to support civil unions

[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:52.760]
Earlier Tuesday when he and other candidates were asked to debate whether religions influence and their policy decisions

[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.940]
Dean was the only one not to respond

[01:48:55.700 --> 01:49:00.500]
In an interview yesterday Dean said I don't go through an inventory like that when making public policy decisions

[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:04.360]
Dean has been expanding on his religious views in the series of conversations with reporters

[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:09.780]
But his remarks the last two days for the first time he's talked about how his faith has influenced his policy making

[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:15.600]
Dean said he doesn't consider homosexual obvious in but nonetheless opposes gay marriage

[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:21.600]
The civil unions bill he signed as my governor in 2000 granted homosexual couples the same rights and protection as if they were married

[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:29.420]
Among the nine democratic presidential contenders represented Dennis Kassinich former senator carol mostly brown and Al Sharpen's support gay marriage

[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:34.760]
How do you like that? I like it. Why is carol mostly brown running? Can it's something to do

[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:40.680]
Yeah, well she lost an Illinois for her sentancy when she want to get reelected she lost there. So you're right something to do

[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:43.280]
He goes for it. I mean she's not she's good. I like her

[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:46.600]
He says a lot of the right thing. She's good. You go girl all that stuff

[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:48.640]
You have a better chance of winning right

[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:50.180]
Well

[01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:52.220]
You have a better no

[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:55.120]
Oh, and speaking of having a great chance of winning

[01:49:55.120 --> 01:50:01.240]
The New Republic endorses Jew Lieberman man and the new republic stopped being like a credible magazine many many years ago

[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.560]
As soon as they made Morton contract you the editor of new republic, which he's long gone

[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:08.280]
But nevertheless he's the one that turned that into a rag it's a joke

[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:14.400]
Democratic presidential hopeful Jew Lieberman received a strong endorsement yesterday from the new republic magazine

[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.820]
Which said the senator from Connecticut offers the clearest bravest vision for the Democratic party

[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.580]
Right, we can just call it Republican party late

[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:27.460]
In its endorsement the moderate political journal gave a blistering assessment of frontrunner Howard Dean

[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:32.400]
Saying the former Vermont governor doesn't possess the leadership skills to head the party not to mention the country

[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.040]
The Democratic party is racing back to the 80s with interest groups enforcing litmus test on everything from

[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:42.600]
Partial birth abortion to steel tariffs and party activist dangerously out of touch with the country

[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.520]
That feels threatened by terrorism not by Donald Rumsfeld the new republic said

[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:53.260]
Dean has created this mood of self-righteous delusion and his competitors have to varying degrees accommodate themselves to it

[01:50:53.260 --> 01:51:02.920]
Only Lieberman the supposed candidate of appeasement is challenging his party and during booze at event after event to articulate a different better vision of what it means to be a Democrat

[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.160]
Oh my god. I want to be ill

[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:07.240]
Wow and then enough to make you want to puke

[01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:09.660]
You

[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:13.780]
More than one new the endorsement came his new polls showed retired army general Wesley Clark

[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:18.980]
Emerging as a strong challenger to dean while Lieberman reigns far in the behind

[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:23.020]
With his tits and his months abroad pay us

[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:26.280]
Right, he's got kind of a pay us the complexion

[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:29.600]
Oh, remember I was talking to you the other day about Robert DuVon. Yes

[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:34.100]
See that first caller the second caller the first one was a good call your step

[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:39.300]
The second one that asked for who just wants to the other side of his own voice was given the lecture about what you know a lot of the stuff that you read

[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:42.460]
We already heard or know about a lot of stuff that's on your website. He's full of crap

[01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:46.520]
He just trying to get you to not do that anymore. He's full of crap. Yeah, he's another probably a bush look

[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:48.280]
He's probably looking bush right now

[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:53.960]
Anyway, here's another example Robert DuVon see it's in the Sunsental this morning

[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:58.020]
DuVon says money was Godfather three issue

[01:51:58.580 --> 01:51:59.820]
I love Robert DuVon

[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:05.260]
As an actor personally, I'm beginning to just have my doubts. You need to see that one scene from the apocalypse now

[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:11.080]
Yeah, what why is that because it's it's phenomenal. You'll you'll watch it over and over again. That's performance ever

[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:17.140]
I'm gonna have a tough time before I get back to Bobby DuVon and voting on this uh this other than I had no problem at all in the first one

[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:18.240]
I struggled a little

[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:26.100]
Tampa I mean Tampa to me for a city of that size. I just it is shocking even scour neighborhood after neighborhood block after block

[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:28.200]
uh, it's just amazing

[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:29.800]
and

[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:33.840]
You just can't find anybody that don't look like a mugwamp man like a goober

[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:36.120]
I'm serious

[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:45.300]
I got a room in the shopping mall there sure and we had 5,000 goobers there. They sure loved us until Randy started doing that bull-like thing

[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:49.980]
Oh, they like that too. No, they did not like that not with her. Okay, Jim that's

[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:56.040]
What are you looking for me? No, see they could tolerate one fact

[01:52:56.040 --> 01:53:00.160]
They could put up with me for a while but then when they had the her start doing that dyke you think they're oh my god

[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:01.280]
This is a bunch of goddamn

[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.760]
Faggot's over there. It's what it is. Figgot. Yeah, so what's the point?

[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:09.780]
We don't count to know. Figgot's up here. Well, but I'll tell you this

[01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:14.800]
They're sure happened to be a lot of them over there in Tampa. Just drop your planes first gave our ever went to and my life was in Tampa

[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:17.080]
It was called Rene's some paintings ready for that

[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:21.060]
1972 or three or something like that. How many years ago is that?

[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.180]
Absolutely no, about

[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:27.500]

[01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:28.500]

[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:30.280]
John

[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:34.940]
Jereema faxes and says when I first got here I walked into local bar and everybody looked at me

[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:40.120]
The bartender asked me where I was from. I told him New Jersey. He asked what I did. I told him I was a taxidermist

[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:46.160]
He asked what was that? I said a person who stuffs dead animals. He all out to the crowd. He's okay. He's one of us

[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:46.620]
Hahaha

[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.980]
That's great that is outstanding

[01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:54.860]
That before but it's cool but it's cute and fits right in. So no

[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:57.620]

QA-M, hello.

[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:03.700]
Hey.

[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:04.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:06.060]
Hey, because Dr. Nail.

[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:06.820]
Speaking.

[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.000]
Hey.

[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:11.260]
If you hate Las Vegas.

[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:12.520]
Yeah.

[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:14.360]
You really hate brands in Missouri.

[01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:15.840]
Really?

[01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:18.340]
Why do you say I hate Las Vegas?

[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:19.960]
I didn't say I hated, I'm burdened out on it.

[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:20.660]
I don't hate it.

[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:20.960]
Why?

[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:21.840]
It's nice.

[01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:24.440]
Let me say it again, I'm burdened out on it.

[01:57:24.460 --> 01:57:25.540]
I left enough of a contribution.

[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:26.560]
It's just ponderous.

[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:28.900]
I mean, after a while, it's just you move on to other things.

[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:29.460]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:31.240]
Yeah.

[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:32.540]
Yeah, okay.

[01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:35.840]
So light up another one's a sweetheart.

[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:36.660]
Wow.

[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:37.660]
Woo!

[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:39.820]
Man, he must have a good smit going.

[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:41.740]
Yeah, you can almost smell it.

[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:41.980]
Hmm.

[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:43.860]
Maybe just outside the window here.

[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:45.520]
Why do you know how liberal they are here?

[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:46.420]
Damn it.

[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:47.160]
Damn Canadians.

[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:49.480]
Speaking of Canadians, I got a story about Sony pop.

[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:50.360]
They banned it in the schools.

[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:51.100]
I got that later on.

[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:52.840]
That's not going to do anything with all due respect.

[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:55.340]
Okay, to my fat Canadian friends, they ain't going to cut the mustard.

[01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:57.780]
I say cut the crap.

[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:02.580]
And they got just everybody as much as all the fast food joints here is you do anywhere else.

[01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:07.140]
It's just as the big companies, the multinational corporations continue,

[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:10.720]
plundering and looting and poisoning the earth and the people.

[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:11.800]
Beautiful thing.

[01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:15.620]
Just like that story about all the species, they're going to be a stink pretty soon.

[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:17.760]
But there is no such thing.

[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:19.340]
Here's no such thing as global warming.

[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:24.320]
That's just a commie pinko thing that you know, eco Nazi people like Ted, Ted Danson

[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:25.820]
and Paul Newman keep screaming about.

[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:26.520]
They just made it up.

[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:30.760]
Anyway, actor Robert DuVal says the money was the reason he didn't appear in Francis

[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:32.260]
for Coppola's Godfather 3.

[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:35.360]
An interview to Aaron 60 minutes, too.

[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.220]
Oh, it was last night.

[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:38.020]
I would have wish I would have seen that.

[01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:39.680]
Oh, well, damn it.

[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:44.440]
He says if they paid Al Pacino twice what they paid me, that's fine.

[01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:46.520]
But not three or four times, which is what they did.

[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:52.840]
DuVal 73 told 60 minutes to correspond with Charlie Rose excerpt to release an advance.

[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:56.060]
Coppola came to my farm, parked his car, went into the kitchen.

[01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:59.260]
I said, I know you always wanted the crab cake recipe.

[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:00.280]
Let me cook it for you.

[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:03.700]
Oh, he loves to eat so I cooked a crab cake, wrote it down and he forgot it.

[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:04.460]
So we called twice.

[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:08.140]
He was more concerned that he forgot the crab cake recipe than that I would be in Godfather

[01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:08.520]
3.

[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:10.640]
How do you like that?

[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:16.380]
DuVal was nominated for a supporting actor Oscar for his role as Tom Hagen in 1972 as

[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:16.980]
the Godfather.

[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:19.440]
He also starred in 74's Godfather Part 2.

[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:22.180]
He won a Best Actor Oscar for 83's tender mercies.

[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:26.040]
His other top films included Apocalypse Now, The Apostle and a Civil Action.

[01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:27.660]
How come they left out network?

[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:30.040]
What about, what I'm just tired of it?

[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:31.240]
I'm tired of it all, man.

[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:32.700]
Give it, screw everybody.

[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:35.180]
He was so great in network, man.

[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:36.580]
Yeah, well, give it up.

[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:38.240]
God.

[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:41.560]
He was, what that was his name in network.

[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:46.040]
Frank Hackett, oh, yeah, you beat me to it.

[01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:47.180]
Frank Hackett.

[01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:50.760]
A man named Frank Hackett is sitting in the chair where Mr. Ruddy used to be.

[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:51.040]
What do you mean?

[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:54.180]
I don't think we have any network.

[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.360]
Just don't know.

[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:59.060]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think we have any Tom Hagen clips.

[02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:03.260]
The only one where he was, what I mean, can you stop this my friend?

[02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:04.080]
Who ran?

[02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:05.200]
He was speaking to him.

[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:07.520]
Do you think we have any?

[02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:09.280]
Well, I would be embarrassing.

[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:12.140]
We don't have one Tom Hagen clip.

[02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:14.600]
Call up a being a boy.

[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.620]
I mean, we got a few, we got a few centino.

[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:21.480]
You're taking a story, person like that.

[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:24.420]
And like a confirmation.

[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:29.940]
Oh, oh, God, it's so good.

[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:31.460]
But anyway, Robert Dubals, a great actor.

[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:32.580]
I wish I would have seen that last night.

[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:35.080]
Somebody you all didn't see to call us and tip this off, but they didn't do it.

[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:35.980]
Shame on you people.

[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:40.000]
Now, let's see before we start taking a few of these great calls and interspersed with

[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.580]
these fantastic stories, I M F says rise in US debt is threat to world's economy.

[02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:47.100]
Not that you people ought to be worried about that at all, of course.

[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:51.760]
Not that anybody on the talking head networks who don't even inform you about this or certainly

[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:56.780]
not on CNBC since they're a puppet of the administration anyway now, since it's GE and

[02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:59.820]
they're all in bed together, since it's all via camera, all by the same crowd.

[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:07.180]
In which American state will you find the high percentage of goobers are asking now?

[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:09.520]
I'm poll number two, 64 votes.

[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:12.620]
And so far West Virginia's got 12.

[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:13.880]
Now, why the hell would that be?

[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:14.940]
Because it's true.

[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:16.960]
All the coal mining Yahoo's.

[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:18.900]
Yeah, is it true?

[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:21.620]
I'm trying to think if I ever was in West Virginia, I'm sure I've been through there.

[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:22.460]
I've driven through it.

[02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:25.080]
I don't see there's a reason that there's a Virginia, you know, West Virginia.

[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.380]
Yeah, there's a North Carolina and a South Carolina.

[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:32.880]
Yes, when one when one state pushes all the goobers to one side and they give them their own.

[02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:35.860]
I don't give me that crap North Carolina didn't push all the goobers out of you.

[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:36.940]
You're crazy, but they try.

[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:37.960]
Oh, please.

[02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:41.520]
When was the last time you were there or the first time long ago?

[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.340]
Say many years ago.

[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:44.920]
And I drove real fast.

[02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:53.620]
West Virginia 12 Mississippi 10 with a van to one unique Alabama 9 Florida 8 Texas 7 Tennessee's only got three.

[02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:56.000]
Oh, man, you folks must be Schmitt and me.

[02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:56.800]
We've never been there.

[02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:59.620]
Tennessee's got a lot of Tennessee holy cow.

[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:04.180]
I voted for what I voted for Georgia, which also has three.

[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:06.200]
And you won the why why?

[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:08.920]
Because even there may not be any places entry.

[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:10.600]
There is a place called planes doger.

[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:16.780]
And when you got the president's brother peeing outside, you know, on the walls and you think that's got to tell you something right there.

[02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:19.240]
So I think planes might just be entry.

[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:24.980]
Arkansas's got three South Carolina three and the small potatoes after that.

[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:26.000]
We're just building this one out.

[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:29.360]
North Carolina's got a pair Louisiana two and Kentucky one out of one.

[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:30.800]
Not yet for Virginia.

[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:32.680]
And then I see you added some other ones on here.

[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:33.080]
Sure.

[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:35.560]
Montana, which I thought you told me is not the goobers.

[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:35.980]
It's not.

[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:38.020]
I own another Colorado into Brasca.

[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:40.180]
Now they do have boys.

[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:43.160]
You're selling a Brasco short missed roughly that right now.

[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:44.520]
Omaha.

[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:46.700]
Well, that's the middle of the Bible belt.

[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:49.860]
I'm going to tell you so I've told you this before and you just listen to me.

[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:52.780]
Some of the most hottest looking people of any variety.

[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.420]
Somebody can figure out what they are in Omaha.

[02:02:55.780 --> 02:02:55.960]
Wow.

[02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:58.240]
What a corn fed spoon fed.

[02:02:58.400 --> 02:02:58.940]
They're hot.

[02:02:59.220 --> 02:03:00.920]
It could be said for some of the Southern girl.

[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:02.840]
Not the fat toothless ones you see on Jerry.

[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:03.540]
Yeah.

[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:06.440]
Before they get fat and they're teaching the ones who aren't trailer trash.

[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:07.580]
How many of those are there in the South?

[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:08.840]
About the right.

[02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:10.800]
Still come out of the trailer.

[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:13.180]
Let's see.

[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:17.600]
Booge in for we just found out it says the Humper is like right on the edge of a recovery.

[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:18.980]
But it doesn't want to push it too far.

[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:19.520]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:23.900]
So we got the Booge again today, which is on the first day of the new rating period.

[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:25.560]
And we're a pretty psychotic about that.

[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:26.380]
Come on, Humper.

[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:26.960]
Get over there.

[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.440]
Even half a load is better than none.

[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:30.040]
That was right.

[02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:32.180]
That's what Mo would say half a load is better than none.

[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.500]
Hey, Mo by the way, we hate you even more than we did yesterday, which is.

[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:42.180]
If you want to told me yesterday that today I would hate more twice as much as I hated

[02:03:42.180 --> 02:03:44.780]
a mere status said, impossible is what I would have said.

[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:45.980]
Not not possible.

[02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:49.700]
A new one coming after you here after hearing that crap.

[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:51.680]
Oh, here's a more.

[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:53.220]
Is this cute?

[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:57.600]
I heard your cat bashing and taking a section with your comments cats are a great alternative

[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:00.360]
for those who live in condos and can't own dougs.

[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:03.740]
Well, I do agree that litter boxes are foul and nasty.

[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:05.040]
They're not always necessary.

[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:08.580]
I have a four year old tabby I trained to use the toilet my spare bathroom.

[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:11.840]
I applaud your efforts to raise money for the event that rescue.

[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:14.460]
But please reconsider your cat stance sincerely.

[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:15.640]
I'm Morris.

[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:18.500]
I'd love to see Morris's stance on a bowl when you.

[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:19.740]
Yeah, Morris just fell in.

[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:23.200]
And you don't have to have a cat to be oppressed by them.

[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:25.020]
They'll come and spray your house and your tires.

[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:26.520]
I talked about that.

[02:04:26.620 --> 02:04:29.380]
Can't I had a Michigan state at Abbott Hall during a summer school?

[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:32.740]
I figured it didn't show up mostly during the regular session.

[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:35.960]
So I went to summer school and I was in Abbott Hall, which was a girls dorm.

[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:36.820]
I think they knew something.

[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:39.700]
And this cat showed up and I don't know.

[02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:41.260]
I took it in one day and I was a bad mistake.

[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:44.060]
I gave it some milk or whatever and it just and that was it.

[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:45.760]
Yeah, and it wouldn't go away.

[02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:49.480]
And so we keep coming around and I would come into my room and I'd pick it up and heap it against the wall.

[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:50.780]
Stuff like I shouldn't admit that should I.

[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:51.140]
It's bad.

[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:54.320]
No, but it didn't hurt him obviously or her or whatever it was.

[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:54.920]
Didn't hurt it.

[02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:57.860]
And it just will keep coming back.

[02:04:57.860 --> 02:05:00.080]
It was just desperate for attention and affection and love.

[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:02.560]
And I just kept slamming it not slamming it, but heaving it.

[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:05.060]
You know, heaving it gently against the wall.

[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:06.380]
And it just it was fine.

[02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:07.360]
Didn't hurt it.

[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:09.560]
It was kind of like Greg Reed.

[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:10.380]
You know where there's no sense.

[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:11.080]
There's no feeling.

[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:15.020]
27 pass known at 560 WQM.

[02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:17.200]
It's the last mortgage you'll ever be needing folks.

[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:19.520]
It's the only one mortgage from financial group.

[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:21.460]
The benefits are incredible.

[02:05:21.980 --> 02:05:24.140]
Zero closing costs, zero application fees,

[02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:26.740]
zero credit bureau fee, zero discounted points.

[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:30.980]
So get yourself the new low interest rate of only 1.25%.

[02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:34.640]
If you have $100,000 on your payments or a mere $334 a month.

[02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:38.200]
If you have a $200,000 on your pay only $668 a month.

[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:38.740]
Can't beat it.

[02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:41.140]
Don't forget once you be financed you'll get you a new home mortgage

[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:44.420]
from financial group you'll never ever pay closing costs again.

[02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:47.800]
So column toll free, 1-800-940-LIN.

[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:50.020]
Get the low rate mortgage you deserve and then move to your next property

[02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:51.240]
without further cost of expense.

[02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:53.800]
There's zero underwriting fee, zero dock fees.

[02:05:53.900 --> 02:05:57.160]
You pay zero closing costs even when you move to another property.

[02:05:57.640 --> 02:06:00.740]
So get yourself the new low refinancing rate of just 1.25%

[02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:02.460]
and never pay closing costs again.

[02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:07.680]
Ask about the only one mortgage when you call financial group toll free 1-800-940-LIN.

[02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:10.840]
That's 1-800-940-LIN.

[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:13.600]
The Renewable Housing Letter restrictions do apply.

[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:17.400]
Rates are subject to change monthly 4.21 APR.

[02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:20.100]
I am the hall.

[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:22.300]
This is 4.21 PICY.

[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:23.780]
QAM.

[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:26.400]
Rogers guy.

[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:29.620]
I can't believe it, George.

[02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:32.480]
You got something by little squiggly Jerry with his, um,

[02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:34.400]
with a scoring factor.

[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:39.340]
Any time they see that we're lacking in the pool.

[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:46.860]
They promote a headline that will be you by the,

[02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:49.800]
but no, absolutely.

[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:19.840]
You got it.

[02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:30.480]
You say 9-11 is what they got you to do.

[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:36.020]
Can't get any government,

[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:39.280]
but a one party car on the green.

[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:45.180]
You believe what they say,

[02:07:45.180 --> 02:08:13.220]
but no, absolutely.

[02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:18.460]
You got it.

[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:20.260]
From 32 at 560 W.

[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.160]
You got sucked in by little squiggly Jerry,

[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:26.400]
a K.A. 8 million other names who's using even a new format on the fact that I didn't fool me,

[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.360]
didn't understand it.

[02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:28.300]
I see. Well,

[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:30.200]
it's another one of those.

[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:33.500]
Oh, you're attacking Howard again and you have a right now on one of those stupid things.

[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:34.860]
Blow out your ass, little Jerry.

[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:36.540]
Carl and Homestead says,

[02:08:36.660 --> 02:08:39.040]
if I thought for one minute you were responsible for Feral's firing,

[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:39.760]
which I was not,

[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:42.380]
I would fly up there and kiss your big fat ass.

[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:45.200]
Listening to him was like listening to a pack of Feral cats having sex,

[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:47.020]
good riddance to him says Carl and Homestead.

[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:48.960]
Well, I hate to break the news to your Carl and Homestead,

[02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:50.660]
but most of this audience liked him a lot.

[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:53.120]
How do you like that?

[02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:56.200]
Where did they come up with that that I'm responsible?

[02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:57.780]
Yeah, well, I guess everything's my fault.

[02:08:57.920 --> 02:08:58.080]
Right.

[02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:02.540]
Probably also the fault that Mo Blue Zackoff is sure too,

[02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:04.080]
because Zack actually liked us a lot,

[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:05.360]
and we are talked about him.

[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:05.880]
And so, therefore,

[02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:07.120]
you know, it was just a matter of time.

[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:09.740]
Of course, anybody on Mo Show was always just a matter of time.

[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:10.760]
That would have made a difference

[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:12.560]
if we hated Zack.

[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:14.940]
Well, maybe that would have.

[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:18.080]
Yeah, just have a spidey with a kept-a-moner.

[02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:19.340]
We hate you, Zack.

[02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:19.860]
Oh, it's too late.

[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:20.300]
Yeah.

[02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:23.240]
Britney's hometown not laughing at joke marriage.

[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.140]
Speaking of Yahoo plays,

[02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:26.800]
Kent would, oh, I want to change my vote.

[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:29.140]
No, I'm not seriously a loser,

[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:30.740]
and a man, forget about Joe,

[02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:33.040]
and you forget about how's Louisiana doing on their pool?

[02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:33.860]
I mean, Louisiana.

[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:34.960]
Never had the play.

[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:36.520]
Oh, geez, three votes.

[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:37.340]
You never were there?

[02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:38.120]
No, sorry.

[02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:39.380]
Holy moly.

[02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:41.400]
Well, watch the paper ten or twenty times again.

[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:41.680]
Okay?

[02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:43.760]
Believe me, what you see is what you get.

[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:48.280]
I mean, in fact, when you see all of those statistics,

[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:51.360]
all of the surveys about which state has got spent the most

[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:52.720]
on per child education,

[02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:55.260]
Florida is always like 49th,

[02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:56.660]
and Louisiana is always 50th.

[02:09:57.980 --> 02:09:59.800]
So, try to pick out the-

[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:01.100]
think of the rest of Florida.

[02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:03.660]
All these places we were talking about today, like Loots and two-egg,

[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:04.560]
and stuff like that.

[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:07.120]
And then, think of taking it down a couple of notches.

[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:09.360]
See what I'm saying?

[02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:11.860]
The other visited places where they didn't have no running water.

[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:13.500]
Oh, or in your-

[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:15.140]
Or in your plum and still use the outhouse.

[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:16.580]
If they had run a water,

[02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:18.440]
Louisiana, some of you have to teach them how to use it.

[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:19.600]
And we're to stick it.

[02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:24.580]
Kentwood, Louisiana, if Britney Spears marriage was just a joke on too far,

[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:26.540]
the people in her hometown think the jokes stinks.

[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.580]
The people in Kentwood, Louisiana,

[02:10:29.700 --> 02:10:32.160]
population twenty-two hundred have been cut off in the media friends,

[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:32.680]
and are thinking,

[02:10:33.100 --> 02:10:34.860]
what's Britney done for Kentwood lately?

[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:38.120]
Just kind of like what's Michael Jackson done for Dark Folks lately, huh?

[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.560]
But what a scam that was trying to get in the nation of Islam.

[02:10:41.580 --> 02:10:43.440]
And all of a sudden he's like,

[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:46.760]
wouldn't surprise me if his complication starts dark enough again pretty soon.

[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:51.480]
He's gonna start getting some of that old black paint that Al Jolson used to use.

[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:52.240]
That old black magic?

[02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:53.360]
That old black magic.

[02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:53.820]
That's it.

[02:10:56.140 --> 02:11:00.140]
Maybe you can get some of that Kiwi shoe polish from Ronnie Ray Gunn.

[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:03.380]
Reporters staked out the family home of her ex-husband, Jason Ella,

[02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:08.340]
her ex-husband, Jason Ella Alexander, who is really, I mean, he's definitive Louisiana.

[02:11:08.580 --> 02:11:09.340]
Have you seen his ears yet?

[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:11.620]
Oh, man, there's a picture right here.

[02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:15.020]
They didn't need to spend all that money on the Martian Rover.

[02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:16.480]
He could have flown it up there for him.

[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:20.620]
The sheriff was called into dispersed crowds two days in a row.

[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:24.960]
Alexander's grandfather says Alexander's father had a closest gay-rash

[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:28.020]
where he works as a mechanic because reporters kept intruding on Monday.

[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:32.020]
The co-owner of a hair salon says she wishes the improvement of her own town

[02:11:32.020 --> 02:11:34.280]
got as much attention as Spears Wedding.

[02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:36.660]
Another resident says she's not building character.

[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:37.980]
She's not a mentor to anybody.

[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:39.380]
Nobody wants her to be a mentor.

[02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:39.780]
You idiot.

[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:41.440]
You just want to hop on her bones, you mean it?

[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:41.680]

[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:42.480]
Yeah.

[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:45.680]
These are going to bury their head in her boobies and just bang the crap on her.

[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:51.140]
However, her worker at the Kentwood Museum says Spears is just a very nice hometown country girl.

[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:53.780]
That's what it says.

[02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:54.220]
Okay.

[02:11:55.140 --> 02:11:59.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, Audi AT&T.

[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:00.540]
And Verizon wireless line.

[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:01.460]
Louisiana baby.

[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:03.160]
I don't care how this pool comes out.

[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:04.760]
I just, I just got a real awakening.

[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:07.040]
Man, is that a place or what?

[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:11.400]
Alabama's leading so far in which American state would you find the highest percentage of goobers?

[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:12.760]
Goobers, man.

[02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:13.540]
Goobers.

[02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:16.580]
Alabama 20 West Virginia 15, Mississippi 14.

[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:18.200]
Just changed again.

[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:20.580]
Alabama 22 West Virginia 16.

[02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:23.720]
Florida 14, Mississippi 14, Arkansas 11.

[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:25.940]
Texas 10, Tennessee 7, Georgia 6.

[02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:27.200]
South Carolina 5.

[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:28.940]
I can't believe you people, man.

[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.480]
You ain't never been in Louisiana.

[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:33.780]
Kentucky, North Carolina, Louisiana each have three Idaho one.

[02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:35.560]
Nobody else has none out of 116.

[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:38.100]
It's a little preliminary to start them to conclusions.

[02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:40.060]
But man, Louisiana's only got three.

[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:41.580]
Holy crap, man.

[02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:42.120]
Wow.

[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:45.560]
You see like, like in Georgia, the people there are crackers.

[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:46.780]
Right.

[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:50.000]
The only thing they do with crackers in Louisiana is put them in there like chicken gumbo.

[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:50.380]
You know?

[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:51.440]
Mmm, gumbo.

[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:52.100]
Yeah.

[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:56.260]
All that hot spicy food, I think gets to their brain or something or maybe inside their-

[02:12:56.260 --> 02:12:56.440]
Correct.

[02:12:56.500 --> 02:12:56.780]
Wow.

[02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:02.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon line.

[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:03.200]
WBQAM.

[02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:05.500]
Yeah, I'll put the Indiana on the list.

[02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:07.920]
Indiana car actually should be on there.

[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:08.220]
You're right.

[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:08.940]
Thank you so much.

[02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:10.320]
Sounds a little like Reverend Jones, didn't it?

[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:10.700]
Yes it did.

[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:11.900]
That's okay, but he's right.

[02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:12.400]
That wasn't him.

[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:13.180]
Just another Yahoo.

[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:14.680]
Indiana wants me.

[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:16.020]
That's what Ardine Taylor said.

[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:17.240]
I lived in Hollywood, Indiana.

[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:17.980]
And this guy is right.

[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:22.160]
And how many times have I told you about Indianapolis?

[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:24.080]
Oh, yeah.

[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:29.160]
You think because it's in Indiana like you look on the map and it's like in the middle of the country or like even a little bit north of center.

[02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:32.000]
And so you think that the people there will be like city slickers.

[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:34.560]
They talk with deep southern draw Indianapolis.

[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:37.280]
The only good thing about that town is Bob and Tom.

[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:38.900]
Other than that, you can just Schmidt-Kannett.

[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:41.320]
So let's get Indiana on there, okay?

[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:42.400]
Third.

[02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:43.820]
Okay, excellent.

[02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:45.760]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:49.220]
I wonder if there's anybody in this audience who's been in Louisiana more than like two or three minutes.

[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:51.380]
Let's see if I'm exaggerating or not.

[02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:53.520]
It's just it is just amazing.

[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:56.480]
I mean, just dumber than sawdust.

[02:13:57.240 --> 02:13:58.460]
Dumber than our management.

[02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:00.660]
Somebody QAM?

[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:02.120]
You know, God want for you.

[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:02.900]
Yes, sir.

[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:03.400]
I alia.

[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:04.740]
I want fun with my daughter here.

[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:05.580]
Yeah, okay. Great.

[02:14:06.580 --> 02:14:07.700]
The state of high alia.

[02:14:07.720 --> 02:14:09.140]
I think this guy's in the state of confusion.

[02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:11.600]
Maybe the death of senior crews put him over the age.

[02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:12.320]
What about states?

[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:13.060]
That other countries.

[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:16.860]
Yes, states not third world countries.

[02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:17.660]
Okay, Schmuck.

[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:18.340]
Amigo.

[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:19.260]
Amigo Mio.

[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:21.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:22.660]
Pound 5, 60.

[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:25.380]
I think one of the greatest accomplishments they can write it on my tombstone.

[02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:27.100]
It'll make those 31 people happy.

[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:28.120]
Want to dance on my grave.

[02:14:28.420 --> 02:14:29.600]
They can carve it right on there.

[02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:32.340]
He sold Luis Miguel Records to Redneck's in Tampa.

[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:33.520]
Remember that?

[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:36.160]
That's my, that's my greatest accomplishment.

[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:38.080]
I'm not going to change anybody's political opinions.

[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:39.300]
I'm not going to change the world.

[02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:45.300]
But I actually inspired the cracker Redneck Yahoo's in Tampa to go to their record stores and buy Luis Miguel Records.

[02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:50.000]
That was, and I'm not talking about the people in Ebor City, no speaking in glaze.

[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:51.220]
They weren't listening to us anyway.

[02:14:52.060 --> 02:15:00.060]
I'm talking about actual born again, Bible thumping, Yahoo, a stick-hate-n-uh, Jew-hate-n-uh, etc.

[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.880]
Or speaking of that, let's hear it for all of illegal aliens, while the sudden, cool, pretty soon you're going to be like, okay in our book.

[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:09.320]
I don't want to talk about that yesterday because it makes me sick to my stomach.

[02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:11.100]
Not that it was pandering, you understand?

[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:11.640]
No.

[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:14.360]
That's how we want that spit vote.

[02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:15.120]
No.

[02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:17.460]
The most out of South Florida where they already got it.

[02:15:17.780 --> 02:15:18.380]
What a joke.

[02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:19.140]
What a disgrace.

[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:22.860]
They're people waiting right now who filled out all their paperwork, waiting patiently.

[02:15:23.140 --> 02:15:23.880]
Like legitimate people.

[02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:24.100]
Right.

[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:25.680]
No people who sneak in illegally.

[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:27.440]
That's tomato papers, lawbreakers.

[02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:32.880]
And to hear the rationalization, oh well they had some bitch on CNN yesterday.

[02:15:33.020 --> 02:15:36.440]
They gave her like about a five minute uninterrupted, somebody from the administration.

[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:40.980]
And they just let her give propaganda, bap bap bap bap bap.

[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:42.160]
And nobody challenged her.

[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:44.420]
These people are here, Elaine.

[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:47.300]
And she, well, these are very productive people and their paying taxes and they have jobs.

[02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:49.600]
Yeah, they have jobs that maybe some other schlepper might want.

[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:51.860]
And even Americans don't want to hear illegally.

[02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:52.360]
Right.

[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:58.780]
We don't want illegal aliens being legitimized just so that President Bush can get a few more speak votes out of like the Southwest somewhere.

[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:03.240]
And if they would pay normal wages, then Americans would take those jobs.

[02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:10.660]
Not to mention one of the one of these very few issues that the Republican Party has ever had that I would agree with them on is,

[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:13.380]
is illegal immigration, the whole immigration issue.

[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:22.040]
I agree with them 8 million percent and not like a turn ass like this and suck up to illegal aliens and say, hey, listen, that's the K-year Amidus, man.

[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:24.180]
What a pile of crap.

[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:26.040]
So obvious and so flagrant.

[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:30.840]
This is the thing that just frost my ass and have to control myself again, getting upset because I can't do nothing about it.

[02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:32.320]
It's how stupid the people are.

[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:33.740]
Which I'll get to don't let me forget that article.

[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:40.640]
The S-factor explains Bush's popularity by Neil Starkman in the Monday Seattle Post Intelligence Circuit.

[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:41.620]

[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.220]

[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:16.380]
25 votes. Sorry. West Virginia 19, Mississippi 17. Florida does doing well 16. What state's got the highest percentage of goobers?

[02:20:17.260 --> 02:20:21.320]
Just changed on me again. I want to see how Louisiana is doing. Is it moving up a little bit?

[02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:26.360]
Louisiana still got only six. It's sucking wind. It's 2468. Who do we appreciate?

[02:20:26.880 --> 02:20:28.980]
Louisiana's down there in ninth place. It'll do better.

[02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:34.480]
I guess these people ain't never been to Louisiana. The only place they would have been in Louisiana would have been Nalins, I guess.

[02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:36.480]
Because they were drunk and all hell.

[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:39.340]
I forgot what a toilet it was. That's part of the problem.

[02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:45.600]
The S factor explains Bush's popularity writes Neil Starkman and the Seattle Post Intelligencer.

[02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:47.460]
So forget to read that article. The S factor.

[02:20:47.620 --> 02:20:47.980]
Oh, okay.

[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:55.660]
Mayions of words have been written as to the motivations of voters, particularly in close elections as in the 2000 presidential contest,

[02:20:56.140 --> 02:20:59.300]
pundits and lay people alike of spectally that my people voted for whom.

[02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:05.140]
The exit poll has been a major tool in this speculation, but the speculation misses the mark by far.

[02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:12.020]
It's increasingly obvious, for example, that none of the so-called theories can explain present and bushes popularity, such as it is.

[02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:21.140]
Even at this date in his presidency, after all that's happened, the president's popularity harbors it around 50% and astonishingly high figure, I believe, given the state of people's lives

[02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:22.540]
now as opposed to four years ago.

[02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:31.720]
What can explain this popularity? Can that many people be enamored of what he has accomplished in Iraq, of how he's fortified our constitutional freedoms with the USA Pay for You Act,

[02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:40.540]
or how he's bolster our economy, or how he's protected our environment? Perhaps they've been impressed with the president's personal integrity and the articulation of his grand vision for America.

[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:41.480]
Is that likely?

[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:47.820]
Granted, there are certain subsections of the American polity that have substantially benefited from this presidency.

[02:21:48.420 --> 02:21:56.700]
Millionaires and charismatic Christians have accrued either material or spiritual fortification from bushes of administration, but surely these two groups are a small minority of the population.

[02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:00.460]
What then can it come for so many people being so supportive of the president?

[02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:10.620]
The answer I'm afraid is the fact that they dare not speak its name. It's the fact that no one talks about the posters don't ask it, the media don't report it, the voters don't discuss it.

[02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:19.340]
I, however, will blur out its name so that at last people can address the issue and perhaps it ought strategies to overcome it. It's the stupid factor.

[02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:25.660]
The stupid factor, the S factor, some people sometimes do no fault of their own, are just not very bright.

[02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:36.900]
Stupid. It's not murder that some people are insufficiently intelligent to grasp the nuances of foreign policy of constitutional law of macroeconomics or the very agitated interplay of humans and the environment.

[02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:44.820]
These aren't the people I'm referring to. The people I'm referring to cannot understand the phenomenon of cause and effect. They're perplexed by issues comprising more than two sides.

[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:51.020]
They don't have to wear with all to expand the sources of their information and above all, far above all, they don't think.

[02:22:51.560 --> 02:23:06.560]
You know those people, they're all around you. They're not you else you wouldn't be reading this article this far. They're the ones who keep the Pearl shows on TV who appear as regular recipients of the Darwin Awards who raise our insurance rates by doing dumb things, who generally make life much more miserable for all of us than an ought to be.

[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:11.600]
Sad to say they comprise a substantial minority, perhaps even a majority of the populists.

[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:27.880]
Politicians have been aware of this forever. They cater to these people. They offer simplistic solutions to complex problems. They evade directed questions with non-sequitors. They are for meaningless, jingoistic, pap instead of thoughtful policy. And these people, the S people, eat it all up with a ladle.

[02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:39.160]
I don't have a solution to this problem to claim I did would be lying my previous arguments, but I do have some modest suggestions that might provide a start for discussion and intelligence test were in the right to vote.

[02:23:39.160 --> 02:23:49.120]
A three significantly stupid behavior is your outlaw, finds for politicians who painted the lowest common denominator and deportation of media representatives who perpetuate such actions.

[02:23:49.880 --> 02:24:00.760]
It's well past time that people confront this issue no matter who's offended, we're on the way to becoming a nation of imbosils. I'm certain that a plethora of George W. Bush jokes is already being circulated in every capital of the world.

[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:11.960]
We can stop this sapping of our national integrity, but we'll must do it soon, lest the morons become the norm and those of us who use our brains for more than memorizing advertising jingles are ourselves ostracized from society.

[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:23.040]
Let's start talking, let's bring the S factor out of the closet into the daylight where we can all see it, go up at its hideousness and finally make serious attempts to bring it to bay. What a great column.

[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:34.260]
We'll start from the original Seattle. The S factor explains Bush's popularity. Oh, it's the adult. Yeah, well, see that's in all those places that we mentioned before with their people with a brain larger than their penis. It's amazing.

[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:43.960]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60s got his thumb right on him and of course the states that we're talking about. Now the interesting part of it is.

[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:56.140]
And I wish tell about a save that thing. See, we always Schmidt can stuff that we should save later on. Remember what a tough time we had finding the electoral map and the Bush one organ. I said you're full of crap and turned out I was right for once the site was wrong.

[02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:10.600]
But at any rate, let's take a look and just out of memory. Okay. I could screw up on this easily, but let's take a look at all the states that we have listed on our gooberia poll 155 votes. Alabama's leading Indiana.

[02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:18.720]
Grow in Indiana. No Montana Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Virginia, Nebraska, Kentucky, South and North Carolina, Louisiana.

[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:33.020]
I did grow in any of those that he went Louisiana. I don't think so. Pretty sure he didn't. Pretty sure. Tennessee, Texas, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida, stolen West Virginia, Alabama.

[02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:41.320]
The only one I haven't endowed is West Virginia. No, he didn't win that. The West Virginia very often goes Democratic. I'm a recent that at the time did not win that.

[02:25:41.640 --> 02:26:00.560]
So we've got two, four, six, eight. Who do we appreciate? 10, 11. Let's see after the Carolinas 13, 15, 17, 19 states with goobers. They're running for the Cooper capital of America and the Bush one every one of them. Why do you like that? I'll run it that way. Speaking of the S word.

[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:18.080]
56670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line WQM. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing today? Sensational. Great. I got a suggestion for your poll. Yeah. How about Missouri?

[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:27.220]
Missouri, Missouri. No, I don't think I drove through St. Louis once like real fast. I saw the golden arch and I was about it. Never spent no time in Missouri.

[02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:33.840]
But you know, I wish I was able to get through yesterday. I had a really good suggestion for your poll yesterday. Hannity Comes.

[02:26:35.100 --> 02:26:45.380]
Or you like to dance on their graves. Hannity was on there. He was man. He's horrible. He got a vote. I got 31 votes. So by the way, I'm pretty proud of that. I was right on Michael Jackson's ass.

[02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:59.620]
Yeah, they're probably all Yahoo's and Michael Jackson lovers and little pedophiles could be. Hey, I did you hear on the news? They found out where all of Saddam's chemical weapons were. They're all on the US Alabama.

[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:06.620]
Okay. And I have a great day. We're the one holding it for him. I have a great day.

[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:28.720]
5 6 7 0 5 6. I thought they were in his mouth. Right. Those weapons of mass. I like that myself. Yeah, but nobody. Unless you're so when you stop and think about the fact that Jay Leno's got writers and he never says anything funny and Letterman's got writers who are getting paid a fortune. You know, they sit around. You saw that piece where they showed Leno and the brain.

[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:40.680]
The more brains dormant, the more important and the crap that they come up with. And you know, when you when you just babble a lot of stuff like we do, I mean sooner or later, you come up with something pretty clever and not getting paid too much for your case.

[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:55.980]
5 6 7 0 5 6. The pond. That's your say that business about our one to our yesterday. There was like a turning point. We had a phenomenal response on our website for the first time in a long time. In fact, post for L firing is a matter of fact. It looked like we were on the verge of making a comeback.

[02:27:55.980 --> 02:28:03.700]
Now we're taking these two stupid polls today and websites a little on the weeks. But that's okay. I have to feel like we're like to make a move turn the corner. So to speak.

[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:16.960]
And our operations manager, he comes in and with his usual line of I don't know not. I don't know not. You know, and then the program director, he's too busy sticking his nose deep inside the beast rectum. And so, you know, I need the one of them like oblivious.

[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:34.240]
And they got this giveaway thing with tickets to try to with ties people listen to the radio station. Do we get anything? No, we just had a death now month in November in a trend. The worst month I think I've ever had in modern history in South Florida. Just a death now where they just use that the diaries is a weapon to attack us.

[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:49.440]
And so do we get any assistance? Nothing. Nothing. We don't get the time of the day because we're not sports. We're not sports. They can take their ball games. Man, Clarence can take that football and Charlotte. So far up is that the beast will fall right out. How do you like that?

[02:28:50.500 --> 02:29:06.600]
The beast hit will flip right out next time. How's Louisiana doing? Still always six. I'll be dead. I don't think anybody's been in Louisiana except Nullings and I'll tell you, oh, we love Nullings. We got drunk and had a great time. Got lead. That big easy. That day. The big, uh, sleazy K. W Q. A.m. Hello.

[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:36.220]
Neil. Yes, sir. The Gorvadaw guy. Hello. How you doing? Okay. How give you a run for Louisiana? The Louisiana is really awful. Arcadia and Florida. I mentioned that last hour. Arcadia is unbelievable. Yeah. That's where they burned out the kid. It was a hemophilia. What is it? That's where they burned out the kids family. Remember he called the AIDS. That's right. That's right. Yeah. And that's where the mental institution is too. And I think it's no coincidence.

[02:29:36.660 --> 02:29:53.920]
Exactly. Good talk to you. Have a great day, Pali. Okay. Hang in there. Hang in there. I felt early and often this year, man. We're going to have a real campaign. We're voting for Dr. Dean, even if he don't win the nomination. Dr. Dean, right? Or Jimmy Dean or Alan Burke. He was the Dean. That's Mr. Burke.

[02:29:54.380 --> 02:30:16.200]
Dean. Dean. Dean. Dean. Dean. That's very good. He's super. 5 6 7 0 5 6. You got some bad zits, though. Man, wouldn't you think that if he was Superman, he had a better complexion than that? Like Tom Mullings got a real nice smooth complexion. I haven't watched that show all season long. Aren't you embarrassed? Have you watched it? Oh, the new season doesn't start till next week.

[02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:46.180]
Or the new world, whatever the holiday break about this last season starting in the fall when he started with a new show. I didn't see you mostly. I didn't see one of my just I just lost my interest. It's just not a good show. It was slow. It's slow. I mean, how many times can you look at Clark and the Atlanta and okay, great. Maybe they're going to do something. Oh, none of the chicks were getting naked either. No, they had that one like that. And then the blonde, a sad sack. What's your name? It's always Jones and friends. She's always jailed Chloe. Yeah, you know, just do something. Change it. You know, it's like passions. My name is

[02:30:46.180 --> 02:31:14.740]
I got it. I love that show. It's a panic, but sometimes it just goes on for weeks and nothing happens. And by the way, we need to see a hell of a lot more from Mrs. Wallace lately. And Tola Allister to turn back into Charlie. He was a lot better as Charlie. Five six seven. I love doing it when I have I know that you have no idea what I'm talking about. I'm not sure. Of course, Sheridan who still looks great. Even the straight jacket. She looks good. My life and look old. This is 4356. You're way in. You're way in.

[02:31:16.940 --> 02:31:27.700]
Here you are. And the new Roger wanted to have my personal stable approval. But I'm not sure if that's a young Elvis or a fat elf like you. Like you were what?

[02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:35.620]
One man trapped in a strange world must defend his honor, his woman, and also that weird cult thing he can do.

[02:31:37.600 --> 02:31:40.880]
He was the safest man who ever lived.

[02:31:42.100 --> 02:31:49.660]
Tom Cruise is the last Scientologist. It's as legitimate as any other major religion. Only for some.

[02:31:50.240 --> 02:31:59.280]
The last Scientologist, if you call him gay, he'll sue you for a hundred million dollars. But if you call his religion crazy, he'll cut you in half.

[02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:14.680]
Likewise, with a four foot samurai sword. He's even willing to die for Dionetics. He is the last Scientologist.

[02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:22.980]
What do you want from me? I mean, besides my fame, my fortune, complete control of my life. Oh yes, my soul.

[02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:31.480]
Tom Cruise is the last Scientologist. Unless you count John Tabote, Jenny Ellerman, and a few other gullible Hollywood airheads.

[02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:35.120]
The last Scientologist is now playing with your mind in a theater near you.

[02:32:35.480 --> 02:32:40.020]
Oh, now they say that the chopper that went down black hawk was hit by a missile. I sick.

[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:47.300]
And now they're also saying that all nine on board were American. The soldiers that all did. So that means that with the one that died in the mortar attack out of the 35 that were injured one of them died.

[02:32:47.540 --> 02:32:49.860]
So we got 10 dead American soldiers in the last 24 hours.

[02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:55.980]
Well, you know, we got bigger fish to fry. We got more important things to worry about that. Like let's buy Pete Rose's book. Right.

[02:32:56.120 --> 02:33:01.680]
I'm going to tell you right now anybody buys Pete Rose's book. We will come to your house. We'll send Luca Brozzi in fat rich to break both your legs.

[02:33:03.380 --> 02:33:10.820]
Assholes. Thank you, Brad. Tony's. I'll Brad from Tony's brought the guys food and George is talking with his mouth. I was polishing over here.

[02:33:10.820 --> 02:33:20.220]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T. Verizon wireless. Let me forget the more in doubts column to Tizzy over lezzies.

[02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:30.700]
I love it. No, you love it. Yes, I do religious displays per debate in nation's parks. We got to get to that and somebody sent us a whole bunch of things about religion.

[02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:36.780]
Again, John Adams said this and Thomas Jefferson said that and this one said that, etc.

[02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:46.020]
You're preaching the choir, baby. We agree with you, but it's just a sand situation because another thing if you look at those states on our mugwump guber list,

[02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:55.380]
what's the one common denominator besides the ignorance level is religion. Good old time religion, man.

[02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:08.320]
I bet you you find more churches per capita per square inch in those states than you'll find anywhere on a face of the globe, even in Jerusalem, even in Nekka.

[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:16.220]
Remember Jean Pittany and Nekka? Nope. Alabama 29. I don't like to grammar on a poll, Eric. I don't want people to think you're illiterate.

[02:34:16.220 --> 02:34:24.400]
He says in which American state has the highest percentage of goobers? Good to think we can leave out the word in right.

[02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:32.720]
I mean like bubble would say what does it mean? What's what? Can you get a what what?

[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:42.540]
Which American state has got the highest percentage of goobers? Alabama continues holding the lead. I'm trying to think if I ever stopped in Alabama. I kept on going. I drew through a lot of them states.

[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:50.600]
No, I missed some of those central states. And I think if I had wrote a bus to the central states, you call Alabama's a central state. You know what I mean?

[02:34:51.180 --> 02:35:03.080]
Love the center. Not on the coast. It's not on the coast. Not this coast. Not the sides. Just keep going, man. You'll be in China pretty soon eating civics.

[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:28.940]
I'm going to go home and vote for Louisiana when I get done. South Carolina six Kentucky three to brass. Good to one for Virginia one for Idaho.

[02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:32.640]
And none for Montana. Wyoming Colorado Indiana.

[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:43.620]
I think that's a different breed is what we're talking about. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line WQA. Hello.

[02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:58.540]
Hey, yes, sir. I got one for the older poll, the dance on the grape. Well, actually more than one because it's an institution, the Electoral College.

[02:35:58.540 --> 02:36:20.740]
Yeah, I am in. I'm in that. Definitely, definitely should happen yesterday. No, it should happen three years ago. Right. And also, well, there's a part of the global total. I'm a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:38.800]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a much more of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a wavelength.没有 de rise in my exceptions.

[02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:43.380]
Well, sí, ooo, ok, oh no no didn't mean at all, but first of all, the last way I followed the Valvios Quiz episode that I added in all directions that味 is?

[02:36:43.380 --> 02:36:49.880]
Well, I have another thing that I can't give up, ahright. So if you do have a few words and ask them if there is anyone on the earth and ask them if there are any Last.

[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:53.740]
word. Oh, it's the only it's not this polite to say to mix

[02:36:53.740 --> 02:36:56.720]
company, but why not? No, that's true. Why do you think

[02:36:56.720 --> 02:36:59.520]
your springers got an unlimited supply for his audience

[02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:01.700]
there? And for also with the people on the panel, especially

[02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:05.900]
the part where I'm not causing effect. But I've got to

[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:07.960]
do a lot of Mississippi. They're smart. Well, the

[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:11.940]
best part of so what's wrong? You're dead. That's what's

[02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:14.100]
wrong with you, man. Too many cheaper, there's too many

[02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:18.000]
peanut butter and anna sandwiches. What a hog, huh? Well,

[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.440]
that's the price of fame, man. That's the price of fame.

[02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:22.540]
Just asked to be still tell you look at the way he

[02:37:22.540 --> 02:37:26.440]
ballooned up again, like a pig. He's he's moving back into

[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:29.940]
the Mosho is what I'm here. They're having a great deal

[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:35.280]
of difficulty finding someone. Anybody out there in the

[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:38.520]
world like to work on a Mosho doing a worldwide

[02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:41.020]
talent. I heard that anybody who's trying to work on a

[02:37:41.020 --> 02:37:42.880]
Mosho after the first couple of days will probably be a

[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:45.020]
no show is what I'm hearing. They're digging just

[02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:48.200]
like me. He's got no show. Same difference, right? Absolutely.

[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:51.100]
Thank you. Let's see. It says you give me a rationale

[02:37:51.100 --> 02:37:53.060]
crappier that they when I said in the facts that the

[02:37:53.060 --> 02:37:55.160]
move on dot org loads for the alternative ads was not

[02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:57.600]
working well. They keep sending me notices on the count

[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:00.000]
times for voting and reggae. Ray, I can't. Well, don't be

[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:05.160]
with Jesus. What am I supposed to do about this? The ads

[02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:07.540]
are great. Yeah, they are great from move on dot org. Just

[02:38:07.540 --> 02:38:10.140]
man, talk about a whiners. One thing when people whine in

[02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:12.540]
your ear when they're whining on your facts machine, that's

[02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:16.200]
bad. There's nothing worse than whining just ask what's

[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:19.120]
his name from clock or corns. What was his name? Alex? Right.

[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:23.040]
He was wondering a large. He was whining. Was it large? You

[02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:24.620]
look kind of large to me when he's standing there getting

[02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:28.820]
his his prison outfit. Remember that scene? The target

[02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:31.580]
65532. Hungry right down there on the table.

[02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:39.120]
560, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. What a

[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:41.940]
great movie, man. What a great one. One of the all time

[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:55.420]
best. WQAM. Hello. Q. I. M. Yes. How are you? Happy new

[02:38:55.420 --> 02:39:00.160]
year. Crazy person. WQAM. Hello. Yeah. I wanted to tell you

[02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:02.300]
about something that happened to me in New Orleans. The way to

[02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:07.580]
head. Very gentlemanly older gentleman cab driver talking to

[02:39:07.580 --> 02:39:10.900]
me about where you from. I said I'm from Miami and he said,

[02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:14.860]
he said, how them Jews, niggers and sticks doing in Miami.

[02:39:15.420 --> 02:39:18.000]
Yeah. And I said, well, I don't know about the niggers and the Jews,

[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:23.600]
but us sticks are doing just fine. Yeah. Real goober. No, you

[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:26.220]
wouldn't want to know if we're looking at him. But once you open his mouth,

[02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:29.580]
he'd be established it clearly. How about you? He got a big tip, huh?

[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:33.420]
Yeah. I give him a big tip. And I hope you're stuck in the right

[02:39:33.420 --> 02:39:36.320]
place too. Okay. I like you, Pally. I like it. Don't go back.

[02:39:36.460 --> 02:39:40.880]
Don't go back again, man. Oh, that's the Nashville thing. They're

[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:45.440]
talking about kikes and sticks and niggers and all that. And Nashville.

[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:49.720]
No, although some of them are clever enough to try to like, you know,

[02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:54.640]
cover it up a little bit, you know. Not too much. Oh, you're just

[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:57.500]
going to love Nashville. There's two kinds of people. People in Nashville.

[02:39:57.500 --> 02:39:59.860]
And then everybody else like them people from the Northeast and

[02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:04.180]
M. Jews, you know? Yeah. Wow. What a place. Man, I couldn't get

[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:07.340]
out there fast enough. Although it was really, it was kind of a trip,

[02:40:07.340 --> 02:40:11.080]
though, being on WLAC 48 states. We took, it was 1980.

[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:15.660]
It was right before the 80 presidential election. And we took a poll.

[02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:19.340]
I think it was either the night before the election or a couple of days before.

[02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:23.800]
And we had calls from 48 states. Ready for this? Is that impressive or what?

[02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:28.340]
Without being syndicated without nothing because of that phenomenal signal WLAC hit.

[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:33.420]
And Reagan won in a landslide and shown off just just the way the poll came out.

[02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:35.940]
I mean, maybe just a coincidence, but just the way our poll came out.

[02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:40.200]
Oh, he just whipped Carter's ass big time. How do you like that?

[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:42.020]
What do you think about the homosexuals?

[02:40:46.900 --> 02:40:49.360]
5670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:54.000]
Wireless line. We're kicking ass, baby. Our own. We got the mad dog at two.

[02:40:54.060 --> 02:40:57.360]
All right. Boaster for the Ailing Humberman for the loaded four.

[02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:59.440]
Hank, this is going to be four days in a row. That's bad.

[02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:02.100]
Are we getting any news on his condition?

[02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:06.320]
No, no, no. What condition he's in like Kenny Rogers in the first edition said.

[02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:08.180]
No. Well, why not?

[02:41:08.980 --> 02:41:09.760]
I don't know.

[02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:13.000]
I think that the people out there are a little bit concerned about the Humber and so am I.

[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:14.900]
And I'm sure that this was everybody else in the building.

[02:41:15.140 --> 02:41:17.200]
We care about Hank unlike Mo. Absolutely.

[02:41:17.620 --> 02:41:21.580]
We wish you, you know, in fact, maybe we could like get what's your name? Linda Blair.

[02:41:22.820 --> 02:41:26.000]
And father Mirrin together again, we can conduct an exorcism.

[02:41:26.060 --> 02:41:30.500]
We can take we can take the evil spirits out of the Humber's body and stick it in the Mo's

[02:41:30.500 --> 02:41:33.540]
back dome. Right? Absolutely. It sounds good to me. Yeah. I like it.

[02:41:36.020 --> 02:41:39.660]
WDQAM. Hello. Yeah, howdy. Yes, sir. Howdy.

[02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:44.780]
You just had a question about a couple of articles right on the.

[02:41:45.700 --> 02:41:47.500]
On the radio. I wanted to know if I could find that.

[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:49.460]
Sir, sorry. Go ahead.

[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:54.660]
He's Neil, Neil Starkman, the ass factor. You know, I could find that.

[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.680]
Right on our website, NeilRogers.com. It's on there right now today.

[02:41:58.260 --> 02:42:02.580]
Okay. And there's one yesterday from someone named Tom Harbin. I don't know where that came from.

[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:07.340]
It's also on our website. If you click on above above the stories, there's a link.

[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:10.440]
It says for articles from previous days, the features page.

[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:14.100]
And just click on yesterday's date. And you'll it's right on there.

[02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:18.100]
Wonderful. How do you like that? I like it. You ask it. We got it. Thank you.

[02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:20.780]
I'm not telling you. How do you like that? How are there people actually reading

[02:42:20.780 --> 02:42:23.520]
their articles? Which this crap about? Well, you shouldn't be reading on here.

[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:25.040]
I'll do whatever the hell I want. How do you like that?

[02:42:26.220 --> 02:42:28.300]
Oh, sir. I'm serious. If we sat here, what?

[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:32.060]
Like that, which is a little bit too much chatter will get Tom Ridge all upset.

[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:36.080]
A lot of chatter. We'll have red alert pretty soon.

[02:42:36.140 --> 02:42:39.100]
If you don't want to remember, the rumor has it that we're going back to yellow alert pretty soon.

[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:42.660]
We're not supposed to tell you that. I mean, nobody's supposed to tell you that, but that's the rumor.

[02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:45.860]
Is that we're soon going back to yellow alert?

[02:42:47.340 --> 02:42:51.860]
Now, what level of alert do you think we're going to be in the days and weeks just before the

[02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:56.100]
2004 election in November? Well, they're going to scrap the whole system because the world will be safe by that.

[02:42:56.220 --> 02:43:00.320]
Right. That's right. Now that we got Sodom, things are a lot better and we're safe.

[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:03.100]
Even though we had 10 American kids butchered overnight again,

[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:06.920]
last 24 hours, even though they're still dying in Afghanistan.

[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:11.420]
That's over though. That's right, but that part of it is over. We saw that GI George.

[02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:14.020]
That didn't work out too well. So then we had to...

[02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:18.080]
I mean, they even talked about it blatantly about the first photo off didn't work out.

[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:22.920]
So we had to take that fake turkey that stuck turkey to Iraq that day.

[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.020]
I was going to say to bag that, but actually it was to the airport.

[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:25.600]
Right.

[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:27.820]
They were asking a lot of the troops what they thought about it.

[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:30.880]
And of course, they didn't see him because he was out there in one place and then high-tailed it out of there.

[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:35.260]
How come Hillary decided it was so much safer to be in the city and actually move it around a little bit

[02:43:35.260 --> 02:43:36.160]
and talk it to some people?

[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:40.520]
How come that is? Not that I'm defending that page, but how come that was okay for her,

[02:43:40.780 --> 02:43:43.260]
but El Presidente, man, they damn near turned around and went back.

[02:43:43.260 --> 02:43:48.220]
And that was all based on a bogus story they made up about the B.A., the British Airways of

[02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:53.780]
Pilot, who saw it? A bogus bogie. Yeah, bogus bogie. God, it's just...

[02:43:53.780 --> 02:43:57.260]
But the end, you know, I feel a lot better after reading that S-factor thing, man.

[02:43:58.200 --> 02:43:58.680]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:43:59.340 --> 02:44:02.080]
Because at least here's somebody else articulating what I've been saying all along.

[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:06.120]
You're just not supposed to say that, no? Because it sounds like condescending, like,

[02:44:06.180 --> 02:44:08.020]
and believe you me, I don't think I'm very smart.

[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:09.880]
Maybe smarter than average.

[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:15.120]
George, and George has all this encyclopedia of meaningless trivia in his mind,

[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:16.100]
which is great. That's his real side.

[02:44:16.100 --> 02:44:18.020]
But if he was so smart, how come he's working for Greg Reed?

[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:19.260]
That's right. Because I need a job.

[02:44:19.820 --> 02:44:20.480]
Right, there you go.

[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:23.400]
So if we're so smart, what the hell are we doing here working for peanuts?

[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:29.980]
George, and Josh, I mean, what he's making, you couldn't even afford to buy today's lunch one,

[02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:32.660]
so what's he going to do? Exactly. He's one?

[02:44:33.020 --> 02:44:34.360]
Twenty. Is he really?

[02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:34.740]
Yes.

[02:44:35.340 --> 02:44:37.300]
He's a little bit too old for Michael.

[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:43.160]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60, pound, five, 60 on a 18th.

[02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:47.000]
I'm telling you, all of the different calls I've had over the years, it's amazing to me how they,

[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:53.120]
like, at various times, rush back through my feeble brain. It's just, especially that one bitch,

[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:57.100]
well, you know, you could be saving the world and doing something productive, but you'd rather sell

[02:44:57.100 --> 02:45:02.160]
out for ratings and can't ugly morons out there. Yeah, remember, I talked about her the other day,

[02:45:02.180 --> 02:45:03.600]
but I just can't get her out of my head.

[02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:06.840]
What a nasty, hateful, miserable swat.

[02:45:07.300 --> 02:45:10.640]
I hope you died already, honey, okay? I hope somebody ran over you with a goddamn

[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:14.800]
tractor trader and just ripped your ass into smithereens. In fact, it's too bad that you and

[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:18.160]
Molle weren't hanging out together when it happened. God, what a piece of schmitt.

[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:25.820]
One-th-thirteen. He is. He is, man. I think you could pick, you could pick seeds out of his arms.

[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:31.900]
One-thirteen at five, sixty, WQ, and maybe a little bit of corn out of his earlobe, too. Probably

[02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:33.740]
under his balls. What was his room?

[02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:39.020]
Oh, yeah, in fact, it was Amsterdam. There was a store, a mushroom store. There are many.

[02:45:39.260 --> 02:45:41.260]
It said these used to be under most balls.

[02:45:43.380 --> 02:45:47.440]

there. Oh, God, you would have just been crappin' your pants. And I was, too, man.

It's a dream. It's democratic idols.

[02:47:23.460 --> 02:47:30.860]
As long as the Blacks work of this genre team, I could sleep night.

[02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:41.320]
Not the weak night. They also want to get off. Yes. Yes.

[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:45.460]
Get off. You ain't seen nothing yet.

[02:47:47.480 --> 02:47:49.320]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

[02:47:50.220 --> 02:47:59.000]
Do it. Do it. Indeed, I did have 200 sexual relationships. Do it. Do it.

[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:01.260]
And everybody. Do it.

[02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:04.880]
Democratic Idol on Fox this fall.

[02:48:07.980 --> 02:48:14.760]
Sui for who I really am. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:18.320]
Thank you, Elvis.

[02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:22.320]
We're calling a friend.

[02:48:24.740 --> 02:48:26.620]
I can't walk out.

[02:48:29.180 --> 02:48:32.560]
We call that love too much.

[02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:37.900]
Happy birthday, Elvis. Elvis Presley's birthday and Sui

[02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:39.860]
sales. Who is the other one? I forgot.

[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:40.960]
I don't know.

[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:41.420]
I don't know.

[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:45.380]
Very good. Even though it's not right.

[02:48:45.540 --> 02:48:48.260]
Anyway, judge will change Peterson trial location. Do we care about that?

[02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:48.540]
No.

[02:48:48.900 --> 02:48:50.020]
What we're supposed to see.

[02:48:50.340 --> 02:48:53.420]
Well, look at that picture of Mark Garagos on here. Man, oh man. He is such a

[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:55.020]
divestment. He makes me ill.

[02:48:55.940 --> 02:48:58.640]
A judge said just a while ago, he'll move the location of the trial of

[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:01.080]
California, man. Accused of killing his wife and their unborn son.

[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:05.940]
No additional details were known about Stanislaus County Superior Court judge.

[02:49:06.340 --> 02:49:10.460]
Al Guirur Lamy's decision to move the trial of Scott Peterson away from his hometown of

[02:49:10.460 --> 02:49:11.540]
Modesto, California.

[02:49:12.380 --> 02:49:16.480]
During selection for Peterson's trial schedule of begin January 26th and Modesto, but

[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:17.980]
that date may change as well.

[02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:20.600]
But there you go. There's bushes and Florida.

[02:49:21.140 --> 02:49:23.700]
Who is that? That's not gonna be Catherine Harris that I'm seeing there.

[02:49:23.740 --> 02:49:24.380]
Who is that bitch?

[02:49:25.100 --> 02:49:25.660]
You know, it's hit earth.

[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:26.280]
Yeah.

[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:27.900]
The George Bush is going to be trying to get today.

[02:49:27.960 --> 02:49:28.440]
Yes, it is.

[02:49:28.440 --> 02:49:31.920]
And so it's like groundhog saying you know, you wake up and it's the same thing.

[02:49:32.020 --> 02:49:32.720]
Oh, it's Catherine.

[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:33.480]
I knew it.

[02:49:33.500 --> 02:49:35.140]
I could smell it right through the TV.

[02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:35.840]
I could smell it.

[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:37.660]
It's not in father here and his brother.

[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:41.080]
And then we have cat cars possibly getting ready to run again.

[02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:44.180]
And we have a ballot dispute in an election.

[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:46.300]
So nothing really has to.

[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:48.960]
Here's the schmuck from the upon beach post on their Frankservino.

[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:51.120]
Hey, Frank, you're kissing too much ass.

[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:52.620]
Okay, you're looking too much bush.

[02:49:53.620 --> 02:49:54.340]
So there you go.

[02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:57.220]
They're going to move the they're going to change the venue when the Peterson trial.

[02:49:57.320 --> 02:50:00.120]
Mark Erickos got a shmitty and look on his pistols usual.

[02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:03.200]
Something about guys with certain kind of a mustache, you know.

[02:50:04.140 --> 02:50:04.820]
You know what I mean?

[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:06.640]
Yeah, well like Rimmer.

[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:08.760]
That kind of a mustache.

[02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:10.020]
The whole mustache thing.

[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:13.700]
Never invent and never invest any money with a guy like that.

[02:50:15.740 --> 02:50:18.320]
Which he wouldn't ever better take that word in out of there.

[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:20.140]
They're going to think he's totally illiterate.

[02:50:20.340 --> 02:50:21.700]
Which American state will you?

[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:22.680]
What?

[02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:24.940]
Oh, I see here.

[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:27.660]
We did in which American state will you find the highest percentage of goobers?

[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:28.460]
My bad, Erick.

[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:28.960]
You're the best.

[02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:30.680]
Alabama 32.

[02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:32.080]
Mr. Sippy's got.

[02:50:32.260 --> 02:50:32.660]
Factor.

[02:50:32.980 --> 02:50:34.240]
West Virginia 27.

[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:36.020]
Florida does got 25.

[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:37.640]
Arkansas.

[02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:41.300]
See, I think I can buy that because at least Florida's got a date,

[02:50:41.300 --> 02:50:42.500]
Robert and Palm Beach in Monroe.

[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:46.420]
Whereas these other states, you look around and say, okay, well, where's

[02:50:46.420 --> 02:50:47.660]
where are the intellectuals?

[02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:48.560]
I hate to say it.

[02:50:48.660 --> 02:50:49.780]
Like, where's the hospital for the whole?

[02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:50.240]
The whole of the city area.

[02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:50.540]
Right.

[02:50:50.780 --> 02:50:52.540]
We're the big city slickers, you know,

[02:50:52.660 --> 02:50:54.980]
where the people who are actually were once in the civilized place.

[02:50:55.220 --> 02:50:58.940]
The, you know, Florida 25 Arkansas 22,

[02:50:59.140 --> 02:51:00.840]
Georgia 21, Texas 16.

[02:51:00.880 --> 02:51:02.180]
I bet you there's plenty of that.

[02:51:02.380 --> 02:51:03.960]
Texas is so freaking huge.

[02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:04.420]
Yeah.

[02:51:04.980 --> 02:51:06.840]
Takes a lifetime to just to drive through it.

[02:51:07.240 --> 02:51:08.780]
Tennessee 13, Louisiana 12.

[02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:10.120]
At least it's in double digits now.

[02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:11.560]
It's right on Tennessee's ass.

[02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:14.240]
North Carolina 10, South Carolina 9.

[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:15.360]
How do you like that, George?

[02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:17.340]
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

[02:51:17.380 --> 02:51:19.360]
Oh, there it's, it's, uh, there's Hicks.

[02:51:20.760 --> 02:51:21.720]
Kentucky 6.

[02:51:22.340 --> 02:51:23.000]
Nebraska 2.

[02:51:23.180 --> 02:51:25.780]
Virginia 1 out of one Indiana 1 out of 228.

[02:51:25.900 --> 02:51:26.360]
Wyoming Colorado.

[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:27.400]
My tender have any.

[02:51:28.360 --> 02:51:29.200]
No groovers.

[02:51:29.200 --> 02:51:29.960]
Those three states.

[02:51:29.960 --> 02:51:30.600]
Thank God.

[02:51:31.380 --> 02:51:34.980]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T.

[02:51:35.080 --> 02:51:36.420]
And Verizon wireless line.

[02:51:36.460 --> 02:51:37.920]
Did I put somebody on hold online too?

[02:51:37.980 --> 02:51:38.220]
Hello.

[02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:38.920]
Neil.

[02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:39.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:43.160]
Hey, um, I only got the 2 in about 12 30.

[02:51:43.340 --> 02:51:44.180]
But did you see that?

[02:51:44.180 --> 02:51:47.060]
I think it was on 60 minutes last night about when Bush

[02:51:47.060 --> 02:51:48.880]
was governor of Texas.

[02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:52.000]
How he put pressure on all the schools out there to

[02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:53.740]
improve their dropout rate.

[02:51:54.800 --> 02:51:56.400]
And he never improved the dropout rate.

[02:51:56.540 --> 02:51:58.640]
But he just he was trying to make teachers accountable

[02:51:59.220 --> 02:52:00.960]
for the students that were dropping out.

[02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:03.740]
And they were what they were doing is they were

[02:52:03.740 --> 02:52:07.900]
instead of writing down the code for the student dropping out.

[02:52:07.900 --> 02:52:09.860]
They would just say that the student transferred

[02:52:09.860 --> 02:52:13.620]
to another school when in fact they were dropping out.

[02:52:13.620 --> 02:52:17.380]
And that I was trying to leave no dropout behind program.

[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:19.700]
Yeah, well, he got up on his soapbox and wave

[02:52:19.700 --> 02:52:21.480]
disarm and said, look what I've done here.

[02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:23.060]
And our dropout rate has gone down.

[02:52:23.060 --> 02:52:25.880]
But in fact, all the teachers that they interviewed at

[02:52:25.880 --> 02:52:28.960]
all the schools all over Texas were saying that they're,

[02:52:28.980 --> 02:52:31.420]
hey, there's something wrong because I know for a fact

[02:52:31.420 --> 02:52:32.960]
these kids are dropping out of school.

[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:36.000]
They are not being relocated to other schools.

[02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:39.200]
The dropout rate in fact was it was the same or at

[02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:41.980]
worse than most of the rest of the schools in the country.

[02:52:41.980 --> 02:52:44.020]
Smoking mirrors man. Smoking mirrors.

[02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:45.900]
Yeah, he was and here he was waiting for

[02:52:45.900 --> 02:52:49.120]
the new says the students in our Texas can't be taught,

[02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:50.540]
you know, in the front of high or

[02:52:52.500 --> 02:52:53.780]
good like to us, pali.

[02:52:53.780 --> 02:52:55.840]
I hope he falls off and breaks his neck.

[02:52:57.280 --> 02:52:58.140]
We're dumping that.

[02:52:58.740 --> 02:53:00.020]
There's some good news. I'll see it in red.

[02:53:00.020 --> 02:53:00.620]
Did you dump that?

[02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:02.260]
All the time.

[02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:04.560]
Yes, there's good news about what?

[02:53:05.340 --> 02:53:06.600]
We need to get a style that we're in.

[02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:08.180]
We're in Ron CFO Andrew, fast out.

[02:53:08.300 --> 02:53:09.760]
I'll plead the overducing or prison time.

[02:53:09.760 --> 02:53:11.720]
That's the first thing we'll be contacting them shortly

[02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:13.220]
to see what they have to say.

[02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:16.020]
Miles Jen Rogers and Houston, we'll check in with you.

[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:18.040]
I want to know when Kenny Boy is going to be on the inside.

[02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:19.040]
That's what I'd like to know.

[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:20.660]
Well, that's what this deals all about.

[02:53:20.900 --> 02:53:21.700]
I understand that.

[02:53:21.980 --> 02:53:23.840]
I'd like to know when Kenny Boy is going to be cool in his

[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:25.080]
heels in there for about 20 years.

[02:53:25.100 --> 02:53:26.020]
About 30, man.

[02:53:26.180 --> 02:53:26.340]
Years.

[02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:28.940]
Shouldn't we be allowed to throw a tomato's Adam like,

[02:53:29.020 --> 02:53:29.840]
remember the stocks?

[02:53:30.540 --> 02:53:33.940]
During the colonial days when they put someone in stocks and you can.

[02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:35.260]
Oh, when you start talking about the stocks,

[02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:36.660]
I thought you were talking about Mitch Hersh again.

[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:37.680]
Well, him too.

[02:53:38.020 --> 02:53:39.240]
Yeah, let's throw some tomatoes at him.

[02:53:39.240 --> 02:53:40.300]
I'd get his badge.

[02:53:40.320 --> 02:53:41.440]
The Lidra should be a lot too.

[02:53:41.540 --> 02:53:43.800]
What I lost, I could probably buy every tomato in the country.

[02:53:43.960 --> 02:53:45.360]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:46.560]
And who can take them?

[02:53:46.980 --> 02:53:47.880]
Look at that phone, man.

[02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:49.520]
There's not a line ringing on there on screen.

[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:51.280]
It was that's got to be a hoot, man.

[02:53:51.380 --> 02:53:52.400]
That really tells me.

[02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:55.500]
See any problem being this pole we got here now.

[02:53:55.620 --> 02:53:57.160]
We don't need to add any more states to it.

[02:53:57.280 --> 02:53:57.760]
See what I'm saying?

[02:53:58.700 --> 02:54:01.060]
And so now unless the phone is disconnected or something,

[02:54:01.180 --> 02:54:02.460]
that sounds like it's working fine to me.

[02:54:02.820 --> 02:54:05.540]
Their mom, which means I can read all the rest of my bedtime stories.

[02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:06.580]
Oh, that's okay.

[02:54:06.760 --> 02:54:08.420]
Well, it's okay with me because they got nothing to say.

[02:54:09.160 --> 02:54:09.600]
WDQIM.

[02:54:10.420 --> 02:54:10.960]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:11.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:12.900]
How you doing?

[02:54:13.400 --> 02:54:13.640]
Okay.

[02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:15.960]
I got a good redneck state for you.

[02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:17.920]
South Carolina is my vote.

[02:54:18.020 --> 02:54:18.820]
And I'll tell you why.

[02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:23.240]
The other here, I was riding through that state coming home for new years

[02:54:23.240 --> 02:54:23.600]
even.

[02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:25.140]
I get pulled off or buy

[02:54:26.420 --> 02:54:27.840]
office, sir, Huckleberry.

[02:54:29.380 --> 02:54:30.420]
Right, right.

[02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:32.220]
He comes up to the window and he's like,

[02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:34.100]
more, come on out of that car.

[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:36.240]
This ain't the right to fly state.

[02:54:36.780 --> 02:54:39.200]
Because that's going to be $104 fine.

[02:54:39.320 --> 02:54:42.580]
And you got to play that right now or I'm taking you to jail.

[02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:43.860]
I'll be them.

[02:54:44.300 --> 02:54:46.840]
So I'm like, everybody get your wallets out.

[02:54:47.740 --> 02:54:50.540]
And let's give the nice officer what he wants

[02:54:51.460 --> 02:54:53.320]
so we could be on our merry way.

[02:54:53.500 --> 02:54:54.200]
He's like, thank you.

[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:54.940]
Welcome back.

[02:54:55.120 --> 02:54:57.260]
Come on back to South Carolina whenever you can.

[02:54:57.440 --> 02:54:58.380]
This is all for the pool.

[02:54:58.900 --> 02:54:59.860]
You know, you got to say right,

[02:54:59.960 --> 02:55:01.040]
y'all come back now here.

[02:55:01.500 --> 02:55:02.040]
Y'all come back.

[02:55:02.540 --> 02:55:06.120]
So I'd rather I'd go around if I have to go up more

[02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:07.620]
or I'll drive all the way around.

[02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:10.420]
I'll never ride through that Huckleberry town again.

[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:12.840]
Even hop in the old boat and take the ocean pass.

[02:55:13.140 --> 02:55:13.580]
Yeah, five.

[02:55:14.220 --> 02:55:15.480]
I'll pretend I'm a Cuban.

[02:55:15.580 --> 02:55:16.140]
I'll get on a ramp.

[02:55:16.540 --> 02:55:17.000]
There you go.

[02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:17.900]
Good luck, you, Polly.

[02:55:18.180 --> 02:55:18.320]
Thanks.

[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:21.200]
Say hi to Ali on 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:23.120]
Don't forget all those illegal aliens now.

[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:24.900]
See, it too bad he wasn't here a little bit sooner.

[02:55:25.260 --> 02:55:27.560]
He could have probably stayed and worked at you pick him.

[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:31.460]
The Pakistanis, they work at you floater.

[02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:33.480]
And of course, the Mexicans, they work at you pick him.

[02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:34.100]
What a joke.

[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:39.940]
And again, you'll see he they used to call Reagan the Teflon

[02:55:39.940 --> 02:55:40.280]
president.

[02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:41.180]
They've had other politicians.

[02:55:41.180 --> 02:55:42.500]
They call Teflon this one.

[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:44.420]
This man is the the ultimate.

[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:46.500]
He's the ultimate Teflon human being.

[02:55:47.020 --> 02:55:47.960]
And I use the term loosely.

[02:55:48.540 --> 02:55:51.920]
There is absolutely nothing that he can do or say that's going to get the media

[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:54.420]
to finally open up a mouth or certainly most of the public.

[02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:57.420]
Maybe it's that S word coming to play again.

[02:55:57.900 --> 02:55:58.880]
I think you could be.

[02:55:59.040 --> 02:55:59.740]
I know it.

[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:01.040]
I know what S stands for.

[02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:01.760]
Trust me.

[02:56:02.260 --> 02:56:03.080]
You can smell it.

[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:06.380]
126 at 560 WQA.

[02:56:06.380 --> 02:56:07.760]
And we got the mad dog at two.

[02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:12.080]
The booster is in again today for the Humper who's who's ill and bad, I guess.

[02:56:12.340 --> 02:56:12.900]
He's under the weather.

[02:56:13.820 --> 02:56:17.800]
Too many too much hall of a maybe one too many meals at either Joe Stone grabs

[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:20.960]
at the Rascal House to think that might have been I think that could have put him over the edge.

[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:22.600]
Lose an answer to Humper.

[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:24.220]
We sure as I want him back tomorrow.

[02:56:24.220 --> 02:56:24.620]
Don't we?

[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:25.720]
Absolutely.

[02:56:26.220 --> 02:56:29.080]
I mean, if we get through this entire week without the Humper, we got real tourists.

[02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:34.260]
Inter-Rex Diabetic is a product you ought to check out because it's a meal replacement drink

[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:34.940]

The local business is five cities.

The rate is all yours.

We're back here we am.

[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:05.400]
You drugs packin'?

[02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:16.240]
My pants don't fit real tight.

[02:58:16.900 --> 02:58:20.760]
Something is there, but it's really small.

[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:26.760]
I look at never in your zone, you look at me.

[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:32.460]
And then you say something right.

[02:58:34.140 --> 02:58:42.500]
You know me, what would it take to make you see that I'm a guy?

[02:58:43.360 --> 02:58:46.120]
If I had some destiny, let's go.

[02:58:47.080 --> 02:58:51.560]
And then I could grow some racial hair

[02:58:51.560 --> 02:58:53.840]
and couple of desks because

[02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:57.900]
I'm hanging side by side

[02:58:57.900 --> 02:59:00.780]
if I had some badger juice.

[02:59:01.980 --> 02:59:07.220]
And then I walked technically beyond the land.

[02:59:08.020 --> 02:59:13.420]
So we'd preserve dear glens if I had some desks because

[02:59:21.760 --> 02:59:26.780]
I would have sound like Kelly Clarkson.

[02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:28.920]
A couple of desks because

[02:59:28.920 --> 02:59:32.720]
I'm the standup when I be.

[02:59:33.300 --> 02:59:35.540]
If my baby is a fool,

[02:59:37.180 --> 02:59:41.680]
maybe I have some male fans.

[02:59:42.300 --> 02:59:43.400]
If I had a girl,

[02:59:43.400 --> 02:59:44.400]
maybe I have some male fans.

[02:59:45.980 --> 02:59:48.380]
If I had some desks because

[02:59:50.320 --> 02:59:52.860]
if I had some desks because

[02:59:54.840 --> 02:59:56.680]
132.560 WQM.

[02:59:56.740 --> 02:59:59.360]
Have you heard of a planet that heats up its sun?

[03:00:00.580 --> 03:00:01.700]
Yes sir.

[03:00:02.420 --> 03:00:04.380]
Stars usually heat up their family of planets,

[03:00:04.380 --> 03:00:08.560]
but an amazing reversal on astronomers discovered a planet that's actually heating up its sun.

[03:00:10.500 --> 03:00:12.340]
Just like that brought in a Palm Beecher,

[03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:14.660]
she'd like to heat up your sun if he's about 11 or 12 years old.

[03:00:14.720 --> 03:00:15.620]
No, not that kind of sun.

[03:00:16.340 --> 03:00:18.120]
Canadian astronomers reported this week that

[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:21.340]
there's study of a large planet orbiting a star in 90 light years away,

[03:00:21.660 --> 03:00:25.640]
shows that the magnetic field of the planet is producing a hot spot on its parent's sun,

[03:00:26.040 --> 03:00:29.220]
a reversal of the effect the sun has on its own planets such as the Earth.

[03:00:30.740 --> 03:00:33.840]
The planet is one of a 119-known extrasolar planets,

[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:35.800]
objects that orbit stars rather than the sun.

[03:00:35.800 --> 03:00:38.860]
The star called and it's got like a number is very much like the sun,

[03:00:38.940 --> 03:00:43.840]
HD with 18 numbers. The planet is a gas giant, 270 times larger than the Earth,

[03:00:43.980 --> 03:00:47.180]
almost as big as Jupiter. The largest planet in the solar system,

[03:00:47.440 --> 03:00:50.660]
it circles very close to its parent star, completing one orbit every three days,

[03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:53.180]
and moving at 350,000 miles an hour.

[03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:57.180]
Eugenia Schholnick, who used to work at Shlomi's,

[03:00:57.440 --> 03:00:59.800]
of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver reported yesterday

[03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:02.200]
in the National Meeting of the American Astronomical Society,

[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:05.780]
that she and other astronomers have discovered that as the planet orbits its star,

[03:01:05.780 --> 03:01:09.180]
it causes a hot spot within the outer gaseous layers.

[03:01:10.660 --> 03:01:12.540]
The hot spot moves across the surface of the star,

[03:01:12.680 --> 03:01:15.520]
keeping pace with the planet, but just a little bit ahead, Schholnick said.

[03:01:15.880 --> 03:01:19.440]
She said measurements of more than 100 orbit show that the hot spot on the face of the star

[03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:22.060]
exactly matches the motion of the planet.

[03:01:22.420 --> 03:01:23.820]
It puts the motion in the planet.

[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:24.420]
You ready for that?

[03:01:24.700 --> 03:01:25.120]
Wow.

[03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:28.060]
Pretty interesting for those who can follow that.

[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:32.100]
Religious displays spur debate in nations' parks.

[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:36.580]
Why can't you religious assholes leave the rest of us alone?

[03:01:36.860 --> 03:01:37.340]
Please!

[03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:38.620]
For our own good.

[03:01:39.040 --> 03:01:40.880]
Just leave us alone, please!

[03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:41.960]
They're helping us.

[03:01:42.420 --> 03:01:43.580]
Oh, God.

[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:48.980]
With its eye-catching photographs of the Grand Canyon and the Blue Waters of the Colorado River,

[03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:51.000]
the hard-backed Grand Canyon in a different view,

[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:53.580]
is a medium-cellar at the National Park's Bookstore.

[03:01:54.200 --> 03:01:59.680]
But, but the books claim that the Grand Canyon was formed as a result of the great flood of Genesis,

[03:01:59.680 --> 03:02:01.780]
and is therefore only a few thousand years old,

[03:02:01.980 --> 03:02:06.700]
has thrust the park into the debate of whether it's fitting to display religious materials at public sites.

[03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:10.360]
The book by former Colorado River Guide Tom Veil,

[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:13.480]
includes a collection of essays by fellow creationists,

[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:16.520]
who favor a Bible-based view of Earth's formation.

[03:02:17.260 --> 03:02:19.720]
Veil and his wife are founders of Canyon Ministries,

[03:02:20.180 --> 03:02:23.300]
which organizes Christian whitewater rafting trips through the canyon.

[03:02:24.380 --> 03:02:28.620]
Some critics say the book is the latest example that the National Park Services caved into pressure

[03:02:28.620 --> 03:02:33.820]
from conservative and fundamentalist Christian groups accommodating their request to post-or-altern materials.

[03:02:34.180 --> 03:02:38.860]
The overall concern is that the top managers of the park service are implementing a conservative agenda

[03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:41.980]
that is at odds with their duties as custodians of nation's heritage,

[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:45.340]
said Jeff Rook, Director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility,

[03:02:45.700 --> 03:02:47.740]
a non-profit group of federal and state resource workers.

[03:02:48.660 --> 03:02:53.400]
But National Park Service officials deny the accusation, say they seek legal advice before acting.

[03:02:54.020 --> 03:02:57.800]
The criticism began just weeks after Grand Canyon and the Different View went on sale at the park's Bookstore

[03:02:57.800 --> 03:03:00.320]
in August, said Park spokeswoman Don Ossicki.

[03:03:01.740 --> 03:03:04.120]
This is a book that by its cover, Shouts of,

[03:03:04.520 --> 03:03:09.040]
this is a biblical interpretation of how the Grand Canyon came to be in only a thousand, thousands of years.

[03:03:09.480 --> 03:03:11.640]
This is a decision to approve an essence-a religious book.

[03:03:12.740 --> 03:03:17.780]
Grand Canyon officials let the book on store shelves but refer to the National Park Service headquarters for review.

[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:23.420]
And the dispute over the book came only weeks after Scripture bearing displays,

[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:27.360]
posted at the park caused a similar debate that led to the signs removal and return.

[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:32.980]
Placks quoted the Bible were first placed at senior points of the Canyon South Rim, about 30 years ago,

[03:03:33.340 --> 03:03:35.960]
by the evangelical sisterhood of Mary.

[03:03:37.220 --> 03:03:41.360]
Grand Canyon officials took them down this summer after an inquiry from civil libertarians and consultations

[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.680]
with the U.S. solicitors office Ossicki said.

[03:03:45.180 --> 03:03:48.360]
Then the National Park Service ordered that the plaques be returned to the Grand Canyon,

[03:03:48.640 --> 03:03:53.400]
while officials took a second look at the issue, now the Justice Department is be viewing whether the plaques

[03:03:53.400 --> 03:03:55.700]
should be taken down permanently or remain on the park.

[03:03:55.700 --> 03:03:57.880]
We're just not comfortable making that decision, you see.

[03:03:58.020 --> 03:03:58.760]
Wow, there you go.

[03:03:59.180 --> 03:04:00.620]
They just won't stop.

[03:04:00.900 --> 03:04:01.660]
They won't stop.

[03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:02.960]
They got to stick it everywhere.

[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:04.740]
They got to bumpers stick around their car.

[03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:06.820]
They got to plastic Jesus on their hoods.

[03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:07.560]
They got it everywhere.

[03:04:07.700 --> 03:04:10.100]
They even got to paste it on their air-be-freaking place.

[03:04:10.300 --> 03:04:10.920]
They have to do that.

[03:04:11.340 --> 03:04:11.920]
Why is that?

[03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:15.560]
Because otherwise, your blood will be on their hands.

[03:04:16.260 --> 03:04:19.100]
If they don't get you into heaven, even against your will.

[03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:24.780]
As Confucius once said, it's hubbim and dread.

[03:04:26.620 --> 03:04:27.560]
That's what he said.

[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.280]
Just because you're too stupid to know how damned you are.

[03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:32.660]
You're too stupid to know how damned you are.

[03:04:32.660 --> 03:04:32.880]

The president has raised $130.8 million and are showing a brutal willingness to do whatever it takes to secure key bases.

[03:05:45.780 --> 03:05:49.060]
The president has recorded his spanish by saying we try to extend more legal rights to the state.

[03:06:04.980 --> 03:06:12.860]
The president has said we make illegal immigrants legal, but honor our values while conservatives went on TV to how the vice president was re-rewarding criminal behavior.

[03:06:13.220 --> 03:06:18.820]
The president probably figures that the Republican-led Congress will never pass it anyway so we can get credit and states like Florida.

[03:06:19.040 --> 03:06:19.040]

Across between sex and the city and Budweiser ad, the L word features women sitting around the table at a restaurant,

[03:07:55.860 --> 03:07:59.360]
Tarlie dishing and dating, dishing about dating, grooming and getting pregnant.

[03:07:59.700 --> 03:08:03.680]
But with these very unflannel lesies, the search for fresh meat and new blood is confined to one sex.

[03:08:04.120 --> 03:08:05.440]
Babies come through a sperm and a cup.

[03:08:05.780 --> 03:08:11.780]
The waxing discussed there even raunchier and the weary, worldly bond moths are along the lines of lesbians think friendships in other word for foreplay.

[03:08:12.400 --> 03:08:18.160]
It's hard to figure out that America seems ready to embrace W and the L word at the same time, the new L word that is.

[03:08:18.380 --> 03:08:18.960]
How do you like that?

[03:08:18.960 --> 03:08:19.620]
That's a good point.

[03:08:20.580 --> 03:08:21.180]
Yeah.

[03:08:21.260 --> 03:08:24.080]
They love the W. Meister and they love bikes too.

[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:45.440]
I stand.

[03:08:45.440 --> 03:08:48.440]
All right.

[03:08:54.300 --> 03:08:57.060]
We made a mistake.

[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:01.080]
A vision that we slank.

[03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:06.320]
By covering that whole library of soil.

[03:09:09.860 --> 03:09:15.920]
Fixing that whole thing with weapons that we bring.

[03:09:16.840 --> 03:09:20.760]
Still more germ oil beginning to boil.

[03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:28.680]
We stay in our time again and life here we are built.

[03:09:31.360 --> 03:09:35.020]
Searching for our pieces for in the salt.

[03:09:38.340 --> 03:09:44.300]
Some people claim we got George Bush to blame.

[03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:45.940]
You heard your right.

[03:09:47.500 --> 03:09:49.640]
It's all George Bush's fault.

[03:09:59.080 --> 03:10:01.660]
I bet you this is the president's favorite illness song.

[03:10:07.980 --> 03:10:09.360]
Can't find a line my mind.

[03:10:17.740 --> 03:10:20.340]
When you think Glenn Campbell is thinking about that right now.

[03:10:27.580 --> 03:10:28.340]
Oh, sorry.

[03:10:28.960 --> 03:10:30.120]
A little bit too much Elvis there.

I just keep mentioning that we got the Panthers at the Philadelphia Flyers tonight.

[03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:40.640]
Any interest? No.

[03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:43.440]
Oswet Hot Panthers man. They got 37 points.

[03:10:44.020 --> 03:10:46.180]
They're only six points out of first and a brutal.

[03:10:46.180 --> 03:10:48.360]
A really bad division the all-time worst.

[03:10:49.200 --> 03:10:51.820]
IMF says rise in US debts is threat to the world's economy.

[03:10:52.200 --> 03:10:53.720]
I mentioned that before. Should I read like a little bit?

[03:10:54.100 --> 03:10:54.200]
Yes.

[03:10:57.320 --> 03:10:59.600]
Well, nobody cares the markets are up again today.

[03:11:00.020 --> 03:11:01.220]
There's coal and powla on there.

[03:11:01.220 --> 03:11:03.260]
Was that capability within Iraq?

[03:11:03.460 --> 03:11:07.700]
Yeah, right. He's responding to the Carnegie report that says that war wasn't the best option.

[03:11:07.900 --> 03:11:09.060]
That's right. I got that story.

[03:11:09.320 --> 03:11:12.360]
But I mean, it's like talking about preaching to the choir being a dead host.

[03:11:12.660 --> 03:11:16.720]
They said there were no weapons of mass destruction and it was all misrepresented.

[03:11:17.240 --> 03:11:20.360]
In fact, before I get to the IMF story, I'll actually use that one from the BBC.

[03:11:20.740 --> 03:11:24.900]
Of course, worship administration officials have been accused of misrepresenting the threat

[03:11:24.900 --> 03:11:26.480]
from Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.

[03:11:26.660 --> 03:11:30.260]
The accusation comes in a report from the influential elective center Carnegie endowment

[03:11:30.260 --> 03:11:32.620]
for international peace, which opposed the war in Iraq.

[03:11:33.240 --> 03:11:37.720]
It also said there was no evidence for the claim that Saddam Hussein would give such weapons to terrorists.

[03:11:38.200 --> 03:11:42.620]
The US and UK said it concerns over weapons of mass destruction and justified the invasion of Iraq last March.

[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:50.020]
Meanwhile, a 400 strong US military team that was searching in Iraq for nuclear biological and chemical weapons

[03:11:50.020 --> 03:11:53.620]
reportedly has been withdrawn. Bye-bye. See ya.

[03:11:53.880 --> 03:11:56.300]
And that has been the consistent view of you and inspectors.

[03:11:56.400 --> 03:11:56.800]
Yeah, right.

[03:11:57.700 --> 03:12:02.360]
You're a freaking liar, man. You're a sellout. You're a piece of crap and your son's an even bigger turd.

[03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:05.360]
How do you like that? Rollin' colon. You make me sick. Anyway.

[03:12:06.220 --> 03:12:10.520]
Getting back to the IMF, with its rising budget deficit and ballooning trade imbalance,

[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:13.760]
the United States is running up a foreign debt of such record-breaking proportions

[03:12:13.760 --> 03:12:18.560]
that it threatens the financial stability of the global economy, according to report released yesterday,

[03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:21.280]
by the IMF, the International Monetary Fund.

[03:12:22.240 --> 03:12:26.400]
Prepared by a team of IMF economists, the report sounded a loud alarm about the shaky,

[03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:31.180]
physical foundation of the US questioning the wisdom of the Bush administration's tax cuts

[03:12:31.180 --> 03:12:37.280]
and warning that the large budget deficit's post-significant risks, not just for the US, but for the rest of the world.

[03:12:37.900 --> 03:12:42.060]
The report warns that the US, you know, it would seem to me that when they had these debates,

[03:12:42.620 --> 03:12:47.980]
instead of asking stupid questions like boxes or briefs or stupid-ass crap like that,

[03:12:47.980 --> 03:12:50.740]
they maybe they ought to get a little bit more dialogue about stuff like this?

[03:12:51.380 --> 03:12:53.020]
You think? Yeah, but then who'd watch?

[03:12:54.240 --> 03:12:58.660]
That's right. The report warns that the US net financial obligation to the rest of the world

[03:12:58.660 --> 03:13:02.080]
could be equal to 40% of its total economy within a few years,

[03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:05.460]
an unprecedented level of external debt for a large industrial country,

[03:13:05.540 --> 03:13:08.340]
according to the fund, that could play a havoc with the value of the dollar

[03:13:08.340 --> 03:13:11.240]
and international exchange rates. And let me tell you personally right now,

[03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:14.220]
just to have him come back from Europa, the dollar ain't worth a crap.

[03:13:14.800 --> 03:13:17.760]
You can't buy squat. You can't even squat on it.

[03:13:18.500 --> 03:13:21.420]
The euro is now like a buck 27, 28, something like that,

[03:13:21.520 --> 03:13:24.620]
and even the Canadian dollar is up to like almost 80 cents a.

[03:13:25.500 --> 03:13:29.380]
Two years ago today, the Canadian dollar was worth 62 cents against the US dollar,

[03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:31.220]
now it's like 78.5 cents.

[03:13:31.740 --> 03:13:33.040]
Enough to make you a barf.

[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:37.400]
The danger, according to the report, is that the US voracious appetite for burrowing

[03:13:37.400 --> 03:13:41.620]
could push up global interest rates and thus slow global investment and economic growth.

[03:13:42.320 --> 03:13:46.580]
Higher borrowing costs to broad would mean that the adverse effects of US fiscal deficits

[03:13:46.580 --> 03:13:49.840]
would spill over into global investment and output to report said.

[03:13:51.180 --> 03:13:55.360]
I don't like, of course, the White House poops it, but many international economists say

[03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:56.800]
they were pleased to report, raised the issue.

[03:13:57.220 --> 03:14:02.040]
The IMF is right, said, C. Fred Bergston, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington,

[03:14:02.380 --> 03:14:05.880]
if those twin deficits of the federal budget and the trade deficit continue to grow,

[03:14:06.100 --> 03:14:09.540]
you're increasing the risk of a day of reckoning when things can get to quote him,

[03:14:09.540 --> 03:14:13.540]
pretty nasty, kind of like Moe, you know, pretty nasty.

[03:14:14.240 --> 03:14:16.820]
That's Moe who got Zach came off his show again this week.

[03:14:18.920 --> 03:14:20.960]
Every time I hear those words, pretty nasty.

[03:14:21.700 --> 03:14:24.780]
I think of Moe, not so much the pretty part, just an nasty part.

[03:14:24.980 --> 03:14:25.280]
Party.

[03:14:25.980 --> 03:14:30.500]
Charles and Deerfield Beach says, since today marks the anniversary of the murder of John Linden,

[03:14:30.660 --> 03:14:31.800]
how come nobody told us that?

[03:14:31.940 --> 03:14:33.560]
They're talking about the Elvis, huh?

[03:14:33.980 --> 03:14:34.500]
He just did.

[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:36.580]
Nobody I'm talking about earlier.

[03:14:36.580 --> 03:14:38.900]
I had the neat thing in his utter throat.

[03:14:39.920 --> 03:14:43.080]
Well, yeah, Elvis, every time I think of John Linden, I think of Elvis, don't you?

[03:14:43.180 --> 03:14:43.340]
No.

[03:14:44.820 --> 03:14:48.180]
I felt a fact I wrote last week, but never said, might still be appropriate.

[03:14:48.520 --> 03:14:49.620]
Charles and Deerfield Beach.

[03:14:50.580 --> 03:14:52.800]
In regard to your poll on John Hinckley, I see nothing wrong.

[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:55.580]
I just want to make sure that I read this, uh...

[03:14:56.900 --> 03:14:59.820]
Nothing wrong with letting this up case out for a supervised weekend, I'll write,

[03:14:59.900 --> 03:15:03.320]
but if it were up to me, it wouldn't be to have somebody to know with mom and dad.

[03:15:05.380 --> 03:15:08.940]
I'd say if he's so god damn well, why not have him spend his time doing something worthwhile,

[03:15:08.940 --> 03:15:11.460]
like bathing, dressing, and feeding Jim Brady, for example?

[03:15:11.700 --> 03:15:12.160]
Good point.

[03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:15.720]
Of course, the next thing you know will hear that they not only let Mark David Chappin out,

[03:15:15.980 --> 03:15:18.420]
but they also gave him backstage passes to a McCartney concert.

[03:15:19.160 --> 03:15:20.840]
Excellent job, Charles and Deerfield Beach.

[03:15:20.980 --> 03:15:21.520]
Oh, gross.

[03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:25.480]
Oh, gross.

[03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:31.380]
The Battle of Elvis and John.

[03:15:39.960 --> 03:15:40.280]
Goes on.

[03:15:45.740 --> 03:15:47.100]
Have another sandwich, Elvis.

[03:15:47.800 --> 03:15:48.480]
Have another pizza.

[03:15:49.220 --> 03:15:50.880]
He sure liked his cheebergers, you know what?

[03:15:51.520 --> 03:15:52.580]
He played a butter man or sandwich.

[03:15:52.660 --> 03:15:54.820]
Too bad he wasn't around when we had cheebergers cheebergers going.

[03:15:55.180 --> 03:15:56.060]
He'd just love it.

[03:15:56.160 --> 03:15:57.280]
He'd probably be the best customer.

[03:15:57.480 --> 03:15:58.080]
He'd buy the chain.

[03:15:58.660 --> 03:16:01.840]
5 6 7 0 5 6 6 the impregnably wear it right around his neck.

[03:16:04.080 --> 03:16:08.380]
5 6 4 20 5 6 2 way up.

[03:16:09.860 --> 03:16:10.960]
They'll feed you.

[03:16:22.400 --> 03:16:32.080]
When I find myself from financial trouble, Apple Rapp comes to me, begging you to remaster

[03:17:02.080 --> 03:17:08.100]
and when you free walk these old songlists, they're plenty more we can't release.

[03:17:08.840 --> 03:17:12.940]
Take you off to help me to feed our cream.

[03:17:15.080 --> 03:17:21.260]
If you try to steal our music, buy down the morning, get me free.

[03:17:21.820 --> 03:17:25.800]
You'll hear from our lawyers, waiting to see.

[03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:33.660]
We're in scene, waiting to see, waiting to see.

[03:17:34.480 --> 03:17:39.220]
We will slowly advance on, waiting to see.

[03:17:40.500 --> 03:17:46.920]
Feed our cream, making free, feed our cream, feed our cream.

[03:17:47.920 --> 03:17:51.480]
That's why we recite, let it be.

[03:17:51.480 --> 03:17:59.400]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.

[03:18:00.580 --> 03:18:04.800]
Yes, our cream is done, is done, be.

[03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:13.740]
All right.

[03:18:13.740 --> 03:18:19.780]
1 56 5 60 WQM Mad Dog standing by, soda gets the ass in Canada school crack down, eh?

[03:18:20.540 --> 03:18:26.620]
Canadian kids will learn in the low coke zones next year, soft drink, companies pull carbonated soft drinks off the shelves,

[03:18:26.620 --> 03:18:29.260]
and elementary and middle school officials said Tuesday.

[03:18:30.400 --> 03:18:33.500]
Responding concerned about poor diets and increasingly fat children,

[03:18:33.700 --> 03:18:39.980]
Coca-Cola company and Pepsi Co-Ink will stock cafeterias inventing machines with water and fruit juice, George.

[03:18:40.960 --> 03:18:44.620]
Rather than with high calorie carbonated drinks, the group for rubber is being bought.

[03:18:45.460 --> 03:18:47.760]
It's just, you know, the S word, soda.

[03:18:48.440 --> 03:18:50.000]
Now do they call it pop in Canada?

[03:18:50.380 --> 03:18:50.820]
Yes they do.

[03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:55.080]
In fact, you can go into pizza pizza and get a slice in a pop for right out of a bucket of quarter.

[03:18:55.880 --> 03:18:56.540]
A slice in a pop.

[03:18:57.080 --> 03:18:59.680]
I always thought that pop was just, well, I guess it's because of geography,

[03:18:59.940 --> 03:19:01.800]
because we are like very close to upstate New York.

[03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:04.200]
Upstate New York is pop, right?

[03:19:05.140 --> 03:19:05.860]
Northwest also.

[03:19:07.140 --> 03:19:10.400]
Now in New York, have you asked somebody for a pop that's mac in the nose?

[03:19:10.780 --> 03:19:11.340]
Pop had jenko.

[03:19:12.260 --> 03:19:12.620]
Soda.

[03:19:14.100 --> 03:19:15.920]
In New York it's a soda, I see.

[03:19:16.560 --> 03:19:19.620]
If I see, I'm very confused, at least I used to be anyone.

[03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:22.160]
So my New York roommate got me educated.

[03:19:22.220 --> 03:19:24.100]
My New Jersey roommate got my educated in college.

[03:19:24.520 --> 03:19:26.340]
But I talk about a bunch of condescending assholes.

[03:19:26.460 --> 03:19:30.800]
The kids from New York were, you know, they were just like the New Yorkers you see now.

[03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:32.680]
So many of you, I say, I'm not sure.

[03:19:33.680 --> 03:19:36.560]
It's not pronounced orange, it's orange, it's orange.

[03:19:36.600 --> 03:19:36.680]
It's orange.

[03:19:36.680 --> 03:19:39.620]
Okay, no, but you say orange, I say orange, okay, asshole.

[03:19:40.340 --> 03:19:41.960]
It's orange, stay on the island.

[03:19:42.420 --> 03:19:42.620]
Right.

[03:19:43.720 --> 03:19:45.380]
And the same thing with the pop.

[03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:46.280]
Oh, no, it's a soda.

[03:19:46.500 --> 03:19:48.220]
See, I always thought a soda was like an ice cream soda.

[03:19:48.400 --> 03:19:48.600]
Right.

[03:19:48.920 --> 03:19:50.140]
Like, I have a top of soda.

[03:19:50.500 --> 03:19:50.620]
Right.

[03:19:51.100 --> 03:19:51.460]
Right.

[03:19:51.980 --> 03:19:52.340]
No.

[03:19:52.860 --> 03:19:54.760]
But anyway, you asked and you received pop.

[03:19:54.920 --> 03:19:57.020]
Let's see, on today's pool, I say, forget towns.

[03:19:57.440 --> 03:20:00.640]
The award has to go to the entire state of Kansas based on their passing law

[03:20:00.640 --> 03:20:02.040]
forbidding the teaching of evolution.

[03:20:03.260 --> 03:20:05.700]
Well, they did, they didn't have to change their tune on that.

[03:20:06.300 --> 03:20:07.540]
But nevertheless, good point.

[03:20:07.840 --> 03:20:09.840]
And Kansas, of course, is never where Fred Phelps is from.

[03:20:09.940 --> 03:20:11.500]
That goes to the funerals of all the AIDS people.

[03:20:11.800 --> 03:20:14.360]
How come we don't have, how come we don't have Kansas on there?

[03:20:14.520 --> 03:20:15.000]
We do know.

[03:20:15.280 --> 03:20:16.440]
Oh, thank God we got it.

[03:20:16.520 --> 03:20:19.380]
We got our Kansas and your Kansas.

[03:20:19.680 --> 03:20:21.180]
We don't have that Kansas.

[03:20:22.360 --> 03:20:24.720]
I mean, how is Dorothy ever going to follow that yellow brick road

[03:20:24.720 --> 03:20:26.120]
if we don't have Kansas on there, right?

[03:20:26.360 --> 03:20:27.340]
There's no place like her.

[03:20:27.340 --> 03:20:30.320]
In fact, maybe Julian and Timmy wind up there before it.

[03:20:30.320 --> 03:20:30.900]
What a shame.

[03:20:31.180 --> 03:20:32.520]
What a shame of our little Timmy.

[03:20:32.620 --> 03:20:34.220]
Now, you did see him once upon a time,

[03:20:34.220 --> 03:20:36.120]
did you own pants and other things as well?

[03:20:36.240 --> 03:20:36.960]
I was familiar with him.

[03:20:37.100 --> 03:20:37.480]
Did you really?

[03:20:37.680 --> 03:20:37.780]
Yes.

[03:20:39.120 --> 03:20:44.540]
And the most bizarre thing of the whole deal is that they hit him die in the show.

[03:20:44.720 --> 03:20:47.360]
He was going to die in the show and then he like right around the same time

[03:20:47.360 --> 03:20:49.140]
is when he died like for real tragic.

[03:20:50.080 --> 03:20:52.760]
San, he was like just about everybody's favorite character.

[03:20:53.060 --> 03:20:56.440]
Thank God for Ed the Wallace and the pay and the, what they over chimped.

[03:20:56.440 --> 03:20:58.220]
What about a hell's name is what's the name of the chimp bubbles?

[03:20:59.240 --> 03:21:01.560]
Patients prudence or whatever whatever it is.

[03:21:01.800 --> 03:21:06.900]
Okay, how's that pull coming in which American state would you find the highest percentage of goobers?

[03:21:07.140 --> 03:21:09.860]
In other words, where does the S word really kick in big time?

[03:21:10.140 --> 03:21:11.800]
And it doesn't stand for.

[03:21:12.080 --> 03:21:12.480]
Schmidt.

[03:21:13.920 --> 03:21:15.600]
Alabama has been in lead all the way.

[03:21:15.680 --> 03:21:17.180]
I guess we got to take a visit to Alabama.

[03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:18.120]
No.

[03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:19.900]
Alabama 49.

[03:21:20.160 --> 03:21:21.600]
They're always saying, oh, you ought to go to Baluxia.

[03:21:21.720 --> 03:21:22.880]
That's where that casino is.

[03:21:22.960 --> 03:21:23.600]
Baluxia, Mississippi.

[03:21:24.020 --> 03:21:24.440]
Alabama 49.

[03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:27.760]
Mississippi is right on its heels with 41 there side by each.

[03:21:28.380 --> 03:21:29.700]
West Virginia 39.

[03:21:30.140 --> 03:21:30.920]
Florida 34.

[03:21:31.680 --> 03:21:33.220]
We got a lot of dummies in Florida.

[03:21:33.680 --> 03:21:35.340]
Not that we never have any on this show of course.

[03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:38.800]
Arkansas 27.

[03:21:39.100 --> 03:21:39.940]
Georgia 25.

[03:21:40.220 --> 03:21:40.900]
Texas 18.

[03:21:41.060 --> 03:21:41.880]
Tennessee 17.

[03:21:42.280 --> 03:21:42.680]
Louisiana.

[03:21:42.680 --> 03:21:43.220]
Come on.

[03:21:43.220 --> 03:21:44.220]
You didn't do better than that.

[03:21:45.420 --> 03:21:46.600]
Louisiana's only got 17.

[03:21:46.740 --> 03:21:47.360]
One behind Texas.

[03:21:47.520 --> 03:21:48.260]
Tennessee 17.

[03:21:48.680 --> 03:21:49.620]
South Carolina 15.

[03:21:50.320 --> 03:21:51.220]
North Carolina 11.

[03:21:51.460 --> 03:21:52.760]
See now that you like that a little bit better.

[03:21:52.760 --> 03:21:53.960]
Kentucky 11.

[03:21:54.780 --> 03:21:57.500]
And then a small potato single digits Nebraska 3.

[03:21:57.640 --> 03:21:59.020]
I still say Omaha's a great town.

[03:21:59.160 --> 03:22:00.640]
You you like a great steak houses.

[03:22:00.880 --> 03:22:05.180]
Great restaurants and really well put together people.

[03:22:05.360 --> 03:22:06.640]
I got no truck with the goobers.

[03:22:07.560 --> 03:22:09.060]
They're not goobers ever.

[03:22:09.220 --> 03:22:10.820]
Nebraska is not goobers, man.

[03:22:10.820 --> 03:22:11.180]
Whatever.

[03:22:12.860 --> 03:22:13.780]
Montana one.

[03:22:13.940 --> 03:22:14.600]
Idaho one.

[03:22:14.840 --> 03:22:15.400]
Indiana one.

[03:22:15.700 --> 03:22:15.880]
Colorado.

[03:22:15.960 --> 03:22:16.380]
Wyoming.

[03:22:16.460 --> 03:22:17.300]
You've gotten on the Kansas.

[03:22:17.320 --> 03:22:19.120]
Just went on their 314 votes.

[03:22:19.840 --> 03:22:20.860]
Mad Dog is coming up.

[03:22:20.860 --> 03:22:21.800]
And he ain't no goobers.

[03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:24.080]
He's a real hot city slicker from Solano, Ohio.

[03:22:24.140 --> 03:22:26.300]
And then we got the booster for the Humper for the load at 4.

[03:22:26.380 --> 03:22:27.240]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:22:27.760 --> 03:22:28.880]
I'm going to be on your show.

[03:22:29.160 --> 03:22:30.480]
I'm flying the highway.

[03:22:30.780 --> 03:22:31.940]
I'm going to be for my day.

[03:22:32.120 --> 03:22:34.540]
I stick motherf***er a provolone on my socks at night.

[03:22:34.920 --> 03:22:35.880]
So they smell like assisters.

[03:22:35.900 --> 03:22:36.680]
Cross it a morning.
