[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.860]

[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.220]

[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.100]
Error America's reported non-payment for least airtime and then they said we didn't do this and they did that and the main time

[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.780]
Their employees aren't getting paid either yet kind of like a Joe Rose deal

[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.160]
So error America and I don't want to say I told you so but you know what I told you so they've got real tourists baby

Forgetting about honesty who is your favorite American politicians? You that should have been the end

[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.680]
We're only doing this for one hour. Don't get all panic in bed out of shape and we're not allowing you to add do it

[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.440]
That's gonna really get him pissed off. Where this little they do

[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.800]
I don't care what they do. I got I got a whole pile of stuff here, baby

[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.540]
I mean I realized that we got to get the whisperer in your four or five times and not it gone and those guys on

[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.240]
Which is fine with me. I don't really give a fine crap anymore, you know

[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.160]
So I always check all those checks showed up at the house yesterday. I don't really care. They're all in the bank already

[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.760]
Bonus checks and pay checks and talent checks and non-talent checks

[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.660]
That's all it's all about right. I'll just crap about well. You're gonna get some really great calls on here

[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.140]

[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.960]
Morning. Good morning, sir

[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.040]
Two quick things number one with the over-under on Randy being back in town by the kickoff see a football see

[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.620]
Exactly and the other thing you don't have to get a new sounder for the new Brad Pitt movie coming out

[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.880]
Starting hell and look

[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.140]
We already got

[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.140]
Troy

[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.840]
We got it. We're ready. Heddy appalling. Have a great day. See I was a good call

[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.860]
He was good true

[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.780]
Comparing anything else we had so far. He was always fantastic

[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.420]
Forgetting about honesty who's your favorite American politician only one hour of this some realize it's painful

[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.460]
And this is not the same as yesterday towards W. Bush Bill Clinton John Kerry take Kennedy out sharp

[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:02.540]
And Howard Dean just event to Jimmy Carter Bob Graham Hillary Clinton that is kissin it Charles Wrangold Carl

[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.240]
Levin John McCain Joe Biden or they all suck. That's the pull

[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.520]
Just try adding to it and you'll see how fast Josh types it on there under penalty of debt

[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.740]
In fact, I don't want to like you know

[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.480]
Pile on to this grotesque story we have yesterday

[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.500]
But if you if Josh adds anything on that list we'll turn his head right into a

[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.540]
Seam yeah

[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.460]
Thanks, and you can say see him

[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.300]
So I think based on that suggestion there he probably ain't gonna be adding nothing to it. Are you Josh? No

[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.400]

But Bill he's here to tell you that girl you're not

[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.140]
They used to wear makeup and rip away past

[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.620]
But when they looked at me they were under my triumph

[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.880]

I'd like you to remember this one

[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.840]
She had a safe recorder that she kept on her phone

[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.740]
And after she ate steak she would bury the bone

[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.660]
She got herself some life all end up

[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.120]
To me talk

[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.560]
But she still has a way as a hotkin plug

[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:24.560]

Well you got the brain

[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.920]
But if you got the touch

[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:18.480]

[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.420]

And don't impress me much

[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.460]

[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.900]
Well I've tried to cut the brakes on her car

[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.780]
No offense but I think I'd rather sleep with get a star

[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.880]
When she gives birth I think her offspring should hatch

[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.600]
Big old wags and an ass too much

[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.520]

Well you got the brain

[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.800]
But if you got the touch

[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.500]
Now don't get me wrong

[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.560]

But that won't keep me warm ever mill

[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.040]
Oh tonight

And don't impress me much

[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.140]
Like you

[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.580]
That's what I'm doing

[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:45.580]

[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:45.580]

[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.240]
And my side is the women's dress

[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.580]
I'll grab you

[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.740]
10-21 I guess they love you too

[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.540]
Because Van he's going to win this thing hands down this hour

[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.560]
For getting about honesty

[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.580]
And of course only light about was a few jobs

[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.100]
Who's your favorite American politician

[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.320]
Bill Clinton 48

[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.640]
John McCain 10

[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.120]
Nobody's even close to Bubba's ass

[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.940]
Well

[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.740]
Just eventour seven

[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.220]
George W. Bush 6

[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.140]
6

[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.040]
6 stubborn

[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.280]
See here's a guy that not only lied about weapons of ass destruction

[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.880]
And everything else that's going on with his whole arachnus

[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.640]
But set off all these young people to be killed slaughtered

[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.220]
But he's a friend of the six people out there

[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.680]
Still say he's their favorite politician

[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.580]
He's a Christian

[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.020]
Gornish Telfin man

[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.160]
Gornish Telfin with religious fanatics

[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.120]
I'm not talking about Muslims

[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.920]
I'm talking about born again Christians

[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.640]
Orthodox Jews, fanatical, Muslims, all of these things

[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.680]
Crazy religious people start for the redundancy

[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.840]
All of these things

[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.480]
George W. Bush 6, Bob Graham 4, Ted Kennedy

[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.500]
For I voted for Ted man, I loved Ted Kennedy

[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.560]
He is just like I said yesterday

[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.880]
When I see him on the ear there knowing that he's still alive

[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.540]
Just makes me feel like there's a little teeny tiny bit of hope

[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.060]
A glimmer

[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.580]
He's a good guy

[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.380]
Al Sharpton 4

[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.200]
Jimmy Carter 3

[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.660]
I mean let's face it so Rick Sanchez knocked off that guy in front of the stadium here

[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.780]
Who would you rather have to lead us out of the wilderness

[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.280]
Ted Kennedy or Rick Sanchez

[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.480]
And this Ted Kennedy speaks English with a heavy Boston accent

[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.900]
Jimmy Carter 3, John Kerry 2

[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.820]
Dennis Kucin, it's a period Joe Biden 2

[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.120]
Charlie Rangel 1, Howard Dean's got one

[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.980]
Hillary Clinton's got one a big one

[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.140]
And Carl Evington don't have any other first 127

[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.740]
You better hop on that pole right away

[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.160]
One hour only today

[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.140]
Video shows be heading of American captive in Iraq

[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.360]
Oh my god

[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.300]
Now of course you can see the video

[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.660]
If you're real sadist, if you're sick

[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.180]
We're not going to discuss where and how but you can see it online

[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.120]
And I'll kind of link to website post it video

[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.300]
Yesterday I have an American man in Iraq speaking briefly before being

[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.100]
Beheaded by his masked captors

[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.220]
We're going to catch him though

[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:50.500]
Yeah

[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.240]
Oh yeah we're going to make them pay

[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.620]
Of course they all have masks on and we have no idea what their identity is

[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.540]
Their eras

[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:57.240]
Muslims

[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.440]
I see it's only a billion of those so that kind of narrows it down

[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.580]
See like Osama we know what he looks like

[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.320]
In fact evidently if these

[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.420]
No if these videotapes are authentic

[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.020]
He hasn't even changed his appearance that's how cocky he is

[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.260]
Right now confident he is that we're never going to find him

[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:11.800]
Hutspa

[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.540]
He's got some real Hutspa

[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.260]
So we know what he looks like

[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.840]
And we can find him now here's five guys with hoods on

[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.960]
But we're going to get him

[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.420]
That's right

[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.700]
His captors said the US refused to have changed him for prisoners in the obograib prison

[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.080]
The senior US official told

[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.440]
Cable Nazi network he doesn't believe that to be true

[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.460]
The captors also wish you the direct statement to president

[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.800]
Voice the worst is coming and God willing the tough days are still to come

[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.140]
You and your soldiers will regret today that you touch the ground of a rack

[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.380]
In the video the man identifies himself as Nicholas

[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.720]
Burk 26th of Pennsylvania in a shown sitting in an orange jumpsuit

[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.800]
In front of five armed hooded men

[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.440]
The one standing directly behind burglades the statement identifying himself

[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.840]
And then burglars pushed to the floor

[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.480]
Burglars heard screaming as his throat is cut

[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.060]
One of the captors then holds up his severed head

[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.520]
For the mothers and wives of American soldiers

[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.160]
We told you that we offered the US administration to exchange this hostage for some of the

[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.720]
Detainees in the obograib and they refused the hooded man standing behind the American said

[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.820]
Just before they're killing

[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.960]
Coffins will be arriving to you one after the other slaughtered just like this he be saying

[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.700]
White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters

[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.180]
This shows the true nature of the enemies they're freed and they have no regard for the lives of innocent men moving in children

[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.320]
As opposed to us who have so much regard for innocent men moving in children

[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.480]
Like the 16,000 innocent Iraqi civilians men moving in children who have died because of our

[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.740]
Racketack because we're going to bring them emancipation by decapitation

[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.060]
And at the Pentagon officials confirmed that a body found a

[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.560]
Narek by an army patrol as the person shown in the beheading video

[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.900]
So they got the body which they're sending home but no head

[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.280]
The website also said the killing had been carried out by

[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.600]
Abu Musab al-Zakawi the leader of an Islam which is not true by the way they said they studied

[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.140]
The voice and the whole deal not him

[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.380]
The leader of an Islamist terrorist group that claimed responsibility for numerous attacks on coalition forces in Iraq

[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.360]
The voice on the tape could not be verified as that of al-Zakawi

[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.700]
A cable Nazi network staffers familiar with his voice said the voice on the tape did not sound at all like him

[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:17.140]
In the statement the captors referred to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners of hands of US military personnel saying the picture of the son are in the news of the satanic assault on the people of Islamic men and women will not be tolerated

[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:25.440]
Berk was not a soldier or a civilian employee of the Pentagon the state department said he was a construction communications repair guy

[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:35.460]
He was over there to make a buck not a good idea not a good idea to be hanging around in Iraq

[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.960]
Well they heard the most they didn't want us over there

[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:45.000]
Yeah that's right you mean like they're telling us every day to get the hell out

[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:55.220]
And be now now say to him Chalabi the man hitting the Iraq war car crash crimes criminal tribunal what did you say?

[00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:02.780]
Criminal city yesterday the coalition is considering the possibility of handing Saddam Hussein to the Iraqis for before the June 30th they for sovereignty

[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.180]
But third man they're going to hand him over to him

[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:12.100]
But Chalabi claimed he was misquoted misunderstood he said there's still a lot of work that defensive attorneys for Saddam will have to do

[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:18.680]
It's likely would not be the first of the suspects tried they're going to hand him over for the Iraqis to try and oh gee what a be escaped

[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:24.240]
Would that be something or if he should hang himself in the jail cell right or get struck by lightning

[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.220]
Right or get tortured by some sadistic bitch from trailer park

[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:40.080]
Yeah 27 past 10 at 560 WQ AM might as well you know I mean what's what's the point what are we going to do what am I going to tell you

[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:46.180]
Insanity unleashed by a president they unleashed by a bunch of neo-con lunatics maniacs but it's worth it

[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:52.740]
Show no it's worth it and don't forget if they just wouldn't have flown them planes into those buildings and we wouldn't have to be taking care of all these Iraqis

[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.940]
Oh they did do it oh well at least the gas prices made it worth it

[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:02.280]
That's correct all that cheap gas that you're paying pretty soon three bucks a gallon for I mean what's not to like

[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:09.620]
27 after 10 a QM let's face it we've talked until I'm blue in the face about fast rain but I can't make the call for you

[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.480]
Way to A.M.

[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.460]
Know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:28.420]
So Dale good morning this week I propose a series of new ambitious steps to build on our recent success against prosperity and new jobs

[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.600]
We must continue to turn our backs on America's families and workers and entrepreneurs

[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:39.100]
We'll put good companies out of business and good people out of work including every farmer rancher and small business owner

[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:48.920]
In the coming months I will continue to work with Congress to achieve these important measures requiring all states to criminalize productivity, manufacturing and housing construction

[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.060]
And others who move this economy forward. Thank you for listening.

[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.420]
And have a great day

[00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:02.580]
1032 560 WDQM from the current village voice the doctrine of atrocity us against them a traditional institutionalized business

[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.860]
And we will put that into the bottom of my pile I got just tons of stuff here I don't want to do a lot of reading today

[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.700]
Do I have just a whole pile of stuff

[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.020]
I mean that of course interferes with a lot of those great calls like this one online 3 QAM

[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.860]
This tribunal is a joe of Neil

[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.340]
Yeah

[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.800]
You know why?

[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:21.660]
I'm listening

[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.560]
Well basically a tribunal

[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.320]
Yeah the tribunal against the soldiers for the tribunal

[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.880]
You know the hearings?

[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.860]
Of those terrorists?

[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.060]
Yes, the hearings

[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:38.700]
So it's okay for them to cut people's heads off and mutilate people but a few pictures and you know what I'm saying

[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.720]
Who said it was okay for them to cut people's heads off and hate them?

[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:48.240]
I never heard anybody hold on us again I never hear anybody hold them accountable for the grotesque acts as their own

[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.240]
Oh you're a crazy person man it's all everybody's screaming about the last 24 hours but a bunch of barbarians they are

[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.980]
Nobody holds them accountable it's okay for them to do that but if we just you know

[00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.540]
So in other words we should act like they should that's what you're trying to say

[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.800]
Let's see if we can who can outbar bear the other guy okay

[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:10.000]
We'll show you people a thing or two we're gonna poke your eyes out we're gonna stick a candle product up your ass

[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.800]
And then we're gonna turn the juice on for those wires that you're holding in your hands

[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.620]
And knock you off that little thimble that we got you standing on

[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.620]
Doing that balancing act you simple to new idiot

[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.020]
Grow up okay get a freaking life I have no life

[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.040]
You're simple to new then

[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.120]
What the hell were we doing there in the first place and what are we doing there right now okay

[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.220]
In June 30th can't come fast enough and what the hell were gonna do on June 30th and who were giving the keys to on June 30th

[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.360]
Ahmed Shalabi and as much of thieves and crooks Ali Baba and the 40th thieves

[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.960]
What the hell are you kidding man?

[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.780]
Everything here is based on a lie all of these lives that are just being tossed down the toilet

[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.460]
Like they weren't even existed. It's all because of lies

[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.760]
And you're right about the one thing this is the tribunal the hearings are just a dog and pony show

[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.220]
It's just a chance for a bunch of self-grandizing

[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.400]
Pantificators to sit up there and puff their chest up but I will but I will but about that's all it is

[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.500]
Now what the hell are they accomplishing?

[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.280]
Anybody who really believes that these soldiers just woke up on morning of course it was only just a small handle

[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:20.120]
And the senator in Haaf from Oklahoma. Here's the guy he ought to be on the death row this guy for stupidity

[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.200]
He's outraged by the outrage

[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.160]
In fact he should he should have opened his last punk that just called make a good pair those two

[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:35.920]
He's outraged by the outrage and you just a handful just six or seven soldiers who just went off the depend and yada yada yada

[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.660]
And right

[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.840]
You can't deal with the right wingers because where there's no sense there's no feeling

[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.180]
Senator in Haaf

[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:51.000]
They made a Broadway play about Oklahoma and I have one question about that as a matter of fact

[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.540]
Why?

[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:52.560]
Yeah

[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.100]
No listen to me

[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.980]
There are three places I'm going to warn you right now not to go to

[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.420]
Number one is Iraq

[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.500]
Number two is like Israel

[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.240]
Number three is Oklahoma

[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.660]
No chance

[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.060]
Write those down

[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.880]
Write them on your wrist like a momentum

[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.860]
I don't think you're under a lot of stress these days write them on your wrist

[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:17.460]
Do not be heading for Iraq because you will be in the wrong place at the wrong time

[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.620]
Do not be headed in Iraq

[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.920]
Do not be headed in Oklahoma and certainly do not go anywhere near Israel

[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.700]
Do not send your kids over to the kabuts

[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.220]
Yeah

[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.640]
Oh yeah we got some of these crazy Jews who are still sending their kids over to the kabuts

[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.780]
Oh my god they got on the bus and got blown to bits I don't understand why

[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.580]
I didn't expect that

[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.980]
Forget you about honesty who is your favorite American politician we're asking on the O'Rodges.com

[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.760]
And Bill Clinton's got over 100 votes already

[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.260]
Bubba's got 102 bring him back

[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.140]
Oh yeah please

[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.880]
Cracker please

[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.320]
Bill Clinton 102 they all suck 47

[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.360]
Just eventurage 22 John McCain 13

[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.720]
George W Bush 11 4.4% of this is stood-audio and still says

[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.340]
George W Bush he to man

[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.240]
He's a man of the cloth he's a man of the Lord even though we don't go to church

[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.480]
Even though he lies like a trooper

[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.200]
Ted Kennedy 9 he's right on W's ass Jimmy Carter 9

[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.080]
Bobby Graham 6th Dennis Cassandage 5

[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.540]
Al Sharpton 5 Joe Biden 5 Howard Dean 4

[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.780]
John Kerry 4 Charlie Rangel 3

[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:26.060]
One for Hillary one for Carl Levin with those granny glasses 247 votes

[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.620]
You only got another 24 minutes to vote on this one

[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.340]
Then we get to the real piece of resistance for the day

[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.420]
That's when we really separate the men from the goiim okay

[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.320]
Michelangelo Signurelli in the New York press rights conservative media

[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.640]
pundits revel in their personal responsibility and stand up like a man mantras

[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.440]
Hope when the spotlight shines on one of their own they quickly become the epitome

[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.340]
Of the lame stereotypes they have long perpetrated the whining sissy boy left

[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.240]
Blaming everyone but themselves for the problems that air us

[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.440]
Case in point

[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.540]
After days of silence on the abuse by American soldiers of Iraqi prisoners

[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.380]
And the detrimental effect will have on U.S. national security

[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:10.540]
The conservative national review ran a piece online by Jonah Goldberg trying to offer us some context for these crimes

[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:15.660]
In Goldberg land who you suppose is to blame for the abuse in the ensuing public relations disaster

[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.300]
Was it the president for taking us to war based on false claims about weapons of ass destruction

[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.200]
Including the wrath of Muslims in the region and thus opening us up to even more hatred and violence

[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.520]
And something like this abuse occur

[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:30.260]
Was it Donald Rumsfeld for doing the war on the cheap allowing the command to break down

[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.920]
Leading many testes of Indian private contractors who could operate without any authority

[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.060]
And covering up reports of wrongdoing from Congress

[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.740]
Know the true culprit was CBS

[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.480]
Okay, of course CBS had every right to do what it did Goldberg wrote discussing the airing of the photographs of the brutality

[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.780]
But that's irrelevant. Nobody suggesting the government should have stopped them

[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.960]
I'm suggesting that CBS should have stopped itself

[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.580]
Now we'll all have to live with the consequences and some of us will die from them

[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.340]
In Goldberg land when shocking images might steer Americans to favor war

[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.960]
Such as those depicting people jumping from the twin towers during the 9-11 attacks

[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.200]
And those showing the charred bodies of Americans affecting contractors in Iraq

[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.260]
The serious journalists show great restraint

[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.520]
But Goldberg claims when those shocking images had the opposite effect the Ted Coppels let it fly

[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.280]
I don't know about you but I recall seeing the images of people jumping from windows of the twin towers

[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:24.480]
On television and certainly in newspapers over and over again until the families of the victims finally complain to the media about insensitivity and sheer overkill

[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.200]
No one asked for the footage to be censored as a way of inhibiting war which in the case of Afghanistan

[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.200]
The vast majority of Americans is putting just about every liberal media pundit we're in favor of and are still out to this day

[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.820]
As far as the destruction of the buildings goes we've seen that from every angle and still do in news programs and documentaries

[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:45.560]
And it was on the front page of the New York Times the paper that right-wing conservatives view as the Bush-hating anti-war organ

[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.760]
Where I saw photos of the burned bodies of the contractors just a few weeks ago

[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.820]
Put a hole in one of the conservatives offensive theories about who's the blame for the brutality of the Iraqi prisoners that were

[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.500]
And they'll spin out yet another one

[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:02.260]
If it's not CBS and the rest of the liberal media that's it felt then surely it must be Bill Clinton and the homosexuals right?

[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:08.840]
I think it's a good point to pause right and let that sink in while I do the break and we'll come back and finish the article

[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:15.360]
Lots of stuff here and of course you know like that one crank says who you're reading to all people can understand it which leaves you out

[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.920]
Anybody with an IQ larger than their thumb okay which like I said leaves that guy out and several of the others out there

[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.740]
But that's okay we're keeping them off the streets

[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.360]
It must be Bill Clinton and the homos that must be it

[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.940]
20 to 11 at 560 because Rush popped out of the one sweetheart don't make mistakes

[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:39.040]
Let me tell you right now about the financial group you know you've heard us talk about these folks they're incredible only one mortgage program

[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:44.600]

[00:35:52.780 --> 00:36:02.480]
Fc CSI only on CDS when we're not exposing Janet Jackson's breast on the Super Bowl we're exposing some really serious crimes

[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:15.280]
1045 at 560 WQ have some Michael senior ready goes on to say last week I actually heard right wing radio chat while in a taxi in which colors and the host agreed that we wouldn't have seen this kind of homosexual brutality against the prisoners

[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:29.040]
If Bill Clinton had not let homosexuals into the military and if the torturers are not gay themselves then surely there are product of the Clinton era and its homo loving policies as James Toronto the often idiotic moralizer at the Wall Street Journal's opinion journal

[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:37.500]
Clinton Toronto's attempts to blame the barbaric soldiers actions on the American academic left had me cackling with laughter soon after it came to me in my email box get this

[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:43.920]
He says it also occurs to us that increasing the quality of military recruits would probably help avoid future oboe graves

[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:52.860]
One constructive step toward that end would be for elite universities to drop anti-military policy so that the military would have an easier time sending up the best and brightest young Americans

[00:36:52.860 --> 00:37:04.240]
Many academic institutions have barred ROTC or military recruiters from campus for left wing political reasons first as a protest against the Vietnam War and later over the Clinton era don't ask don't tell law

[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:14.860]
Whatever the merits of these positions at the time the academic left showed some patriotic responsibility and acknowledged that the defense of the country which includes the defense of their own academic freedom is more important than the issue do juror

[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:22.360]
Could anybody make more of a stretch in attempting to demonize those he despises while deflecting criticism of his own well there's always an culture

[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:33.460]
via David Brock's terrific new media matters dot org website which is focused on all of the bile spewers on the right I found this quote from an coder speaking on Fox News and blaming the soldiers brutality and women

[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:42.180]
She said I think the other point that no one is making about the abuse photos is just a disproportionate number of women involved including a girl general running the entire operation

[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:49.920]
I mean this is a lesson you know one million and forty seven on why women shouldn't be in the military in addition to not being able to carry even a medium sized backpack women are too vicious

[00:37:51.240 --> 00:38:06.360]
Similarly the anti feminist columnist Linda Chavez George W Bush's one-time labor secretary nominee who withdrew when she was found to be paying illegal immigrant housekeeper off the books suggested that the presence of women in the unit actually encouraged more misbehavior especially of the sexual nature that the pictures reveal

[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:14.860]
Another conservative finger pointer seemed to get rushed limbaugh all hot and sweaty during his week long quested down by the images as nothing more than college fat boy games

[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:25.000]
Donna M Hughes on National Review online asked why are we shocked by these images from Abu Ghraib but when the victims are women or gay men the images are called pornography or adult entertainment

[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:37.260]
Yes, she was attempting to explain and excuse the behavior and give anti porn crusader John Ascroff more grist for his twisted mill by claiming that the reservist might have engaged in these active torture because they'd seen them played out in porn films

[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:46.360]
Of course according to that logic we should ban the passion of the Christ because if people played out these satomasdic scenes in that film we'd be taking down bloody crosses from maybe to the speed corner

[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.220]
That got limbaugh thinking and making some lurid confessions

[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.140]
If you look at these pictures you cannot deny that there are elements of homo eroticism

[00:38:54.140 --> 00:39:01.420]
You said I've seen things like this on American websites you can find these if you have the passwords to these various porn sites you can see things like this

[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:13.260]
And Hughes and Hughes point was maybe these kids the soldiers the guards whoever are of a certain age group who have grown up with access to this are simply acting out what they've seen on these websites or something just for the fun of it or maybe other reasons

[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.440]
He's seen these porn sites

[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:24.060]
Another another crackpot deflection regarding this brutality to be sure but now we also know what limbaugh was doing on those oxy-contin days nights

[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:30.520]
Fumbling for his passwords looking for those homo erotic websites live and learn says Michelangelo sinurelly

[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.560]
Here you go pop another one rush and take a look at this

[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.080]
Oh my gosh

[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:42.180]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T line only got a few minutes here for this first pool today

[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:49.460]
And we get the important stuff the real the real nitty-gritty that's going to determine the course of our program for the next two and a half years

[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:54.460]
You do understand that don't you? Oh, of course you believe it no don't answer

[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:01.140]
For getting about honesty who's your favorite American politician that's our first pool question today we got three hundred and thirty nine votes

[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.820]
Bill Clinton a hundred forty four they all suck 60

[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:15.720]
Jesse Ventura has got about thirty man towards W. Bush twenty one six point one percent there's that six percent again

[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:23.300]
And that stubborn few who just refuse to be bothered by the truth don't confuse these people with the truth because the truth shall set you free

[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.240]
From all of that brainwashing that's rotted what used to be a brain

[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:39.840]
John McCain twenty one Jimmy Carter eleven ten Kennedy's only got ten that's very sad Bob Grammy then is considered seven Al Sharpton seven Howard Dean five Joe Biden five John Kerry's only got four

[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:46.460]
Yeah, that's part of the problem right there is John Kerry to reason the eight like way ahead is because we don't like him all that much

[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:56.240]
Week Charlie Rangel three Hillary Clinton two and Carl Levin has won he'd have a lot more separate as granny glasses those are out

[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:02.920]
Right now to tell that cam bone guy whatever his name was to that head at the right wing hack hand bone

[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.280]
Handball connected to the well job bone

[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.480]
Speaking that

[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:14.240]
PFC England says I was told a smile for photos to put psychological pressure on Iraqi prisoners

[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.780]
Of course the interesting part about that is that they're all like face down on the ground

[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:28.120]
Yeah, but don't confuse people with the facts. Fayetteville North Carolina man. Let's go right to the old trailer park right now

[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:36.400]
I'm all right. The Army private facing a court martial for being photographed when they could Iraqi prisoners as she was following orders to create psychological pressure on them

[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:48.000]
PFC Linda England told KCNC in Denver yesterday that her superior gave her specific instructions on how to post for the photos as to gave the order she would only say persons in my shame of command

[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:58.020]
In photographs that have been shown worldwide England 21 a scene smiling with a cigarette a packet in her mouth as she means forward and points at the genitals of a naked hooded Iraqi

[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:05.600]
Another photo taken at Baghdad's Abu Grey prison shows her holding a lease that encircles the neck of a naked Iraqi man lying on his side

[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:15.220]
I was instructed by persons in higher rank to stand there holding this leash look at the camera and they took the picture for siop's psychological operations she told the station

[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:20.360]
I didn't really I mean I didn't want to be in any picture she said she also said she thought it was kind of weird

[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:29.440]
The interview was taped Tuesday at Fort Bragg that would be like one of those hooded freaks that was at the be heading yesterday or whenever the hell it took place they had to take him out yesterday

[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.600]
One of those hooded freaks saying well I really thought it was kind of weird

[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:40.360]
See what I'm saying yeah I didn't know what they were doing there yeah I mean I was just following orders but I thought it was kind of weird

[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.540]
This guy told me to stand here with this thing on my head

[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:50.200]
The interview was taped yesterday at Fort Bragg North Carolina where England a military service from West Virginia from a West Virginia trailer park

[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.740]
Met on a team met with one of a team of Denver lawyers who volunteered to take her case

[00:42:54.740 --> 00:43:00.420]
Asked whether the worst things happened and those already seen on the photo she said yes but declined to elaborate

[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.800]
She said it's a period of praise the photos and just told us hey you're doing great keep it up

[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:13.740]
England faces a military court martial and includes charges such as conspiracy to maltreat prisoners and assault consummated by battery

[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:18.020]
And could face punishment ranging from a reprimand of more than 15 years in prison

[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.600]
She don't have a good time in there for the looks of her got to have that baby first

[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.300]
We don't feel like we were doing things that we weren't supposed to because we were told to do the England said

[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.180]
We think everything was justified because we were instructed to do this and do that

[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.080]
This and that and they did it they did this they did that

[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.380]
So there you go there's her story

[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.860]
Now here's one that says question mark an orange prison jumpsuit

[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:46.960]
Well that's the kind they favored at the Gitmo and they still do and as a matter of fact you know this general miller

[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:55.720]
That they sent from Gitmo where he was being accused of being like lunatic they sent him over there to straighten things around in Iraq that should do it sure yeah crazy person

[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:02.280]
An orange prison jumpsuit question mark it says just in time to justify or abuse how convenient

[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:08.180]
Al-Qaeda in Iraq how convenient what does that mean I don't understand what that means

[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:13.060]
The other conspiratorial minded crazy person who just obviously just crumbling under the pressure

[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:15.960]
Let's see you

[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:20.060]
Read it out here first I just did okay

[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:28.020]
So what does this mean I don't have any clue what does this means do you carry socks is what he's trying to say yeah

[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:34.840]
But I just get you reading exactly just got you saying nobody likes me so I got 4% I just got to tell you that

[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:39.240]
Of course this comes from Greenville South Carolina even George don't like South Carolina

[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:45.240]
He like North Carolina a little bit but he don't like South Carolina and South Carolina reminds me of one person you know who it is

[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.240]
The who Susan Smith oh yeah see there's a good South Carolina reminds me of

[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:59.020]
Susan Smith a miserable bitch hateful South sick twisted piece of crap

[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:05.460]
At any rate tonight's a big nut on 60 minutes to again

[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:12.080]
You're aware of that aren't you you told me this morning an American soldiers video diary showing her to stay in for

[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:18.180]
Raki detainees who died in her charges to be broadcast by a US network tonight in a further escalation of the prisoner abuse scandal

[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:25.100]
Let us shake in the Bush administration and promote world outrage oh my god CBS which two weeks ago broadcast the first picture of a Raki

[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.360]
Prison is being abused in Abu Ghraib prison your Baghdad said yesterday

[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:34.680]
It's 60 minutes to program which you'll video footage depicting conditions there and another US run prison in southern Iraq called

[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:38.080]
Camp Buka or is that camp Buka?

[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:45.260]
Fogra has a Raki prisoner is being sexually humiliated threatened by dogs and piled into pyramids as

[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:50.600]
Gritting American soldiers look on have been published around the world a leading a major setback to US attempts to stabilize their rack

[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:56.600]
CBS said the home video did not show scenes of abuse been included comments by the soldier whose name was not revealed to protect her identity

[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.940]
Then make clear her dislike for the camp and the prisoners under her control and yada yada

[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.540]
That would be tonight 60 minutes to

[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:09.880]
At least we're getting a little bit of advanced warning this time because I wasn't watching it the first time two weeks ago because I didn't know

[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:15.940]
But they were going to be showing and I don't watch 60 minutes to do you not a great while if it just happened to find it

[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.680]
That is a rule but sometimes no so they would have just told us ahead of time and we'd have been

[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.800]
But then again they would have accused of giving it too much publicity and trying to whip everybody up into a frenzy

[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:33.740]
Just like a senator in Hof says from Oklahoma. There's those flying saucers by the way you see those no where what I'm CNN I'm a scabled on not see network

[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:41.960]

I'm telling you they're gonna they're gonna pay our ass out and I'm too soon after to that right now. Oh, embarrassing.

[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:55.180]
Wouldn't it be something at least spaceships landed and turn out to be a bunch of shmata heads in there that would be bad. Yeah, right heads.

[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.400]
Woohoo, little green rag heads not looking for no caution counter with that kind of a ship anyway.

[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:07.580]
The defense fifty six at five sixty I said ship you heard exactly what I said as in your ship may be coming in

[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.880]

[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:51.640]
Now.

[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:19.280]
You know, somebody should've told me yesterday that the hunger must have been a deep new

[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.140]
General Indian thing in Hollywood that they just had the grand opening yesterday

[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.520]
We're never been nice to know that I'm sure that's where he must have been wasn't it?

[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.480]
I'm sure everybody knew it just by what you were talking about

[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:32.240]
How was that magic I didn't know that I didn't even know it was open

[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.720]
How about I know you know how out of touch I am right?

[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.840]
The other everywhere they're all over the TV. Yeah

[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.040]
I didn't even rate. Oh, okay, whatever

[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.360]
That's where Hank was yesterday. He's on a way to

[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:52.200]
Baltimore today we got the mad dog at two we got Kimba Bo camper at the triple a Miami heater rainy because they'd actually won again

[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:57.700]
So Kimba Bo camper will be there from four to seven for Hank will be broadcasting tomorrow from the Baltimore in the prequence

[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:01.260]
The crow is on at seven o'clock tonight because we got a half hour to kill air

[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:06.860]
Then you got Marlon's on deck 730 Marlon's who lost to the Astros was at 6.1. I do believe last night

[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.600]
Josh oh Josh is out. We're training Sean right now

[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:17.500]
I'm bigger pardon Josh went for a p-brake. Yeah, Sean's a sports head. He might know

[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.720]
Yeah, Marlon's lost 6.1

[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:25.000]
You know what I just said thank you Sean anyway, Marlon's will try to turn it around night 805's game time

[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.300]
And then you got the oh what was any K look at this the big after the game. That's bad. Oh man. It's always bad

[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.480]
That's a bad omen 404 votes on that first pool for getting about honesty

[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.900]
Who's your favorite American politician Bill Clinton man hands down your pants nobody even close

[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.760]
180 votes bubble we want them back now

[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:46.960]
180 they all suck 63

[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.400]
Just event you're 35 George W. Bush 26

[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:58.340]
6.4% of people who refused to allow their brains or what used to be brains to be penetrated who refused to be confused by the truth

[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.880]
John McCain 25 Ted Kennedy only a dozen Jimmy Carter 12

[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.580]
Bob Graham 11 Dennis Cassinich 8 Al Sharpton 8

[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:12.100]
Howard Dean 7 Joe Biden's got 6 John Kerry only 5

[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.820]
5 1.2%

[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:22.520]
Chuck Wrangles got 3 Hillary Clinton's got a parent Carl Evans got one right at the end of his pointed nose there

[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.360]
But there's a granny glasses in

[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.720]
John Kerry's got 5 so it's not just my imagination that the

[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:35.000]
Public out there the anti Bush crowd those of us who will do just about anything

[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:40.180]
To make sure that he don't get another four years to destroy what's left of American democracy

[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:46.500]
We're getting mighty dissolution with the Carrie Meister and his waffling and wimpy and

[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.020]
Inept campaign. I should give you the results of this poll

[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.320]
It's you ended online last night and this morning

[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:58.000]
Their poll question was are US goals in Iraq worth the cost because you like throwing in that line

[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.700]
They always kept telling us it's worth it

[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:05.760]
Just like metal and all bright said about those 500,000 Iraqi kids that died because of the sanctions and the depleting the uranium on all these things

[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:12.300]
It's worth it. They keep saying that our US goals in Iraq worth the cost they had 89,000 in some votes. That's a few more than we get

[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:13.660]
Yes

[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.380]
2338 no

[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:19.500]
63,700 percentages come out to

[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.720]
27 for 28 percent yes 72 percent no

[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:27.620]
And that's from a wide swath of Americana

[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.800]
72 percent no

[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.780]
28 percent yes, they're fine to catch it on their little slow on the uptake

[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.220]
But they're finally catching on boys and girls that we've been led down to garden path

[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:42.540]
We've been con they had no more of a game plan than you and I got

[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:48.560]
For how to get out of this mess what they were going to do after the after the big battle finished on

[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:53.640]
Of course, they knew that there really wasn't going to be any big battle because they knew that the 1991 the Gulf first Gulf war

[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.500]
That was like they virtually destroyed the you know other than the

[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.560]
Republican guard other than that there was basically nothing there was a rag tag army

[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:05.440]
A rag hit army rag hit army

[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.820]
And as far as weapons of mass destruction and we knew they didn't have any in a first place

[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:18.380]
But anyway, don't confuse people with the truth. We still got that 6 percent out there. Oh, let's down a long ways ain't it

[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.700]
That's done a long long way from the olden days back in they when it always was like 178 percent

[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:27.420]
The bush lickers out there

[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:31.080]
Here's the poll for the rest of the show

[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.320]
Which of these best described well before we do that let's take a call WQAM. Hello

[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:38.880]
QAM

[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.160]
WQAM. Hello

[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.960]
Okay, sir

[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:50.800]
I see him sometime. Yeah

[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:59.780]
About outsourcing of jobs. That's all he ever talks about. I'm sorry. He's phoning at them out. Right

[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.160]
He had

[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:05.020]
Ah, yesterday he was a

[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:14.020]
Right wing conservative pretty bluntly and uh, but the man I was very surprised he was um

[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:19.400]
He got on there and he said quite bluntly we either need to reinforce the troops

[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:24.300]
In our rack as we originally planned and uh, we talked about yesterday

[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.300]
We'll get to her out now

[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:31.240]
As in like now no, listen around right, you know, and you know

[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.480]
I'm not saying you was a Bible-fumperating like but he's definitely conservative

[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:38.640]
But he just said this is ridiculous. We're losing men and women left right and center

[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.300]
For nothing. Yeah, you know, Lou Dobbs was

[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:46.560]
For Lou he was somewhat in agreement, you know, I you know, I can't say 100 percent agreement

[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:50.960]
But you know he at least listened to him and you know Lou Dobbs is a pompous ass

[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:52.560]
I agree

[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:59.300]
Probably good news while they see even the right wingers now are starting to say hey, we got somebody got us into this mess

[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:06.180]
And has no idea how to extricate ourselves from it see that this is the thing that really gets me is people like

[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.840]
John McCain and Joe Biden and others say and the Jew Lieberman of course of course

[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:12.540]
Julie Brem was all in favor in the first place

[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:15.360]
Being the right wing hawk that he is

[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:19.460]
But the people will say well, we're already there whether we should have been there or not in the first place

[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.200]
That doesn't make any difference anymore. You know, I'll Biden to say in that McCain

[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.600]
Well, what kind of crap is that? So in other words, we made a mistake

[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.260]
We got sucked advice than a bunch of lies

[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.940]
So let's see how many more lives we can flush down the toilet

[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:36.180]
Let's see how many more billions of dollars we can flush down the toilet if we were spending just a fraction

[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:42.660]
Of the hundred and two hundred billion whatever it's gonna eventually wind up being billion dollars to really be fighting terrorism

[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:47.140]
Then we wouldn't have a kind of capturing people in slice of their heads off

[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:49.560]
Because

[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:52.480]
Because once a by and then when they take these polls and they keep showing oh well

[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:57.160]
Bush still gets really high marks on fighting terrorism. We're not fighting terrorism you idiots

[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:02.320]
He's not fighting terrorism. He's creating it in a place where it didn't exist

[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.320]
Oh

[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:11.440]
How is it possible? I know one of the reasons is possible because the American news media is such a pile of crap

[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:15.220]
Such a bunch of propaganda's they ought to be in jail most of them

[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.560]
Much of suck holes just like Vietnam all over again, man

[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.160]
How many people acted ivy for the media finest is all well

[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:27.320]
Maybe the same go in just the way we thought of what maybe we don't have to be quite so patriotic

[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.380]
Maybe we don't have to suck up quite so much

[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.000]
Oh Pete the chronic is a pig report here. We haven't had one of these in a long time

[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:43.280]
Plantation pigs everywhere university and Peters Road and university driving 84 there are ten pigs

[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.380]
Shoot near radar. Okay. That was his of 11 o'clock this morning. So there's an up to the minute

[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:50.020]
Plantation pig report. They must be sure on cash this month

[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:54.260]
So govern yourselves according me. Okay. Here's the second poll

[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.340]
Well, let's take a call first

[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.840]
W.A.M. Hello

Ideal yes, sir. What's up, man? How you doing? Did you all right? I was an ask man

[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:13.920]
He was good. Was I with the red light and blue hoots for nowadays, huh?

[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.160]
Okay, see now I'm gonna pick up no no sir that this I

[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:23.340]
I must be gonna put a right side of it today because for all the money in the world

[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:27.520]
I couldn't have done a better job which in these best described why you listen to the NEO Roger show

[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.260]
That's our poll today

[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.760]
Here you got six choices for a few laughs

[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:38.060]
To hear the callers opinions to hear the crazy and crank calls

[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:45.680]
To hear the stories NEO reads I hate NEO but I can't turn it off or it kills four hours of my boring life

[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.200]
In other words, I have no line right

[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:53.460]
And again, I guess we ought to underline which of these best describes why you listen to the NEO Roger show because you know

[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:57.660]
There obviously is mix and match a little this little then we want to find out what the main thrust

[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.740]
Can we say that no the main thrust is

[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.840]
That compels you to listen to this program

[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:12.420]
For a few laughs to hear the callers opinions to hear the crazy and crank calls to hear the stories NEO reads

[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:17.060]
I hate NEO but I can't turn it off or it kills four hours of my boring I have no life life

[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.680]
Good pull by the way my choice I know there

[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.580]
And what was that because they pay me to I see

[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.240]
Well, Josh would put that under too only they're not paying him enough to really count

[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:35.800]
He does it for the it's a labor of love. It's a labor of love. Where have we heard that before where have we heard that

[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.420]
Bitches

[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.440]
They're part of a fair and balanced breakfast

[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.820]
And be sure to try carry ego waffles

[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:38.120]
The breakfast that never gives you a straight answer

[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.440]
Carry ego waffles

[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.360]
Kaya man you'll say

[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:40.800]
Carry

[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.020]
Lego on that ego

[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:43.680]
Carry ego waffles

[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.500]
11-18-8-22-2-2

[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.780]
But on that last pull I'll tell you that he did a week

[01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:48.600]
Very weak

[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.440]
Greg and Carl spring says

[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.940]
Letterman who never misses a chance to make George Bush like like to look like the fool he is

[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.440]
Had the funniest line about the current situation last night

[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.360]
Said George Bush told rumse

[01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.560]
He was doing an excellent job

[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:02.340]
Last time a president said that to someone he was looking under his desk

[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:06.940]
I don't watch Letterman

[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:08.780]
I think maybe now you understand why

[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:11.160]
Well there are a lot of he's you know let's say a state of mind thing

[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:13.560]
Job

[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:20.020]
For its holidays now this page one eight you send me that's like off the side of the page and everything

[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:27.520]
Yeah, but actually went to the newspaper the state.com South Carolina's home page

[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.700]
For its holidays the senior senator from South Carolina writes

[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.640]
Why we're in Iraq

[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:40.580]
Would 760 dead in Iraq and more than 3000 maimed for life folks continue to argue over why we're in Iraq and how to get out

[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.500]
Now everyone knows what was not the cause of this war even president Bush acknowledges that

[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:50.600]
Sodom was saying that nothing to do with 911 listing the 45 countries where Elkada was operating on 911

[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.080]
70 cells in the US the state department did not list Iraq

[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.360]
Richard Clark and against all enemies tells how the US had not received any

[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:04.680]
Threditarism for 10 years from Sodom at the time of our invasion on page 231 John McLaughlin of the CIA

[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.380]
Verifies this to Paul Wolfowitz

[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.980]
In 1993 president Clinton responded to Sodom's attempt on the life of president George Herbert Walker Bush

[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.120]
By putting a missile down Sodom's intelligence headquarters and bagged in not a big kill

[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.780]
But Sodom got the message monkey around with the US and a missile lands on his head

[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.480]
Of course there were no weapons of mass destruction

[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:26.280]
Israel's intelligence Mossad knows what's going on in Iraq. It's the best

[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.720]
It has to know Israel survival depends on knowing

[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.900]
Israel long since would have taken us to the weapons of mass destruction if there were any or if they'd been removed with Iraq

[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:38.940]
Why invade a sovereign country the answer president pushes policy to secure Israel

[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:43.700]
Led by Richard purle Paul Wolfowitz and Charles Krauthammer for years

[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.860]
There's been a dominoe school of thought that the way to guarantee Israel's security

[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.900]
It's to spread democracy in the area

[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:53.460]
Wolfowitz wrote the United States may not be able to lead countries through the door of democracy

[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.900]
But where that door is locked shut by a totalitarian deadbolt American power

[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.240]
Maybe the only way to open it up on another occasion

[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:05.900]
Iraq as the first Arab democracy would cast a very large shadow starting with Syria and Iran but across the whole Arab world

[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:13.860]
Three weeks before invasion president Bush stated a new regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example for freedom

[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.320]
For other nations in a region

[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:20.280]
Every president since 1947 has made a futile attempt to help his real negotiate peace

[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.560]
The no leadership has surfaced among the Palestinians that can make a binding agreement

[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.920]
President Bush realized his chances at negotiation were no better

[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.720]
He came to office and muted with one thought re-election

[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.480]
Bush felt tax cuts would hold his crowd together and spreading democracy in the Middle East to secure Israel

[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.300]
Would take the Jewish vote from the Democrats

[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.940]
You don't come to town and answer your Israel policies to invade Iraq

[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:46.680]
But George W. Bush has stated by former secretary Paul O'Neal and others started laying the groundwork to invade Iraq days after inauguration

[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.620]
And without any Iraq connection to 9-11 within weeks he had the Pentagon outlining a plan to invade Iraq. He was determined

[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.700]
President Bush thought taking Iraq would be easy

[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.820]
Worfoward said it would only take seven days

[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:01.280]
Cheney believed we'd be greeted as liberators, but Cheney's man

[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:08.300]
Osmej Shalabi made a mess of the debathification of Iraq by dismissing Republican guard leadership and Sunni leaders and soon join with the insurgents

[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:11.260]
Worst of all we tried to secure Iraq with two few troops

[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.580]
In 1966 in South Vietnam with a population of 16 and a half million

[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:20.280]
General William Westmoreland with 535,000 U.S. troops was still asking for more

[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.140]
In Iraq with a population of 24.6 million

[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:28.640]
General John Abuse with only 135,000 troops can barely secure the troops much less the country

[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.360]
If the troops are there to fight there are two few if they're there to die there are too many

[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.820]
To secure Iraq we need more troops at least a hundred thousand more the only way to get the United Nations back in Iraq

[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.320]
Is to make the country secure

[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.580]
Once back the French Germans and others will join with you when to take over

[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:47.540]
With President Bush's domino policy in the Middle East gone a riot he keeps shouting war on terror

[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.580]
Terror is a method not a war

[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:55.800]
We don't call the Crimean War with the charge of the light brigade the cavalry war or World War 2 the blitzkrieg war

[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.720]
There's terrorism in Ireland against the Brits

[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:04.740]
There is terrorism in Indian Pakistan and the Middle East terrorism is a separate problem be defeated by diplomacy and negotiation not military

[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.820]
Here a might does not make right right makes might acting militarily

[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:14.120]
We've created more terrorism than we've eliminated says senator Fritz Holling from South Carolina who they propped up and gave a little

[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.640]
Lossige into that's why I looked a little animated this morning. I was screaming in the older rumsville

[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:19.620]
Not bad

[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:24.540]
Only the idea of sending the more troops of this juncture ludicrous insane

[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:29.000]
You ready to send in more troops? Oh, yeah

[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:35.260]
We got to get these best describes why you listen to the Elijah show

[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.780]
That's our pull today as we try to probe the audience and find out what makes these people tick okay?

[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:45.380]
Are my just spinning my wheels here and wasting my time all these bedtime stories all of this pseudo-inletual crap

[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:51.120]
Sitting here and reading to a bunch of people out there who want to hear and a bunch of sounds we can't play anymore

[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:55.800]
Ah 89 votes. It's all we got so far. That's pretty weak

[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:02.080]
For a few laughs 58 60 per 97 votes 58

[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:05.280]
Which is almost 60 percent just for a few laughs you know like

[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:10.800]
That's all and when you're at South Florida for God's sakes anybody can give you a few laughs for free, man

[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.660]
It's like a gift from God. They're all God. That's the one

[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.700]
To hear the stories neo reads 17 George

[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.000]
That's the big fan of these stories what I am a big fan, but that's not what I've heard

[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.440]
17 and a half percent to hear the stories neo reads I might as well be sitting in a corner reading to the fruit flies

[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:34.840]
It kills four hours of my boring life 14 I had no life to hear the crazy and crank calls three

[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:39.420]
I hate neo, but I can't turn it off three and to hear the caller's opinions too

[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:45.540]
Oh those callers are so important they don't understand

[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.380]
They're so dang important

[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.180]
Here the caller's opinions to

[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:57.140]
You know that reminds me of I'm gonna go to college yesterday who sounded like fairly coherent

[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.540]
And he may have been right he may have been going somewhere with it, but nevertheless

[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:05.080]
Assuming just given the benefit of the doubt. He really had something to say

[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:08.960]
And he was belly-ickened about the fact that he kept you know, we're doing screenless

[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.540]
And he kept ringing the phone and we're in a phone

[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:15.120]
He doesn't have time to like wait and about and he's he's wasted his minute because I had to go into a break

[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:15.520]
right

[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.560]
and he wasted his minute of

[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:18.560]
Fame

[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.820]
belly-ickened about the fact that we didn't take the call soon enough and yadi yadi yadi and low and behold

[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:24.780]
There was a minute to get

[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:32.120]
That's what climbs up perfect South Florida person as opposed to actually saying something assuming that he had something to say

[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.980]
Which I seriously don't assuming that he had and then of course probably

[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:38.760]
muttering and was like well, do you know wonder near low? You know, we don't get any smart callers

[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.420]
We just don't yeah

[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.320]
Well, if you would have said something instead of belly-ickened and of course

[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.400]
I've had how many million of those calls over the years

[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:47.760]
About 30 million of those calls they spend all of their time belly-ickened

[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:51.500]
Well, if you would have gotten to me sooner and I've been hanging on here for 20 even nobody cares

[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:55.620]
Nobody cares okay in the Olympic sport we could feed the team right here

[01:09:55.620 --> 01:10:00.680]
It's a radio show that's all if you have the time to wait fine. That's that's great. No problem

[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.780]
If you don't have the time to wait also no problem

[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:08.080]
Whatever case the Ross or man like doors gay a day sound throughout Hudson

[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.560]
Death to all

[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:28.040]
America in the name of Allah

[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:32.000]
This new but they got us no more as you can see I am still alive and well

[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.380]
They could I should make it up up and fighting evil

[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:36.780]
Wrath will come down

[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:39.180]
On you Americans

[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:41.620]
Because I'm staying alive

[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:44.020]

Ha ha ha staying alive

[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:15.400]
But the pretty one 29 till known at 560 WQM. Are you sure can carry out too and canning

[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:22.360]
Carry it where that the website media matters.org that David Brock website that Michael miss a senior rally mentioned in her column

[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.580]
That's a pretty good. I just take a peek at it media matters.org

[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:30.420]
We got to probably make a link to that Eric media matters.org you got it

[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:34.160]
Got it where he really rips into all of these right-wing liars

[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.720]
You know the Fox News people and they misfudge people and rush all of these right-wing maniacs these

[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.680]
Hate mongers these sickle fans

[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:48.860]
151 votes on here. Which of these bestest grabs why you listen to the Neil Rogers show for a few last 86

[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:51.040]
57% just for a few

[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:57.160]
Couples that's all they don't care about all this heavy-duty stuff. They don't want to be depressed. They they don't give a crap

[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:01.300]
They just want to hear a few yuck's man just a few silly sounds like

[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.880]
I guess that's the only one we can play anymore

[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.840]
Right well this one

[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:08.840]
Right

[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.360]
And maybe I have no last stuff like that the club absolutely yeah

[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:20.080]
Anyway few laughs 86 57% there's John Kerry. He and Funny believe me

[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.720]
Unless you thought herman monster was a panic when they would change a vote in the Senate and they were not gonna let it happen

[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:31.840]
So it's not really a one-vote margin. It's a multiple vote margin because they don't want it to happen

[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:36.280]
And it was very clear that even if it passed the Senate they're not gonna pass it in the house

[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.860]
If they're willing to reconsider and keep everybody's votes where they are

[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.400]
We'll go back and do it

[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:48.420]
But that's not what they're doing they're playing a game. See there you go see they try to make it appear that his failure to be in the Senate yesterday

[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:53.520]
Resulted in the unemployment benefits not being extended that bill not passing because they fell one vote short

[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.800]
But he makes a very good point and that is that they were just manipulating the vote so it would appear that it was one

[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:02.820]
Short and they had enough people in the cans so that no matter what it was they would have you know voted against it

[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:06.960]
So I'm saying what do you say? I'm saying that he continues being made to look like a loser

[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.000]
That's what I'm saying to be manipulated. He should have been there

[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.640]
So he wouldn't be allowed to be put in that position

[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.840]
But nevertheless he's got some bad handlers and you know what happens with bad handlers, don't you?

[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:20.780]
No, what bad results at the end of the election asked how are Dean about that

[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:26.200]
Which of these best described I'm that's right. I was reading this and then I saw John Kerry

[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.400]
See are the stories Neil reads 38

[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.120]
23% one of those bedtime stories there's Bubba

[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.660]
What advice he's giving the Democrats when I go inside politics

[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:42.280]
Yeah, Bubba says my advice is let me run again. Come on get another four years. Can you imagine all the jobs he can get in four more years?

[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.900]
Now these learn to be a little bit more discrete

[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:52.500]
On his feet. Let's hope it kills four hours of my boring life 23 is said that I have no life and we're delighted to do it at the right price

[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:58.900]
To hear the crazy and crank calls five. I hate Neil, but I can't turn it off three. Here the callers opinions too

[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.700]
In writer's jail up in a chapacock

[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:10.960]
For three months I have done nothing but try to finish the story of my life. It was hard enough to live at the first time. It's been

[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.620]
awful let's say but that's right this book is that we're gonna read that no

[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.840]
I like you lot Bubba, but I want to read your book

[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:22.360]
I have too many other books sitting on a coffee table or got books all up to my ass

[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:27.280]
lie nine is ringing now. You know how good this always is speaking of great cause that the audience wants to hear

[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.040]
They're on pins and needles for this wqa and hello

[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:35.120]
Hey, the only doughman pretty good. Neil man. I saw the video myself man. Yeah, yeah

[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.320]
I cried man. Why would you watch it? I mean, I just wanted to see

[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.520]
What was going on over there and I can't believe it. We don't belong there in the first place

[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:53.000]
I mean this the busier that said F.M. All you want to make a wait fine. You want to make Saudi fine

[01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:02.260]
We should have been off of four oil years ago. Correct. I mean the internal as far as cars go

[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:09.860]
The internal combustion engine. It's up as the dinosaur. That's correct for dick eight right? Okay

[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:17.460]
We should have been on natural gas or electricity a while ago, but of course this is the dark

[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:22.620]
I just heard that sound George made someone to do with natural gas when you said I heard it. No, that was gas

[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:28.180]
This is ridiculous. I can smell it all the way up here. Okay. Thanks pal. Calm down relax. Okay. Why would you watch that?

[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:30.500]
See I can't imagine one. Oh, I can because that

[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:37.040]
Faces of death parts one through a hundred was the most purchased video of all time. Wasn't it

[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:42.460]
We heard something like that or rented something like that. Yeah, faces of death people like snuff films

[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:46.000]
That's what they want to see even the fake porno snuff films

[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.220]
Which they were all fake great. I don't want to burst your bubble

[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:53.240]
But they're all fake anyway. I want to make a difference because they were convinced that it was real

[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.400]
They got off on that if I can I say that yeah, they have got excited about it

[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.480]
So I don't know why anybody to watch you but he's right and then then I take that way back in the big

[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:06.860]
Inso about OIL and ammo any why and about the Haliburton and Vectel and the Carlyle Group and all these other grave

[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:10.840]
Robbers that's what it's all about in the American media once again continue showing their ass

[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.540]
That's what they continue to do do in the uh

[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:18.700]
They just continue rearing their big fat pimple ass right in your face and you keep looking at and say oh wow how about that?

[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:25.660]
My god, we got a guy gets decapeted in American not even a soldier for crying out loud

[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:30.160]
Not that that would make it any better but a guy who's just over there working trying to make a living

[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.920]
He gets his head chopped off

[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.260]
And what are they talking about on the cable Nazi network this morning?

[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.220]

[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:52.440]
Although I got I got to be honest with it my very favorite of all

[01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:58.600]
Oh

Okay, no, you're not gonna get to McDonald's they did they're gonna get a breath at McDonald's what they're gonna

[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.140]
Gonna puke their guts off from that crap

[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:38.400]
Do not eat at McDonald's I'm begging you the good news is

[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:44.540]
Remember the other day on Monday guy called in who was standing talked about standing at the Swiss hotel in a certain room on the dam

[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:45.140]
Rack at Amsterdam

[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.480]
The good news is right there on the dam rack, which is the main tourist trap

[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.120]
You know right across from that dam square

[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.380]
There's a new Albert High and Albert High is like the public's the big supermarket chain

[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:03.720]
There's an Albert High to go so it's like it's like a because they don't really have like a lot of convenience stores in Amsterdam

[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:07.980]
Yeah, I'll tell you where they do in Copenig and there's a 7-11 on every street corner

[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:13.280]
What's that all about the handy and they have great square slices of pizza there two man's good

[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:19.140]
There's a 7-11 every half a block in Copenig and when Amsterdam they're not too big on that crap or on good food

[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:24.640]
But Albert High and to go is like two doors from McDonald's so instead of when you're really desperate and you know that they

[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:29.380]
There's no good food to be found especially anything quick go to Albert High and to go

[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:33.740]
There used to be a record store. They're right on the dam rack. That's where all our Amsterdam crowd out there

[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:37.160]
It's right next to the pot all right

[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.780]
X-chain don't not that kind of pot

[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:53.700]
It's a magnificent picture and also we still got the old boon in the box and the lovely Michael Moore and his gigantic

[01:25:53.700 --> 01:26:00.560]
Ask Michael Powell what I say Michael Moore. He's also got a big ass, but so Michael Powell's much bigger ass little spot

[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:01.780]
You're the poor Michael Moore

[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.000]
Don't worry the uh, did I mention a can festival starts today

[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:10.920]
You didn't mention that oh, can't film festival starts today and the movie is in the can

[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.460]
They'll be watching it'll get all the awards again, and it will be out this summer all over the country with or without

[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:21.080]
Eisner, okay with or without Disney with or without Mickey Mouse with or without your good friend Eisner

[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:21.960]
All these people

[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:28.840]
The price of arrogance for reads the Carla, but the website they don't care about all the stories

[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:33.600]
And I work my ass off and so do you what I'm not around to put really meaningful media stories under that

[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.480]
The kind of stuff that people read to be need to be reading that they're not getting from the general American news media

[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.740]
And most people aren't gonna be bothered with that crap. How many people do you think really read those stories?

[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.240]
Yeah, if I ever felt like I was spending my wheels. It's doing that. Do you really? Yeah

[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:52.340]
I talked about it if I felt that if I felt that way I would just give up doing it

[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:57.880]
And it would be happy about that because it takes up a lot of his time and of course it wouldn't take up nearly as much of his time

[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:03.740]
If he'd let you know turn the purse strings loose to so Josh can do some of that which is the reason like we got that the

[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:10.820]
That laptop computer. Yeah, we didn't just get it so Josh can look at a bunch of porno websites on here and like be in Russia and Bogd Jr

[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:12.260]
We should have got him a laptop dance

[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:13.660]
There you go

[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:19.780]
But nevertheless, I mean, you know one of these days maybe in a fusion of generous mood

[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:23.280]
Say, oh, well guess what Josh. I guess you can put some of the real simple stories on here

[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.300]
But I don't really trust it. They do it right job. I mean like it worries. I think they're important, but I just wonder

[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:31.060]
You know, I just wonder how many people actually read those stories

[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:32.020]
30 man

[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:36.000]
The rest of the people and you'll notice how they tremendous volume of

[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.100]
Traffic we have on our website now since we started the beaded curtain and we have the naked pictures

[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:46.720]
Which I'd say about 90% of the guys out there want to see the naked pictures of the broads and about 10% want to see pants boon in the box

[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:51.840]
Right right that's about right although there's not much to say no

[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:56.600]
Very disappointing maybe it was cold that day mue pakenia

[01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:58.540]
What?

[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:03.400]
I don't think it was cold at all although quite frankly. I'll let you find out

[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:11.380]
Poor pack boon man. What a another another sad tragic tragic youth gone the down the wrong road

[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:12.900]
It came to that fork in the road man

[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:16.060]
And I think he I think he took that 2d fruity road myself

[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:22.680]
Did you know that he did he recorded 2d fruity? Oh, yeah, I saw the video. I rudy yeah

[01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:27.460]
Little wretchedy and they they haven't been speaking together to each other ever since

[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:36.260]
And he used to be so tight now. Didn't we already do that pull on the worst remake of record? Then we do or did we do something like that? Yeah

[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:41.640]
That's a sweet one. You know what he says that yeah, like go don't do that again

[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:46.900]
Yeah, yeah, I'm not as slow as you think okay. I caught that

[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:53.960]
That's really likes those pole builds. Yeah. Oh, yeah, especially the ones where you have to have like 800 different names on their song titles movie titles

[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:59.400]
We're gonna be starting out tomorrow. What's your favorite Shakespearean paragraph? Yeah, what's your favorite word

[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:01.880]
That we can still say on the air well. There's only

[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.040]
So that should narrow it down

[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:10.060]
For reads of Carla writes well before I do this I probably should take some of the good calls WQA him hello

[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.520]
Yes, no, no, the next one. We're in Jones

[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.040]
See I didn't even need you on that one. Yeah, I know

[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:24.140]
See now I finally caught he's got that tone in his voice now. We got that tone Reverend John's yeah the great one. That's actually jazz

[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:30.760]
Why don't I don't really care which is which okay? I'll leave you the the minutia of the details of which is which news on top and who's on bottom

[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.680]
WQA him hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir

[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:37.320]
I just wanted to let you know that I don't even go to the Neil Rogers show

[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.480]
Web site anymore. I just go to Neil god.com to see the

[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.740]
The curtain because you can go right through it right

[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.860]
So have a nice day and thanks for your refreshing honesty, sir. There you go

[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.680]
So you try to try to give me a stooch. You don't need to go to your website. Just go to Neil

[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.520]
So what do we care? We put it on there so you can look at it

[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:57.840]
If it does it really is an a sweat off of my ass. No, what do I care? Oh

[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:02.260]
But you can tell by the way like the hidden run job. They're like you know having our stay click

[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:06.560]
Like like I it's gonna hurt my feelings. We don't care. What do I care?

[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:08.580]
Do you care?

[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:11.380]
About what the choice coming out right

[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.920]
probably around the same time is a duff

[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:21.880]
For reads the collar writes in newsweek the price of arrogance

[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:28.420]
America's ushering in a new responsibility error says president Bush is part of his standard stump speech

[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.920]
Where each of us understands where responsible for the assistance we make in life

[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.640]
When speaking about bad CEOs, he's even clearer as to what it entails

[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:40.420]
You're beginning to see the consequences of people making irresponsible decisions

[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:43.380]
They need to pay a price for their irresponsibility. He says

[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:48.820]
I take full responsibility said Dom or Rumsfeld in his congressional testimony last week

[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:53.140]
But what does this mean secretary Rumsfeld hastened to wear that he didn't plan to resign

[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:58.440]
And wasn't that ask anyone else who might have been responsible to resign as far as I can tell taking responsibility these days means

[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:01.100]
Nothing more than saying the magic words. I take responsibility

[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:03.240]
Or maybe I apologize

[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:10.720]
After the greatest terrorist attack against America no one was asked to resign and the White House didn't even want to launched into a serious investigation in a wood

[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:15.480]
The 9-11 commission was created after months of refusal because some of the victimist families

[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.620]
Presuded aggressively and simply didn't give up

[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:23.640]
After the fiasco over raki weapons of mass destruction not one person was ever re even reassigned

[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:29.800]
The only people who've been fired or cashiered in this administration are men like general Eric Shiniski Shinseki

[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:32.960]
Paul Neal and Larry Lindsay who spoke inconvenient truths

[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:38.600]
Rumsfeld went on his testimony to explain that these terrible acts were perpetrated by a small number

[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:45.200]
That's correct except the small number who are truly responsible are not the handful of uniform personnel currently being charged for the prison abuse scandal

[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:49.760]
The events at Abu Ghraib are part of a larger breakdown in American policy over the past two years

[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:53.200]
And it's been perpetrated by a small number of people at the highest levels of government

[01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:58.940]
Since 9-11 a handful of officials at the top of the defense department and the vice presidents or a fist have

[01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:02.820]
Commented here to American foreign and defense policy in the name of fighting terror

[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:07.420]
They have systematically weakened the traditional restraints that have made this country respected around the world

[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:16.120]
alliances international institutions norms and ethical conventions have all been deemed inexpensive indulges expensive indulgences at a time of crisis

[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:23.140]
Within weeks after 9-11 senior officials at the Pentagon and the White House began to drive to maximize American freedom of action

[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:27.540]
The attack specifically the Geneva conventions which governed behavior during wartime

[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:32.140]
Rumsfeld explained that the conventions did not apply to today's set of facts

[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:37.280]
He and his top a to try persistently to keep produce out of a reach of either American courts or international law

[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:41.840]
Presumably so they can be handled without those petty fogging rules as barriers

[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:48.900]
Rumsfeld initially fought both the uniform military and colon powerhards that prisoners in Guantanamo be accorded rights under the conventions

[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:53.420]
Eventually he gave in on the matter, but continue to suggest that the protocols were antiquated

[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:58.680]
Last week he said again that the Geneva conventions did not precisely apply and were simply basic rules

[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:04.360]
The conventions are not exactly optional. They're the law of the land signed by the president ratified by Congress

[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:10.080]
Rumsfeld's concern that al-Qaeda members do not wear uniforms in our thus unlawful combatants is understandable

[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:14.420]
But that's a determination that a military court would have to make in a war that would go on for decades

[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:18.500]
You cannot simply arrest detained people indefinitely on the say so of the Secretary of Defense

[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:25.440]
The basic attitude taken by Rumsfeld Cheney in their top aides has been word war all these sub-pieties will have to wait

[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.260]
as a result

[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:33.040]
Is that word not then you see the copy of this no to miracle I can read it all all these nice

[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.680]
ities I guess we'll have to wait same difference as a result

[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:40.460]
We've waged preemptive war in the latterly spread international cooperation rejected you in participation

[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:45.420]
You may lead an allies this kind of the need for local support in Iraq and incurred massive cost and blood and treasure

[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:50.940]
If the world is not to be trusted in these dangerous times key agencies of the American government like the state

[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.560]
Department are to be trusted even less

[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:58.420]
Congress is barely informed even on issues on which its advice and consent are constitutionally mandated

[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:07.060]
Leave process aside the results are plain on almost every issue involving post-war Iraq troop strength international support the credibility of exiles

[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:09.960]
debatification handling a total of al-Sistani

[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.560]
Washington's assumptions and policies have all been wrong

[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:18.320]
By now most have been reversed often too late to have much effect the strange combination of arrogance and incompetence

[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:23.440]
Is not only destroyed the hope for a new Iraq it's had the much broader effect of turning the United States into an international

[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.540]
Outlaw in the eyes of much of the world whether he wins or loses in November

[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:33.560]
George W. Bush's legacy is now clear the creation of a poisonous atmosphere of anti-Americanism around the globe

[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:35.720]
I'm sure he takes full responsibility

[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:48.780]
More how it is David and the only thing funny and then rape of it is that pipe smokers toward the one hour

[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:53.800]
Another thing

[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.080]
A little bit of a star by now

[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:01.020]
You have that little bit squeak voice and you expect to get anywhere a little beauty

[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:01.320]
Poo

[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.240]
We take you

[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.040]
And I take it

[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.180]
I want it to 35 white

[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:08.020]
I have come up

[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:08.440]
I want you

[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.340]
The more white

[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:11.080]
The more white you

[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.980]
Yeah, what about you

[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:15.160]
The more white hate you

[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:16.600]
What do I think?

[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.280]
And when I see you

[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:22.660]
I want to die

[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:25.920]
You're the category

[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:30.560]
Oh, Tonyl, she's a robot

[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.620]
Me in a donut

[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:37.880]
And point my body

[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:41.720]
Why you are a smth you

[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.920]
I know my smell attracts you

[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.320]
But unlike that you

[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.080]
You still got some job

[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:57.280]
I feel just like

[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:00.640]
That you are my brother

[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:04.320]
And what you need to another

[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.220]
That's why you are so much fine

[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:09.420]
That's it

[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.320]
That's right

[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:17.200]
That's right

[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:27.400]
That's right

[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.220]
I want to show

[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:31.160]
And what you

[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.800]
In a cowboy

[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.420]
If we kill it so far

[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:38.660]
Absolutely

[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:41.760]
Oh, promo to it

[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.840]
560 WQ unhappy Wednesday afternoon

[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.160]
And the reason I listen to the oldest hearing

[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.440]
Merpmo Howard David had says this back so there you go

[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.580]
And of course keep in mind

[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:50.720]
Oh, we're fine

[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.900]
That's why he listens

[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:53.000]
Oh, do we want to put that on there?

[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:54.020]
What?

[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:55.380]
That's the job

[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:57.200]
No, we're not going to add on to this pool

[01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.580]
Don't get sucked into that game

[01:36:58.580 --> 01:36:59.360]
It was kind of cute

[01:36:59.360 --> 01:36:59.960]
I waited there

[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:00.880]
I played the guy the bit

[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.000]
Okay, which I love that bit

[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:03.960]
But let's not add on

[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:07.440]
This is not a pool that needs to be embellished, expanded, etc

[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:09.840]
Which of these best describes

[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.420]
Why you listen to the Neil Roger show

[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:12.300]
For a few laps

[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.660]
A yuck or two here or there

[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.280]
168

[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.620]
54.1 percent

[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:17.940]
Here the stories Neil reads

[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:18.280]
82

[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:19.800]
26.4 percent

[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:20.960]
That's not really that bad

[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.140]
Because I'm sure that there's like mix and match

[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:23.940]
There's you what I'm saying

[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.520]
We didn't ask which of these best describes

[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:29.000]
It kills four hours of my boring life

[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:29.640]
I have no life

[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.220]
34

[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.860]
I hate Neil but I can't turn it off 11

[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:34.460]
Now we're starting to get to the truth

[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:36.000]
Now we knew I knew that would go up

[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:37.480]
Hate me like poison

[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.300]
Probably hate you even worse if that's possible

[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:41.100]
But they can't turn it off

[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:43.360]
To hear the crazy and the crank calls

[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:44.380]
Nine and nine

[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.320]
And to hear the call is opinion six

[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:47.920]
Not too uh

[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:49.600]
Not too thrilling there would have callers

[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.660]
For some strange reason

[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:51.340]
Now

[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:54.220]
Let's see you're like this

[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.420]
Let's say something good about John Kerry for change

[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:57.200]
Can't say too much

[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.340]
Democratic challenger John Kerry said today his first choices

[01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:01.600]
Defense secretary would be

[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.460]
Republican senator John McCain

[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:08.120]
As he criticized the Bush administration for failed policies in Iraq

[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:12.220]
Kerry slammed Bush and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld for the abuse of Iraqi prisoners

[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:14.420]
They're figured to build an international coalition

[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:14.780]
Other

[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.920]
Miscalculation surrounding this war

[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.360]
This thing has been so extraordinarily mismanaged

[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.100]
And in an ugly prosecutor he said

[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:23.340]
He told I miss in the morning

[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:25.020]
Well, we missed that this morning. Thank God

[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:27.640]
A day after army major general Antonio Taguba

[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:31.520]
Toll Congress the abuse re reflected the failure of leadership in the US Armed Forces

[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:34.060]
We're renewing this call for Bush to take full responsibility

[01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:35.080]
See there as again

[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.240]
And Rumsfeld to resign despite his apology

[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:39.140]
Kerry singled out to McCain of Arizona

[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:42.060]
A fellow Vietnam veteran and frequent Bush critic

[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:44.040]
When pressed on who he want running the Pentagon

[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:47.440]
Here we listed several other possible candidates

[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:49.720]
Who could manage the Pentagon very effectively including

[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:51.740]
Democratic Senator Carl Levitt of Michigan

[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:53.700]
Republican Senator John Warner for Virginia

[01:38:54.260 --> 01:38:56.360]
Yadi Yadi Yadi in a partridge in a pair of tree

[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.360]
That's a good move though of mentioning McCain

[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:00.880]
Don't you think? I absolutely do

[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:01.980]
Public likes John McCain

[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:04.040]
They feel a little bad about that thing on his cheek

[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:05.300]
But nevertheless they like him a lot

[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:05.880]
I like him

[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:07.060]
Now wait a year this

[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:09.180]
You sitting down?

[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:09.940]
Oh yeah

[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:12.820]
New York Daily News Michael Goodwin's column today

[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:17.360]
Liberal radio is airing bad jokes and worst taste

[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.000]
There's one word in here

[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.100]
I can't even read on here

[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.840]
It's not not a I just can't read it

[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:22.880]
You'll understand why

[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:23.180]
All right

[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.060]
The United States is on the slippery slope to theocratic fascism

[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:31.180]
The Catholic Church has been secretly encouraging oral sex for years

[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:33.760]
The French secretary Donald Rumsfeld ought to be tortured

[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:36.820]
President Bush should be taken out and I can't read it

[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:38.360]
Okay

[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.740]
But it doesn't need any comment

[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:42.100]
It's just no why I can't read

[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:45.060]
Those are a few nut-so-nuggets from the host of

[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:47.700]
Aramereca Radio which calls itself the new liberal voice

[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.200]
The fledgling network is carried in New York on WLIV 1190 AM

[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:54.360]
With the Iraq torture scandal everywhere I tuned in expecting the

[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:56.820]
Her sober policy analysis mixed with Glee over

[01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:58.480]
President Bush's political pickle

[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.660]
Instead I got 10 hours of rancid venom

[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.040]
directed at the president Rumsfeld Rush Limbaugh

[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:06.760]
The Catholic Church and anyone else the host felt like slamming

[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.780]
If you're a card-carrying liberal who likes crude sex jokes

[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:11.280]
And a cartoonish echo chamber

[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.820]
Air America is for you

[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:16.940]
Take one host linking of the talk of pulling out the troops with a claim that

[01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:18.700]
That's what the Catholic Church has about

[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:19.540]
Primeral sex

[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:20.400]
Ha ha

[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:24.720]
The network aims to give Democrats a media organization to counter Limbaugh

[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.360]
And others on the right who dominate talk radio

[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.900]
What national public radio in the New York Times aren't enough

[01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:32.460]
The signing of comedian and best sounding author Al Franken gave air

[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:35.400]
America a liberal drawing card but if his three-hour show on Monday was

[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.200]
typical he could sink the ship instead of saving it

[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:40.760]
Two attempts at humor offensive in his

[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:41.960]
Oy Oy show

[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.140]
Set to Israeli music

[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:47.600]
A sidekick reads news reports in this case the murder of the Russian

[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:48.980]
Back President of Chechnya

[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:51.460]
Franken's rule is to pipe up a lighthearted

[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:53.360]
Oy Oy Oy

[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.420]
Yep nothing tickles the ribs like an assassination

[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:58.860]
Franken also imitated a priest-given

[01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:01.060]
Communion saying body of Christ when an imagined

[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:02.480]
Pedophile priest was in line

[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.900]
But not for you when pro-choice politicians came up

[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:09.000]
The Church was a day-long obsession as was Limbaugh

[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.800]
He's an awful man of pig and a Nazi

[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.020]
Franken said

[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:16.220]
Color may confuse if Franken and company hate to pill-pob a Limbaugh so much

[01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:20.320]
Why imitate his tarpit tone sounds like Limbaugh simply driven them nuts

[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.580]
Missing was the tension that comes from honest debate only Franken had guest voice even the slightest distance

[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:29.700]
From the party line which is that John Curie is perfect except he should attack Bushmore

[01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.900]
The Queen of Venom Randy Rhodes

[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:39.160]
That is a great line the Queen of Venom Randy Rhodes followed Franken in the hosts slot

[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:43.280]
Her imitation of a cracker military type telling a soldier to insert this

[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.980]
Florescent light bulb into that man's buttocks was revolting

[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:49.540]
She compared US prisons interact to the Nazi ghoulog and said

[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:52.260]
The day I say thank you to Rumsfield is the same day

[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:55.000]
I'll say thank you to the 12 people who raped me

[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.480]
Rock bottom came when she compared Bush and his family to the Corleone's and the Godfather's Saga

[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:02.840]
Like Frado somebody ought to take him out fishing and oh geez

[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:08.960]
You know somebody ought to explain to this girl the things that you can and cannot say on the year about any present

[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:09.820]
Not just this one

[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:11.000]
Jesus

[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:15.500]
Jesus Christ and then up to just make you want to cry

[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:21.260]
Assuming it's all true. Yeah, how I have I don't think that the guy's gonna make this up. It's you know

[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:26.440]
During a day of torture by radio I heard ads for Hulib Packard Greyhound and especially general Motors

[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.700]
I asked GM. I had appeared in such shows

[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:34.380]
Ridee Karney GM's manager marketing communications said the ads were wrongly picked from an earlier deal with WLIV

[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:36.960]
She said the station was ordered the season assistance that they added

[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.300]
GM will not advertise that any of America for you. It's well good. He good good gumdrops for them

[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:46.220]
I don't see really all of that much in there except of course that comment that she made what you can't see on here

[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:51.980]
But again, you know when you take stuff out of context. What does it really mean except for the fact that Al Franken is okay on and print

[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:53.200]
He's not a broadcaster

[01:42:54.660 --> 01:43:00.340]
And that she obviously is like going off the deep end evidently all for deep end man

[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:02.400]
Jesus

[01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:07.140]
Anyway, so there's this guy's probably a right-winger anyway. I don't have no Michael Goodwin

[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.500]
calmness in New York Daily News. I have no idea. Never heard of it. No

[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.080]
Anyway, there you go the three-reprooze hold on they are posed with ordinarily is very far to the right

[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.000]
Show me of the Daily News. They're just about anybody else

[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.560]
But they got a really good calm here by John Crudell. What are they smoking at the labor department? You're like this one

[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:28.980]
He says don't get too excited about all those new jobs that were supposed to be created in April

[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:32.180]
I'm not going to waste a lot of my precious space on this

[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:38.100]
But the bottom line is that most of the 288,000 jobs that the labor departments has were created last month may not really exist

[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.720]
They could be figments of statisticians optimism

[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:46.840]
Anyone who plotted through my column last Thursday knows I predicted that job growth in April would be better than the 160 to 170

[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:48.640]
Thousands jobs the pros were anticipating

[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:52.400]
But I also said quite emphatically. I hope that the stronger growth would be an illusion

[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.280]
The result of the labor department's computers making happy predictions about seasonal job creation

[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:00.660]
Could neither be verified or justified. I'll explain one aspect

[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:04.200]
Back in the March employment report the government added

[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:07.420]
153,000 positions to its revised total of

[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:13.060]
337,000 new jobs because it thought but couldn't prove loads of new companies were being created in this economy

[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:16.340]
That estimate comes from the labor department's birth death model

[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:21.340]
You can look up these numbers on the department's website as staggering as the assumption about new companies was in March

[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:23.340]
The labor department cut even more brazen than April

[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:34.000]
Last Friday was disclosed that these imagery imaginary jobs have been increased by 117,000 to 270,000 for the latest month because I guess the statjockey's got a vision from the gods of spring

[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:40.000]
Without those extra 117,000 make-believe jobs the real total growth rate would have been just

[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:46.120]
171,000 subpar for an economy that's supposed to be growing at more than 4% a year but right on the pros targets

[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:52.540]
Take away all 270,000 make-believe jobs and what you have the sort of pessimism that the political pollsters are seeing

[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:56.040]
If I was the suspicious type and if I thought Washington was smart enough

[01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:01.760]
I suspect a nasty motive behind the sudden surge in these mystery jobs, but for now let's just acknowledge their existence

[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:07.740]
Also keep in mind that the government doesn't distinguish between good companies being created and say a guy doing

[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:10.440]
Consulting work out of his basement because he can't find real work

[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:13.440]
What is this new job run announcement mean in the real world?

[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:17.280]
It means it'll be more pressure on the financial markets as we've seen for a while

[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:18.520]
But especially since last Thursday

[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:23.120]
It also means that the federal reserve now is the excuse it needs to raise interest rates in June is

[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.300]
I've said what happened before and we'll probably start regretting that move by the end of the summer

[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:30.480]
And President Bush will probably give him the temptation and start crowing about the economy

[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:36.440]
Going against the mood is captured by pollsters. This will make him look as out of touch as reality with reality as his father did

[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.460]
And here's some more bad news about Iraqi rights

[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.640]
A source in the intelligence community

[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:48.180]
Community tells me that the UN oil embargo of Saddam Hussein was worthless because Iraqi oil was being shipped all of these years to a

[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:50.580]
Caribbean island called St. Eustaceous

[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:54.320]
Unloaded onto unshore tanks and then reloaded in the US bomb tanker ships

[01:45:54.320 --> 01:46:00.320]
The same switcher was being done with Iranian oil on told oh and the sources say Washington would rather than nobody know about this

[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:02.960]
Wait, how do you like that?

[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:04.080]
Gee

[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:08.220]
That Saddam was enabled to it and I'll tell you to speak about evil people

[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:12.460]
Some of these idiotic comments that have been made in the last 24 hours since the beginning of the American

[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:16.340]
Since he had his head sliced off by much of al-Qaeda lunatics

[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:20.080]
This goes to Sharia what evil people these are and about you know

[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:25.060]
As if we need a reminder after they kill 3000 innocent people by hijacking planes and flying them into buildings

[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.420]
They're bad people. Oh no kidding

[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.760]
I forgot about that hadn't you?

[01:46:30.940 --> 01:46:35.300]
12 minutes past noon. They're naughty and they're nasty. They need to be spanked bad

[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:38.800]
So let's attack a country that had nothing to do with it. Yeah, let's like attack

[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:41.340]
spade and door of that

[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.380]
Oh Chinese already did that. Oh

[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:48.460]
Well the Dalai Lama was just here a couple weeks ago or in right here in Toronto

[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:52.680]
But a whole bunch of the Narputus people all the people with her schmatzes on did he dilly dally?

[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.880]
I don't know. I don't I don't want to see him

[01:46:56.260 --> 01:47:01.060]
You got enough bald head at geeks at QAM. They don't need to see the Dalai Lama. Although I didn't reach out my window

[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:04.780]
I waved said hello Dalai a couple of times. He said you know look like the way Armstrong

It's are you laughing for me now

[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:38.560]
And then the Lord said let there be light

[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:46.400]
And low there was light from the same people who brought you the much beloved talking Bible

[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:51.660]
Comes a new 10 volume set brilliantly updated for the 80s

Yes, it's the wrapping

[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:59.540]
Bible there was dark everywhere then the man said light and the light was there

[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:04.740]
He said I done good there's no doubt on the seventh day. He just chill out

[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:10.640]

There's a town called Sotter and tomorrow everybody party like no tomorrow

[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:20.080]
God look down

[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:23.740]
Sit now my fall don't look back or you turn too far

[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:27.780]
That's why to the beat started to freak the cow came up and let's

[01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:35.540]
Take a lick your a cheek your imagine all the song all the parables every sacred biblical word

[01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:39.000]
Interpreted by the finest sucker MC of all time

[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:48.980]
For wrapping Bible making his word fresh again

[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:55.120]
From my 10 at 560 w2m the mad dog Jim Mandage the man he'll be along it to this afternoon

[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.840]
Then you got Kim Bo camper who's even a bigger man in some respects

[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.060]
Is he gonna bring that cow with him from front of the dealership? I'm I'm here

[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:05.320]
I don't want to like bring your personal stuff in on the air

[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:08.340]
But why are you not getting your vehicle fixed at

[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:10.860]
Kim Bo camper's dealership?

[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:12.220]
Well, be on my budget

[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:17.320]
Considering what it needs done. It's not under warranty. Not no more old

[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.380]
Four years old now. Yeah

[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.600]
Then that sound like a sob story to you Josh. Yeah a little bit

[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:29.320]
Don't teach it go like to some Israeli businessman and get the ripped off man. That'll teach you

[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.280]
See that article I read from the daily news. I'm almost sorry that I read it about your America

[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:36.300]
It indicates to me just have this with you

[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:40.520]
But the idea that he's expecting to tune in and hear a bunch of really straight-laced political

[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:44.200]
That would be the biggest kiss of that at least if they're trying a little bit of humor on there

[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:48.700]
Maybe they might have a chance all the way down it, but maybe they might say and maybe if some of it was actually funny

[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:50.680]
The only thing I'd find very disturbing though

[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:55.300]
Was that this skid he was describing on the al franken show was obviously

[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:58.040]
Scrake everything he does is scripted right

[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:00.500]
Well, that's because he's a scripter he writes

[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:05.980]
But how can you be a broadcaster and read from a script?

[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:09.760]
And there he is one thing if you're reading bedtime stories

[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:12.880]
Okay, which I think I'm probably the only one who does that and it's probably pretty boring

[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:18.280]
But I mean to be to do be doing your show reading from a script comedy stuff

[01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:20.720]
Oh my god

[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:26.960]
That's when I saw that clip of them doing the show and the Monday morning show and if those were

[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:33.220]
No, they were just chatting their him and his cohort. Oh, there's a chat show. Yeah

[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:40.300]
Although I think they were pronouncing it wrong. I see probably US military opens investigation into

[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:44.500]
Well, it's the abuse of prisoner in eastern Afghanistan. How do you like that? Oh my god

[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:50.960]
Kabul the US military is open and investigation into allegations that an Afghan police officer was stripped naked beaten and

[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:53.880]
photographed at US base in Afghanistan official said today

[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:56.580]
This must be just the other one of those strange coincidences when you think

[01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:57.660]
Let's be

[01:51:58.180 --> 01:52:01.680]
And then they just showed your girlfriend another again, Linda England that I'm thinking of myself

[01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:04.280]
Cuz she's pricked and forget about that. I don't like them

[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:07.520]
Just thinking of myself all these poor schleps man who were over there

[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:11.780]
They're the ones that are gonna have to be the scapegoats because that's what they're looking for now is scapegoats

[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:15.560]
So we're gonna court martial her we're gonna court martial at other broad and a few other guys

[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:19.820]
And and there'd be like a you know half a dozen or so scapegoats and then all the other higher up

[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:24.080]
So who really were responsible for giving all the orders they'll just go along and marry away

[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:27.820]
Well, if it'll care if the soldiers die they're not gonna care if they go to jail right

[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:33.980]
The alleged abuse in Afghanistan occurred in August 2003 at the American base in the eastern town of Garda

[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:35.600]
60 miles south of the capital of Kabul

[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:40.060]
According to a statement by the US Embassy in Kabul the US military has launched an immediate investigation

[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:44.840]
The statement said adding US officials had a learn of the allegations from the media

[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:53.240]
Lieutenant Colonel Tucker Manseger a military spokesman said the case was only brought to the military's attention yesterday

[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:57.400]
And is being investigated by the army's criminal investigation department. He wouldn't discuss details

[01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:00.960]
Saying they wanted to investigate in a totally impartial manner

[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:03.060]
New York Times quoted the former police Colonel

[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:06.720]
Syed Navi said dicky 47 a saying you subjected the sexual abuse

[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:11.020]
Totted in sleep deprivation and yada yada yada in the cartridge and appear tree

[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:12.260]
and

[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:17.120]
With same-sex marriage becoming legal in Massachusetts on Monday

[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:26.600]
Newspapers throughout the state are preparing to wash her in a new era by publishing the same sex wedding and engagement announcements on their pages in Massachusetts

[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:35.320]
What isn't clear? However is how many newly married gay and lesbian couples will choose the traditional method of using their local newspaper to trump at the news

[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:39.880]
Now I skit again when is Troy coming out?

[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:43.240]
Huh Troy

[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:52.140]
Less than two years after the New York Times did a crucial precedent by announcing its willingness to publicize same-sex unions and commitment ceremonies

[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:54.040]
The sands have shifted dramatically

[01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:55.740]
Right Troy

[01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:02.060]
Same-sex marriage is about to be legally sanctioned editors around Massachusetts say they have no crumbs about publicizing these events

[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:04.280]
A Boston Globe Survey of 15 Massachusetts

[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:10.400]
Daily's including the two largest Globe and a Herald found that they that's the Boston Herald of course found they plan to treat same-sex

[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:13.280]
Marriage announcements the same as heterosexual wedding news

[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:20.120]
Only one newspaper that responded to the Globe inquiry the Ponton data Gazette sit in heaven formerly decided whether to publish the announcements

[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.200]
Maybe they'll just spend their time Ponton the couples

[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:27.520]
You think they're a little teething too. They just have a dog track in Ponton. I wonder if it's still there

[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:31.060]
I haven't even thought about that yet said the man in jand under Dave Brown

[01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:37.840]
Malik now is in that the paper would probably have said well isn't that great Troy I congratulate you Troy. Let us know who the lucky fella is

[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:43.540]
5 6 7 0 5 60 he did pound 5 60 on a AT&T

[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.460]
And Verizon wireless line wouldn't that be a hell of a quenilla Troy and Roy

[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:49.900]
I can just smell it now

[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:55.800]
Which in these best describes why you listen to the neo-roger show that's our second pull question today

[01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:57.300]
378 votes

[01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.980]
For a few laughs 202

[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:05.880]
To hear the stories neo reads 100 so 53.4% for a few yucks

[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:09.400]
26 and a half percent for those bedtime stories

[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:15.840]
And then of course we got those other people who want make sure we understand they don't even go to neo-rogers.com on our website

[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:19.440]
They're like subverting. They're going behind our back. So then get right to those dirty pictures

[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:23.360]
Yeah, well, we have a backdoor for them. Yeah, but I bet you that kids got his own

[01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:30.760]
It kills four hours of my boring life 43. There's at least some honesty there. I have no life

[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:35.840]
I hate neo, but I can't turn it off 14 hate him despising

[01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:45.560]
To hear the crazy and crank callers 12 and hear the callers opinion 7 out of 378 the callers aren't doing too well there

[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:51.340]
What would get the distinct feeling that maybe the callers have been the little on the weak side for the last how many years now

[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:56.580]
They might pick up like this call online nine. I bet she's gonna be a real wiener. Hello. There's nothing else on

[01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:59.340]
What is it? There's nothing else on

[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:04.880]
That's why there's nothing else on yep your radio only picks up Q a m

[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.780]
Don't you post the hang up a new one now? No, I'm waiting. I'm just waiting for you to come up with some new material

[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:10.420]
Okay

[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:16.880]
Okay, don't have it can't do it see that's them right there that's the reason that the callers are in last place because of you

[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:21.960]
Season shocked that I actually like I mean, I'm not gonna be hurry to hang up on people

[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.740]
The brother's a few we make an exception on

[01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:29.720]
But he's so sad almost felt sorry for him there. There's nothing else on

[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:34.580]
See but that already is in the category of the kill four hours of my boring life, see I have no life

[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:37.800]
That's what you're trying to say pal. We already put a perfect category for you there

[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:41.920]
He didn't even recognize it. No wqm. Hello

[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.040]
Neil yes, sir

[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:48.400]
There's another reason why people listen to you and it's what is that sir?

[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.460]
And you can phrase it one of two ways Neil tells it like it is and you can trust that

[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:57.640]
Or what he'll says makes a lot of sense

[01:56:58.200 --> 01:56:58.940]
Uh-huh

[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.300]
That's the reason why I listen to you you're honest

[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:07.360]
I know you're a carry supporter, but there have even been times when you've come out and said I can't figure out

[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:12.900]
What John Kerry's doing ways and I'll put out right you know, I just like the fact that

[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:17.360]
In not afraid to be straightforward and tell the truth I'm gonna be straight man

[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:19.340]
Well, I know

[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:24.480]
You know, you know, I'm trying to say you I do there's value to what you have to say on your program

[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:30.440]
Thanks for the look job man. Thank you so much. Okay. See you. Bye. Let's put that on there because Neil tells it like it is

[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:34.580]
Huh? Yeah, I'm just gonna bend over and let you kiss my dear ears

[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:37.700]
There you go. I like I understand what you say. Maybe that would be a nice thing

[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:39.440]
There's nothing wrong with being nice once in a while

[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:42.880]
I was telling George the other morning off the earth and I'll say right on the ear

[01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:48.580]
That since I've been hearing Toronto the last couple of years have been part of the time that I find myself being a much nicer person

[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:50.140]
Sure, I hold the door open for people

[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:54.180]
I it converts a little bit with my neighbors when they come into building with their groceries or whatever on the elevator

[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:58.920]
And I just I just find myself doing things that in South Florida wouldn't dream of being like nice to strangers

[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:02.520]

235 60 WDQA anyway Josh little spelling lesson here for you little grammar spelling all of these things

[02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:06.910]
Okay, okay now I'm looking here

[02:01:06.910 --> 02:01:11.550]
You did put that on or Neil tells it like it is which has seven votes already by the way. Thanks for our kiss of my ass

[02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:14.950]
But why is there an apostrophe in the word tells

[02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:19.330]
Mr as a matter of fact

[02:01:19.810 --> 02:01:30.790]
Could there ever possibly be an apostrophe in the word TELS is there any possibility that or any circumstances for any meaning sure the word tells

[02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:36.430]
Sure such as the guy didn't tell and he's got a pen. It's tells pen

[02:01:38.490 --> 02:01:41.210]
With a small T. Well, no that would be a

[02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:45.150]
I'm trying for

[02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:48.350]
Why is that apostrophe in there?

[02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:51.230]
Oops, and the worst part of it is now you can't change it

[02:01:51.930 --> 02:01:56.890]
Eric can change it. So once again you have to rely on fat old Eric to go in there with his magic one

[02:01:56.890 --> 02:02:00.550]
Make you up as apostrophe go away. He's not so old

[02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:02.610]
Just fat

[02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:05.170]
That would you try to say was that a shot at Eric?

[02:02:05.530 --> 02:02:08.910]
Yeah, there was a shot at fat Eric up there in Orlando man shame on you

[02:02:18.210 --> 02:02:21.430]
227 53 few chuckles like that

[02:02:22.170 --> 02:02:28.390]
Here these stories those bedtime stories those ponderous long stories that Neil fumbles and bubbles over

[02:02:29.050 --> 02:02:31.030]
108 25.2 percent

[02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:35.350]
Although actually then reading fairly well because my blood sugar is under 500 good job

[02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:42.530]
It kills four hours of my boring life 49 11.1 percent say I have no life and they're right and we understand they're in South Florida

[02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:43.130]
What do you expect?

[02:02:44.010 --> 02:02:45.850]
To hear the crazy and crank calls

[02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:53.010]
15 I hate Neil but can't turn it off 15 Neil tells it like it is a dozen. It's moving up there already. Thank you, sir

[02:02:53.970 --> 02:02:58.830]
And fear the callers opinions nine out of 440 votes see

[02:02:58.830 --> 02:03:03.370]
I hate to break it to that columnist in the New York Daily News and also the people that are America

[02:03:03.370 --> 02:03:12.230]
But that whole right versus life. It's done. It's history. It's finito. Okay the old style talk radio any I could have told them that saved them a lot of money

[02:03:12.770 --> 02:03:17.630]
For for one hundredth of whatever their money. They're wasting on his crap. I could have saved them all that money

[02:03:18.570 --> 02:03:20.550]
Said forget about it

[02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:25.270]
Don't waste millions and millions and try to put on a liberal talk network. It's gonna go over like halivine

[02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:28.210]
Siberia the god about it right

[02:03:28.730 --> 02:03:33.170]
Although halivine microwave pretty well Siberia. They probably still have a lot of old Jews. Let's talk the way there

[02:03:33.930 --> 02:03:37.830]
See what I'm saying? What he said? I'm saying Mo Wattabi in Siberia

[02:03:39.570 --> 02:03:42.190]
56705 60 pound 560 here's a good story though

[02:03:42.190 --> 02:03:45.210]
Well, you know, it's doubly good. You want to know why because it's in Dave County

[02:03:46.210 --> 02:03:50.110]
And since all of us and that's right josh lives in Dave. Well, that's okay. The amount of money you got

[02:03:50.110 --> 02:03:54.710]
You don't have to wait up in time date. You know, that's right. It lives in western coral spring somewhere around there

[02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:57.690]
So we're three for three we live in

[02:03:58.230 --> 02:03:58.670]
Yeah

[02:03:59.950 --> 02:04:03.810]
Dave County commissioners yesterday gave their blessing to wait 367

[02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:09.530]
Million dollar plan to build a retractable roof ballpark for the marlins southwest of the orange bowl

[02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:13.430]
Anybody want to go there? No, anybody want to go anywhere near the orange bowl? No, of course not

[02:04:14.370 --> 02:04:17.350]
Practice reading about him makes makes me want to run to another bowl

[02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:22.010]
acknowledging there's still numerous questions to be answered and much work that needs to be done

[02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:27.250]
Commission's voted eight to three for the proposal the plan was approved unanimously by the city commission in Miami last week

[02:04:27.250 --> 02:04:31.590]
Of course, this is before the marlins lost to Houston six to one last night. They might change their mind

[02:04:32.630 --> 02:04:37.430]
The vote allows city county and team officials to begin work in earnest on a full financing proposal

[02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:39.850]
With legal guarantees and construction specifications

[02:04:39.850 --> 02:04:45.590]
But the plan is contingent on selling the the city selling the old Miami arena a process already underway

[02:04:45.590 --> 02:04:50.210]
And securing a sales tax rebate from the state that would fill a 30 million dollar financing gap

[02:04:50.210 --> 02:04:51.790]
In the plan

[02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:58.590]
Although officials are hopeful for the stable grant the team the two million dollar sales takes tax rebate for 30 years

[02:04:59.150 --> 02:05:04.350]
During next year's session marlins president david samson said the team will need to come up with an alternate plan

[02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:06.270]
Should the state funding not come through

[02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:11.090]
Samson said construction will need to be started by December or January to ensure April

[02:05:11.650 --> 02:05:18.810]
2007 opening the team is counting on or else the plan calls for a 38,000-seat ball park in a 2500 space parking garage

[02:05:18.810 --> 02:05:24.670]
The team committed 20 million bucks upfront 127 million in rent payments from future revenue when ten million dollars from a ticket

[02:05:24.670 --> 02:05:26.810]
Sir charge and a parkers in a pair of three

[02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:30.690]
5605 60

[02:06:05.610 --> 02:06:07.270]

[02:06:08.010 --> 02:06:13.690]
I just want to let you know overall these years you never lost your integrity you stay close to your gun and

[02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:18.030]
You know, people were more on the same page as you and

Just keep doing what you're doing and keep fighting the good fight because we need more people like you around

[02:06:24.010 --> 02:06:29.510]
Thanks a lot, pali. You got him. I'm gonna tell myself off. Thank you. Okay. That was good. When they're good call

[02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:32.350]

[02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:36.910]
Hi, pali. That's good. I mean don't look too hard because that's bad for your words

[02:06:36.910 --> 02:06:41.410]
That's what Duff was explaining me before the show today. He says it causes very painful identification

[02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:50.450]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line and I'll tell you one thing Duff knows that he knows it inside now

[02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:55.690]
But why oh he knows his ass

[02:06:56.710 --> 02:07:01.950]
He knows his ass from your elbow. Oh, there's something funny on TV. Oh, now bet you there was

[02:07:02.350 --> 02:07:06.690]
In fact, if you don't cut the crap, he might have his elbow up your nose pretty soon if you don't watch it

[02:07:07.250 --> 02:07:10.410]
On to your armpit or somewhere maybe old joshes. I'll always watch in it

[02:07:11.190 --> 02:07:13.730]
20 till one at five sixty down. I don't know what it is

[02:07:13.730 --> 02:07:18.390]
But that is it just me or today seem to be like for a fairly pleasant day and we're not supposed to feel really good

[02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:25.470]
In American guy a young guy with his heads chopped off yesterday. What do you talk? We're sitting here. Why die every day

[02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:31.250]
Well, that's true, but I mean this was you know what we're making a bigger deal out of this because they got it on video

[02:07:31.250 --> 02:07:32.990]
And just like those pictures of all the

[02:07:33.930 --> 02:07:36.610]
Dehumanization of the Iraqi prisoners when you have the pictures man

[02:07:36.610 --> 02:07:40.230]
That's what makes it more graphic if it's just like some kind of you know vague

[02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:42.930]
Nebulous. Oh, there's a bunch of dead people over there

[02:07:42.930 --> 02:07:47.890]
And then of course if you prevent the people from seeing the coffins which they're they're just frantically trying to continue doing that

[02:07:47.890 --> 02:07:50.350]
Then it makes it seem like not even real, you know

[02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:54.710]
But as some people we know would say is real

[02:07:55.730 --> 02:07:57.310]
Cool, it's another one. Oh

[02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:57.610]

[02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:38.250]
The Vatican Foreign Minister told Nathagin newspaper. You ready for that? Okay

[02:10:38.910 --> 02:10:46.090]
In an interview published today in the Romneyley La Re publica archbishop Giovanni La Jolo described the abuses as a tragic episode

[02:10:46.090 --> 02:10:51.590]
In the relationship with Islam and said the scandal would fuel hatred for the west and for Christianity no Schmitt

[02:10:52.170 --> 02:10:57.070]
The torture a more serious blow to the US than 911 except that the blow was not inflicted by terrorists

[02:10:57.070 --> 02:11:01.390]
But by Americans against themselves La Jolo was quoted as saying in La Re publica

[02:11:02.070 --> 02:11:07.650]
La Jolo said that intelligence people in Arab countries understand that in a democracy such episodes are not hidden and are punished

[02:11:07.650 --> 02:11:13.630]
Still the vast mass of people under the influence of Arab media cannot but feel a version in hate for the west growing inside themselves

[02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:17.230]
And yet if the West is often identified with Christianity

[02:11:17.230 --> 02:11:18.010]
Oi

[02:11:18.730 --> 02:11:23.490]
The remarks went up the first by La Jolo on the abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and the wake of the scandal

[02:11:23.490 --> 02:11:27.610]
He had said that a democracy should punish those responsible and their direct superiors

[02:11:27.610 --> 02:11:32.330]
In fact the speaking of punishing your superiors how about you pops

[02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:39.190]
The Vatican paper La Zerva Thoreau Romano has also won some harsh comments in the past days

[02:11:39.190 --> 02:11:45.030]
On Monday criticized what it called a Pentagon cover up until Sharpeh with the photograph of a soldier holding a prisoner by a leash

[02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:49.850]
And Wednesday's interview today La Jolo said the coalition's party should be putting as soon as possible at the head of the Iraqi

[02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:54.250]
Executive and Iraqi leader who speaks to the Iraqis in Arabic and not in English

[02:11:54.250 --> 02:11:56.950]
In other words somebody they might understand then we've got a problem

[02:11:58.230 --> 02:12:04.710]
President Bush is scheduled to hold talks with the Pope in the Vatican on June 4th. Oh my God

[02:12:04.710 --> 02:12:06.470]
Absolutely correct sir

[02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.950]
Wow

[02:12:07.930 --> 02:12:11.330]
W and the Pope can you can you just see that oh man

[02:12:12.070 --> 02:12:16.030]
Man oh man who's the most incoherent in that meeting well the Pope can speak English

[02:12:16.750 --> 02:12:17.350]
Yeah

[02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:21.630]
On his coherent days yeah

[02:12:21.630 --> 02:12:22.010]
You

[02:12:22.010 --> 02:12:26.330]
You see women speaking about the subject

[02:12:27.010 --> 02:12:28.250]
For who to shaker?

[02:12:29.110 --> 02:12:32.450]
Who to shaker who to funk it and who to her sister who to shaker

[02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:37.670]
For who to shaker the humiliation began at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Baghdad

[02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:43.430]
American soldiers demanded to search her handbag when she refused one of the soldiers put it is gun toward her chest

[02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:50.570]
He pointed the laser site directly in the middle of my chest said professor shaker a political scientist at Baghdad University

[02:12:50.570 --> 02:12:53.910]
Then he pointed to his penis. He told me come here bitch. I'm going to

[02:12:54.610 --> 02:12:55.050]
you

[02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:57.430]
The f-word

[02:12:58.170 --> 02:13:04.070]
The incident is one of a number in which US soldiers are alleged to have abused intimidated or sexually humiliated Iraqi women

[02:13:04.070 --> 02:13:05.890]
According to professor shaker

[02:13:06.690 --> 02:13:11.110]
Several women held an oboe grabbed yogurt sexually abused including one who was raped by an American military

[02:13:11.110 --> 02:13:14.090]
Policeman and became pregnant. She is now disappeared

[02:13:15.010 --> 02:13:15.450]
Huh

[02:13:16.610 --> 02:13:20.710]
Just like that vanished maybe she's put on too much of that vanishing cream

[02:13:24.690 --> 02:13:28.590]
Most of the coverage of the prisoner abused at oboe grave has focused on a raki men

[02:13:28.590 --> 02:13:33.290]
But there's compelling evidence that several female prisoners who are in a minority at the jail were abused as well

[02:13:33.290 --> 02:13:35.630]
I mean, why should they leave them out in the exception?

[02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:41.310]
A female colleague of mine was arrested taken and when I asked her after she was released what happened at oboe grave

[02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:43.470]
She started crying professor shaker said

[02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:47.490]
Ladies here are afraid and shy of talking about such subjects. This everything is okay

[02:13:47.490 --> 02:13:51.870]
Even in a very advanced society in the west it's difficult to talk about rape, but I think it happened

[02:13:53.790 --> 02:13:58.110]
Few women released from US detention have come forward to talk about their experiences in a Muslim society

[02:13:58.110 --> 02:14:04.650]
Where rape is sometimes equated with shaman victims can be killed to salvage family honor. She kept her honor

[02:14:04.650 --> 02:14:09.090]
I believe in a medicah

[02:14:09.690 --> 02:14:10.830]
Let's watch that again

[02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:11.410]
What do you say

[02:14:12.810 --> 02:14:15.670]
Only none of those phrases about Freito now

[02:14:15.670 --> 02:14:15.950]
No

[02:14:17.190 --> 02:14:18.070]
Mamma mia

[02:14:18.070 --> 02:14:19.910]
You cannot like a man

[02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:21.150]
Put your arms

[02:14:21.150 --> 02:14:24.270]
Don't think you put a brains all over your nice side release suit

[02:14:26.410 --> 02:14:28.130]
5670560 pound 560

[02:14:28.130 --> 02:14:33.790]
I think your brain is going to start from all that comedy you play with a young girl

[02:14:34.350 --> 02:14:35.290]
Up against the door

[02:14:35.970 --> 02:14:38.690]
Well, she was really nasty. No, man. Yeah, her

[02:14:38.690 --> 02:14:43.930]
She must add a great answer something because she was a nasty although she was beautiful compared to Sophia

[02:14:43.930 --> 02:14:46.750]
Yeah, well, but then again so is my ass

[02:14:46.750 --> 02:14:47.610]
Wow

[02:14:50.830 --> 02:14:55.270]
I'm proudy. Let's let's recut that movie just blow her away in the beginning and man that movie give

[02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:57.290]
Go zooming up there past the life

[02:14:58.210 --> 02:15:01.490]
Right, and George Hamilton, right then you got something

[02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:04.050]
We have an understanding

[02:15:04.050 --> 02:15:04.750]
Oh

[02:15:07.610 --> 02:15:09.830]
The old docky puss. That was my ass

[02:15:11.490 --> 02:15:15.670]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:15:16.530 --> 02:15:23.070]
What is John carry on with I'mus you get the the the war out of the pocket of the American taxpayer

[02:15:23.070 --> 02:15:28.770]
exclusively by getting an international group of countries doesn't have to be under the UN

[02:15:28.770 --> 02:15:31.730]
Though ultimately you want the UN to sign off on it

[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:36.060]
Tom you've been covered okay Tom WQA and hello

[02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:37.420]
Yes

[02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:44.580]
We're I'm coming down there to pick up some tickets. I know your address is 20295 north west second Avenue, right?

[02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:46.420]
Are you guys north or south device?

[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:50.520]
No, just barely north. You know where the Kentucky fried is one light

[02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:55.720]
One light north of eyes west side. I mean, you know the Kentucky fried chicken. Is there any side?

[02:15:56.040 --> 02:16:00.180]
Yes, I that's where you make your turn right in there. It's a big white building with that looks like it's fallen apart

[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:03.040]
Yep, that's the one

[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:08.140]
Hey, Neil. You're good. How are you enjoying enjoy the game enjoy whatever you're going to is he going to a heat game? Is that what it is?

[02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:09.260]
something like that

[02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:16.520]
20295 north west second Avenue just like for the Kentucky fry on a corner say how to the kernel when you drive by

[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:22.660]
Right right here then right up the road from that we got a poio topical and then we got that

[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:25.400]
BP gas station in the quarter of the big gigantic one

[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:28.760]
It's right in front of that little strip mall there. It's got the publics in the Walgreens in it

[02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:33.300]
And then right on the other corner course you got Chuck sub center. How's Chuck doing?

[02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:37.080]
I haven't seen him lately. Oh, would you want to be ordering your lunch from Chuck every day?

[02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:38.300]
We have howies

[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.040]
In fact, you know when he comes in say what's up Chuck? Oh

[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:48.540]
You got howie still is coming by with that gut wrenching bacon man or pounds and pounds of bacon

[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:53.720]
I get a nice chicken Caesar from howies and Josh gets the bacon egg and cheese sandwich

[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:58.140]
Oh, I think we're getting co-sandwiches from the condonuts for that fantastic coffee and

[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:05.620]
Donuts, but they bring donuts that the percentages Sydney Schanberg and the village voice rights. Is this America for now maybe

[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:10.820]
He says torture and humiliation of war prisoners is not in itself surprising

[02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:12.420]
It happens in everywhere on both sides

[02:17:12.420 --> 02:17:17.260]
Savage v after all is the very language of war transforming some combatants into feral avengers

[02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:20.680]
And leading others to shed civilized norms and acquiesce in the acts

[02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:24.980]
We send soldiers to kill others. Therefore to a degree we testly accept that

[02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:26.960]
Vile things will occasionally happen

[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:33.260]
What makes this torture scandal different or makes it an earthquake for our government rather than a tremor is that it comes after a long

[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:37.620]
This heartening string of other revelations showing that this war was built on a foundation of deceptions

[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:40.500]
Suggesting a grave threat to our national security

[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:46.540]
Perhaps ingestification of these false premises president Bush aborting an evangelical Christian

[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:53.200]
Has told the American public in the world many times that it was the hand of the Almighty that guided him to send our troops into battle to liberate

[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:56.980]
Iraqi people from a brutal dictatorship that made torturous state policy

[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:03.900]
When a president proclaims a righteous war constantly using words like freedom and justice and invoking the will of God

[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:07.380]
He runs a great risk of losing the trust of his people if it turns out that indeed

[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:10.880]
The inv- instead the invasion was based not only on a heavenly vision

[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:16.460]
But on deeply flawed war plans that assume democracy could be transplanted anywhere with ease and at little cost

[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:19.080]
Our troops were put at unnecessary risk

[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:24.520]
Under a more truthful presidency the torture disclosures might have been less of a blow to the nation's stature

[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:31.120]
This scandal however has scarred America worldwide because Washington's arrogance alienated once friendly nations and because the

[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:35.580]
Prison images run so counter to the president's lofty words and claims

[02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:40.280]
Torture and the Almighty do not fit together. This I guess this guy didn't be the Bible

[02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:45.760]
This could be a presidency in the process of unraveling getting more and more naked as it loses its clothes

[02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:50.180]
Cindy Shamburg in today's village voice well written if you ask me

[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:54.060]
The emperor has no clothes man

[02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:57.000]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:03.940]
pound 5 60 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line. Let's pick up some tickets go to a ballgame and forget all this crap

[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:07.820]
What do you say? Oh, right? Let's get back to the important stuff in life

[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:10.860]
Don't you agree? Sure, Troy

[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:11.900]
No

[02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:15.280]
Bob shorten sweet but I was thinking more like

[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:16.640]

[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:18.280]

How is this possible? I realize that there are a lot of you banana boat people in cell phone are just be fused through cut the cord

[02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:58.600]
You know, but how is it possible?

[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:03.560]
To be so stupid as to like follow her down the end of the garden path

[02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:08.760]
I mean she is just pathetic because she says all the right thing is that what it is all the right thing

[02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:13.240]
Well, it must be one dimensional because the only thing I ever heard her say

[02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:18.120]
Was that I said it's a plot board all she ever says

[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:21.140]

[02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:25.800]
Okay, I'm gonna use the hour

[02:22:34.460 --> 02:22:38.940]
I put some metals back to belong this approach is asked made up from back

[02:22:39.700 --> 02:22:44.380]
Senator carries record raises through his doubts about his understanding of the broader struggle against

[02:22:45.540 --> 02:22:47.420]
These guys want to argue about yet

[02:22:48.020 --> 02:22:49.080]
35 years ago

[02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:52.400]
Let's go do it the decision belong to Senator carries the nameless

[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:59.100]
Our today is a complete distraction by the administration facts that I'm ashamed almost certainly

[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:03.020]
Go be in control and wait as well. It's their attack method

[02:23:03.020 --> 02:23:08.600]
This is what they do and it's coming from a president who can't even prove that he actually showed up

[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:12.980]
Can't even prove that he actually showed up for duty in the national guard

[02:23:16.700 --> 02:23:17.100]
So

[02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:24.960]
Sounds like times running out for hope the bushmeister we can only pray it's a one oh two of five sixty wdq amids are big one to two are you know?

[02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:25.840]
I forgot to play today

[02:23:28.660 --> 02:23:29.800]
That's average for late

[02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:38.980]
Let's up you some more prisoners make them scream nice loud

[02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:46.200]
Ah get me some wires and a factory pack. I don't care if they

[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:56.080]
From my rack to be used used you to the torture because they're just playing their game in the past

[02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:01.540]
It had to be worse with the dumb who say

[02:24:02.220 --> 02:24:08.120]
102 I think I just got through Sanis 102 boy time is this down one of those days when the clock stopped again

[02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:09.640]
Is it no what's out of it?

[02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:17.220]
It's 103 all right all right man that thing seemed like that would like we were hung in suspended animation like Larry King

[02:24:18.500 --> 02:24:21.580]
Cubans stunned as government closes dollar only stores

[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:23.040]
Havana

[02:24:24.220 --> 02:24:27.120]
See we did a great job with those UN sanctions in Iraq

[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:29.800]
Made the people's lives were like a living hell

[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:33.620]
And those sanctions are really working big in Cuba aren't they?

[02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:36.380]
Yeah, they're getting the job done got cast throughout a power in two years

[02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:39.860]
No question about in fact that visits from the pope. That's what really put them over the a

[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:43.160]
That's when he started smoking in really big fat ones

[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:51.140]
Cubans dollar only stores displayed closed for inventory signs yesterday after the Kami pinko government suddenly shut them down

[02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:54.560]
blaming new U.S. measures aimed at squeezing the island's economy

[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:00.820]
Long line stretch from state and I'm sure that Fidel's probably really a just starvin now

[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:03.240]
Okay, you see how it may see

[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:10.540]
Long line stretch from state stores with food and personal hygiene products nearly the only items still sold the Cubans in dollars

[02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:17.520]
As people scrambled to buy shampoo and soap from rapidly emptying shelves maybe aliena was anodinican finds some soap

[02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:25.760]
Make this is insanity since 64-year-old Odila Morales waiting to buy laundry detergent politics are filthy

[02:25:26.400 --> 02:25:30.380]
And evidently she is two amounts to buy some of detergent to wash them over clothing on

[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:36.440]
The government didn't say whether the stores would reopen but Julio Perez the administrator of Harris Brothers department store

[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:40.520]
Said they were merely giving dollar only stores time to mark up the prices of all their goods

[02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:46.580]
It really isn't anything serious said Perez maybe it will only be three four five days or maybe not who knows

[02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:48.060]
she said in face

[02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:53.920]
Some question about the closure which prevents Cubans from spending dollars of the government stores would counteract the U.S.

[02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:55.220]
Proposal is now sliced weak

[02:25:55.220 --> 02:25:59.820]
Which aim to reduce hard currency on the island by limiting how often Cuban Americans can visit relatives

[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:02.220]
decreasing how much they can spend and

[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:06.560]
Providing money transfers to Cuban officials and county Pico party members

[02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:10.920]
It's not helping the Cuban people and it's not helping the Cuban governments of Kermit

[02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:17.720]
Or Mesa Lago an expert on the Cuban economy at the University of Pittsburgh all of this is bad bad economics and bad social welfare

[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:22.240]
Mesa Lago said the measures could strengthen the Cuban government's control over the economy

[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:28.160]
Cuba is forced to implement liberal reforms in the early 1990s to cope with losses Soviet aid and trade

[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:34.340]
Possession of dollars was legalized in 93 to draw hard currency from growing tourism and family purchases at the state stores

[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:41.160]
The government is steadily offered more and more goods in U.S. currency while the Cuban ration book of items available in pesos has withered

[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:45.700]
For many Cubans rations now cover eight eggs a pound of chicken

[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:52.140]
About a pint of cooking oil six pounds of rice a half pound of ground meat slash soy mixture

[02:26:52.140 --> 02:26:53.900]
And a few other goods each month

[02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:57.660]
The rest must be purchased at far higher prices either in pesos or in dollars

[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:02.160]
The dollar-wolley shops have been associated with social inequities that have worried Cuban leaders

[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:08.320]
The elite with access to greenbacks can easily buy everyday goods that a doctor cannot on a salary equivalent to 25 bucks a month

[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:16.520]
Three floor selling clothing mattresses and electrical goods were cordoned off and Harris brothers where employees stood behind empty counters looking confused

[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:22.220]
Other workers catered to dozens of shoppers buying cooking oil span and deodorant in the stores only open section

[02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:29.380]
Dozens of stores along rolled Havanis commercial old bizzbo street selling toys shoes and fancy furniture never opened yesterday

[02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:35.220]
gift shops and upscale hotels and other tourists ever were still selling t-shirts, crafts and camera film and dollars

[02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:42.220]
Lotta perne as a 25 year old gift shopper said tourists would not be affected by the measures Cubans on the other hand were very uncertain

[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:46.820]
I am worried of course since we don't know if this is going to be a week a month or seven years perne

[02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:50.140]
Said but we need to wait one shouldn't go into a panic is what she said

[02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:50.560]
ah

[02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:56.560]
The government said the dollar prices would be raised in food and gasoline and perhaps other products

[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:02.040]
But it is sure Cubans that other aspects of the economy would not be affected people will still be able to change money by food and

[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:07.300]
Paces at private private farmers markets and have access to such government services as healthcare and education

[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:09.800]
All of these things

[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:17.820]
Massa mesa logo said the dollar stores were open to 93 in large park to fight a growing black market in which goods were traded in dollars without

[02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:23.180]
Passing through the state's hands once they closed this window then the black market is going to expand he be saying

[02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:29.540]
Okay, so there you go there's the latest on Cuba. It was Cubans in Cuba doing it. Now this one any shape percent

[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:35.440]
56705 60 pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon line

[02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:39.220]
Which of these best describes why you listen to the New Roger show

[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:46.800]
259 46% for a few laughs a few yucks a few chuckles in my otherwise dreary existence

[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:53.020]
To hear this stories neal reads 116 20 and a half percent that's dropping like a rock

[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:54.760]
out of five 65

[02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:59.520]
Neal tells it like it is 83 look at that the way that's moving up there boldly

[02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:06.240]
Not incredible just like smarty Jones in the Derby making a gigantic move in the stretch 83 for that

[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:10.420]
It kills four hours of my boring life. I have no life 56

[02:29:10.980 --> 02:29:17.740]
To hear the crazy and crank calls 21. I hate Neal, but I can't turn it off 19. To hear the callers opinions 11

[02:29:21.540 --> 02:29:25.640]
You'll see we'll make up for this are gonna get a lot of good calls. All right. You don't think

[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:30.380]
Not usually I think the calls this hour are gonna be memorable

[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:33.220]
The way I'm hello

[02:29:33.900 --> 02:29:40.920]
Who I am yeah, I'm gonna help you speaking Neil yeah, um clicky question. I've been out of town for a while

[02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:46.680]
I know you had been talking about it and I never did hear the results that you said a couple weeks ago that was

[02:29:47.220 --> 02:29:52.440]
What happened between the big one of six ratings when they dropped Howard and I'm sure you spoke about it

[02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:57.260]
I apologize, but I have the I happen to have it right here in my hand as a matter of fact

[02:29:58.140 --> 02:30:01.600]
Here are the monthly men 18 plus numbers for WBGG

[02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:06.260]
In January they had a 7.1 with Howard Stern in February with Howard Stern

[02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:10.760]
They had a 9.9 in March with Stern off the air they had a 1.8

[02:30:12.620 --> 02:30:19.180]
Beautiful 99 to a 180 and the worst part of the whole deal is that an idiot by the name of Howard Cohen in the business section

[02:30:19.180 --> 02:30:24.500]
The Harold wrote an article a couple of days after the book came out saying big 106 doesn't lose any ground

[02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:28.060]
After losing shock shock in the morning because he doesn't understand the ratings

[02:30:28.060 --> 02:30:29.400]
He has no idea what he's talking about

[02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:34.200]
I ripped him a gigantic ass on here never printed a correction. They don't really care about giving the public the truth

[02:30:34.200 --> 02:30:35.880]
They lie like crazy. That's the hero

[02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:41.680]
Yeah, listen to you because you're a god and you tell the truth. Thanks a lot, Pally. I'm a great thing

[02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:46.920]
The Harold no corrections no nothing and never ever no

[02:30:47.520 --> 02:30:52.240]
And I'll say well, you know technically and in fact, I'll say it again every single piece in that story

[02:30:52.240 --> 02:30:55.940]
I remember like it was yesterday was a week ago Friday, but I remember like it was just yesterday

[02:30:57.460 --> 02:31:02.800]
Because he said well, there's still number 17 in the first of all he's talking about 12 plus numbers with nobody cares about

[02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:07.100]
Secondly, they never were number 17 12 plus so so in any respect

[02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:13.240]
You can't justify that idiotic article in the business section and a monkey business section of the freaking Miami

[02:31:13.240 --> 02:31:20.180]
Harold a sad excuse even for a fish wrapper even the parakeets at the parachungal screaming and yelling the macchi

[02:31:20.180 --> 02:31:27.700]
What do they call them macaws? Okay, and the cockatoo's say don't put that thing in my cage in the herald either, all right

[02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:28.940]
no mo

[02:31:30.500 --> 02:31:32.820]
piece of turd

[02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:39.620]
Tom jikam meantime and ducking him all the numbers. Did he write a story about the ratings? No about big 106 the gigantic precipitous decline no

[02:31:40.780 --> 02:31:46.140]
You know, it really said because I tried to make amends with Tom a little bit there when we're doing at stop FCC

[02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:50.300]
Thing and did write a couple of columns, you know about stirring this and so on and so forth mentioned me

[02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:54.020]
But but in the meantime here's some and he just got this a version

[02:31:54.020 --> 02:31:59.900]
We all he wants to do is write 85,000 articles about friends and phraser anything that begins with that far. Maybe father or tool

[02:32:00.700 --> 02:32:04.820]
F are as in freaky. I mean, well, what is that?

[02:32:06.340 --> 02:32:10.180]
You just have these one-dimensional little narrow-minded people in that market

[02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:15.280]
They just want to write about the same tired crap all the time and his response is oh well nobody cares about the radio ratings

[02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:16.820]
Right right

[02:32:17.440 --> 02:32:23.140]
How many more articles do we need about phraser about third man about friend about third man

[02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:30.000]
About the same tired cock and bull crap that you write all the time little Tommy garbage

[02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:35.720]
Really sad what what a market man what a sad sad place

[02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:43.120]
We could have been contenders you do realize that don't you instead of bombs instead of just beach bombs

[02:32:46.460 --> 02:32:47.340]
But no

[02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:50.580]
We're mired in a swillow South Florida man

[02:32:51.120 --> 02:33:00.460]
And I sent out my heartiest condolences to the rest of you who are just trapped like prisoners like Patrick McGuwen on an island like prisoners and look over your shoulder because rovers coming

[02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:04.420]
Make no mistake about that's what they said that

[02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:09.940]
With those Iraqi prisoners to you better watch out because rovers coming. Yeah. Oh, buddy is

[02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:12.400]
And it wasn't a big white ball either

[02:33:12.400 --> 02:33:13.160]
I

[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:20.000]
Realized I'm back in the day you probably would have said something about that but probably gonna let go just as well to a dummy upright

[02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:21.220]
Exactly

[02:33:22.540 --> 02:33:24.920]
And if you're thinking about making some comment about their

[02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:27.080]
Be very afraid

[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:33.680]
12 minutes after one at five sixty WDQ and we got the always ballsy mad dog gym manager to

[02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:38.040]
The big gigantic bigger than life Kim Bo camper for the Humpir at four

[02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:45.040]
From the trivile mommy heat arena from the Mickey a slip in the Mickey arena the croes on for half hour at seven

[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:49.080]
Which again we apologize for that although I don't think that's gonna be enough

[02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:55.900]
Just one little apology the crow for half an hour, which is plenty I like that one then we got the marlins on decades

[02:33:55.900 --> 02:34:00.960]
7 30 marlins at the Houston Astros at 805 Astros are hot as a pistol and the big

[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:04.720]
After the ballgame we have no idea why I'm probably better off not know

[02:34:05.340 --> 02:34:09.920]

Because he is not on the run.

[02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:01.120]
Who has been hidden?

[02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:05.060]
The Democrats are all done.

[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:08.700]
I'm told this time to roll out a sauna

[02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:12.280]
for the election.

[02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:16.280]
18 at 5.60 W.D.Q.A.

[02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:18.060]
It's interesting they're interviewing some of these

[02:36:18.060 --> 02:36:19.960]
of mindless Americans about this beheading thing.

[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:20.440]
They are.

[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:23.960]
They're saying, well, as compared to these minor abuse

[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:27.720]
things that we don't condone those, but as compared, I mean, we didn't kill anybody.

[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:28.880]
We didn't?

[02:36:28.940 --> 02:36:29.160]
Oh.

[02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:30.780]
People to death?

[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:32.360]
No. Scads of them?

[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:32.760]
No.

[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:39.360]
And abuse the...

[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:39.600]
No.

[02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:42.000]
They were just carcasses.

[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:43.120]
Just propaganda.

[02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:45.220]
Quasimodo, man.

[02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:45.920]
He was a hit.

[02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:49.480]
608 votes. Which of these vests describes

[02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:51.720]
why you listen to the Elijah show for a few laughs?

[02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:55.160]
272.44.7%.

[02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:56.560]
Here are the stories, Neil reads.

[02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:58.760]
117.19.2%.

[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:02.320]
Neil tells it like it is 104.17.1%

[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:03.680]
are licking all over my bottom.

[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:06.260]
It kills four hours of my boring life.

[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:07.160]
I have no life.

[02:37:07.880 --> 02:37:08.360]
59.

[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:10.320]
Almost 10%.

[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:12.800]
Here are the crazy and crank calls 23.

[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:14.760]
And of course you know who those 23 votes are, don't you?

[02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:15.300]

[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.540]
Meppin' Jones, your gay.

[02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:20.860]
That's who they are.

[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:22.180]
Camba?

[02:37:23.140 --> 02:37:24.180]
This is Gaggy.

[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:25.580]
Yeah, those are the 23.

[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:27.920]
I hate Neil, but I can't turn it off 22.

[02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:29.620]
And I hear the caller's opinions 11.

[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:33.000]
I think most of the audiences discovered all these long, painful years.

[02:37:33.100 --> 02:37:36.420]
But the audience doesn't, for the most part, have any opinions.

[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:39.240]
As we discover every day.

[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:40.760]
But I told you this hour they'd be good, didn't I?

[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:42.020]
Right? That's so far.

[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:43.260]
WQM, hello.

[02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:46.360]
QAM?

[02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:50.440]
QAM?

[02:37:52.300 --> 02:37:53.040]
WQM, hello.

[02:37:53.620 --> 02:37:55.280]
Well, greetings. How are you doing, sir?

[02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:58.480]
Okay, sir, greetings to you from the warm North.

[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:00.420]
I had a radio.

[02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:02.960]
I had TV action about a week ago.

[02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:08.000]
And I'm sure it's been covered since then that the return of the Congress

[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.660]
or expansion to the anchor desk.

[02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:10.380]
Yeah.

[02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:11.620]
So the anchor desk?

[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:12.820]
I'm sorry?

[02:38:13.260 --> 02:38:14.900]
He's back on the anchor desk?

[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:18.860]
Oh, sir, WB39, it's 10 o'clock.

[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:20.960]
Oh, my God.

[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:22.220]
Yes, yes.

[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:23.140]
Oh, you didn't know.

[02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:23.740]
Okay, yeah.

[02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:24.640]
I know how about that?

[02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:27.860]
They stuck them in there on a Wednesday night.

[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:29.700]
And then they was on against Thursday.

[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:32.520]
And then they started running ads for it.

[02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:36.920]
You know, and I used to watch that every night, but I can't watch him.

[02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:41.040]
It speaks to what you were saying about Frazier and Friends.

[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:47.280]
We have a media that used to listen to what people had to say and then wrote about that.

[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:51.960]
Now we have media that tells us what they want us to hear.

[02:38:52.220 --> 02:38:57.040]
And I'm sorry, Rick Sanchez has absolutely no credibility and he should be pumping gaps somewhere.

[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:00.740]
Hopefully not too close to the stadium, though.

[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:06.060]
But he's got friends at NBC who keep thinking that he's some sort of super star.

[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:13.180]
They're going to inflict him on us until, and of course, because we know what channel 7th raise are.

[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:16.460]
There is an audience for drilling idiots that will watch him.

[02:39:17.300 --> 02:39:20.900]
Well, but evidently, there's no audience for his drilling idiot show on Channel 6, though.

[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:22.520]
So that's why they're trying to move him into news.

[02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:29.260]
Well, I think they're going to see what happens at 39 and if things go well there, they'll move him in and move Antonio.

[02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:30.120]
Excellent.

[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:31.920]
I'll program it right off my set when I get back.

[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:32.660]
Thanks a lot, Palli.

[02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:33.280]
There you go.

[02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:34.020]
Have a great day.

[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:36.220]
What do you have to say about that, Rick?

[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:39.240]
I already have a homosexual relationship with NEO.

[02:39:39.420 --> 02:39:40.800]
So I might as well have one with you too.

[02:39:41.060 --> 02:39:42.140]
So who do you dislike most?

[02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:43.360]
Greg V. Delo, Rick Sanchez.

[02:39:44.700 --> 02:39:45.020]
Oh.

[02:39:45.020 --> 02:39:46.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5.

[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:49.620]
Well, Greg never killed anybody that we know of.

[02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:51.900]
How do you know that?

[02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:52.620]
That we know of.

[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:53.440]
Right.

[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:55.540]
I mean, he's had a few inquiries moments himself.

[02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:56.000]
Right.

[02:39:56.760 --> 02:39:57.500]
V. Delo.

[02:39:57.540 --> 02:39:58.280]
But so far, no harm.

[02:39:58.280 --> 02:39:58.600]
No foul.

[02:39:58.940 --> 02:39:59.260]
Right.

[02:39:59.400 --> 02:39:59.780]
We know of.

[02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:00.460]
Right.

[02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:05.440]
Just because somebody had a little accident there in front of the stadium and made the

[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:08.740]
guy to be a vegetable and the guy died, I think you're being a little bit of a hard ass to

[02:40:08.740 --> 02:40:10.600]
keep holding that against my close friend, Rick.

[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:12.200]
Rick, Ricky Tiki Sanchez.

[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:14.660]
I can't believe that.

[02:40:14.660 --> 02:40:17.280]
I guess that show is still on channel 6, which goes to show it.

[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:21.160]
Oh, and also, Jekyll the other day wrote not only about friends and Fraser, about the

[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:25.320]
great pool of talented channels, 7WSV and how they keep stealing all these people away,

[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:27.020]
like little Brian Andrews, who's the call to see it today.

[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:29.060]
I'm missing so much, not reading that paper.

[02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:29.640]
Yeah.

[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.140]
I mean, something that really is a news story.

[02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:36.620]
I mean, like I said the other day, even if the only thing he wrote about the Winter Rating

[02:40:36.620 --> 02:40:41.660]
book about radio was about stirring going off in big 106, taking this gigantic dive and

[02:40:41.660 --> 02:40:44.900]
losing almost all of their audience, that's a major story.

[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:51.220]
But no, Tom, you can't do that because nobody's going to tell you what to write about.

[02:40:51.340 --> 02:40:54.760]
We need several more stories about Fraser and about friends going on.

[02:40:54.760 --> 02:40:55.600]
Got good, man.

[02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:57.100]
You know, the rest already, will you?

[02:40:57.400 --> 02:40:58.380]
They just do the same.

[02:40:58.380 --> 02:41:02.280]
Old hackneyed cock-a-man day after day after day.

[02:41:02.660 --> 02:41:04.560]
You can read both the Harold and the Sun settle.

[02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:08.300]
From the time you pick them up and take that little plastic sleeve off them up and you drive

[02:41:08.300 --> 02:41:13.800]
away in the morning, from the time you slip that sleeve off it and the paper too and walk

[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:16.320]
to the tea room to sit down and take your morning dump.

[02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:19.120]
You can read both papers, stand it up.

[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:21.020]
That's how little there is to read to them.

[02:41:21.740 --> 02:41:25.640]
One of the great joys of life in a real city would have a real newspapers, which we have

[02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:26.620]
two and a half here.

[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:28.460]
There's four papers, but two and a half real ones.

[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:34.300]
Sunday morning is the Florida legislature of joint and national debate over outsourcing,

[02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:37.800]
saying the states are not higher companies that are laying off Americans in favor of

[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:38.740]
cheaper foreign labor.

[02:41:39.240 --> 02:41:42.940]
House and Senate proposals requiring state contractors to hire U.S. workers were defeated

[02:41:42.940 --> 02:41:46.660]
this session, but some lawmakers still are demanding a more thorough examination of the

[02:41:46.660 --> 02:41:47.020]
issue.

[02:41:47.780 --> 02:41:52.060]
Why do we want to spend our dollars in New Delhi when News Mernavich needs our help as

[02:41:52.060 --> 02:41:54.440]
House Democratic leader Doug Walsh of St. Augustine.

[02:41:54.820 --> 02:41:58.120]
Governor Jeb Bush calls their opposition ill-considered and politically motivated.

[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:00.860]
I'm going to tell you right now and mark it down.

[02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:07.360]
The most evil doer of them all is not W. It's Jeb Bush.

[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:08.460]
Just remember I told you that.

[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:12.560]
He is the greatest evil doer of them all, the Jebster.

[02:42:14.140 --> 02:42:17.960]
In a time when corporations do business all over the world, banning contractors with foreign

[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:20.260]
workers would be an expensive exercise in futility.

[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:25.100]
Bush wrote the spring in response to concerns of state senator Skip Campbell, Democrat of Tamarack.

[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:29.880]
Taking it to its logical conclusion, your proposal would require the state to remove the

[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:33.800]
Dell computer from your desk and the desk of most members of the Florida Senate because

[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:37.060]
Dell has manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Malaysia, and China.

[02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:39.460]
You followed the logic there?

[02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:40.000]
No.

[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:47.320]
The state contract fueling the debate began quietly in 1996 when managers of the Florida

[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:53.120]
Department of Children and Families, the FD's CF, sought to end its reliance on paper

[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:54.700]
food stamps and welfare checks.

[02:42:54.980 --> 02:42:58.560]
That system requires large numbers of state employees to guard prices and distribute large

[02:42:58.560 --> 02:42:59.240]
number of booklets.

[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:03.220]
The streamline at services floated to a private company, City Corporate Electronic

[02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:03.980]
Financial Services.

[02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:08.800]
The company used its banking expertise to replace paper stamps with electronic swipe cards

[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:12.820]
that work in ATMs and grocery store kiosks, saving the state about four million a year.

[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:16.140]
About 40 other states have signed similar contracts with CityCorp.

[02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:21.020]
In 2000, state officials allowed the company to replace US call centers with four and

[02:43:21.020 --> 02:43:21.380]
ones.

[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:24.700]
The approval was based on a present to federal government sent the year before.

[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:30.560]
Unices, a second state vendor that subcontracts in India, want to state contract to identify

[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:32.080]
and recover welfare for other mistakes.

[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:35.900]
Unices employees about 500 people in Florida, but turned to an Indian company called

[02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:38.180]
Caratour to develop its computer codes.

[02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:42.260]
Two of Caratour's programmers live in India, seven just relocated from India to Florida

[02:43:42.260 --> 02:43:44.960]
to deliver and test the code, and another three live in the US.

[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:50.160]
Critics question whether the state shares the financial benefit when a contract to use

[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:53.500]
its foreign labor, Campbell has been trying to get the answer from state agencies.

[02:43:54.180 --> 02:43:57.420]
Campbell asked if the expectation is that American workers are going to provide the service

[02:43:57.420 --> 02:44:02.720]
say at $15 an hour, and that company goes over to Indian pays $2, who's getting the $13 profit?

[02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:08.480]
It's unclear whether savings from Indian labor are passed on to taxpayers, cost to the

[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:13.700]
state of Florida about $1.80 a month for each food stamp account in 1996.

[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:17.760]
In the 2003 contract, three years after the company turned to foreign labor, the state

[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:18.920]
raised the rate to $2.19.

[02:44:19.660 --> 02:44:23.280]
In total, the state pays to the crook, which JP Morgan Chase bought in January, about

[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:23.980]
14 in here.

[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:25.380]
Or do you know what the crooks, baby?

[02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:26.120]
Crooks.

[02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:28.500]
That's what you got.

[02:44:28.780 --> 02:44:29.100]
Crooks.

[02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:35.100]
Anything that Jeb Bush touches immediately, that bell should go off in your brain at buzzer.

[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:36.340]
Crook.

[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:37.660]
Lire.

[02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:38.480]
Thief.

[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:40.560]
What do you call that?

[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:40.840]
Jeb Bush.

[02:44:41.340 --> 02:44:42.120]
And how to hell you.

[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:44.120]
I still don't believe it.

[02:44:44.180 --> 02:44:46.820]
How many people I think voted for Jeb Bush to get reelected?

[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:47.760]
About 30, man.

[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:48.180]
Perhaps.

[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:50.720]
I think every other vote was fake.

[02:44:51.500 --> 02:44:54.940]
And I think it's important for you to know we headed on the website the other day, that

[02:44:54.940 --> 02:44:56.440]
they're going to be purging the voter rolls again.

[02:44:56.540 --> 02:44:57.500]
You do understand that, don't you?

[02:44:57.600 --> 02:44:58.860]
On a national level, I understand.

[02:44:59.180 --> 02:44:59.360]
Right.

[02:45:00.220 --> 02:45:03.400]
We've got to get all you dark votes off those voter rolls, but it ain't going to get

[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:04.880]
Bush's re-election campaign going.

[02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:06.700]
We've got to get all your darkies off of there.

[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:09.160]
Worked so well in Florida, they're going to do it all over.

[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:09.660]
That's right.

[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:12.740]
From coast to coast, from pillar to post.

[02:45:13.900 --> 02:45:17.620]
Hamas militants, frankly, displayed remains of some of these six Israeli soldiers killed

[02:45:17.620 --> 02:45:19.340]
in the roadside bombing in Gaza City yesterday.

[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:20.860]
There was some more today I should point out.

[02:45:21.700 --> 02:45:25.700]
Promting Israeli threats of punishing reprisals if body parts are not returned.

[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:30.240]
Eight Palestinians were killed in 123 wounded in a battle that pitted hundreds of government

[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:33.660]
against Israeli troops firing from tanks, helicopters, and rooftops.

[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:35.900]
It's just another one of them bumps on the road map.

[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:38.080]
That's what the courttett told me.

[02:45:38.860 --> 02:45:43.160]
The violence began after midnight when a small Israeli force entered the crowded Zaitun neighborhood

[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:44.420]
to look for weapons workshops.

[02:45:44.940 --> 02:45:48.220]
As the troops withdrew around daybreak, an armored personnel carrier transporting at least

[02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:52.260]
220 pounds of explosive for use in the raid was shredded by the roadside bomb.

[02:45:54.220 --> 02:45:58.520]
We are checking every roof and every balcony where to locate the remnants of the armored personnel

[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:02.000]
carrier in the bodies of our soldiers said army general Dan Harrell.

[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:04.520]
They want the body parts.

[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:09.580]
Al Jazeera broadcast the video it said showed two masked Islamic Zihad activists taking responsibility

[02:46:09.580 --> 02:46:13.380]
to explain what they said was the head of an Israeli soldier on a table in front of them.

[02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:16.640]
Israel TV carried the footage but electronically obscured the head.

[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:17.840]
They blotted it out.

[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:20.180]
When it out, mask it out.

[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:22.980]
That seems to be the new deal now.

[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:24.280]
Is the severed heads.

[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:26.260]
They're probably going to be selling them all over the Arab world.

[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:28.600]
Let's think to have who sent the economy.

[02:46:30.940 --> 02:46:32.660]
We're dealing with crazy people, folks.

[02:46:33.380 --> 02:46:36.660]
I've been trying to tell you for a hundred years the religious nuts are the crazy people,

[02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:43.060]
the dangerous ones, including your president, they, with his faith-based bullcrap, his faith-based slaughter.

[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:48.040]
Which of these best describes why you listen to the New Roger Show?

[02:46:48.780 --> 02:46:53.400]
For a few laughs 289, 43%, 289, for a little chuckle.

[02:46:54.280 --> 02:46:58.160]
Neil tells it like it is, that's moving to the second place already, 137.

[02:46:58.540 --> 02:47:02.640]
He tells it like it is, even if it hurts, even if I tell you that we got beat by WC.

[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:04.760]
MQFM and we're number two proudly.

[02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:07.560]
We can't compete with him, stick music stations.

[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:12.880]
So here are the stories, Neil reads, 121, only 18% George.

[02:47:13.540 --> 02:47:14.700]
Here are all his bedtime stories.

[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:19.900]
Uh-oh.

[02:47:20.540 --> 02:47:21.720]
Oh no, that was me, I'm sorry.

[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:24.720]
To hear the stories, he reads 18%.

[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:26.600]
It kills four hours of my boring life.

[02:47:26.980 --> 02:47:28.080]
65 people.

[02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:28.960]
I have no life.

[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:30.380]
I feel so of that one alone.

[02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:32.360]
That one makes me feel like I'm doing something worthwhile.

[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:33.120]
Besides the paycheck.

[02:47:34.540 --> 02:47:37.240]
Help here that kills four hours of these lifeless, poor software,

[02:47:37.420 --> 02:47:38.960]
audience managers, desperate for anything.

[02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:42.400]
Just to reach out, there's that voice, there's the voice I'm still alive.

[02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:46.200]
It's almost a summertime.

[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:48.540]
And mosquitoes are going to be as big as bowling balls.

[02:47:48.660 --> 02:47:49.740]
It's going to be like the end of the world.

[02:47:49.860 --> 02:47:53.020]
Tornators and thunderstorms every stinking day for months and months to come.

[02:47:53.340 --> 02:47:55.880]
There isn't anybody who speaks English within 50 miles of where I live.

[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:57.600]
But I hear that voice on the radio.

[02:47:57.900 --> 02:47:58.980]
That's what keeps me going.

[02:47:59.100 --> 02:47:59.680]
I have no life.

[02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:00.620]
Thank you.

[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:06.560]
I hear the, let's see, I hear the, I like, I can't read it.

[02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:07.680]
Let me put my glasses on.

[02:48:07.740 --> 02:48:08.040]
I would help.

[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:11.320]
To hear the crazy and crank calls 24,

[02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:14.620]
I hate Neil, but I can't turn it off 23.

[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:19.520]
And to hear the callers opinions only 12, 1.7% basically the audience don't care

[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:20.080]
about your opinion.

[02:48:20.140 --> 02:48:20.740]
How do you like that?

[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:22.880]
They care about my opinion.

[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:24.640]
Sometimes they even care about George's opinion.

[02:48:24.940 --> 02:48:27.260]
Well, it's not a while they even care about Josh's opinion except Antonas.

[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:31.080]
But here comes the big bud.

[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:31.640]
Welcome.

[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:33.080]
They don't care about your opinion.

[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:35.460]
See one thing I've discovered about America.

[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:36.880]
What's that?

[02:48:38.380 --> 02:48:41.320]
They just, you can't, you can't move them off the dime.

[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:41.820]
No.

[02:48:42.340 --> 02:48:44.760]
In other words, here we have this decapitation yesterday.

[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:47.880]
And of course we also had the one with what's all the guys name.

[02:48:49.540 --> 02:48:50.340]
Daniel Pearl.

[02:48:51.980 --> 02:48:52.380]
Remember?

[02:48:52.780 --> 02:48:53.300]
Yes I did.

[02:48:53.500 --> 02:48:56.360]
Now did they, did we have a, we didn't have an actual video?

[02:48:56.360 --> 02:49:00.760]
Yes, there was a video, but they didn't make a, as big a deal out of it.

[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:01.840]
It's bigger but simmous.

[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:02.280]
Promoted.

[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:04.320]
It wasn't promoted like this one is.

[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:04.800]
I see.

[02:49:05.980 --> 02:49:09.200]
141 at 560 WDQM right now let me tell you about the financial group.

[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:11.000]
You know, you've heard us talk about financial group and they're

[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.380]
incredible only one mortgage program without unbeatable.

[02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:16.320]
One and a quarter percent rate for the purchase or refinancing of your home.

[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:18.700]
Think about it just a measly one and a quarter percent.

[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:21.480]
That means if you have a hundred thousand dollar loan, your payments are a mirror

[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:22.740]
three thirty four a month.

[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:25.300]
If you have a two hundred thousand dollar loan, your payments are just

[02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:26.400]
six sixty eight a month.

[02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:28.200]
Now they're advertising on TV.

[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:29.000]
They're on billboards.

[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:29.740]
They're all over the radio.

[02:49:29.740 --> 02:49:32.600]
They're everywhere there in your pop up toaster because this program is so

[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:32.920]
exciting.

[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:34.320]
It's got everyone talking.

[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:37.660]
Only one mortgage makes it possible and only financial group makes it

[02:49:37.660 --> 02:49:38.620]
available for you guys.

[02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:41.920]
So we finance your current home, give money for renovations, move to another

[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:44.180]
home and never pay fees or closing costs again.

[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:48.740]
You pay zero closing costs, zero credit bureau fees, zero application fee,

[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:51.180]
zero discounted points, zero everything.

[02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:52.680]
Kind of like most numbers.

[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:53.580]
Oh, zero.

[02:49:53.940 --> 02:49:54.660]
This is for real.

[02:49:54.660 --> 02:49:58.820]
Just call financial group at 1 866 395 Lend to find out Mo.

[02:49:58.820 --> 02:50:02.960]
That's 1 866 395 Lend the only one mortgage.

[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:04.900]
It's the only mortgage you'll ever be needing.

[02:50:05.220 --> 02:50:10.420]
The Renegal Housing Lender, Queterastricians apply 4.25 APR rates subject to change monthly.

[02:50:10.580 --> 02:50:12.380]
My life and local.

[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:14.700]
This is for trade-o by sixty.

[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:16.100]
You weigh two.

[02:50:18.740 --> 02:50:19.340]
Best.

[02:50:21.940 --> 02:50:22.540]
Absolutely.

[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:31.860]
That he had a stint.

[02:50:33.260 --> 02:50:39.460]
It happened when they put one back in does his heart is old.

[02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:40.980]
Right, though.

[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:51.660]
The doctor's called it a hard thing but now we really know his heart is old.

[02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:54.480]
No matter what we're told.

[02:50:56.960 --> 02:51:01.840]
Yeah, Dick Cheney's got a heart that's old.

[02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:04.760]
Hope it don't explode.

[02:51:07.380 --> 02:51:10.100]
He makes decisions.

[02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:12.820]
He has the vision.

[02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:17.560]
He has the country under his control.

[02:51:17.560 --> 02:51:19.260]
Wow.

[02:51:26.780 --> 02:51:29.440]
That's all we have.

[02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:39.460]
Yeah, Dick Cheney's got a heart that's old.

[02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:42.760]
And it's done a blow.

[02:51:45.760 --> 02:51:50.100]
He'll keep on working till his heart is cold.

[02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:55.340]
He'll keep pretending that his heart ain't old.

[02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:59.200]
But it's really old.

[02:52:00.080 --> 02:52:00.740]
That's the bad news.

[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:04.440]
Cheney had his physical yesterday that said it's still ticking and beaten and pounding

[02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:05.300]
in his heart too.

[02:52:05.840 --> 02:52:06.320]
Damn it.

[02:52:06.820 --> 02:52:10.280]
Because like I said only moments ago, the second most dangerous man in America is

[02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:10.720]
Deb Bush.

[02:52:10.860 --> 02:52:13.060]
The number one most dangerous man is Dick Cheney.

[02:52:13.260 --> 02:52:14.440]
Does there any doubt about that?

[02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:14.920]
No.

[02:52:15.460 --> 02:52:17.600]
Number one evil door is Dick Cheney.

[02:52:18.140 --> 02:52:18.860]
Beware of Dick.

[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:23.680]
Late Sunday afternoon and before we get to this story that you just sent me do you believe

[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:24.120]
this story?

[02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:25.680]
I guess what?

[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:26.500]
Yeah, I don't know.

[02:52:27.540 --> 02:52:28.460]
You don't know what?

[02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:29.800]
I don't know what.

[02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:30.080]
I've got it.

[02:52:30.220 --> 02:52:33.180]
It's got all the websites to go to to check this out.

[02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:33.760]
I think it's real.

[02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:34.260]
Check out.

[02:52:34.260 --> 02:52:34.420]
Yeah.

[02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:37.060]
Cheney questions, release a more photos.

[02:52:38.140 --> 02:52:42.300]
Mr. Secret of himself, Vice President Dick Cheney suggested yesterday that releasing

[02:52:42.300 --> 02:52:46.080]
additional photos of American soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners might do nothing more than

[02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:48.440]
cater to journalist appetite for more pictures to print.

[02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:50.860]
When it down, let's leave them all out.

[02:52:51.660 --> 02:52:54.380]
It's not just a matter of sort of wedding people's appetites.

[02:52:54.520 --> 02:52:55.780]
The seasonal stuff here.

[02:52:56.060 --> 02:52:57.820]
Cheney told Fox News Radio.

[02:52:58.940 --> 02:53:02.360]
Congress in the Pentagon working out the tales on procedures for giving senators access

[02:53:02.360 --> 02:53:03.220]
to additional photos.

[02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:04.780]
And they're looking at them all today.

[02:53:05.020 --> 02:53:07.400]
I should point out that they told him up yours.

[02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:11.460]
The Defense Department previously agreed that the Senate Armed Services Committee could

[02:53:11.460 --> 02:53:14.480]
see classified photos, which have not yet made public in at least one video.

[02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:16.180]
Britney Spears was in it.

[02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:16.520]
I'm hearing.

[02:53:17.460 --> 02:53:20.920]
Committee Chairman Senator John Warner of Virginia City, yesterday, it asked Senator

[02:53:20.920 --> 02:53:23.920]
attorneys for advice on including all senators in any viewing.

[02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:27.640]
The Bush administration still hasn't said whether it would release the photo of the public.

[02:53:28.020 --> 02:53:30.200]
Cheney made clear he has serious doubts about releasing them.

[02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:33.800]
We wouldn't want as a result of the realistic pictures to allow guilty parties off the

[02:53:33.800 --> 02:53:35.600]
hook said, Cheney, by the same token.

[02:53:36.460 --> 02:53:39.200]
You don't want to see innocent people in a perfectly mind by virtue of the release of

[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:42.760]
the photograph said, Dick Cheney, the anxious of noxious one.

[02:53:44.880 --> 02:53:46.700]
Hope you enjoyed those meetings with Kenny Boylay.

[02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:49.100]
Hope you enjoyed all your halibut money.

[02:53:49.500 --> 02:53:50.640]
He did and duck hunting too.

[02:53:51.860 --> 02:53:53.460]
Oh, yeah, you and Antony, man.

[02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:54.220]
You and Antony.

[02:53:55.240 --> 02:53:56.460]
Studio City, California.

[02:53:56.460 --> 02:54:02.180]
Lates on the afternoon, the Bush Voodoo Com website and online store both hosted by Yahoo.

[02:54:03.540 --> 02:54:06.160]
Mysteriously disappeared completely from their server.

[02:54:08.740 --> 02:54:13.140]
When franticbushvoodoo.com staffers contacted customer support they were told the account

[02:54:13.140 --> 02:54:15.800]
was closed for non-payment and that nothing could be done.

[02:54:17.100 --> 02:54:21.920]
A Yahoo building supervisor contacted Monday morning stated that the Bush Voodoo.com account

[02:54:21.920 --> 02:54:24.720]
was in perfect standing and should ever have been canceled.

[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:27.100]
He was unable to explain why the cancellation declared.

[02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:30.600]
While I'm talking, why don't you type it up on there and see if it's a back online?

[02:54:31.940 --> 02:54:32.820]
BushVoodoo.com.

[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:38.560]
I wonder the Bush Voodoo.com founding partners having a background in computers was able

[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:40.780]
to rebuild the online store and recover the website overnight.

[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:41.860]
Oh, I see.

[02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:42.680]
So you don't have to worry.

[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:46.780]
However, regardless of the site's dramatic rebirth and email from press outlets continues

[02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:50.160]
to be blocked or bounced back causing frustration to the small firm.

[02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:55.620]
Alan White, a BushVoodoo.com stated that Yahoo staff appeared to be incapable of correcting

[02:54:55.620 --> 02:55:00.960]
the sabotage and we repealed the CE of Yahoo through an unpublished email address as

[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:02.640]
if yet no responses been received.

[02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:09.260]
Just 24 hours before I see, just 24 hours before it seemed apparent that the site's launch

[02:55:09.260 --> 02:55:12.940]
would be a success when a caller mentioned it on the Randy Road show that's part of the

[02:55:12.940 --> 02:55:17.040]
new liberal-era-america radio network, the brief mention set off a flurry of activity

[02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:20.300]
at the site and dozens of kudos, calls and emails from site visitors.

[02:55:22.180 --> 02:55:26.920]
A major goal of BushVoodoo.com and the George Bush Squeeze Voodoo Doll is to combat voter

[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:31.060]
empathy, foster interest in the 2004 election and encourage voters to cast their votes on

[02:55:31.060 --> 02:55:31.620]
election day.

[02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:36.240]
A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the dolls will be donated to nonprofit organizations

[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:36.940]
that do the same.

[02:55:38.100 --> 02:55:40.460]
So let's boost up BushVoodoo.com.

[02:55:40.540 --> 02:55:41.480]
Okay, nice going Randy.

[02:55:41.700 --> 02:55:42.060]
You go, girl.

[02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:44.020]
And quick talking about what you said.

[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:44.660]
Yeah, that.

[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:45.720]
Not a good idea.

[02:55:47.260 --> 02:55:50.320]
Probably want to, when you talk to her next time, tell her to be a quick talking about

[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:50.440]
that.

[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:51.260]
Talk to her to me.

[02:55:51.460 --> 02:55:51.800]
Yeah, that.

[02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:54.120]
Yeah, what I talk to her.

[02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:55.420]
Yeah, when you talk to her again.

[02:55:56.960 --> 02:55:58.920]
Well, here's the story about the UFO, the UFO.

[02:55:59.400 --> 02:55:59.860]
Oh, please.

[02:56:00.020 --> 02:56:00.240]
Oh!

[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:05.500]
Mexico's largest television network, Monday and Tuesday broadcast footage, which CNN has

[02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:06.460]
been showing little clips of it.

[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:07.740]
They don't want to go overboard.

[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:13.560]
Taken by Air Force pilots of what they say are unidentified flying objects, UFOs.

[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:18.000]
The footage shows bright lights with movements and characteristics that do not have up to

[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.840]
now a scientific explanation according to the television network.

[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:24.860]
The Air Force pilots are heard expressing amazement on the tape.

[02:56:24.900 --> 02:56:29.920]
What I'm says a frame by frame analysis show 16 UFOs according to the network.

[02:56:30.420 --> 02:56:32.480]
The other one says, un-dealable.

[02:56:32.700 --> 02:56:34.880]
Television said the film was taken with an infrared camera.

[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:35.840]
There are no alterations.

[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:40.020]
It's one of the most important film documents we've been able to access, especially because

[02:56:40.020 --> 02:56:42.240]
it comes from an official source, a Jamie Mausanne.

[02:56:42.700 --> 02:56:45.620]
A journalist who's been tracking the UFO phenomenon for more than 25 years.

[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:49.760]
The daily large urnata on Tuesday however dismissed the brujaha as circus.

[02:56:51.060 --> 02:56:51.240]
Oh!

[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:56.160]
On January 31, two Mexican Air Force photographers said a video tape what they believe

[02:56:56.160 --> 02:57:00.120]
were eight UFOs that over from Mexico City and the city's international airport for several

[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:00.440]
hours.

[02:57:00.460 --> 02:57:03.120]
Ghosts assure that tequila man too much will really do it to you.

[02:57:03.460 --> 02:57:04.700]
Now, they showed it on CNN before.

[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:06.560]
On the Keeble Nazi news network.

[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:11.860]
But they only showed it a couple of times as opposed to like stuff that we're really

[02:57:11.860 --> 02:57:12.760]
supposed to care about.

[02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:17.920]
Like a phrasier or like the sausage retiring in Milwaukee.

[02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:21.360]
153 at 560 speaking of sausage.

[02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:23.520]
And that's pretty good on your low carb diet, right?

[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:24.080]

[02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:28.460]
And especially if you don't have any preservatives and stuff like that.

[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:32.300]
But if you're sick and tired of your meat and your eggs and your cheese and your steak

[02:57:32.300 --> 02:57:32.960]
and your shrimp.

[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:33.940]
I mean, that's fine.

[02:57:33.940 --> 02:57:36.060]
But you have to have some variety on your low carb diet.

[02:57:36.060 --> 02:57:39.680]

That's my opinion.

[02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:50.740]

And let's see the whole next door.

[02:59:41.100 --> 02:59:43.140]
Now I have a agency coming to you.

[02:59:43.140 --> 02:59:43.240]
and I don't wish anyone to go straight down this high-וד window.

[02:59:43.240 --> 02:59:44.000]
Okay, I don't need you there.

[02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:45.800]
We are not there now.

[02:59:46.860 --> 02:59:49.000]
Those things come after me.

[02:59:49.280 --> 02:59:49.280]

[02:59:49.280 --> 02:59:53.160]
I've done with a vest, this view, takes a question of doubt

A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.

[02:59:59.880 --> 03:00:03.160]
Show me when they got a lot of wood you need

[03:00:03.160 --> 03:00:05.720]
Now hope you got a steal of doubt

[03:00:06.500 --> 03:00:09.720]
I wanna fill my place with my tables and meats

And then I'm gonna sit back down, I'm back in the U.S.S.A

[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:18.200]
You should come out and obey me, boy

[03:00:28.640 --> 03:00:29.040]
Okay

[03:00:29.040 --> 03:00:33.420]
Based with a scarcity of letters praising my president a newspaper and Republican the industry appeals for

[03:00:33.420 --> 03:00:35.520]
Public letters remember that story from Wisconsin yesterday

[03:00:35.520 --> 03:00:39.900]
They changed their mind. They said oh, it's not a good idea. They backed off the request yesterday

[03:00:39.900 --> 03:00:41.720]
And then complaints of blatant politics

[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:46.200]
They're readers said you people'd be crazy. They said maybe not a good idea

[03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:53.800]
Okay, and all scum of next we got Kimber for the a homerit for the San Thin we got the crow at seven marlins baseball at Houston tonight

[03:00:59.300 --> 03:01:01.520]
