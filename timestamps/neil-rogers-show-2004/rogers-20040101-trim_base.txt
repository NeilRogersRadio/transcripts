[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540]
Sports video 516 WQAM presents The Best of Neil.

[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.260]
That's right that tapes her back.

[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.320]
Don't start calling. No one will answer.

[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.740]
Don't call the front desk. They don't want to hear from you either.

[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.880]
As a matter of fact, even when Neil or George get back on the air,

[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.140]
don't bother calling. So we're not giving up the phone numbers or the facts.

[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.880]
Don't call to tell us some assholes just cut you off in traffic.

[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.120]
You probably deserve it.

[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.380]
Just sit back, relax, and listen to the best of Neil.

[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.200]
And if you don't like it, tell it to W.

[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.380]
Man.

[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.400]
How do you know, ladies and gentlemen, is our privilege to bring you a dis time.

[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.220]
And I witness report of the first international trepidation contest.

[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.300]
We are speaking to you from the ring side of the great Maple Leaf Auditorium,

[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.780]
which is packed with the raptors with spectators, eager and curious.

[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.620]
But whenever the my listeners who are not acquainted with the facts relating to this event,

[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.400]
it might be worth to describe the two contestants.

[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.000]
Lord Windus Vier from Wapping Fog Hole in Devon Gyrzerpore, the champion of the British Empire.

[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.860]
The challenger is Paul Boomer, native son of Australia,

[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.940]
who I understand, worked his way to Canada and the crew of an ocean freighter

[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.580]
carrying a load of Melbourne cabbage upon which, so it is stated Boomer,

[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.740]
trains exclusively.

[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260]
And I see now there's a bit of a furry around Lord Windus Vier's entrance.

[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.640]
And yes, here he comes, Lord Windus Vier.

[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.320]
I'll see, I'll see Ryan get him to come to the microphone and say a few words.

[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.580]
Joe, so we can get his laws up from over here for a minute.

[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.140]
I'll tell him it's for the radio.

[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.580]
Okay, I'll get him for me.

[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.400]
Thanks.

[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.740]
Well, Lord Windus Vier appears to be in good spirits.

[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.640]
He's smiling and capping.

[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.140]
Don't about him in the beautiful silk dressing gown of purple velvet upon which his work

[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.380]
I imagine to be the coat of arms of the House of Windus Vier.

[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.080]
It's a beautiful thing.

[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.160]
Good boy, Joe.

[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.200]
In just a minute, ladies and gentlemen, I think we're going to have his law chip himself

[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.000]
come to the microphone and say a few words.

[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.860]
Right over here, please.

[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.540]
Right over here.

[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.400]
Yes, right here.

[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.640]
Yes, yes, folks.

[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.220]
Here he is.

[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.040]
Right on the microphone, the champion himself.

[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.300]
Lord Windus Vier, are you highness?

[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.640]
How did you come to take an interest in this unusual art?

[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.940]
Well, I suppose you could say it all started over lady Windus Vier's fan.

[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.540]
I see.

[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.460]
Yes, I noticed she was constantly waving this fan in front of her face.

[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.480]
So I asked her why did you she do it?

[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.000]
So she retorted that if I insist she long constantly repredating,

[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.380]
she had to fan away and clear herself defenses it.

[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.120]
So, my friends would go on into the cup of the sea and persuaded me to capitalize on my

[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.100]
proficiency and so on and so on and so on and so forth.

[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.580]
So I was going through it and all that.

[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.280]
That's all.

[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.760]
Thank you very much, your majesty.

[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.380]
Thank you and good luck to you.

[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.820]
That was Lord Windus Vier, a champion prepare.

[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.800]
Oh, here's a challenger.

[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.700]
Here's Paul Boomer from Australia.

[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.780]
Paul, over here, please.

[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.180]
Please ask Mr. Boomer to come over here, please.

[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.000]
The radio, we want to speak on the radio.

[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.840]
Just a moment, ladies and gentlemen, I think we'll have Paul Boomer for you right away.

[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.960]
Yes, here he comes.

[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.420]
Is it, then, and he just point us out?

[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.840]
How did Paul, how?

[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.000]
He just raised his hand in greeting and starts walking over the microphone.

[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.960]
And here, ladies and gentlemen, is Mr. Paul Boomer?

[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.580]
Will you say hello to our audience, Mr. Boomer?

[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.540]
Hello, Canada.

[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:21.180]
Now tell me, sir, when did you first realize that you were proficient enough to take a shot at the Empire Championship?

[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.920]
Well, ever since I was a little nipper, I like to fart.

[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.280]
I remember you said, make me mother and father laugh their bleeding heads off when I used to let one go in church

[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.820]
during the announcement of the light is eight.

[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.640]
Excuse me, Mr. Boomer, on the radio, we call it, uh, crap-pitating.

[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.540]
Now look here, cover.

[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.600]
Well, I always says this, a fart, a fart, whether you raise up on one sheet and sneak,

[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.900]
or whether you're given a full blast like I do.

[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.820]
Very well.

[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.900]
As long as he sees an objection.

[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.620]
I personally find before I do word much easier to say and, uh, more descriptive than the longer and more academic, uh, kept.

[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.520]
Thank you.

[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.920]
Well, I would like to say so.

[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.040]
And there's the bell.

[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.080]
Thank you, Mr. Boomer.

[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.300]
And good luck.

[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.340]
Paul Boomer hurries off to the center of the arena to meet the champion and to receive instructions.

[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.540]
Now the house lights are dimming.

[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.100]
And the great squad of five power electric lights cascade down onto the center of this great arena where stands in simple eloquence.

[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.300]
A diffiring pose.

[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.040]
The farting pose is about four feet high and is decorated with red, white and blue bunting up to about nine inches from the top.

[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.220]
The bare top section is worn smooth by the grip of many hands in previous contact.

[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.800]
So now it appears that Paul Boomer is to be the first at the post.

[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.140]
But that I believe has cut the murray for the challenge, just to make the first effort.

[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.140]
Yes, Paul Boomer takes off his dressing gown and drives to the farting pose.

[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.480]
He gripped it firmly around the top and flexes his knees.

[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.840]
The signal to the commences not yet been given so we may assume that these are just preliminaries.

[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.080]
I think I have time to describe Mr. Boomer down, but he stepped from the waist up and wears a tight fitting trunks of powder blue trim blue scarlet.

[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.280]
These trunks are similar to those worn by wrestlers with one important difference.

[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.920]
There's a whole lot of six inches in the thycine diameter, removing the seat.

[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.160]
This of course has been done for obvious reasons.

[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.240]
This semepic aperture is called the finesse degrees, literally translated meaning the zebra window.

[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.720]
Mr. Boomer's finesse degrees has a scarlet trim around its perimeter,

[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.600]
giving a very provocative air to this genial Australian backside.

[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.180]
On the air goes the signal to commence.

[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.440]
You might have heard it overnight to pull the plash on the medieval brown scissor spigot,

[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.960]
the traditional woodwind instrument associated with this port for sensors.

[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.080]
Now a harsh fog on the vest, the vest, strong as Boomer walks slowly,

[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.860]
deliberately to the farting post.

[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.620]
He's a guting confidence, and he gives one last all encompassing grin to the tense audience,

[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.160]
as he grips the farting post between a pair of hands that look as though they could splinter the post.

[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.040]
Now he flexes his knees, much in the manner of a boxer.

[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.180]
He seems to be concentrating on the very top of the farting post.

[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.200]
You can hear a pin drop, and here it comes.

[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.620]
Or a beauty, a beauty I think it was a triple flutter blast.

[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.380]
Yes, that's what the judge signals.

[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.380]
A triple flutter blast, that gives him 25 points right off the bat.

[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.640]
And another, another of the same, and another 25 points.

[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.400]
That's a look by one side, no two flutter.

[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.600]
I beg your pardon, three fuzzy farts in rapid succession.

[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.720]
It's amazing how this man can change face and style of offering by a slight,

[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.500]
simple shifting of his buttercarrier.

[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.300]
He's still gripping the post in complete concentration.

[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.040]
Guma now has a score of 65, those last three fuzzy farts,

[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.840]
a five point to be having 15th with previous score.

[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.320]
And now he's something coming.

[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.520]
A flutter, a flutter, a perfectly executed flutter.

[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.160]
What's that?

[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.580]
I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, that was a follow-up flutter.

[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.480]
A follow-up flutter.

[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.500]
The second time in the history of this sport,

[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.240]
that a follow-up flutter has been achieved in open competition.

[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.380]
The only other time I believe was,

[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.140]
during the World Series held in Europe in 1783.

[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.440]
During the course of this series,

[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.560]
friends who are fuf, the famous French father after leaving

[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.360]
a follow-up flutter defeated Sanemite when his Scottish opponent

[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.340]
by only one bloop and then dropped dead.

[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.380]
You know since then, in honor of Masifu,

[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.800]
the bloop has been dropped in open competition.

[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.440]
And now the score is 100 and five for Buma.

[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.760]
A flutter of course can't stand point,

[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.580]
but a follow-up flutter, a very difficult maneuver,

[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.240]
gives 40 points.

[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.260]
Well, a certain has been a world in session.

[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.000]
I think the poor Buma is about played out,

[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.680]
or blown out as they say.

[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.740]
What am I saying?

[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.500]
And he's not two years apparently.

[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.760]
Wait a minute, here come a three.

[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.440]
Or whole a little three,

[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.920]
with only two points and very dangerous,

[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.360]
and another three.

[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.300]
Well, not bad.

[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.920]
What have he said before the other five?

[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.100]
Well, he said in putting up a fighting finish.

[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.460]
All three are very hazardous,

[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.900]
very hazardous part because of the danger of plotting.

[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.640]
But giving him eight very valuable points.

[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.140]
And there he throws up his hands.

[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.400]
He throws up his hands as a signal that he's finished.

[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.260]
And the crowd gives him a tremendous ovation.

[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.700]
He's sitting down, looking a little pale,

[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.360]
a little warm perhaps, but smiling happily at the crowd.

[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.140]
This man has a definite charm about him,

[00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.000]
that is indeed him,

[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.000]
to all except the most rabid,

[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.040]
who endlessly offend.

[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.120]
And here's his dog, wait a minute.

[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.160]
Paul Buma!

[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.100]
One, two, three, three.

[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.860]
To hear that, Paul Buma, 123 points, a world record.

[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.560]
Meeting Lord Windus Rea's previous world mark of 119 by four points.

[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.900]
Paul Buma, this moment is the world champion.

[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.680]
But how long we don't know because

[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.700]
Lord Windus Rea might take it right back again.

[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.440]
And his is large ship now walking up to the post apparently,

[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.940]
not in the least disconcerted by the brilliant performance

[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.980]
of the talent.

[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.080]
He's outfitted a little differently from Paul Buma.

[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.740]
He had purple tight, full length tight.

[00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.740]
And around the finesse debris,

[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.740]
you remember the whole cut out from the center of the sea.

[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.640]
Around this there's the fringe of little gold tassels

[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.640]
about four inches long.

[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.220]
Just no doubt is some decoration affected by just a moment.

[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.000]
He's with some sort of dispute here.

[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.380]
Paul Buma in a second, around their feet,

[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.920]
and seem to be arguing with the judges.

[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.420]
And pointing to the fringe on their champion's posterio.

[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.800]
Oh, I see.

[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.000]
As he pulled Buma is claiming that the fringe might add a whistle

[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]
or some other sound to Lord Windus Rea's efforts

[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.060]
and throwing free their value.

[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.700]
And after all, in a 4-3-4 contest like this,

[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.440]
every little advantage must be jealousy-watch.

[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.060]
The judges appear to be agreeing with Paul Buma,

[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.040]
and they direct the champion to remove the fringe.

[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.200]
He doesn't like the decisions very much.

[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.520]
And the crowd is getting,

[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.860]
the crowd's getting resentful.

[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.680]
They think he should be a better sport about it.

[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.200]
And I agree with him.

[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.340]
Always seems to have decided that he's got to give in.

[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.400]
And he rips off the fringe and flings it to the ground.

[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.500]
Then he walks over to where Buma is sitting.

[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.460]
He turns his back, puts his hands on his hip, and...

[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:57.720]
Oh!

[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.940]
Oh, he leaves a free fright in Paul Buma's face.

[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.200]
The crowd get a kick out of this.

[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.240]
As you know, a free for the very low score are only two points.

[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.760]
But to throw one away just in a gesture of defiance,

[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.520]
demonstrates the spirit of dash and recklessness,

[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.220]
which has made the Englishman the champion that he is.

[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.320]
He's smiling these things for an out of returns to the central arena.

[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:23.040]
In order to judge the show, he's ready, and he'll allow what's this.

[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.460]
He's not going to use the farting pose.

[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.880]
Lord Windus merely championed and a final gesture of contempt

[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.860]
scorned the use of the farting pose.

[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.120]
Well, this is developing it a little bit of a grudge contest.

[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.020]
He has his hands on his hip, feet apart.

[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.080]
He's likely bent and...

[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.840]
Aschisla, his first attack is at another one,

[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.200]
two in a row, and another one a third.

[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.300]
Three sisters in a row are tremendous at the 60 points in his first 30 seconds.

[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.280]
This one...

[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.540]
And one, two, three, four.

[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.520]
Four fuzzies, four, fragrance fuzzies in rapid technique.

[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.140]
It deploys you to see the even comfort with which his law tip leaves his fart.

[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.160]
Perfect technique.

[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.880]
And now his score is 80 points.

[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.560]
80 points in the first 30 seconds of the pose.

[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.260]
I was getting ready again, hands on hips.

[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.840]
A little bit, right in the face.

[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.400]
He's trained to...

[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.680]
Oh, something there, wait a minute.

[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.640]
Something's wrong.

[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.160]
His attendance run into him, he's in some kind of distress.

[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:26.900]
I see.

[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.520]
He has to judge his signal.

[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.360]
It was a posture or hard luck, your Lordship, the hard luck.

[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:38.900]
The champion left a very bad posture and will be penalized 15 points.

[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:45.700]
That puts him back to 65 points, 59 shots of the 120-40 needs to retain the championship.

[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.860]
He's all set again and seems to be straining a little more cautiously.

[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.300]
And here he is.

[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.060]
A fundous break.

[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.840]
Oh, a beautiful bit of wind breaking virtuosity.

[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:10.280]
A most difficult, a most difficult part of a form without plotting this man as wonderful control.

[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.940]
And the crowd are really warming up to him.

[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.600]
That last death, that fundous break counts 30 points.

[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.000]
And the takes the Lordwind is mere up to 95 points.

[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.220]
It's getting very tense now.

[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.500]
And here it is, here is the next one.

[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.500]
A crow blow.

[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.340]
A crow blow.

[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.340]
10 points.

[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.620]
Follow the slide.

[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.640]
A resounding single strutterble...

[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.340]
I think that is.

[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.000]
Wait, yes, the judges.

[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.860]
Propane that be a single flutterble.

[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.420]
A lovely, a lovely change of pace there.

[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.540]
And now the excitement is going unbearable.

[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.940]
As the champion takes a step away from the post,

[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.720]
and his score is 120.

[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.260]
Just three points, short of the post.

[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.300]
Bumamar, just three points short.

[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.760]
If he gets one more fuzzy or two small free,

[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.140]
it's all over the doubting.

[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.960]
And the challenger will have to return to Australia

[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.000]
with his chattet hope.

[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.460]
I think everyone's heart takes a full boomer.

[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.860]
He's really a great guy.

[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.140]
But the wind is mere depth up to the post again.

[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.160]
It looks very confident.

[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.100]
As he gets ready for the killing.

[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.940]
And here it comes.

[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.380]
It's a three.

[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.240]
A three.

[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.360]
That's two more points.

[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.360]
A little small free was all it was.

[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.540]
Two points.

[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.200]
And now it's practically over just one more.

[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.960]
Of those little free, those little two points

[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.400]
free from the contest will be over.

[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.200]
It seems as though his lordship was deliberately

[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.800]
tormenting Bumar by darling.

[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.980]
But Bumar smiling.

[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.780]
It's a poor smile.

[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.260]
But he's trying hard.

[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.900]
It's sitting there trying hard to take it

[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.960]
like the grand forceman that he is.

[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.720]
But he can see defeat standing ready to take away

[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.860]
his dreams at almost any instant.

[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.320]
And now Lord, wind is mere depth forward.

[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.760]
And hello, hello.

[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.020]
He's going to use the farting post to find a better scene.

[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.660]
I suspect this is his knees.

[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.480]
It looks as though he's going to try

[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.560]
for ice-coating effort for a whirlwind finish, perhaps.

[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.000]
Another cistern.

[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.560]
And now he's trying very hard to vein this,

[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.560]
but starting out on his foyer, and even the trickle

[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.280]
of perspiration venturing down his temple,

[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.160]
seems to have the base.

[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.620]
So for this mighty last effort,

[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.540]
should have undivided tension.

[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.180]
Now, the suggestion of a smile from the champion,

[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.820]
he can still decide he's just what

[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.180]
Trinkens is going to get his final bid.

[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.700]
Like he's the audience,

[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.280]
so much to a man who's on his feet.

[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.420]
Breakfast and tense.

[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.600]
Because his eyes look a pure certainty on his face.

[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.240]
Oh!

[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.520]
Oh, he's s**t!

[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.720]
The champion is just wildbind!

[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.220]
Now, ladies and gentlemen, as a special service feature,

[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.600]
we have brought you to the direction

[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.420]
of the ring side of the Maple Leaf Auditorium,

[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.700]
a blow-by lotus chrypton of the first

[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.300]
deputation contest hung held under international

[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:02.260]
orthosis.

[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.640]
The sword cast,

[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.080]
replaced midweek meditations usually had a good time.

[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.880]
The honorators didn't yet found.

[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.780]
Now back to the best of meal on 5.60 QAM.

[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.080]
Here's your brand, honey.

[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.020]
Land again.

[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.460]
It tastes so crappy.

[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.240]
You know, I'd give my immortal soul for a brand that tastes good.

[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.780]
I heard that.

[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.240]
Beelzebob, Lord of the Underworld!

[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.760]
What are you doing here?

[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.580]
I heard you're not eating your fiber, Bob.

[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.080]
Perhaps you'd like to try a new Beelzebrand.

[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.820]
What's so great about Beelzebrand?

[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.140]
Well, one bowl of Beelzebrand has all the fiber you need to keep regular,

[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.520]
but the best part is it tastes great.

[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.100]
Wow!

[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.320]
Besides, if you don't eat your fiber,

[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.140]
your bowels will clog with rotting meat,

[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.680]
your intestines will fill with cancerous tumors and bloodshed

[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.800]
but from your anguish.

[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.360]
Okay, okay, I get the points.

[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.500]
So I'll eat my brand.

[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.440]
There's a good fellow.

[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.960]
Thanks, O'Destinylet One.

[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.900]
No problem.

[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.000]
And now about your immortal soul, Bob.

[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.420]
Beelzebob!

[00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.760]
I'm just kidding.

[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.940]
Beelzebrand, because good health shouldn't cost you your soul.

[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.000]
They're smoking it out in the air for glazed.

[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.400]
Voices, every time you turn around,

[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.820]
there's another one coming straight for you.

[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.720]
Your mom, your girlfriend, your buddies, right?

[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:13.920]
And somehow, you're a voice,

[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.920]
the one that really matters gets buried.

[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.160]
But man, you can't let it stay silent.

[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.580]
And that's why the Air Force could be the place for you.

[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.860]
You'll earn a good salary,

[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.560]
learn from a hundred and twenty-five years.

[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.060]
And, sir, be a con.

[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.100]
Well, that's the right...

[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.280]
Well, it's right fosters, Fall, okay?

[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.380]
What was that about?

[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.140]
He came in here and he said,

[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.300]
he would all redden the face.

[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.980]
Well, I guess he wasn't redden the face.

[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.840]
It's kind of hard for Roy Foster to be redden the face.

[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.720]
Well, you know what a black guy gets redden the face?

[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:39.740]
You know?

[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.640]
But at any rate, he looked embarrassed and he said to me,

[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.780]
oh, you should be talking about my personal stuff on here.

[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.040]
I said, what personal stuff,

[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.620]
he said, oh, my plumbing problem.

[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.700]
So we take it back, Roy Foster,

[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.240]
Roy Foster, no, he didn't care about the other thing.

[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.380]
You keep thinking it's about that stuff with that sales broad.

[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.500]
No, he doesn't care about that.

[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.560]
Everybody knows that.

[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.340]
No, he's concerned that people will like,

[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.500]
somehow, this great ex-dolphin player,

[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.860]
when we all admired when he played,

[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.880]
always really badly out of shape and fat now.

[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.780]
And we understand why he tried the Act Can's Dead,

[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.040]
because he's big as a house.

[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.440]
But at any rate, he did not shed blood.

[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.700]
I just made that up.

[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.160]
Not.

[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.160]
We talked about Maya incident on the year before.

[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:16.560]
Remember?

[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.420]
Why, you shed blood?

[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:17.840]
Right.

[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.600]
And all these people were calling me

[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.680]
and the doctor on the beach was calling me.

[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.060]
Yeah.

[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:22.640]
Because I'm...

[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.060]
But you're not uptight and sensitive,

[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.540]
and when you blush, you can see.

[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.300]
So we know when you're offended.

[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.520]
But when we're blushes, we can't see it.

[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.860]
So that echoes to sure.

[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.380]
One more good reason not to be black,

[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.920]
because if you're going to be sensitive

[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.120]
and start blushing about stuff,

[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.680]
how are we supposed to be knowing it, huh?

[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:37.800]
I don't be knowing it.

[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:38.780]
God damn it.

[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.340]
So Roy did not the crap black or a green,

[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.260]
whatever it was, purple.

[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.100]
Red, whatever color it was.

[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.520]
Oh, it was purple.

[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.180]
Okay, whatever.

[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.940]
Just go upstairs and do what's your name and get out of here, Roy.

[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.060]
Go sell some spots.

[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.020]
Here's Dear Field.

[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.340]
Hello.

[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.020]
Neil.

[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:52.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.180]
How are you?

[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:53.460]
Great.

[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.460]
Never been better.

[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.160]
Listen, I just stepped into the house for a minute

[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.160]
and flipped the TV on.

[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.040]
You should hear Pat Robertson

[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.120]
praying for Carla Fei Tucker.

[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.540]
So well too late now.

[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.000]
Hey, the one that's going to fry.

[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.700]
You know, why should it be any different

[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.580]
for the men than it is for the women?

[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:09.520]
Yeah.

[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.380]
You know, you stick an axe through someone.

[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.820]
They're going to fry you.

[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.060]
Has nothing to do with men or women

[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.700]
and has to do with that she's born again, sir.

[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.600]
Don't you understand it?

[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.300]
She's a born again Christian now.

[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.260]
And how that she's changed.

[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.420]
So what maybe OJ will, you know, see the light.

[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.380]
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.560]
She's all ready to go meet her maker.

[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.280]
Good.

[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.160]
I wish I could pull the switchers or flip it for her.

[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.800]
Or give her the needle, stick it to her.

[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920]
Oh, listen, have a great day, Pat.

[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:32.800]
See you around.

[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.660]
Every where you go, it's the same old crap.

[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.460]
But your Yenthas, see, it goes to show you

[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.680]
while we have no spots on most of the day on a station

[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.780]
because most of the people are supposed to be selling

[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.960]
and or coordinating those kind of activities

[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.640]
are busy.

[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.740]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, do you know Yenthas routine?

[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.020]
So George tells me during the last break

[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.180]
that he's had several calls from upstairs.

[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.340]
Upstairs meaning the power structure of this joint

[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.040]
where all the Yenthas sit around all day,

[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.660]
finger diddling each other or themselves

[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.260]
or both as the case may be.

[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.440]
We're trying to get the stains off their clothing.

[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.400]
And people want to know, are you okay down there?

[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.300]
Say anything going on?

[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.460]
Because Joe Castello is in here today,

[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.400]
who of course is usually back at the other joint,

[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.400]
getting emphysema from what's in the building.

[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.840]
And he's just sitting here observing today in case

[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.080]
of course since he's the backup if we can say that.

[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.700]
In case George is going to be out sick,

[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.060]
which being here today, Joe means,

[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.780]
count on it in the next couple of weeks.

[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.100]
Trust me, he's already planning the days.

[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.540]
But I mean, doesn't that show you how pathetic

[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.020]
and paranoid you assholes and George says to me,

[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:28.940]
oh my goodness, I'm fired right now,

[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.000]
yeah, because he just bought a house.

[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.560]
That would be a good time to fire his ass.

[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.460]
Although at least you always circumside.

[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.020]
I'll say that.

[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.300]
That was only an accident that I just dropped my cigar.

[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.240]
It wasn't lit, was it?

[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.240]
No, no.

[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.200]
If I'm brushing down there, it's only because it's cigar-ish.

[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.020]
Let's go to a mobile in West Palm Beach.

[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:45.320]
Hello.

[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.180]
Hey, what's up, Neon?

[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:46.780]
How you doing, sir?

[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.580]
I got a couple quick questions for you in a couple of comments.

[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.060]
Okay.

[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.420]
Before I never let her just show before,

[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.620]
he came over to QAM.

[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.320]
And I basically listened to a few times,

[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.260]
an open mind.

[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.980]
I think your insight on hockey is excellent.

[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.380]
I think you know a lot about the game,

[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.360]
and I appreciate some of the things I hear

[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.940]
in your comments about it.

[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:05.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.920]
But as far as your other comments,

[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.400]
I'd rather you stick to sports.

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.740]
I don't understand why.

[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.540]
You'd rather I stick to sports.

[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.740]
Well, let me say this to you, sir.

[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.660]
Again, I don't do a sports show.

[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.760]
I don't do a hockey show.

[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.100]
I don't do a sports show.

[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.660]
I do the highest rated show in this market for the last 20 years.

[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.980]
Then he'll rod your show and will continue doing so.

[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:23.720]
Don't hang up on me.

[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.720]
I'm not hanging up on you,

[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.500]
but I will say this,

[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.460]
I don't take direction from listeners,

[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.000]
especially people who don't even know what my show is about.

[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.240]
Okay, well, like I said,

[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.660]
I came on board with an open mind.

[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.060]
Okay.

[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.360]
But I mean, I've been on the year now here.

[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.280]
For like five weeks.

[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.440]
And it would seem to me that if the only part that you like

[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.860]
here in is the hockey stuff,

[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.560]
which represents about 5% or most of my show,

[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.300]
that you would have been long gone by now.

[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.160]
No, no, no, I know.

[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.700]
That's I tune you in once in a blue wound

[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.640]
because I'm in my car a lot.

[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.120]
I'm in cells.

[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.900]
You know, I do.

[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.040]
When I hear a hockey, I keep doing.

[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.060]
Otherwise, you know, I think you're in a Gary Tachas.

[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:53.680]
Yeah.

[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.100]
And, you know, I think your daily views on daily life,

[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.560]
a lot of them are misconstrued.

[00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.380]
And you just don't want to.

[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.160]
Misconstrued.

[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.040]
You know what that means, sir?

[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.640]
You know what they mean?

[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:01.760]
I do.

[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:02.680]
Misconstrued.

[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.020]
It's misconstrued.

[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.040]
Misconstrued.

[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.340]
Misconstrued would be misunderstood.

[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:07.340]
You know what that means?

[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.400]
You misunderstand a lot of things.

[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.180]
And I'm not going to point you out.

[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.980]
When you said the views would be misconstrued,

[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.320]
that means that whoever would be hearing them

[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.340]
would misunderstand them.

[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.640]
And then perhaps that's the problem.

[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.240]
No, I think you don't get it.

[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.700]
No, you don't get it.

[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.880]
Neil, stick to hockey, buddy.

[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:20.260]
Goodbye.

[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.580]
Hey, stick it up your ass, buddy.

[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:21.900]
Goodbye.

[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.700]
See, there's another guy that can't handle it.

[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.840]
Another one who's real nervous now.

[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.720]
He's probably in a closet.

[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.040]
Now, back to the best of meal on 5.60 QAM.

[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.960]
So, uh, where's uh, Davey Gravy line?

[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:45.780]
Welcome.

[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.020]
I took her calls from the eponics.

[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.220]
They say the future needs right for me.

[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.300]
Now I can't get snow job.

[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.120]
Cause I don't got no literacy.

[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.060]
I's talking like an old league road.

[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.000]
Eponics thought they how this way.

[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.160]
Now I can't do nothing.

[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.160]
But my heritage says that's okay.

[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.700]
Change my name to shoot throw.

[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.320]
No, right.

[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.780]
Do send the quarter any kind of life.

[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.920]
I remember when I was stealing.

[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.940]
All the white bands got hanging outside.

[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.220]
The building there bar.

[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.560]
Grind the blues.

[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.540]
Now, poverty.

[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.560]
White and there was God's know.

[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.560]
Job for me.

[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:28.840]

[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.440]
Todibonics will give my life a chance.

[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:33.900]
Now.

[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.340]
Got to go in and sell more crack cocaine.

[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:39.640]
Crack cocaine.

[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:40.760]
Crack cocaine.

[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.160]
Crack cocaine.

[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.660]
Crack cocaine.

[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.520]
Crack cocaine.

[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:46.640]
Crack cocaine.

[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.200]
Crack cocaine.

[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.000]
Crack cocaine.

[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.220]
Crack cocaine.

[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.760]
Lordy, what a boring song.

[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.960]
Eponics makes me sound funny.

[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.660]
Got nothing to do with literacy.

[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.080]
Now I got to make more money.

[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.160]
Live a fool sounds good to me.

[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.380]
I got plenty of nothing.

[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.340]
Eponics ain't getting me anywhere.

[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.960]
Maybe I'll mug an old white bitch.

[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.740]
Steel a purse and pull her hair.

[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.920]
Then I gonna take some money.

[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.120]
By a cereal and a fridge a day.

[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.120]
I remember when I was stealing.

[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.200]
All the white bands got hanging outside.

[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.500]
The building there bar.

[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.760]
Grind the blues.

[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:37.700]
Now, poverty.

[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.660]
White and there was God's know.

[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.600]
Job for me.

[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:41.140]

[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.420]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.600]
Todibonics would give my life a chance.

[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:45.960]
Down.

[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.400]
Ha, ha.

[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.540]
Got to go in there.

[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.700]
Moe crack cocaine.

[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:51.900]
Crack cocaine.

[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.240]
Crack cocaine.

[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.260]
Crack cocaine.

[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.820]
Crack cocaine.

[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:57.260]

[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:57.720]
Crack cocaine.

[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.520]
I think we really struck on the wall.

[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.800]
Nerd here today if he asked me.

[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.200]
I think we finally got to do with topic

[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.280]
that we should have been talking about.

[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.160]
Years ago, long ago, if we only would have realized

[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.700]
we had 600,000 Jamaican just living here

[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.700]
in the city of Miami alone.

[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.040]
And two minutes, what is it?

[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.120]
Two and a half million Jamaicans

[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.160]
and Dayton Briar put together.

[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.320]
And that includes Palm Beach.

[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.080]
Because in this article, it's interesting.

[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.320]
It says Brazil's fans, absent promoters hopes

[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.660]
of breaking a South Florida soccer

[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.120]
attendance record fell short.

[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.580]
Conspicuous by their absence in Tuesday's crowd

[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.580]
of 43,000, 754 were Brazilian fans

[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.960]
when recent years of filthy orange bull.

[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.900]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.260]
But perhaps only 10% of Tuesday's crowd

[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.500]
was pounding samba drums

[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.800]
and wearing the blue green and yellow

[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.420]
national colors of Brazil.

[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.120]
So that means there were like 4,000

[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.820]
Brazilian 40,000 Jamaicans in that orange bull last night.

[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.160]
40,000 Jamaicans.

[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.760]
And where are the Jamaicans?

[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.900]
If they really live here, if they're not illegal aliens

[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.120]
or came down from Alabama or wherever they're hanging out,

[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.960]
I mean, where the hell do they live?

[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.040]
Where are these people?

[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.040]
Have they infiltrated us very quietly?

[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.080]
Are they busy selling wheat on street corners

[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.740]
in Little Havana?

[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.780]
They're in Miami, in the city of...

[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.420]
In the city of Miami selling jerk pork

[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:02.980]
and jerk chicken.

[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.620]
Is that Haitian?

[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.580]
That's Jamaican.

[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.940]
Yeah, jerk pork.

[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.460]
So Haitians don't jerk pork, hurry.

[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.080]
Yeah, Haitians don't have any food at all.

[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.040]
Well, I know they're not doing too well,

[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.820]
but I mean, they must have some food

[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.420]
to reproduce like that.

[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.640]
But seriously, we've got the different ethnic groups.

[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.680]
We all know about the Cubans

[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.800]
and there's some people love Cubans.

[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.700]
Some people hate Cubans.

[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.540]
I love kind of like, you know, the young Cubans.

[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.000]
I love a lot.

[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.580]
The ones that listen to this show, the guys.

[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.140]
And then we got, of course, our American...

[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.260]
Well, we don't know what to call them anymore.

[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.760]
Just regular plain old black folks.

[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.360]
African American, which I hate that.

[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.600]
Just black guys, women, whatever.

[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.800]
Which they're okay as long as they stay put.

[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.440]
And in, of course, the Haitians,

[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.500]
which, like you said,

[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.920]
they haven't got two nickels to rub together.

[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.920]
And they're busy selling the baseballs, which is good.

[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:44.940]
That's something very productive.

[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:45.540]
We like that.

[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.080]
And they don't seem to bother anybody

[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.780]
as long as they mind their own business

[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.740]
and stay out of their neighborhood.

[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.480]
And that leaves the Jamaicans

[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.280]
who seem to be the question mark ethnic group in South Florida.

[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.060]
And today, I think we're going to find a lot more out

[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:57.880]
about the Jamaicans.

[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.460]
Yeah, man.

[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.200]
Like that lady.

[00:25:59.440 --> 00:25:59.540]
You're right.

[00:25:59.720 --> 00:25:59.840]
Huh?

[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.620]
They're not on welfare.

[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.360]
They have jobs.

[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.380]
They go to work.

[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.600]
What do you mean they're not on welfare?

[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.300]
Is the...

[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.660]
Are you suggesting that there are others

[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.360]
who are on welfare and don't have jobs?

[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.900]
Is that what you'd be suggesting?

[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:09.880]
Yeah, like Americans.

[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.060]
Black, white, and miscellaneous.

[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:12.920]
And Cubans.

[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.700]
Cuban-American.

[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.740]
No, Cubans are not on welfare.

[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.360]
There are no Cubans on welfare.

[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.320]
Most are ineligible anyway, like myself and my family.

[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.280]
Oh, thank God for that.

[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:19.940]
Thank God.

[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.080]
I was thinking like,

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.540]
Mary Alito.

[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.220]
Has they never got any food stamps or stuff

[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:23.860]
when they came over here

[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.160]
or a driver's license right away

[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.060]
with a guy off the banana bulb?

[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:26.440]
That's different.

[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.260]
Because they're not evil.

[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:27.900]
Mary Alito.

[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:28.940]
They're probably not either.

[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:29.960]
What do you mean that was illegal?

[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.460]
Well, that was not illegal.

[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.220]
I'm not talking about the ones that came in illegally.

[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.340]
I'm talking about the ones

[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.120]
that govern our ground wealth

[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.220]
and with open arms standing down around the shores.

[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.920]
So Bob Barker was standing right there next to him.

[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.620]
Let me know down.

[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:40.940]
That was a joke.

[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.920]
Maybe you'll get your children spayed and neutered.

[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.060]
But I guess they weren't listening.

[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:44.780]
Okay, anyway.

[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.180]
Let's do a Miramar.

[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:46.500]
Hello.

[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.380]
Miramar.

[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.540]
God, Nioh.

[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:48.760]
Yes.

[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.760]
I had a question.

[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.180]
If that dead born again Christian bitch,

[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:53.420]
leave that.

[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.880]
Heaven was like the ultimate reward

[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.580]
and it was so much better than life on Earth.

[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:56.980]
Yeah.

[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.260]
Why should you try to save her own life?

[00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.940]
All because they could be the excuse

[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.160]
they were given yesterday was well,

[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.780]
she's got so much to contribute

[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.740]
and she's still has so much work to do here.

[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.880]
She won't be doing no more work here boys.

[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.000]
She's dead.

[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:09.960]
Here's a good idea.

[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.080]
All the Christians who want to be in heaven

[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.400]
when they're all pick active,

[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.560]
kill each other, the sons, the ones that they're killing

[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.820]
having where they want to be.

[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.820]
And then they'll get the electric chair

[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.420]
or the needle or whatever.

[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:20.640]
Right.

[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.440]
And they'll be there too.

[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.200]
Sounds good to me.

[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.700]
And you can start with O'Jane Johnny Cochran.

[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.120]
Excellent.

[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:24.960]
Have a good one.

[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:25.340]
Okay.

[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.260]
So let's do a question real quick.

[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.440]
What is the question?

[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.820]
The question was about your makings

[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.760]
but this guy's too worried about

[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.720]
frying born again Christians.

[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:33.780]
Not a bad idea.

[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.900]
Those wrong with that.

[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.500]
See the arrogance.

[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.080]
That thing in Texas was a classic example

[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.800]
of the arrogance of most religious groups.

[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.560]
Not just born again Christians or Catholics

[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.900]
or Jews or Orthodox, whatever.

[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.140]
But I'll religious groups think that

[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.340]
because their stuff don't stink

[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.480]
and their God is the right one.

[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.640]
Therefore we bend the rules for us.

[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.740]
Even though she was convicted in a court of law,

[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.540]
she killed these two people with a pickaxe

[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.380]
and we already know while she was on drugs,

[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.260]
she's got this excuse.

[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.140]
But she found Jesus and she's born again.

[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.760]
And therefore because of that,

[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:04.940]
then we should make an exception.

[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.020]
The law doesn't really count,

[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.920]
which of course proves that a lot of born again Christians

[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.960]
think that they're above the law

[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.780]
like the ones who are busy bombing abortion clinics

[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.140]
in Birmingham and elsewhere, etc.

[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:12.680]
and so on.

[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.300]
And in Tallahassee and Pensacola.

[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.060]
God's law.

[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:15.460]
Is not.

[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.180]
God's law.

[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:16.620]
That's right.

[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.060]
God's law is above all the rest

[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.700]
and Cal Thomas knows God's law.

[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.980]
Just read the Sun sent a law

[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.440]
led us to the editor this morning

[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.060]
because the born again,

[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.380]
they know what morality is

[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.780]
and you damn well better listen to them

[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.040]
because their definition of morality

[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.360]
is what everybody else is going to do.

[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.520]
Good enough for the president.

[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.260]
It's good enough for me.

[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.840]
Here's a four-lettered ale.

[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.260]
Hello.

[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.360]
Hey, Neil.

[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.520]
Twenty-year-old circumcised you here.

[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.080]
All right.

[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.200]
I want to put my vote in for the Jamaicans.

[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:40.640]
Okay.

[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.360]
I love them.

[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.440]
I love the Jamaicans.

[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.600]
We want them to understand that.

[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.360]
Yeah, especially the ones in our neighborhood here.

[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.020]
Hey, there might.

[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.100]
I have some neighbors there.

[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.700]
Jamaicans and they are wonderful people.

[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:49.260]
Mm-hmm.

[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.540]
And they don't smoke on you.

[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.140]
Yeah, we just want them to play their soccer

[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.000]
at a more convenient time for all the rest of us.

[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.560]
Hey, now it's Florida Panther hockey

[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.720]
and he better than Jamaican soccer right now.

[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.880]
Yes, it is.

[00:28:59.080 --> 00:28:59.580]
Yes, it is.

[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:00.240]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.080]
Maybe we'll pay any hockey.

[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.160]
Shini hockey would be better than any kind of soccer, sir.

[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.740]
Soccer is terminal and there is no case to be made for it.

[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.700]
I don't hear if there are three billion people

[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.180]
all over the world sitting right now

[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.340]
tearing each other's hair out over their soccer jerseys.

[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.840]
Soccer is terminal.

[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.600]
Make no mistake about it.

[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.600]
But not after a couple of nights to make and do these.

[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.080]
Yeah, right.

[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.380]
Well, that goes to show you.

[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.420]
That's all you need.

[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.420]
Maybe if they'd open up a weed concession at the arena,

[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.700]
we'd enjoy the hockey games more.

[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.420]
Hey, I'd run it.

[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.020]
Okay.

[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:28.540]
I'm the first.

[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.500]
I'm the man for that job.

[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.420]
You're hired.

[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.740]
All right, everybody in radio backed out your juice bag.

[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.180]
Okay, and put your Yamaha away.

[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:34.600]
Have a good one.

[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.300]
You know how you're in your tits, too.

[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.760]
So now in the middle of the show,

[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.400]
after getting into a big song and dance with our Jamaican friends,

[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.480]
now Greg Reed says, oh, it's a great show.

[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.100]
But guess what?

[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.180]
We're right in the middle of a little Jamaican here, man.

[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.860]
And by the way, I'm leaving for the day, said Greg Reed.

[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.280]
No doubt.

[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.340]
He's on his way out.

[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.040]
I mean, today, here's a mobile in Pemberg Pines.

[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.320]
Hello.

[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:53.140]
Hey, I'm on.

[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:53.720]
You're on.

[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.960]
Oh, hey, I've got no material, but I have a burning question.

[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.420]
Yeah.

[00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:02.280]
Where in when did you get that copy or that or managed same?

[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.740]
I want to bang you in the butt.

[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.740]
You know something, um, Robert, who's one of our board ops

[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.420]
at the station, a fine American brought it in.

[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.960]
He brought it and taped it all off stuff in.

[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.080]
And I've been wondering that myself.

[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.200]
I wondered the context.

[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.100]
I keep asking myself what conversation was going on on the air

[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.180]
when they said I want to bang you in the butt, honey.

[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.000]
And George, evidently, it was a locker room interview.

[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:23.940]
Oh, I got it.

[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.380]
Uh-huh.

[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.400]
I bet it was with Danny Boy as what I heard.

[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.100]
That's right.

[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:27.740]
We'll take it on you.

[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.280]
OK, pal.

[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:28.660]
See that.

[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.060]
In fact, it was he was talking to Josh Friedman when he said,

[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.860]
Oh, my God, your breasts are beautiful.

[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.600]
That was my favorite conversation.

[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.720]
Though seriously, stop and think about this.

[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.640]
This was on the air on this station

[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.180]
and managing the middle of the conversation blurt's out.

[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.940]
I want to bang you in the butt, honey.

[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.200]
Do I rest my case?

[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.900]
Do I have to prove to you that he's one of the most

[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.480]
entertaining people in America right there?

[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.620]
I rest my cases.

[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.900]
Here's West Palm Beach.

[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:50.180]
Hello.

[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.200]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.700]
This is Brian.

[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.760]
Listen, you're a genius.

[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.260]
You know that?

[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.300]
Yeah, I know that.

[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.760]
You last night when you were probably home,

[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.900]
you just thinking, what am I going to do

[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.660]
to boost my pathetic show?

[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:04.180]
Yeah.

[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.080]
You probably have to be a fan.

[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.520]
My pathetic show that my pathetic show that the guy

[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.180]
who's on the phone now listens to every day, right?

[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:10.820]
Pardon me?

[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.840]
I said, my pathetic show that you listen to every day.

[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.220]
No, no, don't cut me off.

[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.500]
No, no, just just give it up.

[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.380]
I'm not cutting you off, but I'm having a conversation.

[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.600]
Why do some of you people just like you've got blinders on?

[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.460]
Like you can't hear what I'm saying to you.

[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.880]
You listen to this show every day.

[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.700]
Why don't you admit that?

[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.020]
I don't know.

[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.100]
Listen to this show every day.

[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:26.720]
I'm a Jamaican.

[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:27.500]
You're what?

[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.400]
I'm a Jamaican.

[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.700]
What does that have to do with it?

[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.560]
What it has to do with it is that you...

[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.180]
So how do you know about the show if you don't listen to it?

[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.520]
Well, I've been flipping shadows.

[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.600]
You've been flipping it.

[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.740]
You sound like you've been flipping it.

[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.740]
Anyway, what I want to say, what I want to say, sir.

[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.960]
What I wanted to say was...

[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.980]
What did you want to say?

[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.460]
How many times are you going to repeat that?

[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.460]
What did you want to say?

[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.660]
I want to say that jerk chicken and jerk pork

[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.500]
is a season that needs, unlike the restaurant that you go to

[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.720]
where you have to dump all your salty and black pepper

[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.200]
to get a taste.

[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.660]
We serenade or meat.

[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.060]
And we season the perfection.

[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:06.720]
Yeah.

[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.640]
And that's what I want to say.

[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.260]
What does that have to do with the price of peanuts?

[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:11.920]
What does that mean?

[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.460]
Sir, I have a suggestion for you.

[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:14.820]
Are you listening?

[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:15.760]
Sir?

[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.140]
Yeah, okay.

[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.500]
I was going to tell him to jerk pork,

[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.460]
but I think he already is.

[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.460]
I serenade my meat.

[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.320]
Yeah, man.

[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.100]
Oh, I think I heard that correctly.

[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.720]
And he never, my pathetic show.

[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.680]
I'm going to goose up my rain.

[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.440]
Like, I invented this massive crowd that we had on the roads

[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.320]
last night, and I was just salivating.

[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.920]
I was just sitting there, forming it about,

[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.660]
oh, this is going to make great material tomorrow.

[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:35.240]
Right.

[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.780]
The stress level on a scale of one was infinity, okay?

[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.980]
That's how bad it was.

[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.780]
Just praying that maybe eventually,

[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.160]
sometime before next sookers,

[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.260]
we might wind up at the arena

[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.580]
and get to see the damn hockey game.

[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.140]
But I just invented it,

[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.600]
and I just am an evil person who may occasionally jerk pork.

[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.640]
Now back to the best of you on 5.60 QAM.

[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.260]
Sales people are iceholes.

[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.060]
I want to start the month of February

[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.800]
in this week with something that I rarely,

[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.220]
rarely, if ever do, and that is apologized to a sales hole.

[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.440]
Because I've been saying since I came on here,

[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.620]
and again, I don't, you know, I'm brand new on this station.

[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.700]
I don't know a lot of these people.

[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.020]
I don't know the different personalities,

[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.640]
the different psychoses, et cetera.

[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.520]
So everybody's telling me that Gary Sarner is an asshole.

[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.720]
And of course he gets fired.

[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.360]
And then a week later, they hire him back.

[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.160]
And now I'm beginning to understand why.

[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.640]
Gary Sarner, you can correct me if I'm wrong on this.

[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.660]
Is the sports sales manager, right?

[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.020]
Was.

[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:27.660]
Oops.

[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:28.900]
Used to be.

[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.640]
Well, at any rate, he was involved in selling the ball games,

[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.100]
the dolphins, the marlins, the pantas, whatever, the sports stuff.

[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.840]
Now it seems to me, and again, I don't know,

[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.200]
because I'm certainly not privy to any numbers

[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.760]
or any real inside information.

[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.060]
But it seems to me that when you listen to the sports

[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.840]
events on this station, that there's a lot of advertising.

[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.420]
In fact, when the game is over like a Panther game,

[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.980]
I mean, on and on, which is fine.

[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.920]
You gotta get those spots in there, make some bucks.

[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:54.540]
Great.

[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.640]
But the fact that we've got what 42 sales managers here,

[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.300]
it indicates to me that maybe Gary,

[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.560]
now he is hung like a mosquito.

[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.720]
That part I do not retract.

[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.200]
Because we've talked to guys who have showered with him.

[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.000]
And yes, they do have communal showers here.

[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.960]
Where Foster was telling me about that last week,

[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.160]
he said, just like being with the dolphins,

[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.740]
you shower the salespeople.

[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.500]
And I said, from Luan's not involved in that issue.

[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.640]
Well, maybe that's why I landed door on left.

[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.480]
She couldn't handle the heat anymore, so to speak.

[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.060]
Those communal sales showers.

[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.940]
Well, if you're gonna be a sports station,

[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.780]
you gotta have that kind of sports ambiance.

[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.920]
So at any rate, they have told me that Gary Sarner

[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.240]
is hung like a net, okay?

[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.520]
So I don't take that back.

[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.020]
But he may not be an asshole.

[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.400]
Because at least, maybe he's an asshole,

[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:35.780]
at least gets his job done.

[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.540]
So I've been thinking over the weekend,

[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.080]
because Friday's something happened to me driving home

[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.680]
that just, I've been thinking about this a lot

[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.540]
because I've heard a lot of people belly-ick and about.

[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.880]
There's no spots, there's no this.

[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.500]
And then that reading book came out about two weeks ago.

[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.460]
And this station just went through the roof.

[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.800]
Went through the roof.

[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.160]
Hank is sitting there with a 7.3 share in men

[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.260]
in the afternoon.

[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.140]
Number one, by a country mile,

[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.280]
the morning show giant share in men.

[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.940]
And I keep hearing people saying,

[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.280]
well, this is no sports radio.

[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.980]
We've gone from all sports radio to no sports radio.

[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.360]
And I see somebody like Linda Doyle,

[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.120]
who's a sweetheart and a very, very astute sales hole,

[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.540]
and a very conscientious person.

[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.060]
I see her bailing out of here.

[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.000]
And I'm saying to myself, something is wrong here.

[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.800]
So Friday, I'm driving home and I'm listening to Hank.

[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.600]
And we come to a break, finally, at long last,

[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.560]
we come to a break.

[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.580]
And now I hear, da, da, da, da, da,

[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.900]
and it's that god-awful, muddy sounding,

[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.220]
distorted PSA that they were playing here.

[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.320]
I'll show the first couple of days

[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.520]
when we had almost no spots.

[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.820]
And I'm thinking to myself, afternoon,

[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.580]
get this picture, afternoon drive,

[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.580]
Friday afternoon, top rated show, and they're playing PSAs.

[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.880]
And Hank don't even have time to go take a leak

[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.020]
or maybe a whatever he had to go take

[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.980]
there with the EGAL tournament,

[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.520]
because there's no spots.

[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.860]
And it suddenly dawned on me,

[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.180]
thinking long and hard about it this weekend.

[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.160]
That Luan is the asshole.

[00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.500]
Oh!

[00:35:59.140 --> 00:35:59.940]
Up in sales.

[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.280]
And of course, you probably don't know Luan,

[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.560]
but maybe we'll get to know her better.

[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.960]
Maybe we'll make her into a celebrity.

[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.800]
Because it seems to me that there's something missing here,

[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.780]
because the people are responsible for selling 6 a.m.

[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.980]
to 6 p.m. other than ball games.

[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.280]
They're the ones who have it,

[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.880]
and even if we had a 40 share,

[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.480]
they couldn't sell you a glass of water

[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.940]
to a starving Arab for like one rupee.

[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.340]
Whatever the hell the Arabs have.

[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.660]
What do the Arabs have besides BO?

[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.520]
Now, what kind of a denero do they use in, huh?

[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.360]
Good question.

[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.880]
See, even the U. Mr. Smarty pants

[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.000]
don't know the denomination of the things

[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:31.920]
that they use over there.

[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.600]
The Russians have got their ruples,

[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.200]
the Dutch have got their agilders,

[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.500]
the Italians have got their lira.

[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.380]
One of the Arabs have,

[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.840]
besides a militant anti-Semitic attitude,

[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.260]
which is self-hating, because there's Mites,

[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.140]
and y'all started it.

[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.920]
Yeah, we did, and we're proud of it.

[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.640]
So at any rate, I'm beginning to understand

[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.560]
that maybe Luan is the asshole upstairs in sales.

[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.920]
Because there seems to be like a little bit of a problem here,

[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.180]
and we have sales managers quitting every week

[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.280]
and coming back every week,

[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.400]
and there seems to be nothing,

[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.080]
but absolute chaos up there,

[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.340]
up there meaning upstairs on the turd floor,

[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.520]
here at the Power 96 complex.

[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.920]
Now, if I were involved upstairs,

[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.240]
which I'm not, what is it?

[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:07.840]
Dinar.

[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:08.480]
Dinar.

[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.000]
No, it's not time for even for lunch yet, much less denar.

[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.960]
Reals, we're getting a whole bunch of stuff.

[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.620]
We don't really care to be honest with you,

[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.040]
okay, it was just a little thought there,

[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.860]
because I backed myself into a corner,

[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.280]
and I didn't know, fill in the blank.

[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.900]
Whatever kind of money that those barbarians use,

[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.100]
that was the point.

[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.900]
She couldn't sell them a glass of water,

[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.420]
she couldn't give it away for free,

[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.980]
and they water either, okay?

[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.020]
Is what I'm hearing.

[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.220]
Well, maybe not that far.

[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.440]
Because there's something seriously wrong here.

[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.320]
That's f***ing good.

[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.600]
Which is maybe why the beesleys are a little tight

[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.080]
with their money, why we still got that muddy,

[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.440]
sounding cart machine over there,

[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.540]
like that, which I thought they had that soft,

[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.040]
and then George was telling me the story

[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.460]
about the production studios over there,

[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:46.900]
and Duff is ringing his hands,

[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.140]
and wondering what the hell it's all about.

[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.280]
Of course, he's always been wondering

[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.520]
what it's about since he came here.

[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.140]
And then the wind, we're not going to be able

[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.060]
to straighten her ass out.

[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.620]
I think she's, maybe she'd better take a demotion.

[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.760]
That seems to work very well.

[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.920]
Look how much Gary Sarner is straighten himself out.

[00:37:59.320 --> 00:37:59.720]
Oh, he hasn't?

[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.100]
Well, like I said, the wind,

[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.300]
it's been nice knowing it's sweetheart,

[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.960]
but get with it already, will you?

[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.880]
I mean, this sales department, I thought you were,

[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.120]
I thought that all those months

[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.340]
that you were working in production,

[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.380]
when I was in limbo, having a great time,

[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.500]
I thought you were exaggerating,

[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.620]
I thought you were joking.

[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:13.720]
And then I came over here,

[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.300]
and we have like a lot of our own spots,

[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.600]
which most of them we brought with us,

[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.960]
but other than that, I'm telling you,

[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.160]
if they took all the tradeouts,

[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.320]
God only knows what this place is getting on these tradeouts,

[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.240]
but if they took all the tradeouts off the log

[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.520]
on this radio station,

[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.240]
we'd have to have a tank of oxygen for each show

[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.300]
just so we could continue talking at long

[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.340]
without any interruptions.

[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.560]
It is absolutely unbelievable.

[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.740]
Beyond a shadow of a doubt.

[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.580]
So somebody somewhere must be living

[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.480]
on high off the log, I'll tell you that,

[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.660]
because they got tradeouts for everything in this joint.

[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.580]
Couldn't we trade out a couple of cart machines?

[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.320]
Oh, I'm sorry, that has to do with radio,

[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.180]
we don't wanna do that.

[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.740]
Couldn't we possibly do that?

[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.780]
Could we trade out like something

[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.900]
that might benefit the radio station?

[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:50.740]
We don't wanna do that.

[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.160]
Greg's got his car, and this one's got this,

[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.180]
and this one's got a few cruises on the side,

[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.620]
and we got a lot of insustuous stuff going on here.

[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.660]
Too bad we didn't hire Steve Nickel to be PD.

[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.260]
Then we couldn't have had a habit,

[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.320]
we couldn't really operate in a cheap operation.

[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.660]
There would have been no programs,

[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.120]
just spots all day.

[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:07.360]
I'd have brought my shopping cart.

[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.500]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:11.760]
Oh man.

[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.100]
It's just shocking to me to see how,

[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.720]
you can talk about rating success

[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.000]
as only to a certain point,

[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.820]
but you can only get a certain share of the audience

[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.720]
and at that point, if you still don't have people

[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.080]
that can go out and sell it and make a profit,

[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.860]
then you got a real serious problem,

[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.600]
which is why the radio vouchers in this market

[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.220]
are circling over on this great dank, rainy, windy,

[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.040]
nasty, horrendous, grotesque day

[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.340]
on which the turnpike was an absolute nightmare

[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.480]
this morning northbound,

[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.540]
which snack out I was going southbound,

[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.040]
and all your rubber necks, by the way,

[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.380]
are a bunch of assholes as usual.

[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.340]
But on this day, you can look up there,

[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.400]
even in the middle of the murk and the mung in the sky,

[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.520]
you can see the vultures swirling around

[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.480]
right over this building,

[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.980]
and I'm sure we're on Sheridan Street.

[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.920]
Just waiting for this operation to go belly up,

[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.220]
so they can come swooping it and add it to their collection,

[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.860]
because that's now what it is in radio,

[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.460]
as you know, and I told you this a couple of years ago,

[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.100]
when they started this insanity at the FCC,

[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.760]
and they let everybody gobble up the radio station

[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.620]
to few companies, it's like collecting,

[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.060]
it's like collecting baseball cards.

[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.280]
We collect radio stations and TV stations,

[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.140]
and unless somebody gets their ass in gear upstairs,

[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.680]
when you have people that are telling you

[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.960]
that they've been owed money for eight months or nine months,

[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.320]
when you're hearing about these cart machines

[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.180]
so that the spots and promos on their,

[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.300]
woo, woo, woo, woo, woo,

[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.380]
see, I have to wonder about some of these other people

[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.400]
at work at this joint.

[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.360]
There's such a thing as pride,

[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.860]
I mean, granted, not everybody's got the same kind of clout,

[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.720]
can open up a big mouth,

[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.780]
but how long can you just keep coming in and working

[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.720]
for a goddamn paycheck and not say,

[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.680]
hey, you know what, you're just out like crap.

[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:36.760]
Am I right?

[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.160]
How long can you just fumble your way through life

[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.120]
without demanding just a little bit of excellence,

[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.620]
maybe not a lot of excellence,

[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.960]
but just a little goddamn bit, guys.

[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.400]
Bunch of whims.

[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.620]
They're the sports guys, they have bunch of whims,

[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.600]
like Al Goldstein said, a bunch of faggots.

[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.280]
That's a big club you moron.

[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.060]
Right on, Al, and quit eating so much,

[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.700]
which I can talk a lot about that,

[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.720]
too, about the eating business,

[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.140]
the eating business,

[00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.380]
about everybody you know,

[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.960]
like presenting you with food,

[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.520]
putting food in front of your face.

[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.580]
I guarantee, I predict right now,

[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.800]
I'll never see the first at March,

[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.740]
if the food thing doesn't stop.

[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.360]
And by the way, Mom, no lunch tomorrow, sweetheart.

[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.040]
Yeah, the food thing has got to stop,

[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:12.820]
or I'm gonna be dead.

[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.060]
And yes, Howard Climberg,

[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.340]
I did buy a bag of M&M's

[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.620]
if he rented the hockey game on the Tampa game Saturday,

[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.340]
and you wanna know why I bought a bag of M&M's?

[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.100]
Besides your week.

[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.960]
Besides being weak and hungry.

[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.400]
Three o'clock game, okay?

[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.200]
So I didn't really eat a lunch, which is a mistake.

[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.420]
We get there, and I get a weenie.

[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.040]
They don't have the polo sausage anymore,

[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.300]
which stunk and smelled real bad,

[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.400]
but they have weenies that stink and smell real bad.

[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.200]
Like maybe they once had Forsk in real recently,

[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.260]
and they weren't washed up.

[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.860]
Maybe there's a little pecorino in that weenie.

[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.360]
How come it is that at the stadium at P.P. Park,

[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.080]
a lot of the food, not all of it,

[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.540]
but a lot of food is pretty damn good.

[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:46.840]
And in the last few years,

[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:47.900]
they've had all kinds of stuff.

[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.720]
They not only have the Arrepa Queen over there,

[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.660]
but they got burgers,

[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.540]
and they got all kinds of deli sandwiches,

[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.980]
and they got all kinds of stuff over there.

[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.760]
But if the Miami Arena, I'm gonna tell you,

[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.000]
and I don't think that we can blame this one on Baldi there.

[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.380]
I don't think he has any control over it.

[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.840]
I think it's Mickey Ererson and those bastards

[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.260]
who must have some kind of incestuous deal

[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.420]
with some kind of grotesque food,

[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.300]
a concessionaire, or whatever they call him.

[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.260]
The food in the Miami Arena is unfit for human consumption.

[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.420]
And ordinarily, I have my diet soda, and that's it.

[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.900]
That's my, that's the extent of my imbibing

[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.900]
at the Miami Arena is a diet soda.

[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.540]
That's as dangerous as I'll get.

[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.560]
And I'm gonna tell you that, that winner that they put on that,

[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.360]
I'm gonna tell you something that if anybody ever would eat

[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.760]
one intentionally again, they must be desperate.

[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.820]
And the same starving Arab in the desert

[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.700]
who wouldn't buy the glass of water from Luan upstairs

[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.900]
would definitely not eat that winner.

[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.220]
Even if it were kosher, I'll guarantee you that right now.

[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.900]
The views expressed on the previous programs

[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.000]
are those of the hosts, guests, and collars,

[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.500]
and do not reflect those of the Beasley broadcast group.

[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.580]
It's staffed advertisers for agencies.
