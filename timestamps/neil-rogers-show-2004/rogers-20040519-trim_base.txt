[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.820]
I hear Harvey's green with Envy is what I'm hearing.

[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.500]
Yeah.

[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.380]
With an HD radio digital digital signal.

[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.920]
And who better than coming and speaking with an offense about drugs and current token

[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.300]
Thomas?

[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.120]
My heavy Ford Loner J.

[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.740]
I'm perhaps a total rookie or to get some real good stuff.

[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.820]
Good, you doing?

[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.560]
All right.

[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.700]
Shucks!

[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.940]
Hmm.

[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.940]
Hey.

[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.220]
There we go.

[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.540]
Hey y'all, my name is Franz.

[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.600]
From Eugene Thomas.

[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.140]
Friends of bushes and harmony for the Supreme Court.

[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.900]
And you know there's not some people's idea to think just of.

[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.320]
I smoked a little marijuana when I said college.

[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.540]
Yeah, they weren't that's it but I'm in joy.

[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.440]
Yeah, maybe you'll see guys out here.

[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.600]
I know remember y'all.

[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.880]
They don't think I'm fit to be on the Supreme Court.

[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.460]
Yeah, I got it much easier.

[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.320]
Let's do this quick and get out of here.

[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.540]
I want to sit y'all straight.

[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.480]
When I stop reviewing the law.

[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.480]
I don't just review the law.

[00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.920]
There we go.

[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.400]
I'll be token.

[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.260]
And I token to the east.

[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.180]
And I token to the west.

[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.000]
And I token why not look up Sandra Dayle Panna's best.

[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.540]
Oh right.

[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.360]
I'll be token.

[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.420]
Let's go for the bad one.

[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.200]
The rookie, come on.

[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.920]
It's a 10-0-2-5, 60 WQ Amboidies.

[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.460]
There's a speaker, the whole thing here.

[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.920]
By the way, the lights keep flickering in flash and like on a mic light and all of this.

[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.880]
It's a real disaster.

[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.800]
I notice it between Duff and Clarence.

[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.160]
They still can't get their ass together.

[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.380]
Oh, but I think we'll have that picture on our website.

[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.640]

[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.760]
Ask to ask.

[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.020]
Not with Jennifer Conley but with Duff and Clarence.

[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.240]
Ask to ask.

[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.800]
Raccoon.

[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.160]
We'll get a lot of hits on that.

[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.100]
Even rookie Williams never took as many hits as that.

[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.920]
It's going to be it anyway.

[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.920]
Todd Drek was in here for 25 minutes.

[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.900]
I want to announce to the world that he's the biggest hole I've ever met in my life.

[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.520]
Even Gary Sarner can't match up to him.

[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.760]
Although I understand that the partner is in crime is what I'm hearing.

[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.580]
I never realized until this day I was thought was Baudzini all along.

[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.260]
Huh?

[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.580]
Or was it Tate?

[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.800]
Tate?

[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.900]
What exactly is a pimp?

[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.520]
Oh, I see.

[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.960]
He was Baudzini all along.

[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.200]
Hey, by the way, what's he?

[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.680]
Nice suit.

[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.300]
Richard Conley, isn't he the actor to play to Baudzini?

[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.620]
Indeed.

[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.280]
He was good.

[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:09.860]
Yeah.

[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.560]
He looked like a real mobster.

[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.600]
He looked like the kind of guy you'd see at Runaway 84.

[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.840]
All right, Joe's.

[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.780]
Oh, and you haven't asked me to get you in.

[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.840]
No, I won't.

[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.540]
All right, I can't be bothered.

[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.820]
Okay.

[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.480]
When you're on your way to the direction here, where you're just a little guy, you eat that kind of amount of food anyway.

[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.740]
So that's our poll question today.

[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.180]
Who's the bigger poll?

[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.660]
Todd Drek or Gary Sarner?

[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.920]
No, that's not the poll, but it would be a tough choice, you know what?

[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.100]
I think it's the same person.

[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.940]
You ever see him in here at the same time?

[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.120]
No.

[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.660]

[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.840]
But when you get a Todd, the answer is no.

[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.100]
No.

[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.100]
Just forget about it.

[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.340]
Okay.

[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.480]
I don't want to do any accounts for Todd Drek.

[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.140]
In fact, didn't I say that to you a long time ago?

[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.680]
Yeah, you did.

[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680]
I can't be bothered with him.

[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.660]
He's a slime ball.

[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.340]
He's annoying.

[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.160]
He's irritating.

[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.940]
He's aggravating.

[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.080]
Everything he touches is like turns to Grek.

[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.280]
Yeah.

[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.020]
Always a big major song in a dance.

[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.320]
And you just saw 25 minutes.

[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.500]
I'm going to tell you, Sammy Davis Jr. would have been proud.

[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.240]
You have never seen a tap dance routine.

[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.060]
He was actually dancing around this.

[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.400]
You're mad.

[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.740]
But me?

[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.440]
They're not getting lost.

[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.220]
Go away, Todd.

[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.880]
Don't go away, man.

[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.520]
Just go away.

[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.780]
And by the way, hey, call a good man.

[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.460]
Oh, sorry.

[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.680]
I just don't like the guy.

[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.420]
I can't stand him.

[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080]
See how I'm too easy.

[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.720]
I'm going to start being a real hardass.

[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.420]
And then he goes out of this business about, oh, adults, 2550.

[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.740]
Where I thought our main demo on this radio station was men 2554.

[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.900]
Isn't that what we just got our bonus based on?

[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.220]
Yeah.

[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.580]
Isn't that what we always get our bonus?

[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.420]
Isn't that what everybody's bonus is based on?

[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.500]
And our target demo on a so-called sports and talking under team station is men.

[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.560]
2554.

[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.160]
Was that right?

[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.640]
Yeah.

[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.320]
And I don't know, but I hear Mo who's got pretty marginal ratings all the way around.

[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.580]
I'm listening.

[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.120]
Okay.

[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.880]
And he seems to have spots up the ass.

[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.200]
In fact, even he was like, does he rule all over again?

[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.840]
You know what he was saying this morning when I was coming to work?

[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.280]
We're just here like in between the spots.

[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.400]
He's starting to catch on.

[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.600]
Yeah.

[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.560]
Even an old codger like him, an old foggy like him.

[00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.740]
He's starting to catch on.

[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.820]
We're just filler between the spots.

[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.600]
That's all.

[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.980]
They got that thing.

[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.180]
And of course, they did the same thing.

[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.760]
The first team in N Greg Reed blames.

[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.080]
Oh, it must be Joe Rawls.

[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.960]
It must be Gildi.

[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.960]
It must be Defoe.

[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.300]
By the way, speak on Defoe.

[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.800]
That $850 WFTO with all their billboards might as well save that money.

[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.400]
Because they'd brought in this market.

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.360]
They have a big.

[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.100]
They didn't show it all again in that book.

[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.560]
None.

[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.000]
Zero.

[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.660]
Who do they have on besides Defoe?

[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.620]
Defoe and Defoe and Defoe.

[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.440]
I don't know.

[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.620]
You like I listen to it?

[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.120]
But if you're a savvy sports fan, though, you ought to put a bunch of buttons on $850 on your radio.

[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.220]
That's what Jim Sarny said.

[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.860]
Oh, really?

[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.740]
They do sports?

[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.420]
I don't know.

[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.100]
I have no idea.

[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.840]
I don't listen to it.

[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.200]
Why would I want to listen to it?

[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.660]
Who cares?

[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.800]
We already got that $1400.

[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.580]
Anybody listen to that?

[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.060]
Carl Banana's foster there who bought his way back on your ice.

[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.740]
Let's have a thousand sports stations in South Florida because that'll bring a lot more people to sports.

[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.220]
No question.

[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.180]
That's what Ray Perry said.

[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.220]
And he knows his crap, man.

[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.520]
He's a crap specialist.

[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.560]
Like most of Greg's friends, crap specialist.

[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.120]
Like Gary Sarny, for example.

[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.980]
He knows his crap.

[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.560]
Anyway, so Todd, the answer is, don't come in here before my show again.

[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.500]
I mean, you'd think that muffin clearance would have gotten him out of here, wouldn't you?

[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.200]
Would have dragged his ass out of here.

[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.000]
I don't want to see him.

[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.120]
I don't want to watch Rumpel Stills can hop it up and down like a banana in heat for 25 minutes.

[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.200]
Be from going to go on here and do a high rated big-paid show, which you'd be amazed at everybody in their brother listen to.

[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:32.220]
I'm discovering something very sad that I'm here, even more so than usual, because I'm finding I'm discovering I'm running into Jews for Bush.

[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.680]
And I find that very distressing.

[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.800]
I'm not talking about people who are supposed to be bright educated people.

[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.000]
Right.

[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.660]
And again, what it boils down to.

[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.240]
Who is that?

[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.740]
Is that somebody bothering you and ever again?

[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.360]
We're doing a very important radio show here now.

[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.180]
I can hear it all the way in here on the intercom.

[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.700]
Who is that?

[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.000]
Who was that?

[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.840]
That's the list.

[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.200]
The water Nazi, what did she want?

[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.900]
Sure, just confirming that, you know.

[00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.880]
We're not doing our spots, okay, Phyllis?

[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.920]
By the way, we're doing a show running air right now.

[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.480]
Okay, don't be doing no more intercom with George while he's supposed to be intercoursing away, okay?

[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.040]
Hey, this is business.

[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.420]
Remember the spots?

[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.440]
Oh, that's right.

[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.740]
Just give us the...

[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.320]
I forgot about that.

[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.920]
We're just the...

[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.600]
What are they just saying about the Jews for Bush?

[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.780]
Yeah, Jews for Bush.

[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.180]
Oh, and it comes back to people.

[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.680]
See, one thing all you people out there need to find out, okay?

[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.620]
Anybody already know this, but I just want to reinforce it in case you forgot.

[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.260]
That there's a whole group of Cubans who all I know is Cuba and Jews who all I know is Israel.

[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.520]
Do we live in Cuba?

[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.860]
No, no, no.

[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.480]
Do we live in Israel?

[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.820]
No.

[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.120]
No.

[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.120]
No.

[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.160]
No.

[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.660]
I'll always say in Bokers, you might consider you, you know, in parts of the day you figure you live in Cuba.

[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.840]
Right.

[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.340]
You wouldn't pour in Bokers, you live in Israel.

[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.800]
No.

[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.840]
But we don't live there.

[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.180]
And quite frankly, it's like I spent a lot of time in Toronto, but do I care about Canadian politics?

[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.580]
No.

[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.140]
Not at all.

[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.940]
Not in the least.

[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.540]
It's very boring to be honest with you.

[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.240]
And most of those people, Paul Martin is as boring as it gets in all of those people.

[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.660]
Remember John Defen Baker?

[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.060]
No.

[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.740]
He was like a dead man in the suit.

[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.920]
He was like a...

[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.960]
Don, I'm standing up.

[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.640]
Which ain't easy when you're a dead man.

[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.540]
But not necessarily.

[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.120]
So I don't care about any of those things.

[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.420]
I mean, whatever happened to America, why don't we care about what's going on here?

[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.000]
Be led down to garden path, this country being destroyed, your freedom's been taken away.

[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.140]
And people who otherwise had no excuse.

[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.980]
Well, you know, any president that's strong for Israel, well, what do I care about that?

[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.160]
Like Michael Moore said, give the Israelis and the Palestinians each an equal amount of weapons

[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.060]
and let them kill each other and find.

[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.180]
And then, you know, that's my road map.

[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.960]
That's a loot.

[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.920]
That's my road map.

[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.760]
But I'm being honest.

[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.560]
Have a good time and get out of our face.

[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.400]
Leave us alone already.

[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.000]
We'll see who's left.

[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.160]
And stop soaking us two and a half bucks a gallon of gas.

[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.100]
And you notice how the media manipulates this, too?

[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.260]
Well, you know, it just did for inflation back in 1973.

[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.080]
It was like that.

[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.260]
Nobody cares about that.

[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.880]
When somebody goes to the gas station and costs them 50, 60, 70 bucks to fill up their tank,

[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.040]
they don't want to hear stories about it just for inflation, my ass.

[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.400]
Okay.

[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.660]
They don't care about that.

[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.320]
That doesn't put any more money in their pocket.

[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.360]
All they know is that they're being raped at it.

[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.100]
And they're not too crazy about it.

[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.260]
Oh, and thank you for those low gas prices, Mr. President.

[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.560]
Thank you so much.

[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.480]
So, George had a very important hole yesterday, which we'll get to momentarily after we do the break,

[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.920]
because we are here for the spots.

[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.940]
Make no mistake about that.

[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.920]
Gary Sarner and Todd Dreck, they know that.

[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:15.820]
Yeah.

[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.720]
The two of them ought to be on death row together.

[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.680]
You know, in fact, who would you rather see in jail?

[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.640]
Martha Stewart or Gary Sarner and Todd Dreck?

[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.300]
They're like, chained together.

[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.040]
Oh, no question.

[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.480]
See, I mean, O.J. Simpson, he's playing golf.

[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.280]
You know, one of my, uh, somebody was telling me this the other day, and it's a very excellent

[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:30.600]
point.

[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.020]
O.J., he's playing golf.

[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.740]
He's walking around living a high life.

[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.340]
He's laughing up his, uh, sleeve up his ass at everybody.

[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.780]
He killed two people in cold blood.

[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.600]
Everybody knows it.

[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:39.920]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.660]
He's walking around free.

[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.580]
His water knows it.

[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.680]
Martha Stewart, the worst thing she ever did was maybe like, uh, a grace on passion.

[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.820]
She cooked a bad, to make a soup cake sometime.

[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.020]

[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.380]
Maybe she made a bad recipe.

[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.060]
And so she tried to do a little, a sneak little things you were doing.

[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.160]
No, you're turning things off.

[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:55.580]
Right.

[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.440]
Okay, so it was unethical.

[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.080]
She lied.

[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:58.740]
She was stupid.

[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.380]
But she belongs in jail, and O.J. Simpson is walking around for free.

[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.000]
And you tell me this is justice?

[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.860]
You tell me this is what America's all about, and you're worried about Cuba and Israel?

[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:09.760]
No.

[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.800]
I say to help with all the in-dubans.

[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.480]
That's what I say.

[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:12.800]
Right?

[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.000]
Both the varieties.

[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.200]
I'm tired of it.

[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.980]
My whole life, I heard that from my crazy Zionist father who luckily is rotting in the ground,

[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.580]
as I speak.

[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.620]
Israel, listen, and every time he would go there to live, he'd like come running back here with his tail between his ass.

[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.020]
How come?

[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.760]
Because it sucked, that's why.

[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:28.760]
Yeah.

[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.620]
The food there, I guess, is even worse than an Amsterdam, and that's quite an indictment.

[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:32.980]
Oh, wait.

[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.180]
Yeah, and at least an Amsterdam, you've got other choices.

[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.120]
You can eat other things.

[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.580]
But I mean, why would anybody in their right mind want to go there?

[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.220]
It's like, I mean, Nicholas Berg very sad, sad situation, but why did he go to Iraq to make a buck?

[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.200]
I understand that, but you know something, there's all kinds of places.

[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.780]
He could have built towers here, right?

[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.920]
He could have gone and peed on the IOD tower to have all kinds of problems with that thing that's rotting in the bay.

[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.860]
Hall of Merton and their subsidiaries are offering a lot of money.

[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.100]
I understand, but the fact of the matter is if you've got money.

[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.100]
How many brains at all if you value your life?

[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.800]
What did I tell you?

[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.360]
There are three places you don't go if you value your quality of life.

[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.760]
Number one is the Middle East.

[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.220]
Number two is Iraq.

[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.340]
Number three is South Florida.

[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.700]
That's all.

[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.360]
If you care about your quality of life and stay in life.

[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.240]
So yesterday I got the chance to see Boka.

[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.640]
You know what Boka looks like?

[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.700]
What's the last time you were in Boka?

[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.340]
A little while ago it looks the same.

[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.560]
Now it looks like lawns and swan-rack.

[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.040]
Yeah, looks like Tamarack.

[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:25.720]
Very boring.

[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.760]
What is the big deal with Boka?

[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.180]
It's not so fenced or is it is down here.

[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.220]
That's the point.

[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.200]
That's the point.

[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.920]
It's not fenced or in Tamarack.

[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.760]
That's trying to say there's no dark folks, okay?

[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.440]
That's, yeah.

[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.960]
That's what they like about it.

[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.260]
Who's they, all those old Jews that looked up there?

[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:46.820]
Those are them.

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.280]
See all you old Jews that are obsessed with Israel, quit moving away from where

[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.260]
the shfarts is, okay?

[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.240]
Because it's just, they keep following you around, you'll discover, okay?

[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.960]
And then the Cubans start moving in and then you don't know whether to scream or eat the

[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.360]
Tiktokas banana, okay?

[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.160]
So you just can't run.

[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.200]
You cannot hide.

[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.640]
You can keep moving to Boka.

[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:05.480]
You can move to Jupiter.

[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.400]
You can move to Stuart.

[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.220]
And they're still going to find it.

[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.240]
They'll work your asses.

[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:09.380]

[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:09.900]
They'll work your asses.

[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.040]
Unless you want to move to Israel.

[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.060]
Have a great time, okay?

[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.980]
We'll pray for you at the Wailing Wall.

[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.420]
Unless, of course, you happen to be a woman and we'll just throw rocks at you.

[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:17.940]
Big bricks.

[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.800]
Also, speaking of a big brick, how's Clarence Thomas doing?

[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.100]
12 minutes after 10 at 5, 60 at WQM.

[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.540]
You know, Vulm is not just your ordinary pedestrian TV, but it's high definition TV delivered

[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.760]
via satellite dish and HD receiver.

[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.220]
The picture is so superior to regular TV, it's like comparing the latest DVD to a scratchy

[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.040]
old piece of crap.

[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.400]
Vulm is the only entertainment system designed for high definition TV.

[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.440]
Vulm has got the most HD TV anywhere and provides all the equipment necessary to enjoy

[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.180]
the ultimate HD TV, whatever I said, HD TV experience, including the satellite dish,

[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.600]
HD receiver, and remote too.

[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.420]
And Vulm has got over 30 channels of HD programming so you can watch ESPN and high definition

[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:56.800]
too.

[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.180]
That's three times more channels than you get from cable.

[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.160]
And they've got all your other favorite channels like HD, MTV, even your local channels

[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.140]
too, such as they apologetically are.

[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:05.640]
They're weak.

[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.020]
Vulm has got over 120 channels, a great entertainment.

[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.040]
Vulm's even got exclusive channels of HD movies, music and sports.

[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.680]
Then you can't even get it all from your cable or satellite company.

[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.720]
So with Vulm, you've got everything you have now plus all these awesome high definition

[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.000]
channels as well, which makes your TV actually worth spending all that money on.

[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.020]
Call Vulm today for a limited time offer which ends May 31, which means you only got a couple

[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.480]
weeks left.

[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.820]
Call and find out about it.

Runs that a little holly.

[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.860]
Do we have to give you a big slip?

[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.720]
Are your bands over?

[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.100]
They got the never-scoot-y-racky strip?

[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.080]
And tracks.

[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.080]
Runs that a little holly.

[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.960]
You still have to explain what they did.

[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.940]
They thought it was funny to make a second human pyramid.

[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.440]
I think it's got a wacky.

[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.220]
What they did to those wackies?

[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.800]
Now it's only you just barely feel free.

[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.360]
It's back from our boys.

[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.600]
They made the presents break up.

[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.820]
What putting on makeup?

[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.360]
Do you want to tell a tell you a tale?

[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.140]
It's a bad way.

[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.440]
Runs that a little holly.

[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.400]
I'm listening.

[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.300]
Runs without a watcher, he's useless.

[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.860]
Runs that a little holly.

[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.440]
You might have to give you a big slip.

[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.240]
Runs that a little holly.

[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.700]
Runs that a little holly.

[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.500]
Runs that a little holly.

[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.980]
Runs that a little holly.

[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.080]
Runs that a little holly.

[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:45.640]
Return that a little можете-do.

[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:52.000]
Runs that 50 rural-beyouth type of phrase.

[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.000]

[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.220]
It's not a good idea for them.

[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.540]
You two didn't Thursday and then like in the summertime. It's just the other way around

[00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:02.020]
Mix and match right mix and right so anyway George Framber. Where did you get this picture? Oh?

[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:08.940]
It's all over the internet. It was on the Yahoo most frequently viewed in the emailed photos John carries horse-faced daughter

[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.480]
Alexandra and no wonder we haven't seen her before

[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.180]
Now I guess he didn't learn from John Howard Dean's mistake of letting his me a swifer

[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:23.680]
Get photographed Judy Dean Dr. Judy Dean. I mean apparently Alexander is a director and is that Alexander?

[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.240]
I think you're right the first time Alexander with a boob. Yeah, well if we didn't know better if we didn't see better

[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.480]
I wondered well I could have been a paste on

[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.580]
Because she looks a little pasty to me. Yeah, and anyway, she's wearing like a see-through gown and

[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.480]
There it is right there on our website. There's a and of course see I

[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:49.000]
Still say the same thing about that. I've always said the booby guys who just that's all they care about our boobs

[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.420]
They don't really care what's attached to that's very sad to me. It's like the penis people. It's the same thing, you know no matter what's the title. Oh my god look at that

[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.400]
Look what

[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:01.860]
That

[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.020]
When you start Todd's recognize him. She's like a walking will anyway

[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:13.000]
So there she is in all her glory and she is just basically I she had you ever seen her in Judy Dean together?

[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.780]
I think it's the same face no, although she looks just like her dad boy. Just stick a pair on him and there it is

[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.980]
Skaring around with Carrie so she inspired the poll

[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.820]
All about who's got the hottest daughter hotter daughter

[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.840]
The hotter daughter. Yeah, kind of rhymes

[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.680]
Anyway, here's the pull result from yesterday. He's got the hottest daughter. I don't care what you called it

[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.200]
And she actually got votes. I don't get my wife. It's why I put the picture there

[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.380]
Yeah, the movie he got the movie prize all the rest of the money. He's got big boobies

[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.900]
You can actually see one. I mean like all what kind of crap is this guy that's running for present is his daughters

[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:56.680]
I wonder why would like her boobs sticking out was within friends. Oh, I see well. We know about them. That's the old Europe by the way

[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.960]
Who has the hottest daughter stevy Tyler 343 now there's no question about that

[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:07.680]
Even if you don't like eros myth or him or his lips are in these things. He has got a very very fine looking daughter

[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.760]
John void

[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.660]
I don't know whose daughter is Angelina Jolie. I never knew that. Oh, yeah, I thought I remember the tag of the law

[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.640]
He was calling her crazy. Oh, yeah, that's confident. She's all mad

[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.140]
Jennifer Anderson

[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.920]
That makes sense Paul Servino 93. He's got a daughter Mira

[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.380]
Naomi Judd 86

[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:37.940]
Honestly, yeah

[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:43.160]
George W. Bush 71. Are you must have voted for him because you had a hot nose to drunk daughters?

[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:49.460]
He's not yet had a duvet. No, I did not John Kerry 55 whose daughter's name is Alexander and she ain't so great

[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.320]

[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:56.680]
God

[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.020]
She I'm telling you she is the same person as Judy Dean. Maybe they just swapped wives or something

[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.220]
Or

[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.900]
Daughters or I don't know what she is anyway. She's a pathetic John Barrymore 46

[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.220]

Yeah, I'm gonna dig in there you go same kind of thing and she's not even hot for a dyke

[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.980]
I mean she's very dykey looking but I mean she's more spaced. Yeah. Yeah, in fact

[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.000]
She's got a very similar face to Alexander a Kerry

[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.220]
Bill Clinton

[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.080]
I don't get it. I'm gonna go give Todd record kiss. I can't believe this Bill Clinton 37

[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.860]
Are you people out of your mind or what? Wow?

[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.460]
Chelsea Clinton is hot

[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.240]
But again keep in mind these people are the internet proud

[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:52.460]
So you're the ones that are surfing that looking for a breast for a nipple for oh, it's a body part

[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:56.520]
It might actually have been on something that was alive once and blind people can vote on that poll too

[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.180]
Yeah, oh, I'm sure that the Batavia Mike probably voted on there too. He probably tapped it out

[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.760]
My hand at all E32

[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.340]

Estacia I see Clint Eastwood 30 how may be a third man

[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:26.340]
Eastwood is daughter is Allison and she's beautiful Henry find 25 by now see they don't hold it against 10 or a James

[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.140]
She in her day and even how she don't look that bad right? She held up nice and in fact

[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.200]
I guarantee she looked a hell of a lot better than to be Dean

[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.280]
Whatever I carry whatever name is Alexander Ingrid Bergman 19

[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.700]

[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.500]
Yeah, boys this had to be a joke. Maybe they just aren't a lot of entertainers with great-looking daughters

[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.760]
Lionel Richie 14

[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:11.460]
Nicole and she's adopted and she's ugly but whatever well, but she's now

[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.680]
Knackin cool 13 Natalie Cole she ever stole a freight train. She's way down to bottom list

[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.560]
That's probably because she's dark and Frank Zappaton whose daughter Moon unit

[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.380]
really ugly looks like a good example looks like he did which ain't took the other horse face

[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.840]
I don't understand these people maybe they like horsey face or maybe they like horsey

[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.500]
You know back home something. I don't know horsey sauce

[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:37.720]
So almost 16 hundred votes on air so a staggering pool George really came up with a jackpot there

[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.300]
Thanks, of course to that picture of Alexander Kerry the great

[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.500]
Wow, wow, you think he looks bad man. Oh, man. Maybe that's why they let the picture out

[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.100]
Maybe you think he looks frightening take a look at his daughter. You'd look like that too if you had a daughter look like that

[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.060]
That's why help him campaign apparently they like that moly

[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.960]
Where's that is that is that in here the Howard Dean thing the Howard Dean's wife?

[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.680]

No, it's not in there. I gotta leave yeah, but I gotta leave some place in this so I want to play because you don't have any of it

[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.060]
And since we're only allowed to play a few bits with the new rules in place

[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:28.140]
And these are bush people I should point out are actually justifying well, you know, maybe that's not such a bad idea of clamping down on what you

[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:35.180]
Ice holes can say and well the fact that I play that sales people are ice holes thing that inspired me that that's that adequate for me

[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:40.320]
It's that are trying to come up with something like spaz hola. Yeah, ice holes. What's wrong with that? You ever use one?

[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.200]
I've used a nice pick in fact. I look like what you call Alexander's face as a matter of fact ice pick I say

[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.480]

[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.080]
Hey.

[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.640]
Edwards, Clarkson, Perry.

[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.080]
It's a better than who he married.

[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.960]
A common dress is what the doctor needs.

[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:31.320]
The hopeful next-first lady should think twice before display.

[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.020]
Perfect foe may gums and orcd.

[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.140]
Here's the main.

[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.600]
Howard D.

[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:40.680]
Is right.

[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:41.920]
All aboard.

[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:42.540]
All aboard.

[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.120]
See.

[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.220]
Washington DC.

[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.580]
Howard D.

[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.260]
The strong.

[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.020]
All right.

[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.340]
P31560.

[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.840]
We got the mad dog at two of the Humper.

[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.840]
The Hebrew Hammer is four in a studio in the last.

[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.580]
Marlon's on deck.

[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:57.860]
630.

[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.140]
Astero's at the Marlon's.

[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.180]
Boy, they just can't beat Houston.

[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.720]
Man, they got pounded nine two last night.

[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.060]
They'll try to get it tonight at the estate.

[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.420]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.160]

[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:21.220]

[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.240]

[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.240]

[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.240]

[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.240]

[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.240]

[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.240]

[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.240]

[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:21.300]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:21.460]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.280]

They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.440]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.020]

They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.120]

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.120]

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.120]

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.120]

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.120]

[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.380]

They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:19.960]

[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:19.960]

[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:19.960]

[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:20.280]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:20.360]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:20.440]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:20.440]

[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:20.680]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.240]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.580]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.140]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.020]

They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:33.980]
They'll get it tonight at the Marlon's.

[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.260]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.920]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.540]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.360]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:43.520]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:43.700]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:43.980]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:43.980]

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:43.980]

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:43.980]

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:43.980]

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:43.980]

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:43.980]

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:43.980]

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:43.980]

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:43.980]

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:43.980]

[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.000]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.080]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.580]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.680]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.000]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.380]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.740]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.320]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.040]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.600]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.380]
He doesn't hurt.

[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.440]
All righty then.

[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.040]
Good pull.

[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.120]
I was inspired by Alexander of the grade.

[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.500]
I got 20.

[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.160]
20 what?

[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:11.400]
20 what?

[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:11.600]
Names.

[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:12.020]
Oh.

[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.560]
I got.

[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]
Who was the obvious big name female?

[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.180]
Now do we consider her to be a big name because she's

[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:19.700]
Carrie's daughter?

[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.020]
I mean, I didn't say that.

[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.400]
We never heard of her until I saw that.

[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.240]
So we can't put her on her.

[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.300]
How about you, Dr. Judy Dean?

[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:27.700]
Okay.

[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.220]
We heard her.

[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.180]
We saw her.

[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.560]
Which of course was the beginning.

[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.120]
That was not just that was the beginning and the end of the end.

[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.160]
Hey Eric, I can't add until you change this thing.

[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.620]
Just relax.

[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.180]
Okay.

[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.040]
I don't expect to do like instantly.

[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.900]
He's probably like, you know, probably dropped his breakfast

[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.380]
burritos all over the floor now running to his keyboard.

[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.100]
Oh, no.

[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.600]
You know, got to make a change on her.

[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.420]
But we only had one name on her anyway.

[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.300]
So it's not like he had to do a bubble up for her.

[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.540]
You're going to vote for who Tony Randall is the obvious.

[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:54.920]
Big name female.

[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.540]
It's still on there.

[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.020]
Oh.

[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.640]
No, I know it because he hasn't changed it yet.

[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:00.540]
Would you just cut him a little bit of slack?

[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.240]
Roberta, slack button.

[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.420]
Man, no, you're not.

[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.920]
You're just picking on poor Eric.

[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:05.500]
I would never.

[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:05.620]
I would never.

[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.320]
No wonder he is so neurotic and acts like that.

[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.180]
I love Eric.

[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.760]
And you know what I mean by acts like that.

[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.220]
Whoa.

[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.940]
Anyway, there's the poll Eric.

[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.860]
Who is the ugliest, I was sure hope he's listening in.

[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.320]
Has internet connection all up and everything.

[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.520]
Who is the ugliest big name female?

[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.320]
Leon Friday will do.

[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.580]
Who is the ugliest big name male?

[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.600]
Which does not include me and Hank in the talk.

[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.380]
Big name.

[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.780]
That we're, we're small potatoes.

[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.260]
We can plenty of opportunity to take shots of us on the poll.

[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.360]
You know, all the time.

[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.240]
Think a little bit bigger, a little more popular, a little more well known.

[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.880]
Than all of us ugly goofballs here on this station.

[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.680]
And believe you are, we are ugly.

[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.820]
Is there anybody who works on this, I mean.

[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.540]
No, really.

[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.140]
We got a bunch of ugly people here, right?

[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:46.780]
On the ear.

[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:48.200]
Oh yeah.

[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.460]
I'm trying to think.

[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.080]
Think of somebody that looks like almost human.

[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.580]
Like, well you wouldn't agree but Joe Rose looks almost human.

[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.080]
Blockhead?

[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:57.780]
No, it is not.

[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.240]
Most guys don't have a head that's four times bigger than the rest of the people.

[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.480]
They're body size not with staining.

[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.640]
Facially he looks all the parts from the right place.

[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.340]
Especially since I'm the one and I get ready for it in the gap tooth since I got him to

[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.080]
like you're rid of that hole in his teeth.

[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.680]
He had the condolese a gap.

[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.780]
Of course, he's got a gap in her teeth and one on her leg.

[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.000]
That's another story.

[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:22.300]
But Joe had the gap and I said if you're going to be on TV on Channel 6 there, Joe, I'm sorry on NBC6, excuse me.

[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.920]
You got to like look like a man.

[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.660]
You looked at me.

[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:26.720]
What's that?

[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.180]
You got to look like a real human being.

[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.260]
Like some dumb jack.

[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.020]
And so he went to like a real dentist or something.

[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.060]
And he got his teeth straight.

[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.900]
He got whatever they do.

[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.000]
You know, crowns and these things.

[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.920]
I said this little queen knows about crowns.

[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:43.420]
Believe you me.

[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.940]
I wear one on the throne all the time.

[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.920]
So Joe Rose, yeah, I guess compared to anybody else.

[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:48.580]
He looks almost human.

[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.680]
Gildi of course looks like, he looks like Rapunzel.

[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:52.600]
Gildi.

[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:53.820]
Doesn't he?

[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.960]
He's got a long wand here.

[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.360]
Maybe I don't know.

[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:57.500]
I don't know.

[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.860]
I'm saying it looks like Rapunzel but glasses on.

[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:00.640]
I don't understand.

[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.160]
Who is the ugliest big name female?

[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.580]
Dr. Judy Dean.

[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.500]
Rosie O'Donnell.

[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.560]
Let's go up with the obvious.

[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.840]
Just a couple here.

[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.260]
Because you know, once we start building these pools, you get pole buildings boring.

[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.140]
Pole building is boring.

[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:14.840]
Show's boring.

[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.520]
And we get him.

[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.600]
Who's obviously got absolutely not even a semblance of a life.

[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.140]
And of course we always enjoy hearing his inanities.

[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.460]
Almost as much as,

[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.640]
Kamba and Maidikon.

[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.940]
We haven't heard from him in quite a while.

[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:27.980]
Maybe he's busy.

[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.500]
I got the winner I think.

[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:30.080]
Okay.

[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.320]
Barbara Strise and

[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.420]
Oh, the ugliest big name for just because she's cross-eyed.

[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.580]
Christy Krugger's cross.

[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.860]
You don't think I'm just because.

[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.660]
Because she's got the biggest nose, bigger than five other people.

[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.920]
I'm just putting the labs on her.

[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.680]
Don't know who it is.

[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:44.880]
Oh, and look at this.

[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:45.640]
Here's the a phony.

[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.220]
Look at that.

[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.740]
Phony little, here's little Jerry with a squiggly writing whose peep today and tomorrow

[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.680]
he'll be 80 and there's a Friday he'll be somebody else.

[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:54.860]
Get lost.

[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:56.560]
Don't read it.

[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.260]
No interest.

[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:57.640]
Whatever.

[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.040]
Okay.

[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.620]
And thanks for listening every single minute of every single day to the world famous New

[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.240]
Roger show.

[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.180]
See, this is what really cracks me up about the chronics along with the fact that they have no life.

[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:06.740]
I have no life.

[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.120]
No life.

[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.820]
Is for all other bifsy and belly aching, this is their life.

[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.800]
As Ralph Edwards would say, this is your life.

[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.320]
Absolutely.

[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.080]
This is it.

[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.220]
Kiss the radio.

[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:16.520]
Okay.

[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.320]
Reach right over and put your lips on it.

[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.260]
And the radio too will give it a big kiss.

[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.840]
We ought to be kissed.

[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.640]
Forget that country that knows picking crap they play on our FM.

[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.200]
We ought to be the big kiss.

[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.560]
I want to buy it turned into FM.

[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.020]
Especially now because this station is all you got left.

[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.540]
Is there any other English language station that anybody lives to?

[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:33.820]
No.

[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.680]
That isn't that's got anybody like local and no.

[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.040]
I mean, don't tell me IOD that they have one show with somebody local on.

[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:40.240]
No.

[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:41.980]
It's all piped in crap.

[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.640]
It's all cheap channel garbage.

[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.780]
We could change kiss country.

[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.380]
You can hear in the 75,000 different markets.

[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:47.680]
Okay.

[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.100]
The same right wing crap, the same propaganda, the same.

[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.300]
Look, look, look, look, look, all that crap.

[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.560]
So this is it.

[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.640]
This is all you got left which isn't saying much but we are it.

[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.680]
I think it's about time that people in this market start realizing that.

[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.380]
This is all you got.

[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.360]
It may not be much.

[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.000]
Especially at certain times today.

[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:05.520]
Absolutely.

[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.440]
You're early in the morning.

[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.760]
But this is all you got.

[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.480]
See if it are gathered around your radio.

[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.100]
It's like, because someday you'll be saying a couple of years down the road.

[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.080]
Oh, gee.

[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.920]
I remember when we actually had a station where there were some people that we, you know,

[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.760]
we knew who they were and they knew us and they, you know, they knew the difference between sunrise,

[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.180]
Boulevard and, uh, and, uh, candle drives.

[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.760]
I was dairy road and candle drive.

[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.500]
And glades road and bokeh.

[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.920]
Ah, sitting in bokeh looks just like Tamarack.

[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.200]
A little more pristine.

[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.180]
No, no.

[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.240]
Well, no, actually, I mean, there are some parts of it.

[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.740]
If you go behind some of the big office buildings and there are trees and wooden areas and it's beautiful.

[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.620]
It's, but, but who else sees that?

[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.040]
Who the hell spends the time running around behind office buildings, purfs?

[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:50.940]
Yeah.

[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.440]
And other people are trying to kill some time.

[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.780]
But other than that, when you drive through there, when you're in, and by the way,

[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.580]
thanks to my friend Ken Halpern at National Limbo, he's, he's great.

[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.000]
It's better what you said at one time.

[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:01.500]
Huh?

[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.460]
Well, don't you remember that he had that no speaking English, bro.

[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.060]
I wasn't his father with that silly brother.

[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.140]
Where we go?

[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.240]
Where we are going, you know, and that was somebody else.

[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:10.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.240]
I'm sorry.

[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.980]
I was in a situation and I was the victim of it.

[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:13.880]
So don't be saying that.

[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.660]
Now Ken is great.

[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:20.920]
And I really appreciate it because I certainly would want to have to drive to Boka by myself and get lost and like, oh,

[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.640]
dude, why do people live in Boka who work in databroward?

[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.260]
Why?

[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.300]
Some people live further and still work here.

[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.460]
Oh, it's something else I don't let me forget to talk about today.

[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.660]
The, um, hard rock casino.

[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:40.160]
Your close personal friend, Joe Castello called me at home two nights ago as a matter of fact.

[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.180]
Don't bother me, Joe.

[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:41.820]
You're a great guy.

[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.040]
I love you, but don't bug me.

[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:43.640]
Get on my nerves.

[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.160]
And what?

[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:45.760]
Nothing?

[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.260]
No, he does.

[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:52.260]
He can get some of my nerves because if I had something to tell him, if I could offer him any more assistance than I already have,

[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.740]
I would be more than delighted to do it.

[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.040]
I can't do anything for him.

[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.320]
I have no influence here over what they put on the air or don't.

[00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:58.920]
None.

[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.100]
They're phone-ly.

[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:00.600]
Yeah.

[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:07.820]
So, but anyway, he was telling me about that place, about how it's just jam-packed, which I did mention that the other day about driving through there with the, uh, in the limo.

[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.300]
Coming back from the airport, you couldn't buy a parking spot there for a million dollars.

[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:17.740]
And evidently at night time, it's not just the old blue hairs that you have at the other similar old place in all the, uh, the jury entries.

[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.600]
There's like a lot of young people living and breathing people in there looking for something to do for a good time.

[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.120]
Good for them.

[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:28.180]
And they don't have like your real honest-to-goodness slots with the, uh, you know, the spinning, but you've got, you push a button and does the same thing.

[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.740]
Here is what he said.

[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.800]
And how can a guy like him be afforded to be at the hard rock casino anyway?

[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.000]
That the way it always goes must be gambled on all the rights he wanted.

[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.120]
That's right.

[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.520]
It's from that spiffy ad agencies, you were.

[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.520]
That's just a joke, you need to just relax.

[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.820]
So, can't tell Joe don't call me anymore.

[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.340]
19 before 11 at 5, 60 WQAM.

[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.700]
Oh, I guess who we saw this morning, I'll give you one clue.

[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:52.080]
CM.

[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:53.400]
Yeah.

[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.980]
Josh Cord is stuck his head in the door there.

[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:56.360]
CM.

[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.320]
We closed it real fast.

[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.740]
Now his head looks like a...

[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.460]
Anyway, lobster fest is back at the Emerald Coast.

[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.280]
If you've never been there, you're missing out on a real treat, man.

[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.060]
It's not just a meal.

[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:05.860]
It's a feast.

[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.720]
It's for...you don't have to be fat when you go in, but you probably will be on a way out.

[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.260]
The service is great and the food is unbeatable.

[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.280]
Everything is fresh, delicious.

[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.980]
They don't use any crap, no MSG.

[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.980]
No cornstarch, they cook everything with only cholesterol for your oils.

[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.800]
They've got six different kinds of soups.

[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:25.400]
Dozens of delicious mouthwatering entries like New York strip made order and their sizzling Asian grill along with that new Hunan fish.

[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:32.500]
Main lobster, thermometer, starleters, Jonah Crab, oysters on a half shell, hand carb, primary of their brand new Thai specialties.

[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.240]
And they promote healthy living like I said with no crap, too.

[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.500]
You'll never walk out of there with a headache.

[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:41.740]
The buffet features a full salad bar, full Chinese food line up, the brand new sushi bar, and for a CM cocktail.

[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:42.720]
What the hell was that?

[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.540]
Do you hear that?

[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.480]
Something like somebody from Power 96 is about slam...

[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.960]
Maybe somebody used Todd Wreck as like a ramming rod.

[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:56.140]
In the Waldher, I'm serious, somebody like salesperson just got like rammed right through the wall over there.

[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.940]
Speaking of CM, anyway.

[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.800]
And if you have any room into all of this stuff, they got a great dessert station, too.

[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:02.800]
So pace yourself.

[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.880]
Just spend a couple hours there.

[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:10.680]
They got bells and waffles and pies and cakes, pastries, ice cream with all your favorite toppings, even fresh food.

[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.480]
What an ending to a gigantic pickout.

[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.460]
Three emerald coast locations, Pemberpine, Sonny Oz and Sunrise.

[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.980]
Take the whole family bookie next business luncheon right now.

[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.660]
Zagat restaurant reviews votes them number one in WSVN news.

[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.400]
Number one is settled as best Asian buffet.

[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:23.920]
You'll agree.

[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.180]
It is sensational.

[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.200]
Call them for our reservation information at 954-5723822.

[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:36.680]
CM, 954-5723822 for information on the world famous unbeatable emerald coast Chinese buffet.

[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.200]
I am all.

[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.020]
This is for 2020.

[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.040]
You way up.

[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.900]
Soon it's the movie we've all been waiting for.

[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.020]
Pratt Pee.

[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.300]
As a gladiator.

[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.660]
It's Troy.

[00:36:52.060 --> 00:37:01.740]
The classic story of, uh, well, it's based on the epic poem by O who cares that Pratt Pee and a gladiator have been trove.

[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.020]
I am Achilles.

[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.560]
And now we must engage in hot, sweaty, man-on-man combat action.

[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:09.700]
Yard!

[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.600]
Listen to what the critics are saying about Troy.

[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.960]
Rex Reed calls it the field myself hit of the summer.

[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:23.720]
Rex Reed says, pass me the Trojan, honey, and in the words of Rex Reed, if you see only one.

[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.060]
Homo, a gladiator movie this year.

[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.420]
See, Troy.

[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.920]
Troubles and attack from the rear.

[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:38.400]
If muscular men in leather skirts are your Achilles heel, then pass to a theater near you to see...

[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.140]
Try it, Pitt!

[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.460]
As you always wanted to see him in...

[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:42.860]
Troy!

[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.220]
Troy's made it hard for...

[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:46.820]
uhhhhhhhh.

[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:48.800]
Uhhhhhhhh.

[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:48.800]

[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.780]
I'm desperate people out there, I guess.

[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.100]
I'm 9.48.5060W dem.

[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.680]
Six votes on a pool.

[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.880]
Us because we only got a couple of names on it.

[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.900]
Who is the ugliest big name female, especially inspired by uh...

[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.600]
Jon Kare is Mia's daughter, there yesterday.

[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.840]
Alexander the Great.

[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.880]
Rosie O'Donnell 3, Barbara Streisand 2, Dr. Judy Dean 1.

[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.820]
Got some more names here for you, Monica Lewinsky.

[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.180]
She is nasty. She is a cow.

[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.400]
Come on, Baba, you can do better than that.

[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:18.920]
Sandra Bernhardt tied.

[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.720]
Now you see, this is the way to try to do like it,

[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.860]
but I'm not going to put the other one on there.

[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:24.960]
One, who is the ugliest, big name female?

[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.880]
Not name a bunch of ugly people, okay?

[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.760]
Get with it. We're going to start really laying down the law

[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.520]
on this show, aren't we?

[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:30.880]
No.

[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.020]
Yes, we are. Here's one that says George picked my...

[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.480]
First choice, cross-eyed Barbara Streisand,

[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.520]
but my second choice is, share.

[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.600]
That's a good choice. She's big name.

[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.000]
She's big. She looks daiki.

[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.080]
She got a bull-dike daughter, and she's a gross.

[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.740]
Of course, she also is 85 years old.

[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.700]
She didn't look too bad for 85.

[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.620]
No, it's the blood of young virgin she drinks.

[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.880]
Specialist Jeremy Sivitz on Wednesday

[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.640]
played a guilty, decriminal charges in the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal

[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.560]
that was sentenced to one year confinement this morning.

[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.600]
His sentence by a special court-martial judge includes,

[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.920]
discharge for bad conduct and demotion.

[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.100]
Sivitz put it in the guilty to constern...

[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.960]
You know, what I'm discovering is I talk to various people around town,

[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.420]
is that the American people have no idea what's going on in the world.

[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:14.480]
They get dirty.

[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.140]
They find out what's happening in the world in little snippets.

[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.280]
You know, they see a headline, or they hear somebody saying,

[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.440]
oh gee, they decapitated our guy,

[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.860]
and all we're doing is putting a few hoods over the heads of somebody

[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.900]
Iraqi, bruised, or a g,

[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.000]
how come they spend so much time talking about that

[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.760]
and having these hearings?

[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:28.760]
These people who were there.

[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:29.220]
Yeah.

[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.960]
How come they have any hearings going on?

[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.060]
Where they're like brutal and decapitated in this guy.

[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.020]
Of course, we should be surprised at that, I guess,

[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.360]
because they blew those planes, they flew into those buildings,

[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.020]
and killed thousands of innocent people.

[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.880]
So it's like some big surprise that they decapitated people.

[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.460]
And Saudi Arabia, they decapitated people all the time.

[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.240]
Every day.

[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:46.600]
Right.

[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.060]
Because they're so much of barbarians in Saudi Arabia.

[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.580]
And of course, come to find out that the very latest car bomber

[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.100]
is another Saudi national.

[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.380]
Saudi Arabia is the chigger in the woodpie,

[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.020]
and the sandpie.

[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.380]
Right. They're not civilized like us.

[00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.400]
Right.

[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.380]
We kill people lightly like Mardi Pai thai.

[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:01.740]
I see.

[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.200]
They're like bombs all over the town.

[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:03.380]

[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.060]
Although, civets play a girl that can conspiracy

[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.040]
to maltreat subordinates or detainees.

[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.740]
They were watching a beauty for willfully family protecting

[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.520]
detainees from abuse.

[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.320]
Cruelty and maltreatment and maltreatment of detainees.

[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.860]
Civets 24 of Heinzmann, Pennsylvania,

[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:16.620]
is that Heinzmann?

[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:17.560]
I don't know what I don't care.

[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.080]
Had to present evidence to the judge of his guilty plea.

[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.580]
Pennsylvania, other than Philly, is a pretty schlocky place.

[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.240]
Ever been in Pennsylvania?

[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.020]
No, not ever.

[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:26.600]
Don't.

[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.420]
Philly is okay.

[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.000]
I mean, there are a lot of nasty people there.

[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.960]
I mean, there are sports fans, especially obnoxious.

[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.340]
But who, and then since you don't care about that,

[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:33.800]
you wouldn't mind.

[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.400]
Philly is all right.

[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.020]
Pretty, pretty, but it's okay.

[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.520]
And then you get on the school kill expressway,

[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:39.540]
and you can't get off it.

[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.600]
And as always, it's...

[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.420]
You ever see an expressway that goes through the heart of the city

[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.440]
and there's no way to get off, so to speak.

[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.900]
Anyway, after entering, we got bugs in here.

[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:50.700]
Oh, really?

[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.560]
Let's get our good friends from alternative management.

[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.460]
Steve over there.

[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.760]
Let's get them in here.

[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.560]
We got a little bug spline around here.

[00:40:59.580 --> 00:40:59.580]

[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.780]
Kind of crap is that?

[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:02.440]
Typical?

[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:03.500]
Oh, brother.

[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.160]
I don't have any bugs in my studio in Toronto,

[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.280]
or in my apartment.

[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.820]
Because I'm not a slob.

[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.020]
I made a little bug a hell of a slob,

[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.580]
which is fine with me, because I don't care about that.

[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.180]
But at least I keep my place clean.

[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.500]
I have a little bug spline all around here.

[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:17.620]
They live here.

[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.280]
They hate me.

[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.500]
I think what this place needs, if you're part of the expression,

[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.540]
is an exterminator.

[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.560]
Starting in the sales department would be good.

[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.040]
Yeah.

[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.460]
I don't want to mention no names, Gary or Todd.

[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:33.960]
Anyway, civets gave explicit details of abuses he said took place in November 8th,

[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.340]
including six or seven other soldiers, including beatings,

[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.500]
and positioning the prisoners in sexual positions.

[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.620]
The identify PFC Linda, England, your girlfriend,

[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:45.360]
seen him in the photos as pointing to the generals of one detainee and laughing.

[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.320]
At times, civets became emotional by describing two brutal abuses

[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.960]
he said involved specialist Charles Granger.

[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.040]
A total of seven U.S. soldiers have been accused,

[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.600]
the Audi Audi, and the grain are discharged with conspiracy to maltreat prisoners.

[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.080]
Their election and duty for allowing prisoners to be maltreated,

[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.320]
cruelty and maltreatment, maltreatment of prisoners,

[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.280]
assault of prisoners, committing a decent act,

[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.460]
adultery and obstructive justice, all of these things.

[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.800]
But then again, why they make such a big fuss about this when,

[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.560]
and this is why the American people are so stupid.

[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.240]
They don't read books, they don't read newspapers,

[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.000]
then they don't even watch a whole newscast, such as it is.

[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.880]
They see like little headlines,

[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.160]
and that's why these polls mean nothing.

[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.700]
Polls don't mean it.

[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.380]
I mean, the poll results are based on lack of information,

[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.680]
the lack of knowing anything, as opposed to, you know,

[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.440]
and even in spite of that, now Bush's numbers are dropping like a rock,

[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.160]
like a boulder.

[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.800]
Because finally, if they're putting, well,

[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.880]
this head lying together over here and this one over there,

[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.460]
and maybe things aren't going so great.

[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.040]
Maybe they actually lied to us, and Rumsfeld said,

[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.520]
you know that seren gas from the other day?

[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.400]
Well, he don't think it's seren gas.

[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.260]
He said, in fact, he thought it was more like serendipity.

[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:48.960]
Stupidity do.

[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:49.820]
And that's what it was.

[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.520]
Stupidity do.

[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.340]
Yeah, just a jar of it.

[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.700]
And they shmurred it all over the missiles.

[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.960]
They shmurred some stupidity do.

[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.460]
And then the mustard gas, if time to find out,

[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.100]
one even like grape poop on it, was just the cheap branches mustard.

[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.840]
It was like a generic public spranderson.

[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.720]
Who is the obvious big name female?

[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.780]
That's our poll question today.

[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.920]
Let's get with it here, okay?

[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:11.920]
Rosio Donald 16, Sandra Bernhard 15, Barbara Streisand 6,

[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.100]
Dr. Judy Dean, a real measukite, if there ever was one, too.

[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.340]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.240]
She ain't good for Israel.

[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.100]
She ain't good for the human race.

[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.760]
Sherers got one and Monica don't have any out of our first 40 names.

[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.200]
Okay, let's get this list built.

[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:27.680]
Okay, let's do some poll building, because poll building is maybe boring,

[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.620]
but it's time consuming and they love it.

[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:30.740]
Sure, kills four hours.

[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.620]
What you did yesterday, you had to, you built it, right?

[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:32.960]

[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.540]
Built that poll.

[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.220]
Steve Tyler and his daughter were right there on top.

[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.340]
So to speak, top of the pile.

[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.820]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.040]
I might just do the whole show on Gary Sarner and Todd Dreck.

[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.300]
I might just do that, although it's boring to the audience.

[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.260]
But I just cannot deal with those kind of people,

[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.940]
with these phonies, with these fakers, with these BS artists.

[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.640]
Don't come in here bothering me with your BS, okay Todd?

[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:58.480]
I don't want to see you.

[00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.600]
I don't want to smell you.

[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.860]
I don't want to do your accounts.

[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.040]
I don't want nothing to do with you.

[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.680]
And by the way, say, how did the Collagen Man while you're at it?

[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:06.180]
You idiot.

[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:07.320]
See that?

[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.660]
Well, that's all we need to know.

[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.540]
That's a long time ago.

[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.680]
That's all we need to know about him.

[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.020]
When he reared his ugly rear in this place.

[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.800]
That was enough.

[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.120]
WDQA, I'm hello.

[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:18.560]
Neil.

[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.160]
How you doing today?

[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.320]
Pretty good, Pally. What's up?

[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.140]
I got somebody for your fault.

[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.380]
I hope it's okay, though, though, she's dead.

[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.260]
Silla Cruz.

[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.040]
Silla Cruz was dead.

[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:28.780]
Oh, my God, it's you.

[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:29.520]
She ugly.

[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.460]
Oh, perhaps, do you remember the name of that ugly bitch

[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.160]
that blew the whistle in with Monica?

[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:38.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.160]
You're talking about a trip.

[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:41.820]
Well, start on.

[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.300]
And I don't want to hear this.

[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:45.840]
Okay, thanks, pal.

[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:46.620]
See, there you go.

[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.640]
As he puts two on again.

[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:48.640]
That's okay.

[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.200]
He's a good guy.

[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.920]
He got two really good points.

[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.020]
I'm dead now.

[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.180]
And I remember when I was alive.

[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.540]
I will live in the living room.

[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.340]
When the dwellin'

[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:00.360]
Yeah.

[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.260]
She's still dead, by the way.

[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.000]
And then, of course, we always got...

[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.020]
I don't even remember if we can play that or not.

[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.940]
There might be something in there.

[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.320]
I don't know.

[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.460]
Do you know if we can play that?

[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:13.420]
No, we can't.

[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.800]
You mean, definitely, Clarence, have been in here

[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.600]
going through this DCS and clearing out all the stuff

[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.480]
that we can't play anymore?

[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.860]
Are you shmentin' me or what?

[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:19.620]
Huh?

[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.500]
What kind of an ice-hole are they?

[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.140]
What is wrong with them?

[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:25.620]
Oh, that's right.

[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.240]
They're spending a lot of time asked to ask.

[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.640]
Maybe we ought to ask them about it.

[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.220]
WQM or ask.

[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.900]
And, you know, I never even got into a portony randal yet.

[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:36.320]
I mentioned it in passing.

[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:37.060]
Like he did.

[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.100]
He passed.

[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.280]
We mentioned it yesterday.

[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:39.880]
In passing.

[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.700]
Oh, he died.

[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.440]
When did he die?

[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:42.600]
Yesterday, I guess.

[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:43.720]
Before your show?

[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:44.600]
During.

[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:45.760]
Oh, no.

[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.660]
I hate that when somebody famous dies right in the middle of the show.

[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.060]
Tony Randal, the Emmy Award-winning actor,

[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.880]
made the role of Fussing Neatnik Felix Unger.

[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.440]
In fact, he was used to be every now and then make a guest appearance

[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.260]
on the 80K show, doing the Overs Nungers.

[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.660]
On his TV's The Odd Couple, his died.

[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.180]
He was 84.

[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.540]
Well, quite frankly, 84 is old enough.

[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.380]
He was making babies just a few years ago.

[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:08.720]
Yes, indeed.

[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.280]
None of them old, farce making babies.

[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.680]
But in his case, we made an exception because unlike Larry King,

[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:13.900]
we liked Tony Randal.

[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.400]
The actor died in his sleep Monday evening at NYU Medical Center in New York.

[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.480]
The cause of death was complications from a prolonged illness.

[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.140]
He had pneumonia.

[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.960]
He had some kind of heart surgery or something that he got pneumonia and then he died.

[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.820]
That's a shame.

[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.100]
Jack Clogman ran away.

[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.040]
Jack Clogman still running around like this.

[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.660]
Now, if you're smoking and faggot's out there right now on your kids especially,

[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.860]
there's a walking ad because Hamilton Berger from Peri Mason,

[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.880]
should we end around these dead?

[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.240]
But if you want to be like, you know, Jack Clogman and talk it like this,

[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.000]
just keep puffing away at them faggots, okay?

[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.820]
Just keep smoking on them cancer sticks.

[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:55.120]
And pretty soon you won't be able to talk and you'll have infosima and bronchitis and cancer

[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.420]
and all these horrendous things.

[00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:00.360]
Black lung disease, brown lung disease, purple lung disease, purple people leader disease,

[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.400]
and you'll be dead.

[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.920]
I just, you know, it's a free country to appoint.

[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:04.720]
Not really.

[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.200]
But I mean, if you want to smoke, smoke them if you got them.

[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.160]
That's where clearance token, Thomas will live off and smoke them if you got them.

[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.560]
10.57 at 5.60 is a matter of fact what a segue.

[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.500]
Nobody wants to talk about lung disease or cancer or heart disease.

[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.560]
All of these grotesque things that we can get.

[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.900]
But it's a proven fact that disease responds extremely well to treatment.

[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.780]
If you find it early, that is the key.

[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.780]
That can be the difference between life and a grotesque, carboil death.

[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.900]
Hollywood Diagnostic Center is proud to announce their virtual colonoscopy,

[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.720]
coronary heart scoring and full body screening exams,

[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:37.280]
that really can detect cancer and other life threatening diseases in their early stages,

[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.340]
while it's not too late to do something about them.

[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.780]
And of course, if you don't have any problems at all,

[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.200]

[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.380]
There's bugs in here again.

[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.400]
Gush dang it, man.

[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.460]
There's gnats in here.

[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.240]
Look at that.

[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.540]
That more over there against the wall.

[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.860]

The thing most people like best is peace of mind, right?

[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.920]
After peace of...

[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.240]
My line in local, near sports radio 560.

[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:42.400]
You a...

[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.560]
You a...

[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:43.700]
You a...

[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.540]
You a...

[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.260]
You got a brick of wool.

[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.240]
Oh!

[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:02.480]
Just in case you didn't recognize the candidates are vicious guys.

[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.440]
The TV ads are full of lies.

[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.860]
Why are they only running smear campaigns?

[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:15.080]
None of them have any shame, standing for the heart.

[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.300]
Ha!

[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:21.400]
This race has taken its toll on me.

[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:26.240]
All of these guys look at each other more.

[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.400]
Much sleeping is before your beauty.

[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:36.780]
I'm so annoyed, and I won't watch the news anymore.

[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:41.660]
This race has taken its toll on me.

[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:47.020]
Of my least right to even up the store.

[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:53.880]
Can't stand on the negativity we have a choice.

[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.120]
So let's not take it anymore.

[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.920]
Well look at that, at least 9.5.5.

[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.120]
And then Gaza explodes and does a little bump in the road, Matt Poison girl.

[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.120]
There's a little bump in the road, all right?

[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.080]
Everything will be just fine.

[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.600]
Make no mistake about it in the Middle East.

[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.740]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.760]
Let's see, here's a look at this.

[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.500]
I got this article on our website.

[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.300]
Thank you very much.

[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.320]
Okay, but how I killed people in a ranking out of you.

[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:18.720]
I got it. I'll get to it.

[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:19.840]
It's on our website.

[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.680]
Always a really good idea if you have a computer.

[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.520]
Which you must have if you downloaded these stories and printed them out, right?

[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.100]
Take a look at Neuronjus.com.

[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.520]
You'll see we already got that story on it.

[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.700]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.500]
It's a good place to start your reading anyway.

[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.380]
Right. That's right.

[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:34.180]
We got the good stuff.

[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:35.700]
That's what Clarence Thomas said.

[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.540]
We got the good stuff.

[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.800]
I was watching the sports last night during the newscast, such as it is here.

[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.900]
And I see that Jay Feeder is still on the dolphin team.

[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.280]
Oh, man. Oh, man.

[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.760]
That right there is a very bad old man.

[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.120]
That's a bad sign.

[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.120]
Anyway, oh, look at this.

[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.860]
And is there like multiple pages?

[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.900]
Oh, God. Stop doing this already.

[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:57.640]
Will you? Are you idiot?

[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.200]
Okay. For the pool.

[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.880]
Here's one that says Greta van Sustern.

[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.900]
Who owes all her fame to OJ.

[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.700]
And of course, is Grotesque nasty.

[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.820]
Even on a mad dog had a ride.

[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.640]
Allegedly the hots for her.

[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:09.720]
That was just, that was her.

[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:10.520]
He's just funding you.

[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.500]
There's no way in the world a mad dog who has much better taste than that.

[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:19.740]

love of 17 it made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside on monday morning when

[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:08.080]
mow and I bonded out there by the door and then i missed him this morning i just

[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.580]
just missed him by a couple of minutes. Mad Mike, bald-headed chain-smoking mad

[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:16.520]
Mike was sitting out there in a chair that's got his ass embroidered on it and I

[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.580]
said damn I missed my buddy this morning because I saw his car was already going

[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:24.440]
hey just missed him. Well you still have Friday. I went aww shucks. Yeah I'll come

[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.940]
next year early to make sure I bond with Moe one more time. He's what he is. Who

[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:37.940]

Winske II. Chelsea Clinton's only got one Joan Rivers one, Gloria Greta and

[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.960]
Sandra one. At 161 Chelsea's only got one. She could be the ugliest thing on a

[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:07.720]
face of the earth. She makes Rumpel Stiltski look like Greta Garbo. Oh we got

[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.520]
a nice picture. I should point out of Kim Basinger. Basinger. Yeah good. I don't

[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.340]
care how you say it. It's an excellent picture. Nevertheless and we like her a lot

[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:19.920]
because she said that Mickey Rork smelled. Yeah well now can we still play to

[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.380]
Mickey Rork cuts that are ready? Some of them yeah. We have asked you. Some of them not.

[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:27.620]
What? The ones that we can't play are kind of obvious right up front. But you

[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.280]
don't know what they are. No I've got a lot of friends that are on the police

[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:35.040]
force here. That's okay. Yeah. That's what of them. Yeah it's nothing to

[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.560]
Mickey. Okay those were the great days that I was in. Mickey Rork was out there

[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.060]
listening to show calling in. And his girlfriend. And his girlfriend. They had

[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:45.540]
like that. It was like a ambush which you like to say. Kind of like what fat boy

[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:51.560]
did to me here on Monday morning. Yeah. Ambush. Somebody says here's a good one

[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.880]
for the pool and they're right and colder. Talk about Skanky and Scabby and

[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.660]
nasty and Pastrami and all those things. Who have we can't play that bit? She's got an E

[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:04.960]
on the under her end. Yes. I believe so. In fact every time I see her I think

[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.640]
he got a look at that piece of crap. And here's a very good one that nobody in the

[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.040]
audience probably would think of because we don't have too many birds because they

[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.280]
give us the schmitz. I would rank Camilla Parker bowls right up there. I would play

[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.960]
that bit only it's not in here. You don't have anything in here. The one about

[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:24.740]
the Prince Charles and being by all I love that but you don't have it. What's it

[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:29.300]
called? It's called Prince Charles is I don't know something it's not in there

[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:36.100]
where would it be from? I don't know. No you don't have it. You don't got it. It's an

[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:41.520]
HCN but you don't have it. They don't like you. Anyway don't get around her

[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.120]
Camilla Parker bowls and Prince Charles he's into curling more. He rides

[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.340]
Haas's asses with his kilts on. He likes the way it feels. Well your Brit's

[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:54.320]

[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.880]
get the white powder that went up in the air behind Tony Blair this morning and

[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.940]
Parliament? No. Yeah it was like somebody threw something it was a whole bunch

[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.040]
like powder went up in the baby powder. I think it was a message like take a

[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.920]
powder Tony get lost. It wasn't I guarantee you one thing because if it would

[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.380]
we'd have been hearing about it all day long. I don't know what the hell I had

[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:19.440]
that anthrax. Yeah what's what's that under anthrax? It is no it's not. I already

[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:25.620]

[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:44.700]
Roseanne on there. Roseanne is grotesque. She's nasty. She is obnoxious. Disconn

[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:48.200]
that's just the way she looks either. You're telling me you got to put her up there.

[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:53.260]
Okay thanks pal. All right you guys. See you around the block. 5 6 7 0 5 60. Oh and

[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:59.180]
listen to this ABC news says definitely a cover up a cover up. Oh my God.

[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.820]
Dozens of soldiers other than the seven military police

[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:06.180]
reservists who have been charged were involved in the abuse of Iraq's Abu

[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:09.220]
Ghraib prison and there's an effort underway in the army to hide it a key

[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:15.720]
witness in the investigation told ABC news. A cover up what a shock what a

[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:21.220]
surprise. Military intelligence analyst Sergeant Samuel Provins told ABC News

[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.800]
that the sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib began as a

[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.720]
technique ordered by the military intelligence and interrogators. There's

[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.980]
definitely a cover up the witness Sergeant Samuel Provins said people are

[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:37.800]
either telling themselves or being told to be quiet. Provins who's about

[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.060]
30 man was part of the 300 second military intelligence battalion station in

[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:45.240]
Abu Ghraib last September. He spoke to ABC News despite orders from his

[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.840]
commanders not to what I was supposed what I was surprised that was the

[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:52.160]
silence he said the collective silence by so many people that had to be

[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.300]
involved that had to have seen something or heard something. Provins now stated

[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.780]
stationed in Germany where he will follow orders very well you understand.

[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.160]
They have this. Grand the top secret computer network used by military

[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:07.480]
intelligence at the prison. He said that while he didn't see the actual views

[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.820]
taking place the interrogators with whom he worked freely admitted they

[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.560]
directed the MPs rough treatment of prisoners. Anything the MPs were to do

[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.260]
legally or otherwise they were to take those commands from the interrogators he

[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:22.620]
said. One interrogator told me how commonly the detainees were stripped

[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:27.120]
naked in some occasions wearing women's underwear he said it is your if it's

[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.480]
your job to strip people naked yell at them scream at them humiliate them it's

[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.700]
not going to be too hard to move that to that from that to another level. It

[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:39.280]
goes on and on. Yeah it's just a big cover up there's all kinds of crap going on

[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:46.580]
and Rumsfeld was behind it was that any of that operation code SAP copper no not

[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:51.120]
SAP. It's in one of these stories I'll get to it eventually copper

[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:54.980]
copper head. Oh I can't say that anymore oh sorry

[01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:02.180]

head like about 12,000 people are last night that's at least in the box

score which means they really had like nine or ten now what the excuse I guess

[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.300]

[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:13.080]
very very exciting good team but Tampa Bay lightning and the Calgary flames if it

[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:17.020]
turns out that's the matchup and a stand-up finals the networks are gonna

[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:22.380]
kill themselves not the CBC because we got one Canadian team there eight but man oh man a

[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:27.100]
matchup made in purgatory Calgary and Tampa Bay oh my oh my goodness

[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.720]
anyway the article that the guy was faxing me before which is on our website

[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.320]
atrocities in Iraq I killed innocent people for our government

[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:39.280]
it's a very long interview it's on theorages.com I just I'm just gonna read a

[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:43.680]
little bit okay because it's a Honduras one on plus it's an interview it's a

[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:48.720]
question and answer thing we forget what war is about what it does to those

[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.280]
who wage it knows who suffer from it those who wait were the most I've

[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.680]
often found our veterans who know it Chris Hedges New York Times reporter author

[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.380]
of war is the fourth that gives us meaning said that for nearly 12

[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:02.920]
year staff sergeant Jimmy Massey was a hardcore some say gung-home marine in

[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.380]
fact you know what his favorite word was for three years he trained

[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.980]
fellow Marines in one of the most grueling indoctrination rituals in military

[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:15.140]
life marine boot camp with a without dr. Laura and Sally Jesse Raphael the

[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.840]
Iraq war changed Massey the brutality the sheer carnage of the U.S. invasion

[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.720]
touched his conscience and transformed him forever he was honorably discharged

[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.380]
with full severance on the last December 31 and is now back at his hometown

[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:29.960]
Wayne'sville North Carolina when I talked with Massey last week he expresses

[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.520]
remorse at the civilian loss of life and incidents in which he himself was in

[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:38.240]
va na just we'll read one brief question and answer what does the public need to

[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.760]
know about your experiences as a marine answer the cause of the Iraqi

[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.860]
revolting against the American occupation what they need to know is we killed a

[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:49.600]
lot of innocent people I think at first the Iraqis had the understanding that

[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.680]
casualties are a part of war but over the course of time the occupation

[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.060]
hurt the Iraqis and I didn't see any humanitarian support

[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.160]
and it goes on a great length and you really should read it unless of course you're

[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.940]

[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:46.180]
in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf War

[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:53.320]

[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:56.680]
posed posed by lingering depleted uranium residue

[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:58.560]

[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:03.220]
right in a red call for one we had depleted uranium

[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:07.520]

[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.860]

[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:16.340]

right right while all the brrr they got to do something

[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:35.300]

[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:36.480]

the american public like i said they have no clue what's going on in the world most of them

[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:08.380]
and in the meantime here's a guy that had like a couple of uh jobs and uh the blue dress and the

[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:12.400]
stain all this other crap yeah but he didn't have a slot and he lied about his sex life which is

[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:16.740]
nobody's fricking business even at ice prince at a salary if she wasn't such a dike maybe he

[01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:21.900]
might have been getting some from from her but he wasn't and so and so the whole country the whole

[01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:25.800]
world laughed at us while we were dragged through that crap in the meantime osama's doing his

[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:29.660]
thing he's got all the cells over here i'll sleeper cells and they're plotting all of this crap

[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:34.140]
and we're bogged down here the whole country with whether bubble got a uh job

[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:40.440]
and now we got a guy that's got he's got people over there based on a pack of lies even calling

[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:44.520]
poly other they admitted that it was a pack of uh misinformation he didn't say lies but we know

[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.960]
what it meant when he was uh when we were watching the palm trees on meat depressed

[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:55.720]
yeah they lied they made up stories and then of course it became something else well he must

[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:59.720]
they must have been a good for those some well that was full crap too well we're there for

[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:05.720]
operation Iraqi freedom he's a bad guy and then of course all of the stuff that they're finding

[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.520]
that he's supposed to seren gas and the muster gas this is just a little slop over from what we

[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:16.620]
gave him back in the 80s that's all it is we gave it to him here by all means use it on the

[01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:21.980]
I told him and use it on the Iranians have a great time kill him yeah and we didn't want him to

[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:28.200]
win all we wanted was a stalemate right which is what we got a stalemate yeah do we have democracy

[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:32.480]
in Iran no are we ever going to have real democracy in Iraq no so what are we talking about we had

[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:37.720]
a stalemate he was fine we could have kept those inspectors in there for a hundred years

those other who go cheese Greg they like the right over the line yeah I mean that's an ACN

[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:14.920]
but they said bag they must have been thinking about Todd Dreck and Gary Sarner see up until this day

that they're two peas in the same pod five six seven oh five sixty oh so anyway I interrupted

[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:32.120]
you interrupted me at noon after I played the Moisee which is one of my all time favorites and I

[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:35.060]
just thought I mentioned it on the air because I'm sure that nobody in the building is going to

[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:37.660]
tell them because nobody here wants to look you right in the face and tell you the truth

[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:41.860]
guilty I hate to break the news here but Joe Rose kind of courted me in a hall this morning when I

[01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:46.420]
came in and he said the last if it's the last thing I do I'm gonna make sure that guilty is not

[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:51.980]
on the show I don't want any part of me it's not a bad guy he's a good kid I don't I work alone is

[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:57.380]
what he said he really say any of this but I'm just making it up but what look that's what he was

[01:48:57.380 --> 01:49:01.800]
taken but you know how my psychic powers yeah you could pick it up I haven't even seen Joe since I've

[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:06.380]
been back but I did he just you could just tell as I walked by that corner there Joe Rose was in

[01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:10.460]
there thinking I don't want no intruders interlopers on the show if I can you know is he in Zach we're

[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:14.160]
doing that fake Harvey Green voice at the end of the show they're pretty lame but nevertheless

[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:19.580]
you know he he he doesn't need anybody else to come on there and try to be like a superstar now

[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:22.920]
when we talk about how much guilty is pulling down from this place and all of his other sort of

[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:27.180]
jumps at that point then you will hear George cry like a woman on the air for the first time

[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:52.500]
people in this building have taken that whole thing a little bit too far if you catch my group

[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:58.280]
just a wee bit too far I mean talk about airing on the side of caution but airing on the on the

[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:05.200]
side of paranoia and psychosis and idiocy and stupidity and balllessness I mean I don't want to say

[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.260]
that we got anybody in the building it has absolutely no balls at all okay that that hasn't even

Don't question these callers. They know their crap. It's a speciality of the house

[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:44.980]
5670560 don't forget to take a look at Kim Basinger

[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:10.300]
I have two vivid imagination and a good memory even though I have got my Alzheimer's going

[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:14.560]
Pentagon stops payments to Iraq's chalabee

[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:17.780]
Long overdue that's because they were embarrassed into it

[01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:24.140]
The Pentagon has stopped funding. Uh, Dick Cheney's good personal friend Ahmed Chalabee the Iraqi exile

[01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:30.180]
It wants to help my leader rack but his intelligence reports and motives were doubted elsewhere in Washington, US officials said yesterday

[01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:33.900]
The Pentagon had been giving chill obvious Iraqi national congress roughly

[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:38.820]
340 grand a month a US defense official speaking on condition and anonymity said the Pentagon made its

[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:41.740]
May payment to the I and C and that was the final one no more

[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:47.540]
Just like those pictures if nobody would have ever filed out right and of course the same thing with this

[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:51.260]
The officials said there have been no decision on whether there would be any further Pentagon relationship

[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:56.100]
But you lobbies organization the nature of any future interactions with the I and C is that determined this time

[01:56:56.100 --> 01:57:01.940]
They said deputy defense secretary Paul Heinrich Himmler Wolfewood said cutting off money to the I and C was a decision

[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:05.800]
That was made in light of the process of transferring sovereignty to the Iraqi people right

[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:10.520]
We know if felt it was no longer appropriate for us to continue funding in that fashion he said to a known

[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:10.940]
uh

[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:19.320]
Criminal felon extortionist all of these things evil doer Ahmed Chalabee

[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:26.940]
Whose uh nephew whatever it is the niece whoever that want to say l'm Chalabee is also on the Iraqi government council just by coincidence

[01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:33.460]
It's a family affair just like the whole bush thing. It's a family affair. And by the way, how's uh what's your name doing Terry Shiveaux?

Huh not this one and if we did sue us okay, who is the ugliest big name female I never did that

[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:30.980]
But she and any pull that similar like this she always gets on there because she's discussing in grotesque and there are a lot of guys who think she's

[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:33.020]
Really hot she used to be

[02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:37.580]
Before she turned around 500 pie now she's down to 450 though. She lost the weight

But she's still kind of scared she's slimming down big time makes me think of that what what's that one old AC in bit

[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:25.880]
Go away. Okay. In fact, when you see all the big canals with that dirty brown water hop in it, okay

[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:29.540]
Forget about them glass bottom boats. You don't need no boat just hop in a canal

[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:35.760]
Step on one of the coffee houses first to be or maybe a few to magic magic mushrooms will do the trick for you

[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:38.000]
Just hop in the old canal have a good time

[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:46.780]
56705 60 pound 560 on the 18 and T of Verizon wireless line say how do the pet rider McDonald's there on the damrat

[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:51.140]
The one that hangs out under the fries and the what do they call it thing

[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:58.580]
Where they're frying the fries the fryer well, I guess but I mean that the the fryer the deep fried fryer

[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:05.300]
On the deep fat fries there the pet rat that's been there for a couple of years now every time I go in there never fail to see it comes running out

[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:09.460]
Oh, it does run out. It's not like a dead rat. It's just there. No, no

[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:14.460]
It's not a dead rat it runs around and you and you I don't want to say anything. I mean, what are you gonna say?

[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:20.120]
Eka rat yeah, but they got to know that it's there see what I'm saying right? I mean

[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:26.440]
When you're there they purposely never looked there and a rat coming I mean how many times have I been in that place

[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:32.380]
The last couple of years maybe twice and now that I found the Albert hind to go a little supermarket there

[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:34.620]
I wouldn't dream of going into McDonald's again ever

[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:40.440]
But I only been there two or three times in a lot in that McDonald's in last year

[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:43.100]
And every time I go in there. It's there

[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:45.580]
You see what I'm saying can't just be a coincidence

[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:51.080]
Maybe they just let it run around is kind of like a curiosity thing sir. Everybody's there. Oh my gosh

[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:55.400]
Do you see the little rat that runs around all the deep prior McDonald's on the dam rack and I'm standing right yeah

[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:58.200]
No, it's not a pest. It's a pet. Yeah, it's a pet rat

[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:00.780]
Or maybe it's a gerbil

[02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:02.620]

And don't forget we got eight years after the Bushmeister wins after W gets another four

[02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:46.320]
And we got eight years of Jeb then we got eight years of George P

[02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:51.340]
Everybody come out in the parking lot and watch George P and then we can start working on the girls

And then we can start working you can start working on the girls

[02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:56.280]
Because by that time they ought to be about 80

[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:08.500]

But there should be some rest in too

[02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:29.640]

[02:06:56.600 --> 02:07:03.040]

[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:23.800]
A community that just refuses to well let go. Yeah, but again, I don't want to pick on the spics because after that juice stuff last few days

[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:27.240]
Juice for bush juice juice for Hitler is what it boils down to

[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:28.280]
Right?

[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:30.740]
Yeah, I don't get it.

[02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:32.760]
Ah, it's the Israel thing man

[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:39.380]
If you if people like you on the girl there your boyfriend and there can be hysterical about Cuba when he's never been there

[02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:44.240]
He ain't never gonna go there and he's got any interest in be in anything when when he's obsessed with that

[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:48.900]
So I shouldn't use be obsessed with Israel. Why can't they be just as stupid and stubborn and upset and about crap

[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:53.080]
Why can't they why can't they devote their lives to being fanatical about crap?

[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:57.260]
You have a bushing good for Israel or Cuba

[02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:02.160]
Or anybody the worst part of it is bushing good for America. How do you like that?

[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:07.980]
Absolutely correct because I don't give a flying fig about Cuba or about Israel or about any of those other things

[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:10.700]
I care about America and a little bit about Canada, but not that much

[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:20.280]

[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:37.740]

[02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:26.860]
That's the only man

[02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:33.700]
St. As sing and she's dancing. She's practicing that big guava love and sucking place up in the sky. That's what she's doing

[02:15:35.140 --> 02:15:39.940]
She's sucking guava. I like guava director more tears into bush of can festival

[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:41.820]
He said in a movie if you like it. It's in the can

[02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:50.100]
American filmmaker Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9-11 a savage indictment of president bush and his handling of Iraq and the war on terror

[02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:53.540]
Was cheered and applauded at the can film festival on Monday

[02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:58.880]
In fact, they got a 20-minute standing ovation in all time record-breaking performance 20-minute standing ovation

[02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:05.620]
Film critics were warm in praise of the controversial director later called a news conference for America to pull out of Iraq a man

[02:16:05.620 --> 02:16:06.040]
Michael

[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:11.400]
It's such a total mess. He said their way of doing things is offended so many people more said

[02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:19.340]
The Oscar winning director is fast-moving film is a telling worker propaganda by a movie maker was mission to the ride bush exudes from every frame good

[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:28.980]
It focuses on how America and the White House reacted to the September 11, 2001 hijacking attacks and traces links between the bush family and prominent Saudis

[02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:31.180]
Including the family of Osama Yamab been loved

[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:34.540]
We had a president who was asleep at the wheel Moore said

[02:16:35.260 --> 02:16:44.140]
Fahrenheit 9-11 is already whipped up an international media storm after the Disney company barred its Miramax film unit from releasing such a politically polarizing work in a US election year

[02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:46.620]
I hope it comes out in America this year said more and it will

[02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:47.080]
I

[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:53.780]
Do think it's important to care of times like this this time I was the straight man and Bush wrote the funniest lines he said

[02:16:55.820 --> 02:17:01.600]
The film constantly mocks the president the fish rods from the head down. He said British Prime Minister Tony Blair

[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:05.020]
Bush's closest war ally gets only a brief mention in the film

[02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:06.440]
But more said after the screening

[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:09.300]
What is he doing hanging out with a guy like George W. Bush?

[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:14.040]
I've never understand that it's the weirdest couple I've ever seen even Tony Randle would agree if he were still here today

[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:15.900]
Yeah, I'll talk about a couple

[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:23.100]
Two years ago the directors anti-gun lobby documentary bowling for Columbine grabbed the headlines at Cannes and went on to grow

[02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:29.080]
120 million dollars worldwide when I'm an Oscar and light of the current controversy over pictures of Iraqi prisoners being abused

[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:34.660]
His latest film is right up to date and showing American soldiers in the field mocking and posing with hooded Iraqi prisoners

[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:39.560]
This is the first footage of abuse and humiliation of these Iraqi detainees more be saying

[02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:42.540]
As the film starts the screen goes dark

[02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:48.440]
The sound is a planes crashing into the twin towers before the grief of victims families is contrasted with Bush sitting

[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:52.660]
Apparently impassively in a Florida school room for nine minutes after hearing the news

[02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:59.200]
More using a mocking soundtrack to great effect shows members that he'd been lot in family being flown out of the US after 9-11

[02:17:59.700 --> 02:18:02.160]
Upsurges the song I got to get out of this place

[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:05.560]
In Washington more is shown on a bizarre recruiting drive

[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:10.300]
He stops congressmen in the street asking if they might consider sending their children as soldiers to Iraq

[02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:13.680]
What do you think of that idea he asked before getting the obvious brush off

[02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:21.380]
The film shows the raw emotion of Lila Lipscomb doubled up with grief outside the White House as she contemplates the death of his soldier son in Iraq

[02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:25.700]
In one of the most moving scenes he reads out the last letter received from him before his death

[02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:31.900]
Telling how she collapses on hearing the news over the phone. She said your flesh just aches. You're not supposed to bury your own son

[02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:39.060]
It'll be out this summer Fahrenheit 9-11. It'll be out just in the nicotine and also that I bet you that book comes out too

And then when we read about that abortion and what a hypocrite and liar we dealing with people are gonna say holy crap

[02:18:50.260 --> 02:18:55.920]
Oh, no, he asked for forgiveness since then so I'll do it. I made him okay. He's kosher now right well if he's kosher

[02:18:55.920 --> 02:19:02.080]
They must be good for Israel. Oh, there you go. Frollo's professional Zionist out there who just can't cut the crap

[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:07.900]

No, it looks like a tongue. What is that?

[02:22:27.740 --> 02:22:33.120]
Did you you Yanca Todd Rex tongue before we left here this morning? That would be good. So the story in the building is yes

[02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:38.240]
Later, no, I want to hear it. We got a letter

[02:22:40.460 --> 02:22:43.240]
About what from a competitor and that's why

[02:22:45.700 --> 02:22:46.780]
I don't understand

[02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:53.640]
We got a letter from a competitor saying what saying this and that and that's why you won't do that spot

[02:22:54.740 --> 02:22:57.820]
A letter from a competitor. How would I know that?

[02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:01.900]
No, no, no, that's not the case obviously. Yeah, I

[02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:07.140]
Never heard anything about that until you showed me that thing this morning. It's the audience and we get a letter

[02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:10.320]
We got a copy of an article from a newspaper right

[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:14.780]
But the story that I know something I don't care what the story is yeah

[02:23:14.780 --> 02:23:19.540]
His hardwreck can make up all kinds of stories which is especially lying through his teeth anyway making up crap

[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:21.580]
By the way, how's the Collagen man doing Todd?

[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:24.740]
I don't want anything to do with him. I don't I will

[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:29.900]
If he if he went out tomorrow and sold 15 of accounts for the show for me to endorse I wouldn't do any of them

[02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:35.140]
You follow what I'm saying? I will not do a Todd Wreck account again. He's too much trouble

[02:23:35.140 --> 02:23:38.540]
There's too much baggage involved with every single thing he touches

[02:23:38.540 --> 02:23:43.700]
He's got the minus touch and reverse everything he touches turns to pure instant process crap

[02:23:45.580 --> 02:23:48.880]
As a matter of fact since Todd direct maybe a lot. How about just calling him the

[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:56.020]
Meister would be good the crap Meister while we can say it right while we can still say crap on here. He's the crap Meister Todd Wreck

[02:23:57.560 --> 02:24:00.600]
I don't give a crap how many stories there are in the building. I mean

[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.180]
You you saw what the deal what went down?

[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:06.760]
Yeah, I read the thing I made to the season and I'm not gonna be used and abused

[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:10.820]
I mean I got a little bit of credibility even after seven years on this guy for second radio station

[02:24:11.780 --> 02:24:16.520]
And that's what it's all about if you don't have any credibility how to how can you be on the air maybe the last month

[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:20.500]
You're on the air you can sell it all out. Oh, there you go. Yeah, well last month that I'm on the air Todd

[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:24.140]
stomach in Tesla

[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:31.920]
I got agita and aljada from Todd Dreck being in here this morning bugging a crack and from what you just told me again

[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:36.160]
There's a just stirred up all the negative juices. It's going through my fat puppet

[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:40.980]
You bastard you Todd Dreck. Don't come in area make up all the stories you watch

[02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:44.860]
Just run up and down the hallway like rumpel stiltskin like you were being in there go like like that

[02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:49.200]
I don't care and they'll say oh, it's Todd again, you know, that's all they'll say

[02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:51.880]
What you know, that's the truth

[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:57.800]
It'd be like if there was somebody standing outside the door with their crying against the wall. I would need to be muffler a Gilbert

[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:01.880]
Who is the ugliest big name female?

[02:26:02.900 --> 02:26:04.340]
Rosie O'Donnell 110

[02:26:05.180 --> 02:26:08.620]
Sandra Bernhard 93. By the way, Gellie. Joe don't want you on his show, okay?

[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:12.740]
I know the only reason I keep mentioning that is because I never know when he might be in a car listening

[02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:15.200]
He's certainly with him two little kids not listening at home

[02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:22.580]
In fact, maybe he's at the track right now. Let's see. It's Wednesday. I probably is Gulfstream runner right now or colder. I don't know

[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:24.540]
Hmm one of it

[02:26:25.340 --> 02:26:28.740]
And I somehow I don't I just never really oh

[02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:33.220]
God is punishing us again. We just had the lights the floater flicker in the lute and here again

[02:26:34.020 --> 02:26:35.540]
Is the phone and the phone still working

[02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:42.180]
As soon as I said that Joe no one guilty on all of a sudden there was an act of uh, oh good punishing me

[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:47.380]
But I just can't see guilty at the racetrack. Can you just he's such a not yet

[02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:50.020]
But but that's where he hang he hangs out

[02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:55.940]
He's a racetrack kind of guy. Of course when you're making a big bucks like he is right then you can afford to be out there plunging your guts out

[02:26:57.320 --> 02:26:58.440]
WQA him hello

[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:00.400]
Hey, how's it going pretty good pali?

[02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:03.860]
What that I say. What do you got for us?

[02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:05.520]
Uh

[02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:08.820]
Tell me about the economy. What is it?

[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:10.860]
The economy the economy what?

[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:12.840]
That the uh

[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:15.840]
They use construction for a benchmark in

[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:19.780]
Telling how the economy's doing. They're all these experts are saying the

[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:27.460]
The okay good five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty. It's the economy's stupid. Oh wow. He was good

[02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:34.840]
Uh, WQA him hello. Hey, yeah, how's it going pretty good sir? I want to thank Tom jica for not covering the biggest non-story of this

[02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:41.140]
Paul and douchebag going to one oh nine point five one oh nine point one oh five. I mean just as well

[02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:45.460]
I mean it shows socks old old Paul and ancient old Paul so it's I mean

[02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:48.440]
I have to just to see the redo anything new and it's like

[02:27:48.980 --> 02:27:52.760]
Of course not what just because they moved them different spot on the diet. I think now they're going to find a show

[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:56.220]
No, they have no show. It's right. It's it's it's

[02:27:56.220 --> 02:28:02.460]
But that was that I should point out here. That was the same time jica that now did he write a story that I missed about the

[02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:06.120]
Bigs numbers dropping off the face of the earth that I missed that I didn't see no

[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:09.980]
I look for it every day. I didn't see any column like like once every

[02:28:10.940 --> 02:28:14.880]
Leapier right every leapier he discovers he's got a radio sitting in the trunk of his car

[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:20.140]
So I mean I heard so yesterday. I mean you got a guy that's fairly decent on the air and then they got these two

[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:25.500]
Shmandrix. I'll tell you one thing about suds eats a great free meal man. Hey, you know free loaders a good thing

[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:29.180]
But anyway, it's it's just told all that they're rooted in our track

[02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:35.340]
Classic crock rock radio with these two more on and this idiot Ron all he keeps doing the same Zeta

[02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:36.760]
He can't even he can't even

[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:40.420]
Get the call letters right? He's not the same we're a pollcaster and over that

[02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:43.860]
kept trying to get a job over here all the time and then denied and lied about it

[02:28:52.540 --> 02:28:54.700]
They're QM on a ropes for what what is he talking?

[02:28:58.380 --> 02:28:59.980]
See he keeps saying it and sir

[02:28:59.980 --> 02:29:03.700]
You know, I would love to talk radio because it's the favorite because we used to actually have radio

[02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:06.720]
But you keep saying that word again like right bagging we can't say that

[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:10.320]
Innocently I know the guy is well intended. I hate to hang up on him

[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:14.400]
But that's the second time I had a dump him and we just can't do that because then muff is gonna go in there

[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:19.840]
Start crying and then you'll see Duffin clearance will be having a hold in there meeting there and as to ask and it's just

[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:21.520]
We can't afford to be doing that anymore

[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:25.940]
tragic, but it's sad. I mean this is just the way people talk very nice

[02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:32.300]
You know, you're stuff, but you're living in a fascist country and anybody out there who wants to excuse it by making in-aing comments like well

[02:29:32.300 --> 02:29:36.660]
Bush is great for Israel if you're willing to give up other not only your

[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:42.380]
But everybody else is a freedom of speech if you're willing to endorse this pay for you that if you're willing to endorse a system

[02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:47.520]
Where they can just drag you away with no legal representation then there's something definitely there's a there's a missing link

[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:51.080]
Okay, not the weakest link. There's a missing link between your ears

[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:57.580]
It's what we were your brain used to be and just this week being here again talking to people otherwise are very intelligent

[02:29:57.580 --> 02:30:02.740]
Very articulate and yet they keep throwing his crap in my face about well Bush is good for Israel

[02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:07.520]
You know what hubman drere that's what I say about Bush and all of this garbage, okay?

[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:11.060]
And you can throw an aerial shiron to and his TV aerial

[02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:13.460]
It's enough to make me sick

[02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:19.960]
Man oh man talk about eating too much too many humantosh in it for him time pick a look at that type of crap

[02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:25.280]
Aerial shiron and the worst part of it is in case they ever decided to throw his ass in jail

[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:29.060]
Where it belongs since he is a criminal just like I think they can put him in there with the chalabi

[02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:33.200]
Oh, yeah, couple of good long fun the worst part of is if they throw him out of there

[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:37.280]
They got baby that in the ahu baby brain who makes the aerial shiron look like Ted Kennedy

[02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:41.720]
Okay, like a screaming liberal peace in our lifetime. Yeah, peace of this

[02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:49.560]
Anyway, let's see it says I have this to add Laura Bush now and Laura Bush is not no don't put her on air

[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:54.600]
Or you're just gonna go back to your sushi. I think you're gonna put her or a bush is not. Oh, actually she's dumb bitch

[02:30:55.160 --> 02:31:00.180]
She's just yahoo looking at saw she just looks like I mean compared to a Hillary

[02:31:01.060 --> 02:31:02.520]
She ain't too bad right?

[02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:04.000]
compared to

[02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:08.240]
Rosalind Carter she's like a beauty queen

[02:31:08.840 --> 02:31:12.660]
Compared to Lady Bird Johnson the only the only attractive

[02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:19.460]
wife first lady I can think of in my lifetime is Jackie Kennedy and I mean she was overrated. Oh very much so

[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:21.920]
But she said that la plume de ma time

[02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:26.920]
Yeah, oh god. She was a simpleton. She was a bubble head. She was like that right

[02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:33.840]
A bimbet kind of like a brunette Marilyn Monroe which Kennedy's had a thing for that spending money is not a talent

[02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:39.740]
Right and and and latching on to rich you know, you know, area on acid. I still think when acid was a jfk

[02:31:39.740 --> 02:31:43.060]
Junior's father. I believe that's right. I've read a couple of things about that

[02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:48.700]
Stem can you look anything like the Kennedy's he didn't look Irish. He looked Greek show no and when I'm reading any inquiry

[02:31:48.700 --> 02:31:50.140]
He was into that Greek stuff

[02:31:51.140 --> 02:31:52.160]
That's what I heard

[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.260]
I'm telling you right now if I'm lying you're dying

[02:31:58.840 --> 02:31:59.680]
Best Truman

[02:32:00.740 --> 02:32:07.980]
Eleanor Roosevelt. I mean Eleanor Roosevelt. She made Janet Reno look like a Kim basinger. Okay. That's how grotesque Eleanor Roosevelt was

[02:32:07.980 --> 02:32:13.380]
Even when she was young talk about a donkey push. She she looked like Dr. Judy Dean

[02:32:13.980 --> 02:32:17.920]
You know like like a donkey teeth. What's her name Mary Todd Lincoln? She was a high

[02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:26.340]
In fact her favorite song was donkey chain little crazy who very tired like oh, yeah, that's a long time ago. How's the play? She filled out a bustle

[02:32:27.020 --> 02:32:30.600]
There were stories about him I should point out about Abe yeah honest

[02:32:30.600 --> 02:32:32.840]
Blessed and honest Abe but anyway

[02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:35.900]

And plastic surgery lies

[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:05.800]
From a woman we chose

[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:09.980]
I follow advice from my ear

[02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:10.980]
I'm gone

[02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:14.760]
For news I know where I'll go

[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:17.080]
And the next thing you know

[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:21.020]
I'm looking at the magic in the prison

[02:35:21.020 --> 02:35:22.040]
I'm listening

[02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:25.940]
He's asking me to bend the way

[02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:26.860]
Rack them

[02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:29.300]
And no one less it's good to bend

[02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:30.900]
And he clear out

[02:35:30.900 --> 02:35:32.280]
If you wanna make your world

[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:34.540]
I bet it makes Michael drop the soap

[02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:36.060]
And bend this way

[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:40.240]
Hey I got news for Michael Jackson videos for

[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:41.900]
He don't have to drop the soap anymore

[02:35:41.900 --> 02:35:44.440]
Because they got that body wash that everybody's using now

[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:45.840]
Right

[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:46.920]
What?

[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:48.900]
Liquid soap?

[02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:49.980]
Wait a minute

[02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:54.100]
What just happened to that?

[02:35:54.100 --> 02:35:54.980]
To the end of that

[02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:57.520]
That is

[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:00.120]
Anyway

[02:36:00.980 --> 02:36:03.040]
Liquid soap, what they don't call it liquid soap

[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:04.600]
I mean some of them do that's new

[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:09.840]
Oh it brings up, it conjures up the images

[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:12.300]
Some of the people I've been talking about here in the last half hour

[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:13.920]
Which at any rate

[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:14.540]
Yeah

[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:17.800]
Oh liquid soap, I wonder who that used to be

[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:18.540]
But at any rate

[02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:20.520]
Yeah, purey

[02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:22.640]
They call it body wash

[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:24.200]
Even in all the hotels now

[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:25.540]
My last trip in Copenhagen

[02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:26.980]
And by the way it's not Copenhagen

[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:28.560]
It's like you wouldn't call Dave Hagen

[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:29.280]
Dave Hagen

[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:30.180]
I will not

[02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:31.860]
I do like his ice cream that Hagen does

[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:33.400]
But I don't like Hagen

[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:35.360]
And anyway it's Copenhagen

[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:37.840]
But in Copenhagen in Rome and also in Amsterdam

[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:40.100]
In the Grand Cresnepolskie Hotel

[02:36:40.100 --> 02:36:41.820]
They have in the bathroom

[02:36:41.820 --> 02:36:43.500]
They have body wash and the shampoo

[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:45.260]
And the little bottle of soap

[02:36:45.260 --> 02:36:47.280]
So soap is becoming a thing in the past

[02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:48.620]
Which is great because

[02:36:49.180 --> 02:36:50.780]
Like my colleague keeps dropping it

[02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:52.420]
And it's not a good thing to do, not a good idea

[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:55.200]
No, they also give you the little scrungy that you can squirt the soap into

[02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:58.220]
In fact Brad, the Davis said it's not a good idea to be dropping that soap

[02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:01.780]
Especially when I'm in Turkey now

[02:37:01.780 --> 02:37:02.580]
At any rate

[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:04.160]
Now what were you just asking?

[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:05.740]
To give you a little scrungy too

[02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:08.820]
You don't want to use that, it comes with a kind of

[02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:09.780]
I don't like them either

[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:11.940]
That's for women

[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:13.480]
That's for women

[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:15.200]
I don't want to take a bubble bath or something like that

[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:16.900]
I don't know what you're talking about, I'm just using gloves

[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:19.220]
No, and also share

[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:20.620]
What was your name, Sharon?

[02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:22.920]
The nice lady that came there and took my blood

[02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:26.120]
She sent me, you know, I talked to her last night

[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:28.680]
She facts me the partial results which I'm still alive

[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:32.580]
But she also on the note of Polynesia

[02:37:32.580 --> 02:37:33.980]
Is for leaving her with the gloves behind

[02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:35.060]
The bloody gloves

[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:37.160]
She might have been listening when she left here

[02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:41.920]
Oh, Jay would have apologized for leaving the toilet

[02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:44.520]
So anyway, the body wash is where it's at

[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:47.100]
All you guys out there that keep dropping the soap and having that problem

[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:49.520]
Get you some body wash and a tolder

[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:51.940]
And when you go to your nearby Walgreens

[02:37:51.940 --> 02:37:54.280]
Do not go to Eckers because they will turn on you like a rat

[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:56.340]
When you go to Egg Walgreens

[02:37:56.340 --> 02:38:00.220]
They have now the just gigantic jugs

[02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:00.860]
Can I say that?

[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:01.420]
No

[02:38:02.260 --> 02:38:05.680]
Yeah, gigantic containers of body wash

[02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:07.500]
And clear all

[02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:09.660]
Now I don't know if you ever used clear all shampoo

[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:11.340]
I must have

[02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:15.420]
Oh, you must have, you ever got all this neat like purpl and all those real noses

[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:19.200]
Well now they make the same, it looks like the shampoo

[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:21.600]
In fact some of the person that I bought at their Walgreens

[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:23.300]
They said I bet you they use the same shampoo

[02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:26.320]
The same crap they just put in a different, it's like Chef Boy already all over again

[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:27.720]
They just call it something else

[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:29.780]
And they put the same crap in a container

[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:32.940]
But I mean just gigantic

[02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:35.740]
And that's the way to go, it's more, I don't know

[02:38:35.740 --> 02:38:38.820]
I mean soap, I never been a big soap guy

[02:38:38.820 --> 02:38:40.820]
Although I do have my bring back fire from Amsterdam

[02:38:41.620 --> 02:38:44.180]
Yeah, and fair for my Arab friends

[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:45.900]
Soap gets hair on it

[02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:48.800]
Oh, I don't like that, even though I know it's my own

[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:52.380]
Yeah, I don't like it, you're in the same way, you mentioned that

[02:38:52.380 --> 02:38:53.680]
So I know I'm not the only person

[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:56.900]
The first thing I do if I pick up the bar and the bar is soaped in the shower

[02:38:56.900 --> 02:38:58.380]
And I see there's a thing in here

[02:38:58.380 --> 02:39:00.280]
I picked that baby off of there too

[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:01.900]
That's the hair tub, one of the public hair

[02:39:01.900 --> 02:39:07.080]
Oh, well no, but you're living in a house with your wife and kids and the dogs

[02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:08.460]
We all have our own bar

[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:11.460]
Even your own party

[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:11.760]
Yeah

[02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:15.860]
5, 6, 7, we're talking about bodywag

[02:39:15.860 --> 02:39:17.000]
What other show in America?

[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:20.360]
You know, I was taking a leak in there during the break and I'm picking it myself

[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:24.460]
Because the sports aspect of this radio station really bothers me

[02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:26.700]
See, when I'm in Toronto, I don't have to listen to it

[02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:28.660]
Right, because I don't have a car number one

[02:39:28.660 --> 02:39:29.840]
Number two, I couldn't hear it in a car anyway

[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:32.440]
I can hear it in the studio, but I have to be a maniac too

[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:33.700]
Listen to me, I'll have to be nuts

[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:39.680]
But here, I'm driving a work in the morning, you know, Mo, I'm hoping that maybe I don't know

[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:42.920]
I listen only in thinking that maybe something will happen and never does

[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:47.540]
But Joe, as much as I like Joe a lot, I can't listen like 30 seconds

[02:39:47.540 --> 02:39:49.340]
I mean, fuck her, man

[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:52.840]
Because all he talks about is sports, there's nothing, and don't get me wrong, Joe is great

[02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:57.340]
He doesn't want you on the show by the way, Geltie, I love Joe Rose, he's a good guy, he's got good numbers in there

[02:39:57.340 --> 02:39:59.220]
So I'm just talking for me personally

[02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:04.660]
And I thought to myself, let's change the format on QM, let's have a station about stamp collecting

[02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:06.680]
Ooh, you see what I mean?

[02:40:07.140 --> 02:40:08.260]
Ooh, for lot of wisdom

[02:40:08.260 --> 02:40:11.000]
Yeah, to hold the election

[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:15.820]
Yeah, I'm 20, 20 hours in and out on this show, but you see what I'm talking about, I mean

[02:40:15.820 --> 02:40:18.900]
I'm talking about narrow casting, we're not just talking about sports fans

[02:40:18.900 --> 02:40:23.080]
We're talking about people who have no lives whatsoever and take it like, I have no life

[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:25.800]
To another level, you ever see those triangular stamps there?

[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:27.200]
Oh, yeah, triangles

[02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:31.120]
Yeah, and see the interesting thing is, is a kid, I used to collect stamps, I've written a lot about

[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:37.200]
All the different countries of the world, all the British colonies, of course now all those places have changed their names, it didn't do me any good now

[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:42.320]
But you know, as a youngster, I was like a genius in geography, because I used to collect stamps from all I'm countries

[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:46.760]
And all the Germany stamps with a Hitler mustache, all I took out of here, I don't get the ones with bush and a mustache

[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:49.160]
You like the ones with animals on them better or celebrity?

[02:40:49.620 --> 02:40:53.400]
The triangles from Australia and New Zealand were very, very pretty and very ugly

[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:57.780]
Yeah, what kind of, they have kangaroos on them, kangaroo and swallowing them

[02:40:57.780 --> 02:40:59.680]
Yeah, kangaroo is yeah

[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:02.300]
And that by the way, quant is never crashed

[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:11.520]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Law, we're talking about the Hollywood, whatever the hard rock hotel

[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:17.820]
And now this fall, and I'm sure they'll get that thing on a ballot about slots at the permute tools, if they don't pass that

[02:41:17.820 --> 02:41:25.240]
And it's county option by the way, why should the rest of the state, even though there are a bunch of mugworms and Bible thumpers, how can they deprive us of the right?

[02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:29.160]
Because it'll pass, the Sun sent a little pull on that overwhelming yes

[02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:30.780]
Why should they care if Gays get married?

[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:32.480]
Exactly, why should they care?

[02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:36.220]
Oh, but you're going to earn your hell well, they should be happy because they'll leave more room for them in heaven

[02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:37.800]
Or wherever they're going to be in purgatory

[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:45.040]
So that thing better passed this November because that's the only last hope that the permute tools have gotten this state, that the whole state has got

[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:48.160]
This is such a back-ass water placement, pathetic

[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:50.520]
WNQAM, hello

[02:41:51.060 --> 02:41:51.660]
Nail, please

[02:41:51.660 --> 02:41:52.420]
Yes, sir, speaking

[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:59.420]
Nail, how you doing? I'm just wondering if you got the channel full news today that you're holding somebody big-peated ROLL

[02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:03.000]
I saw that the other day, as usual, they're a little bit behind

[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:04.860]
Yeah, I guess ROLL

[02:42:04.860 --> 02:42:08.300]
Made it come back, he's actually talking now, and how's that possible?

[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:13.360]
I've got the, which one's got the fifth there, I'll punch it up, what are you going to do?

[02:42:13.540 --> 02:42:16.040]
He's got, hey listen, but he's still alive, man

[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:17.600]
Did you see the thing?

[02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:18.000]
Yeah, I did

[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:24.200]
They're sitting together around the couch, and it's like nothing ever happened when he was saying he doesn't have it like he had a stroke from this episode

[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:25.880]
But he looks a little funky, but he's talking

[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:29.200]
Hey, compared to what he went through, he's pretty damn good

[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:30.900]
You should look so good after Tiger 10

[02:42:30.900 --> 02:42:32.520]
Right, or after Tiger Rescue, something

[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:33.880]
Even with our one, Tiger Rescue

[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:37.660]
Although they're a little bit too fave for me, but nevertheless ROLL

[02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:38.800]
He's doing pretty good

[02:42:39.620 --> 02:42:42.100]
In fact, they're a lot too fave for me

[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:42.800]
Too pay?

[02:42:43.140 --> 02:42:43.780]
Too pay

[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:49.480]
So I guess they're back together, we're getting there pretty soon, they're going to be doing it back in Vegas, and they show too

[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:52.080]
Sick Freed and ROLL

[02:42:53.660 --> 02:42:56.920]
I'll tell you, it's really upset, our good friend in the sales department because he thought

[02:42:56.920 --> 02:42:59.880]
If he couldn't come back, he could be sick Freed and DROY

[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:01.520]
But it ain't going to be that no more

[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:06.980]
Can you see him running away from a lion? I mean, he ran away from a few lion bakers in his time

[02:43:06.980 --> 02:43:11.560]
And maybe a few Detroit lions, but 26 after 1 at 5, 60 WQM

[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:13.040]
Hey, speak into that, what a segway!

[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:17.340]
We're just talking about bald people like Troy Stratford and Mohawar Davis

[02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:19.680]
I can't see him running away from a lion

[02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:22.120]
Oh, absolutely, absolutely, Freed and DROY

[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:26.560]
Anyway, you can always spot a bad piece because man, it looks ridiculous

[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:28.660]
And most people can't afford to look ridiculous

[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:34.040]
Charles Alfier has been designing and supplying hair systems to real people for more than 35 years

[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:36.480]
People with a lot of money, people with a little bit of money in between

[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:38.540]
He's appeared as a guest on Good Morning America

[02:43:38.540 --> 02:43:45.840]
Today, show CBS Morning News, introducing his patent and hair system that offers you the most amazing natural hairline system you can find anywhere

[02:43:46.260 --> 02:43:49.160]
Keep in mind the most critical area of any piece is the hairline

[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:54.720]
Now, if you want to look like Aaron Brown on CNN on the Certainly Nazi Network, good luck to you

[02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:56.520]
You ever see Aaron Brown with that?

[02:43:56.800 --> 02:43:56.980]
Yeah

[02:43:56.980 --> 02:43:59.540]
The colors change while you're watching the show

[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:03.720]
Yeah, I mean, I've seen comedian ones that change from day to day

[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:06.460]
But while you're watching the newscast, the colors are changing

[02:44:06.460 --> 02:44:07.700]
And the things start to move around

[02:44:07.700 --> 02:44:10.880]
Anyway, Charles has got the new skin like hair system and it looks so great

[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:16.580]
It's 100% undetectable, it looks like real hair as opposed to a farm, a barnyard, animal died on your head

[02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:19.720]
And Charlie gives you this great guarantee, as he always has

[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:21.880]
He tries hair system for 30 days

[02:44:22.340 --> 02:44:24.980]
And after a month, if you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells

[02:44:24.980 --> 02:44:28.880]
If you're not getting clawed and pawed at like crazy, even by some people you want to be

[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:31.260]
Then get a full refund, no questions asked

[02:44:31.260 --> 02:44:36.040]
Charlie also services and repairs existing hair systems, including shampoo and...

[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:36.240]

We're Sports Radio 560, UAM

[02:44:57.060 --> 02:44:58.980]
My junior, honey

[02:44:58.980 --> 02:45:03.520]
Messages, there are known knowns, there are things we know that we know

[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:04.780]
Run, run, run, smell

[02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:10.700]
There are known unknowns, that is to say there are things that we now know, we don't know

[02:45:10.700 --> 02:45:12.880]
But there are also unknown unknowns

Courtney Love, we don't love Courtney.

[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:47.900]
We can't stand that bitch.

[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:52.000]
In coherent, pill popping, just a tragedy.

[02:49:52.500 --> 02:49:53.440]
And actually, a way to happen.

[02:49:55.700 --> 02:49:56.320]

I got a name for your obvious list.

[02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:10.440]
You know, also last night, they were the loss regardless

[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:12.860]

[02:50:12.940 --> 02:50:13.460]
Yeah, you're right.

[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:15.620]
But the other one, we're cocking up.

[02:50:15.620 --> 02:50:16.320]
She didn't make the list.

[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:18.080]
She's pretty nasty looking.

[02:50:18.160 --> 02:50:18.760]
She's a good choice.

[02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:19.420]
Thank you so much.

[02:50:19.460 --> 02:50:20.040]

[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:21.880]
What do you give me?

[02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:23.660]
Like, eh, she's pretty gruesome.

[02:50:23.700 --> 02:50:25.260]
She's ugly now, but she wasn't always.

[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:27.060]
Oh, she never looked any different.

[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:27.960]
All right.

[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:30.420]
She looked younger, ugly, but she was ugly.

[02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:31.960]
She was good looking one.

[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:33.680]
Her look went from exotic to bizarre.

[02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:34.580]
Maybe at birth.

[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:37.740]
She was lovely for about 10, 50 minutes till they cut the

[02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:39.080]
umbilical cord spanked her ass.

[02:50:39.300 --> 02:50:40.420]
And then all of a sudden, oh, man.

[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:42.140]
She's nasty.

[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:42.580]
Okay.

[02:50:42.780 --> 02:50:43.340]
Deon Warwick.

[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:45.620]
I'll tell you who else is grotesque, but I don't want to put a

[02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:46.980]
runner up with the Humper Pistoff.

[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:49.040]

Oh, what?

[02:50:50.280 --> 02:50:50.680]
What?

[02:50:51.500 --> 02:50:52.620]
Because she's black?

[02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:53.820]
Because she's fat.

[02:50:54.180 --> 02:50:55.080]
Fat and black.

[02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:56.660]
That's a bad combination, sir.

[02:50:57.220 --> 02:50:57.680]

[02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:10.600]
Nobody's there.

[02:51:10.600 --> 02:51:11.980]
I don't know attractive fat people.

[02:51:12.180 --> 02:51:12.500]

[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:20.660]

[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:20.660]

[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:20.660]

[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:20.660]

[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:20.660]

I'm just going to get there.

[02:52:21.900 --> 02:52:24.040]
There was an old farmer.

[02:52:24.040 --> 02:52:24.040]

[02:52:25.580 --> 02:52:26.640]
I passed more.

[02:52:26.660 --> 02:52:26.660]

[02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:28.680]
There came a young lady.

[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:28.720]

[02:52:28.940 --> 02:52:30.440]

She pulled up her dress.

[02:52:35.220 --> 02:52:35.260]
She pulled up her dress.

head on and he's got a head on and he's got a head on and he's got a head on and he's got a head on and he's got a head on and there's got enough bliss to pull through the like-the-

[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:50.440]

[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:52.440]
Fidel. Well, they shouldn't have elected him.

[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:55.120]
They should punish the people who couldn't elect him in the first place who have no vote.

[02:54:55.260 --> 02:54:55.940]
Let's punish them.

[02:54:57.440 --> 02:54:59.560]
I mean, all of this crap is madness.

[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:00.960]
This lunacy.

[02:55:01.260 --> 02:55:01.940]
Well, that'll teach him.

[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:02.420]
Right.

[02:55:02.660 --> 02:55:03.400]
They shouldn't have bombed us.

[02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:05.080]
Yeah, that's a good point.

[02:55:06.700 --> 02:55:09.280]
I say, let's roll into Saudi Arabia by the weekend.

[02:55:09.480 --> 02:55:12.020]
By Monday, we'll have our hoses hooked up to those tanks.

[02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:14.880]
You'll be paying 40 cents a gallon of gas in life will be beautiful.

[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:16.420]
Well, those are our buddies.

[02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:17.780]
No, they're not our buddies.

[02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:19.460]
They're the worst despots on the face of the earth.

[02:55:19.460 --> 02:55:21.340]
By the way, how about that Saudi democracy?

[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:22.580]
And now we're talking.

[02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:27.440]
Much of a smot that heads, much of a rag head to a former for all that oil that they had over there.

[02:55:27.540 --> 02:55:30.780]
And the way that they raped the day immoral and all their business dealings with the Bush family.

[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:34.320]
Those people would be like, they'd be squatting in the desert.

[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:35.520]
You're talking like it was salad.

[02:55:36.040 --> 02:55:38.740]
They'd be digging a hole in the desert to drop their entrails.

[02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:39.040]
Okay.

[02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:42.820]
They'd be singing happy entrails to you with Hoppalong Cassidy.

[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:45.220]
And by the way, that's our cowie.

[02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:46.700]
He does Hoppalong because he lost the leg.

[02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:48.340]
Well, maybe he didn't.

[02:55:48.340 --> 02:55:49.700]
5 6 7 0 5 6.

[02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:52.660]
Well, of course, if he's dead, what turns into the making if he lost the leg or not?

[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:55.000]
He just had to come back long enough to chop off the guy's head.

[02:55:55.820 --> 02:55:56.340]
That's all.

[02:55:57.440 --> 02:55:57.740]
Right.

[02:55:58.320 --> 02:55:59.640]
Don't confuse the American public.

[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:02.660]
But the first I chemical Ali we killed him about how many times we kill him.

[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:03.580]
But 30 man.

[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:06.020]
Yeah, people rise from the dead over there all the time.

[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:07.520]
It's back in the day, man.

[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:10.660]
Back in the day it was Yoschki and this one that would last.

[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:12.380]
They were making a comeback all the time.

[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:14.380]
All the Resurrection's all the time.

[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:16.060]
All the crucifixions.

[02:56:16.060 --> 02:56:18.820]
I mean, if you're going to have a crucifixion, might as well have a resurrection.

[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:21.860]
What's one without the other goes along good with the story.

[02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:24.860]
Who is the ugliest big name female?

[02:56:24.860 --> 02:56:26.440]
That's our poll question today.

[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:28.440]
729 vote.

[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:29.260]
That's the thing.

Janet Reno.

[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:40.820]
Good old Janet.

[02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:41.580]
He's got 50.

[02:56:42.380 --> 02:56:43.720]
Barbara Streisand's got 40.

[02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:45.840]
That was George's pick.

[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:47.520]

Greta van Sustner.

[02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:54.480]
It smells just like sponge cake in here.

[02:56:55.240 --> 02:56:55.840]
It's that stuff.

[02:56:56.300 --> 02:56:56.740]
Campy.

[02:56:56.800 --> 02:56:57.360]
It's good stuff.

[02:56:58.060 --> 02:56:58.700]
What is it again?

[02:56:58.900 --> 02:56:59.220]
Ozean.

[02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:00.040]
It's like lighter fluid.

[02:57:00.300 --> 02:57:02.800]
You spray it in your car in case you want to smoke a number.

[02:57:03.220 --> 02:57:05.120]
Oh, like cherry like a tar baby.

[02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:06.040]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:57:06.220 --> 02:57:06.660]
Liquid cherry.

[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:12.860]
But this is liquid new car smell supposedly liquid new car smell.

[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:13.880]

You're ain't nothing like new car smell.

[02:57:16.700 --> 02:57:18.820]
Nothing even this even though it says that's what it is.

[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:20.220]
Tomorrow I'll be telling you about new car smell.

[02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:21.700]
I'll bet I'll let you go down smell it.

[02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:22.120]
All right.

[02:57:22.460 --> 02:57:23.420]
I'm not talking Friday.

[02:57:26.780 --> 02:57:27.140]
Yeah.

[02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:30.340]
I thought the first time he threw that line I'll let you go down smell.

[02:57:30.460 --> 02:57:30.880]
I know.

[02:57:31.660 --> 02:57:33.180]
Something right on the edge again.

[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:35.080]
Something borderline you're going to sneak in here.

[02:57:35.180 --> 02:57:36.180]
Going to get past the smell.

[02:57:36.220 --> 02:57:38.040]
You're reaching for the buttons and all that stuff.

[02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:39.840]

[02:57:40.260 --> 02:57:41.220]

She's one.

[02:57:47.100 --> 02:57:47.920]
She's on there.

She's on her.

[02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:52.040]
She ain't doing too much.

[02:57:53.460 --> 02:57:54.400]
Get a life pal.

[02:57:54.620 --> 02:57:55.220]
Get a real voice.

[02:58:11.240 --> 02:58:12.500]
I'm in my friend.

[02:58:12.620 --> 02:58:13.220]
You're the best.

[02:58:13.300 --> 02:58:13.620]
Listen.

[02:58:13.820 --> 02:58:15.320]
I'm talking about oil.

[02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:15.980]
I want to try.

[02:58:16.180 --> 02:58:16.960]
I'm under the bed.

[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:17.340]
It's road.

[02:58:17.540 --> 02:58:18.720]
I don't think it's worse than that.

[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:19.660]
Who?

[02:58:20.620 --> 02:58:21.620]
I'm under the bed.

[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:22.040]
It's road.

[02:58:25.300 --> 02:58:26.060]
This guy.

[02:58:26.300 --> 02:58:26.680]
He doesn't either.

[02:58:26.700 --> 02:58:27.080]
Wait off.

[02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:28.860]
He doesn't just have the phone close to his mouth.

[02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:30.060]
He's got the phone stuck in his mouth.

[02:58:30.060 --> 02:58:30.400]
Correct him.

[02:58:30.520 --> 02:58:30.700]
Wow.

[02:58:31.700 --> 02:58:32.080]
Man.

[02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:32.500]
Oh man.

[02:58:32.620 --> 02:58:33.280]
Talk about emotional.

[02:58:33.380 --> 02:58:33.760]
Okay.

[02:58:33.880 --> 02:58:34.960]
Two in call in the morning.

[02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:35.300]
Okay.

[02:58:35.300 --> 02:58:37.320]
Well, see you at the, uh, have had a Hilton.

[02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:39.480]
About 830 to tomorrow morning.

[02:58:41.460 --> 02:58:42.300]
The hotel's day.

[02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:43.420]
Are just fantastic.

[02:58:43.420 --> 02:58:45.840]
Well, you know, you were in the hot said back in the day.

[02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:50.780]
That's what Hyman Roth said back in the day when men were men and, uh, there was always what's his name Superman.

[02:58:51.820 --> 02:58:52.140]
Yeah.

[02:58:52.700 --> 02:58:53.060]
Yeah.

[02:58:53.540 --> 02:58:55.100]
Yeah, he used to have a cape on.

[02:58:55.520 --> 02:58:56.720]
You couldn't get a hymen Roth replace.

[02:58:56.800 --> 02:59:01.000]
In fact, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, now, you're lucky if you can find a cape on like for lunch and breakfast and dinner.

[02:59:02.160 --> 02:59:02.660]
Ten minutes.

[02:59:02.660 --> 02:59:04.900]
I mean, the sanctions, it's just a joke.

[02:59:05.240 --> 02:59:05.240]

[02:59:05.500 --> 02:59:06.060]
It's a joke.

[02:59:06.320 --> 02:59:10.000]
You can go to Toronto or Montreal or anywhere Ottawa get an airplane flight directly to Cuba.

[02:59:10.020 --> 02:59:10.820]
No problem at all.

[02:59:11.060 --> 02:59:11.980]
And I used to believe in him.

[02:59:12.860 --> 02:59:13.620]
Programmed as I was.

[02:59:13.740 --> 02:59:14.340]
They don't worry.

[02:59:14.540 --> 02:59:14.660]
I know.

[02:59:15.020 --> 02:59:17.080]
They don't work except while they work in one respect.

[02:59:17.280 --> 02:59:21.180]
And that is they, they lower the quality of life for the people who supposedly we sympathize with.

[02:59:21.460 --> 02:59:22.660]
What is the sanity in that?

[02:59:22.760 --> 02:59:25.260]
And if you were to have time, if I were to throw them on Monday, you'd be that book.

[02:59:25.660 --> 02:59:29.680]
You would just cry when you read about what we did to the people of Iraq when those sanctions were 11 years.

[02:59:30.040 --> 02:59:30.840]
Well, they shouldn't have bombed us.

[02:59:30.840 --> 02:59:33.460]
And then all of, they bombed us afterward.

[02:59:33.920 --> 02:59:34.580]
And not.

[02:59:36.020 --> 02:59:39.000]
Seriously, 11 years of madness of insanity.

[02:59:39.540 --> 02:59:43.540]
And the kind of crap that went on in the hospitals and all the people dying from diseases that they had already,

[02:59:43.740 --> 02:59:45.240]
like tuberculosis was already gone.

[02:59:45.320 --> 02:59:46.400]
Well, guess what? I made it come back.

[02:59:47.400 --> 02:59:48.680]
Because they couldn't deal with it.

[02:59:50.660 --> 02:59:55.240]
But once we bring democracy to Iraq, and once we stop blowing up people at weddings.

[02:59:55.240 --> 02:59:57.040]
We're going to be great.

[02:59:57.840 --> 02:59:59.800]
We're sportsmen in five 60s.

[02:59:59.860 --> 03:00:00.620]
It is the K-1.

[03:00:01.440 --> 03:00:03.020]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:03.020 --> 03:00:03.800]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:03.800]

[03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:03.800]

[03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:03.800]

[03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:03.800]

[03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:03.800]

[03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:04.120]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:04.900]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:04.900 --> 03:00:06.060]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:06.060 --> 03:00:06.460]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:06.620 --> 03:00:08.920]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:08.940 --> 03:00:10.980]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:12.180 --> 03:00:14.200]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:14.520 --> 03:00:19.900]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:20.320]

[03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:20.320]

[03:00:20.380 --> 03:00:21.180]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:21.660]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:24.440]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:24.440 --> 03:00:25.220]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:34.320]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:35.160]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:35.160]

[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:35.160]

[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:35.160]

[03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:35.160]

[03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:36.640]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:36.860]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:39.120]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:40.520 --> 03:00:41.620]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:42.600]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:43.460]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:50.940]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:53.880]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:54.960]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:54.960 --> 03:00:55.200]
We're going to be great.

[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:55.200]

[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:55.200]

[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:55.200]

[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:55.200]

[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:55.200]

[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:55.200]

[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:55.200]

[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:55.200]

[03:01:04.860 --> 03:01:18.540]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:18.540 --> 03:01:18.540]

[03:01:18.540 --> 03:01:18.540]

[03:01:18.540 --> 03:01:18.540]

[03:01:18.540 --> 03:01:18.660]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:18.660 --> 03:01:18.660]

[03:01:18.660 --> 03:01:18.740]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:19.140]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:20.540]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:20.540 --> 03:01:20.540]

[03:01:20.540 --> 03:01:20.740]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:22.120]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:22.780]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:24.680]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:25.140]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:25.140]

[03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:25.140]

[03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:25.140]

[03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:25.140]

[03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:25.160]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:25.160]

[03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:25.160]

[03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:25.180]
We're going to be great.

[03:01:25.180 --> 03:01:25.180]

[03:01:46.740 --> 03:01:47.300]
That's the...

[03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:49.220]
That's the...

[03:01:49.220 --> 03:01:52.300]
You see that thing they just said on the crazy Nazi network there?

[03:01:53.600 --> 03:01:55.740]
Violin images to violence for TV.

[03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:59.940]
They sort of picture a Nicholas Bird with the orange jumpsuit on.

[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:03.460]
By the way, every time they take prisoners, the al-Qaeda,

[03:02:03.560 --> 03:02:04.300]
they always put them in one of those...

[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:07.080]
...regulation.

[03:02:07.180 --> 03:02:07.620]
...regulation.

[03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:09.020]
...regulation, guantan, orange jumpsuit.

[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:10.180]
And crates of them, they got from us.

[03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:10.360]
They got from us.

[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:10.560]
They got from us.

[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:11.000]
They got from us.

[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:11.680]
They got from us.

[03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:14.080]
But anyway, two violent for TV,

[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:15.560]
please don't tell me,

[03:02:15.700 --> 03:02:17.720]
because nothing would surprise me that these great robbers do.

[03:02:18.780 --> 03:02:20.820]
And what would Michael Powell have to say about that,

[03:02:20.860 --> 03:02:21.980]
since he's so concerned about,

[03:02:21.980 --> 03:02:23.700]
sex and violence and...

[03:02:23.700 --> 03:02:27.260]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what they're saying.

[03:02:28.220 --> 03:02:29.280]
Well, they can say all they want.

[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:30.960]
But they had a party, but anyone,

[03:02:31.160 --> 03:02:32.220]
for any kind of violent...

[03:02:32.220 --> 03:02:34.320]
But anyway, can you imagine that they would even consider

[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:36.020]
putting their stuff films on TV?

[03:02:36.300 --> 03:02:36.920]
Wouldn't that be lovely?

[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:39.280]
But maybe...

[03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:39.280]

[03:02:39.340 --> 03:02:43.540]
But if that's what it takes to convince the American public of just how barbaric they are,

[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:46.460]
as opposed to how wonderful and firm I did, we are.

[03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:47.420]
You see, we see,

[03:02:47.660 --> 03:02:50.200]
and they keep saying this and all these hearings which really cracks me up.

[03:02:50.580 --> 03:02:52.200]
Well, we find out about it in America,

[03:02:52.300 --> 03:02:53.900]
the difference is we do something about it.

[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:54.860]
We find out who's guilty,

[03:02:54.860 --> 03:02:55.940]
and then we publish them.

[03:02:56.020 --> 03:02:58.920]
And the code for, we find a few scapegoats,

[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:02.100]
a few lower low-life scapegoats at the bottom of the food chain,

[03:03:02.100 --> 03:03:03.680]
and we make them hang them out.

[03:03:03.820 --> 03:03:04.820]
Right, hang them out to dry.

[03:03:05.740 --> 03:03:06.620]
And all the upper...

[03:03:06.620 --> 03:03:07.680]
And all the upper-ish alone people,

[03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:08.960]
we know nothing about it.

[03:03:09.020 --> 03:03:09.920]
They were doing wrong, they were wrong.

[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:11.720]
And they're going to have to pay this in barbaric,

[03:03:11.740 --> 03:03:12.480]
and this is not the American.

[03:03:12.540 --> 03:03:13.460]
We believe in the audio audience.

[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:14.260]
I don't know, Godfather.

[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:14.680]
Right.

[03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:15.220]
Exactly.

[03:03:17.780 --> 03:03:19.260]
So who now are we, Kidding, man?

[03:03:19.260 --> 03:03:20.200]
Who is Kidding them?

[03:03:20.380 --> 03:03:21.180]
Obviously a lot of people.

[03:03:21.180 --> 03:03:21.340]
Yeah.

[03:03:21.760 --> 03:03:25.200]
So many of these people I've been talking to this week who make me just want to scream.

[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:25.800]
Oh, yeah.

[03:03:27.180 --> 03:03:29.660]
I mean, just because of the fact you're Jewish,

[03:03:29.820 --> 03:03:31.600]
therefore you have to be concerned about Israel.

[03:03:32.260 --> 03:03:33.280]
If you're concerned about Israel,

[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:34.760]
maybe peace would be good for Israel.

[03:03:34.940 --> 03:03:35.140]
Right.

[03:03:35.620 --> 03:03:37.520]
Maybe getting rid of all those settlements would be good.

[03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:38.660]
Maybe taking down that wall.

[03:03:39.480 --> 03:03:40.420]
Maybe, uh, right.

[03:03:40.700 --> 03:03:43.120]
Quit having all those accidents where you're bombing this one,

[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:44.160]
and that one, all these terrorists.

[03:03:44.300 --> 03:03:46.040]
But in the meantime, there's all that collateral damage

[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:47.700]
and these innocent people and children dying.

[03:03:47.700 --> 03:03:48.720]
Maybe things like that.

[03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:48.880]

[03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:50.360]
That have given the subsidies to the settlers

[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:51.500]
and spending it on something in tomorrow.

[03:03:51.500 --> 03:03:52.140]
There you go.

[03:03:52.300 --> 03:03:52.300]

[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:53.060]
All of these things.

[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:57.140]
And of course we do know that the Palestinians have those dangerous rocks to throw back,

[03:03:57.240 --> 03:03:58.940]
which is, you know, something to be concerned about.

[03:03:59.020 --> 03:03:59.640]
Get rid of those rocks.

[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:00.460]
Is, right.

[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:01.840]
You're rock.

[03:04:02.660 --> 03:04:03.400]
And a heart place.

[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:04.440]
Exactly.

[03:04:05.840 --> 03:04:10.080]
So anyway, the idea that they would put that on here is just a chilling to me.

[03:04:10.240 --> 03:04:11.980]
But if that's what it takes to probably get to go ahead,

[03:04:12.060 --> 03:04:14.000]
they'll probably get a call right from the oral office.

[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:16.440]
Saying, you just go ahead and put that on here,

[03:04:16.440 --> 03:04:19.380]
because we got to like get that propaganda machine going big time.

[03:04:19.380 --> 03:04:21.040]
We're up into a frenzy.

[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:23.560]
You see, what barbarians, as if we don't already know that?

[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:24.740]
Well, I guess we forgot.

[03:04:25.800 --> 03:04:27.440]
Anyway, here's our poll question today.

[03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:28.360]
We got a lot of votes on here.

[03:04:28.420 --> 03:04:29.080]
Mad Dog came in.

[03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:30.000]
You wouldn't believe what he said.

[03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:31.760]
He was just foaming at the mouth.

[03:04:32.180 --> 03:04:33.460]
Because I said something about Mo anyway.

[03:04:34.640 --> 03:04:36.080]
Several times he was like, okay.

[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:36.720]
He did.

[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:38.040]
He could get it that high.

[03:04:38.120 --> 03:04:38.640]
Oh, yeah, he did.

[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:39.300]
Yeah.

[03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:42.040]
Well, you know how he starts is your,

[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:44.360]
I, I sports fan, I like that.

[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:45.900]
Well, this was like sports fans.

[03:04:46.480 --> 03:04:47.340]
A little bit higher.

[03:04:47.560 --> 03:04:48.560]
That's got a matter of eight.

[03:04:50.100 --> 03:04:51.960]
Anyway, who is the ugliest big name?

[03:04:52.040 --> 03:04:53.520]
We like the man dog a lot on this show.

[03:04:53.620 --> 03:04:54.160]
I'll tell you that right now.

[03:04:54.260 --> 03:04:55.040]
He's okay in our book.

[03:04:55.260 --> 03:04:56.160]
He's a square shooter.

[03:04:56.440 --> 03:04:57.820]
And we know he gave a lot of mind above Graham.

[03:04:58.580 --> 03:05:01.200]
Even when we talk about good game about bush,

[03:05:01.280 --> 03:05:02.640]
because that's part of that whole, you know,

[03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:04.620]
jock right-wing thing, the image.

[03:05:04.840 --> 03:05:05.760]
It's the image thing, baby.

[03:05:07.520 --> 03:05:10.320]
Rosie O'Donnell 128, the ugliest big name female of Mo.

[03:05:10.420 --> 03:05:13.820]
She's just a unbeatable Sandra Bernhardt 111.

[03:05:13.820 --> 03:05:15.040]
It's too bad we'd have time to play that.

[03:05:15.720 --> 03:05:18.120]
Sylia Cruz 79, Janoreno, he's got 52.

[03:05:19.220 --> 03:05:21.720]
Barbara Stress and 42, and quarter 32.

[03:05:22.020 --> 03:05:22.700]
Whoopie Goldberg?

[03:05:23.020 --> 03:05:24.100]
Look at whoopee, she's got.

[03:05:24.280 --> 03:05:25.060]
BAD THIRD MAN.

[03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:26.460]
BYE BYE BYE!

[03:05:26.840 --> 03:05:31.100]
Send the rushed show on 5-6 million QAF lightning for Lonerado.

[03:05:31.500 --> 03:05:32.840]
I have to stop right now.
