[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.820]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:24.840]

[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:48.360]

[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:11.180]

[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:18.020]

[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:24.060]

[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:24.060]

[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.060]

I'm a doggy to do.

[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:34.800]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.600]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.500]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.840]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:11.240]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:11.280]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:11.280]

[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:16.300]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:23.300]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:46.060]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:46.200]
I'm a doggy to do.

[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:46.200]

[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.340]
Oh my god, your breasts are beautiful.

[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.220]
I just know how it is, David.

[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.740]
We're going to have a little union here.

[00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.220]
They have a little problem with the starting show.

[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.000]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:32.980]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:32.980]

[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:32.980]

[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:32.980]

[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:55.820]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.500]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.260]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:02.720]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:32.700]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:32.700]

[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:32.700]

[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:32.700]

[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:49.420]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:49.820]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:50.580]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.680]
I think that the satellite fell down.

[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:02.960]
Hello.

[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.340]
Good morning, sir.

[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.020]
Excuse me.

[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:21.180]
It isn't over the air because it's a satellite.

[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.580]
Both series and XM are satellite conditions.

[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.740]
Of course, the fact is that you have to pay for the service.

[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:29.960]
You have to buy the equipment.

[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.920]
You have to decide to want the service.

[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.060]
But it doesn't matter to the not too currently in charge.

[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.800]
They'll find a way to evaluate.

[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.840]
You're getting the transmission through a...

[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.140]
It's a way.

[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.960]
That's the excuse to use.

[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.900]
But, of course, eventually they're going to govern everything, including cable and the internet and everything.

[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.980]
Who he does, what they want.

[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.300]
And DVDs.

[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.140]
And DVDs.

[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.640]
And what you read and what you read.

[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:01.640]

[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.260]
Well, you do them.

[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.700]
Well, the only exception being Chinese-dyped daughters.

[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.320]
Well, however, she wants to call and keys-dyped daughters, too.

[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.520]
And how they can make money off of the oil.

[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:20.560]
That's not to be controlled because we wouldn't want anybody to get upset over that.

[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:24.040]
By the way, speaking of making money from the oil, let me take a puke at CNBC.

[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.960]
I don't know if you're anywhere near a TV right now.

[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:26.580]
Probably not.

[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.660]
I'm on the web, but I think the last five times.

[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.020]
5177.

[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.640]
Thank you very much.

[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.640]
Thank you, sir, for reminding me about that.

[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.460]
I have a great day in the oil.

[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:36.960]
I can't.

[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.000]
I'll see you in Caldalli.

[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.420]
Take a good shower.

[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.200]
5177 for a barrel of-

[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:43.820]
Oh, my God.

[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.680]
That's about as crude as it gets, you know?

[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.700]
Don't exaggerate.

[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.460]
It's 5175.

[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.480]
Thank you, Mr. President, for those low-gas prices, ma'am.

[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.020]
I'm telling you.

[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:52.340]
It's 180.

[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.640]
Oh, and rising.

[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.240]
It's getting close to a buck up.

[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:57.960]
And now it's the reason.

[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.340]
You better buck up, okay, because it's going to get really bad.

[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.280]
Because as we learned during the Carter years, when the price of oil goes skyrocketing like this,

[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.240]
it takes a little while, but then eventually air everything.

[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:12.000]
The price of air, everything, transportation, all the produce and things that have to be transported.

[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.080]
That's your supermarket.

[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.220]
Of course, the airlines all going belly up.

[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.600]
And they already are right now.

[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.040]
I mean, you name it, man.

[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.340]
Two and a half bucks, maybe three bucks, before they end to this crap.

[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.440]
Thank you, Mr. President, for your low-gas prices, ma'am.

[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.600]
We got gas up the old-

[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:27.960]
Correct them.

[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.440]
Shoot is what we got.

[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.500]
It is pathetic.

[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.280]
And you know, the timing of this is fine.

[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.640]
Because again, and again, there was a certain night 9-11.

[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.620]
When you see the connection, and I don't know, other than that 1A,

[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.680]
which isn't what you need by the carrier people directly anyway,

[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.760]
about the, all those, and a few of the speeches there last few weeks,

[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.380]
were curious about making a point of the deal.

[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.760]
Out of repeating the thing about the bushes and the Saudis and their connection about how well we are.

[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.240]
He's president.

[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.140]
We won't be held hostage by the Saudis.

[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.040]
And in fact, look, let's face it.

[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.620]
When you watch period 9-11, you realize just like Boca-Browns isn't that one bit.

[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.120]
We were attacked by Saudi Arabia on 9-11.

[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:03.380]
Yeah.

[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.400]
And then, of course, that morning, there was daddy Bush sitting there at his big meeting

[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.260]
with Osama Yamaama's brother who was in on a meeting.

[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.760]
And there was Prince Veda with a White House two nights later.

[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:20.520]
It was absolutely un-exceptible and believable.

[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.320]
Just shocking and publics its back.

[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.860]
He's going to keep us safe from terror.

[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.420]
He's in business with the terrorist, you idiot.

[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.360]
What have you thinking about?

[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.160]
Oh, I'm sorry, I think it's.

[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.280]
70 QAM, hello.

[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:34.180]
Hello.

[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:35.860]
QAM?

[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:36.960]
This is us.

[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.080]
Oh, hi.

[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:38.520]
How are you?

[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.340]
Did you sound like you?

[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.740]
The first thing I thought of this morning when they and I, when I heard the thing on the radio

[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:49.040]
about the hour's turn was what another bonehead decision they made on the morning show with

[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:49.460]
your station.

[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.680]
Yeah, how do you like that?

[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:51.440]
Yeah.

[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:56.740]
What I call to ask you is, if either one of you guys know what happened to your close personal friend Greg Budell.

[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:03.460]
He's waiting tables, I think, at the country kitchen in Hollywood and between doing mornings on some station in Palm Beach.

[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.320]
What station is he on?

[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.440]
He was on JNA.

[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.060]
Well, he's off of there already?

[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:08.920]
He's off.

[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.400]
He hasn't been on for two or four weeks.

[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:12.760]
And now.

[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.480]
And I know that you keep close to what he's doing and I just wanted to know.

[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.540]
Oh, yeah, I keep close to what he's doing.

[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.860]
I listen to that station in the morning because of the radio.

[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.380]
You're ready to hear.

[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.280]
Greg hates you.

[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.000]
Greg hates you.

[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:26.260]
Yeah.

[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:31.220]
That's what Greg had to be there and it's that, you know, it's generally information format.

[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.700]
But he's been gone for three weeks at least.

[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.100]
I'll be there.

[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.240]
Like I said, I think he's waiting tables at McDonald's.

[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.080]
And McDonald's, I think he needs to get some stuff by.

[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.460]
I think maybe you see him at the drive show one of these days.

[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:44.960]
Good luck, Kylie.

[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:45.940]
Okay.

[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:46.440]
Thanks.

[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:47.540]
How do you like that?

[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:51.440]
I like that poor Gregory Benjamin Boudelle and maybe it's the fact that this guy called

[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.760]
today because he was like the Rodney Danger Field of Radio couldn't get no respect.

[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.880]
Now that Rodney croaked, right?

[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:57.380]

[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:57.520]

[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.680]
And if Rodney croaked, could the Gregory be far behind Benjamin Boudelle?

[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:02.820]
That's bad.

[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.720]
You should want to say that.

[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.000]
Do you?

[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:04.680]
I mean, I don't.

[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.060]
He was doing so well.

[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:06.120]
He was doing so well.

[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:06.120]

[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:06.280]
He was doing so well.

[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:06.340]

[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:06.380]
He was doing so well.

[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:06.480]
He was doing so well.

[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:06.540]
He was doing so well.

[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:06.680]
He was doing so well.

[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:07.520]
He was doing so well.

[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:16.540]
He was doing so well.

[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:17.760]
So I know that.

[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:17.760]

[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:17.760]

[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:17.760]

[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:17.760]

[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:17.760]

[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:17.760]

[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.240]
Look at this.

[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:20.260]
This is good news.

[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.940]
Although I was just on the other day that I never hear any more about today.

[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.240]
Right?

[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.080]
That's my psychic powers again.

[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:25.400]
I know.

[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.660]
You think Austin powers is good.

[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.580]
My psychic powers got him out.

[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.120]
The all sideways to all hell.

[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.200]
A state appeals court in West Palm Beach, where yesterday that Rush, Leibhah, Medical

[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:39.540]
Records were properly seized by investigators seeking information on the alleged illegal drug

[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:39.800]
use.

[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.400]
They were properly seized.

[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.480]
How do you like them?

[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.020]
Green Apple.

[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:49.160]
Exactly. Investigators rated the Office of Limbaugh's Doctors seeking information on whether

[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:55.880]
they conservative commentator illegally tried to buy prescription painkillers. Limbaugh

[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.600]
53 is not been charged with a crime and the investigation is but it stands to the

[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.860]
appending of the decision on the medical records. We hold that the constitutional right

[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:10.460]
of privacy and medical records is not implicated by the state seizure or in review of medical

[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.640]
records under a valid search warrant without prior notice or hearing before that they could

[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:21.060]
have appealed. Chief Judge Gary Farmer wrote the opinion. A state as spokesman for Limbaugh

[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:25.040]
did not have any immediate comment. Prosecuted when after Limbaugh's medical records after

[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:31.760]
a learning that he received about 2,000 painkillers prescribed by four doctors in six months.

[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:42.920]
Oh yeah, prescribed by... In six months at a pharmacy near his Palm Beach mansion. Limbaugh

[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.340]
admitted his addiction to payment occasion after overseeing its stem from severe back pain.

[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.440]
You took a five-week leave from his afternoon radio show to winery. We have program and

[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:57.120]
now he's as clean as clean as he will. We can't hear his answer. That's a thing that

[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.460]
is a cochlear implant or whatever the hell they call it. What? It's an implant. Don't get

[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:05.300]
joys all bad out of shape. See how it's already pissed off. He already hates norm can't like poison.

[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.300]
Throughout the club, man, by the way, joys, you're a backstab. You're not fooling me.

[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:14.120]
Oh, man, oh man, talk about covering your pimpley ass. What a joke. This whole company,

[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:18.340]
this is the whole deal. Let's get serious. What do you say? Let's go on to the satellite radio.

[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.060]
Okay, and we can get the fart sounds back. We can get back about 90% of the comedy bits that we

[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:27.720]
can't play anymore. We can do a real radio show. I have to deal with temper tantrums from

[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:32.820]
temperamental management types. I'm crawling around on a floor. I'm like, if five and a half

[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.300]
hours of my life down the toilet yesterday trying to do my duty, I could have just said,

[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.160]
what we can't get the thing going, we just take them off. Plus I got vacation coming up anyway.

[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:46.420]
I could have done that, but no. Being the trooper that I am there, I'm crawling around with my

[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:51.400]
portable phone in the hand trying to find this and where to stick that and stick in this and

[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:56.660]
a motor and all of a sudden, finally 730 last night got it back on. In the meantime, what's going

[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.420]
on? Are they really helping me with this? No, they're just giving me a bunch of double talk

[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:03.500]
while another temper tantrum is going on. I'm a program director and the operations manager

[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:09.200]
and this one. I'm trying to get the damn studio fixed up and get down to business here instead

[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.020]
of monkey business. Too much freaking, just like with Bush, too much monkey business at QAM.

[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.400]
And now of course the stirring thing blows up in their face all over again. We just got them

[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.880]
on the air a few months ago and now he now says he's failing out. Like I said, I sure hope they make

a lot of money in a short time. 19 to noon at QAM, if you want to know more about following a low

This is Albert Kite from Tony Van Records and fighting you American intro delt

[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.640]
to my latest Hat Stevens collection.

[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.280]
You know my heart is right, so you can head up your body.

[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.660]
Got a machete with the real sharp blade.

[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.360]
How I wish I had an American hostage, make those ends and ends.

[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.340]
I was only hooting this classic.

[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:18.040]
I was onto an airplane, and suddenly with DJ, their mac is eigenberg, and wear it down on my head.

[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.460]
I'm being followed by an F-16.

[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.060]
What do they want with me?

[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.300]
The money from your purchase does not go through fun's terrorism, really.

[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.420]
It's not time to get off the plane.

[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.160]
Just relax and take it easy.

[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.880]
You're just dumb, that's your fault.

[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:46.360]
It wouldn't have been a firewood you, fine dark skin and a rag.

[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.800]
If you want a DJ, I got my variation on the classic.

[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.480]
What am I?

[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:58.860]
I ask myself every day, which American should pay you?

[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.580]
Tell me who would you harm at slaves?

[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.920]
I'm telling you to make a moment.

[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.680]
She lives in a very small town.

[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.380]
So buy Newcastle evens collection today for 1995.

[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.400]
Or you can pay with Lisa, Mastercard or weapons of master's trust.

[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:28.700]
When you watch Fair and Hyde 9-11 or if you already saw it, I'm sure you're going to want to watch it several more times between now and the election.

[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.100]
You see that scene in Chop Chop Square there in Riyadh?

[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.360]
Would they chop the guys head off?

[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:35.240]
It's sport.

[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.360]
Of course we've got all these barbarians over there in Iraq.

[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.820]
All these terrorists are doing things like beheading people.

[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.940]
Oh my gosh, it's like something out of the stone age.

[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.040]
What kind of people would do that?

[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.980]
Our friends and the Saudis, they do that all the time.

[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.300]
They cut off people's hands and they chop off their heads.

[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.180]
It's traditionally.

[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.780]
All of these things is what they do.

[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.320]
Yeah, just sit there.

[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.380]
I'd be headed out to watch it.

[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:53.860]
Right.

[00:46:54.540 --> 00:47:00.940]
So it's really good that we're doing business with people who really understand democracy like the world kingdom there in Saudi Arabia.

[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.100]
What a joke.

[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.140]
Polls require different victories in VP debate.

[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:14.280]
Early polls indicating different reactions to last night's debate between Vice President Shane, Democratic Vice President Shulamani, Senator John Edwards.

[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:20.080]
And ABC News, that poll showed Cheney the winner and they did by a more Republican audience.

[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.260]
Now let me say that again.

[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.080]
You want to know why?

[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.680]
Because you know who does the poll with ABC?

[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:24.960]
CNN and Gallup.

[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.480]
It's the CNN ABC Gallup poll.

[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.100]
Aided by a more Republican audience.

[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.200]
While the CBS News poll among the decided voters showed the opposite.

[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.360]
Cheney Edwards engaged in that.

[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.480]
Goes on about they did this.

[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.040]
They did that.

[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.080]
Moderated Gwen Eiffel.

[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.900]
She was terrible.

[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.060]
She was asking somebody stupid-ass questions.

[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.780]
Well, what do you think about your opponent?

[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.680]
Do you ever steal a freight train?

[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.040]
Is he a good guy?

[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.960]
And would you ever go out on double date?

[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.380]
She was weak.

[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.460]
She was so soft-amored.

[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.680]
It was embarrassing, man.

[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.520]
Gwen Eiffel, my ass.

[00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:58.860]
Let's see.

[00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.480]
ABC poll.

[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.180]
43% said Cheney won.

[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.500]
35% gave it Edwards.

[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:04.020]
19% called it a tie.

[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.140]
38% of viewers were Republicans.

[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.220]
31% Democrats rest independence.

[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:10.700]
How do you like that?

[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:11.220]
Yeah.

[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.160]
CBS News, 41% said Edwards the winner.

[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.260]
28% Cheney, 31% said it was a tie.

[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.260]
They based their poll on a nationally representative sample of 178 debate watchers who were either

[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:25.800]
undecided about who to vote for or have a preference but said it could still change their minds.

[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:32.160]
The MSNBC poll with 1.6 million votes, 60% said Edwards won.

[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.260]
40% Cheney.

[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.880]
It was 75 to 25% hours after debate like early this morning.

[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.540]
But then the freepers got in there right away.

[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.780]
Jeepers, freepers, let's all get on the line with the freepers and get them on there.

[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:43.640]
Let's keep this tall.

[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:48.500]
And so they got it like closer but still Edwards by landslide, which is pretty embarrassing because

[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.760]
when you lose a poll like that.

[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:54.560]
And of course, Cheney, really, to get back on even playing for your left or bushes debacle

[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.700]
last Thursday, Cheney had a big win.

[00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.460]
And I don't think anybody by any measure could say, especially with that last half hour of coma,

[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:02.960]
that he had a big win.

[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:03.960]
Am I right?

[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:04.440]
Yes.

[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.660]
Oh, it was big.

[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.000]
It was big.

[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.640]
Well, maybe once upon a time it was big.

[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:12.200]
Oh, speaking of that, X key aid to McCain gives support to Kerry.

[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:17.640]
A man who, until last week, was one of Senator John McCain's top aides is endorsing John Kerry

[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:23.520]
for president asserting that President Bush and Vice President Cheney have weighed an unprecedentedly cynical and divisive campaign.

[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.560]
Led by Kerry Democrats, can now seize the opportunity to reach out to dissipate the moderate Republicans

[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.780]
and independence to delay new political coalition of national unity, Marshall Whitman,

[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:37.180]
right to the upcoming edition of Blueprint Magazine, published by the Democratic Leadership Council.

[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.900]
I'm an independent McCainiac who hopes to revive the Bullmoose tradition of theater Roosevelt,

[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:46.320]
and I support the Kerry Edwards agenda Whitman rights, no relation to Dawetna of the CBC.

[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.080]
The unreconstructed Bullmoose will run with Donkey.

[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:51.340]
What is it?

[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.220]
This unreconstructed Bullmoose will run with the Donkey November he said.

[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:55.860]
Too many animals for me.

[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.500]
Whitman had been McCain's director of communications for the past three years.

[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.840]
He left Wednesday.

[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:05.540]
Last Wednesday to become a senior fellow with the DLC, A Centrist or White of Center Democratic Group.

[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:09.620]
How do you like that?

[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.080]
Okay.

[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.560]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.780]
One of McCain's top people.

[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:17.620]
See, McCain would have taken Kerry up on the offer and run as he was ready made 8-1-5-40%.

[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:18.640]
It would have been a landslide.

[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.740]
But then it wouldn't have been as exciting.

[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:21.740]
We liked a little bit of a segment.

[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.640]
And we wouldn't have had nearly as much chance for all that political chicanery,

[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:27.920]
all the vote rigging in Florida that's surely coming again in less than four weeks.

[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.060]
5670560.560 and the Verizon singular wireless lines.

[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.440]
WQA and Hello.

[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:37.660]
Q&A.

[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.240]
Yes, Dr. Neal, please.

[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:39.760]
Speaking.

[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:40.740]
Neal?

[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:41.280]
Yes.

[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.620]
I've been hearing that interference.

[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.480]
I'm an owner in the North West.

[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.420]
And that interference you get in the back.

[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:50.760]
If you were.

[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:51.760]
Right.

[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.060]
Right.

[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.100]
Exactly.

[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:54.940]
It stood out, man.

[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.360]
He cranked up the thing.

[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:56.840]
No, man.

[00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:01.660]
Well, hey, sometimes, you know, it comes from the kind of words they're talking about.

[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.200]
I think you're, uh, they, uh, they, uh, they, uh, they were going by a lingual.

[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.580]
Maybe that's the new format that they've told me by yet.

[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.260]
You never know.

[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.200]
I, I asked our operations manager this morning, or, you know, have you heard anything about who?

[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.240]
Well, just what you would have said on your show the other day.

[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.980]
So they're obviously right on top of this.

[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:17.820]
Our management people.

[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:18.300]
Yeah.

[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:18.920]
Well,

[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:23.220]
I can hear real fine.

[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.340]
Well, if they would just start playing a little CD, cruising the background,

[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:27.040]
we could have an 80 share by the end of the year.

[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:27.620]
That's right.

[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.460]
So, wow.

[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:29.440]
If you have good news, mom, you go.

[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:30.880]
You going vacation next week?

[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:31.960]
Okay.

[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:32.820]
We'll have fun.

[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:33.640]
Thank you.

[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.040]
All right.

[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:34.320]
Bye.

[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.740]
See you.

[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.980]
That was a fine wish.

[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:39.620]
All right.

[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:40.880]
5.670560.

[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.180]
Pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless lines.

[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.420]
If you don't know what that guy's talking about, his little bit of chatter in the background,

[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.020]
a Castro cranked up.

[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:52.200]
He took some of the juice he's taken away from the Cuban push-floppers down there.

[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.160]
And he's cranked up one of his high-powered pony stations.

[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:56.380]
Right.

[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.740]
So we have all little esponial chatter in the background.

[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.020]
No matter what language you speak, we got to hear for you.

[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.980]
It's quite a place.

[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:08.280]
Okay.

[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.040]
Let's take over that poll result so far.

[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.040]
Now, I'm really thinking very seriously about that Judas Larosa deal.

[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:15.280]
Yeah.

[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.120]
Although, normally, it don't look like Judas Larosa.

[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.100]
Allows you, Lay 51.

[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.700]
Which of these things would you most hate being thought of as?

[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:28.480]
Time with dumb 51, Republican 49, Frank Slop 33, Religious Phenatic 20, Home Mode 20,

[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:34.420]
Boring 15, Ugly 9, Wim 7, Short 358.

[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.360]
If you don't call us none of them.

[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.180]
Let's say, here's another effects.

[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.000]
Did you see Mr. Powell?

[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.040]
That's Michael Powell, the course son of Roland Cullen, that sell out.

[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.420]
One of the FCC members came out and had to have one of the football games that I remember,

[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.500]
which one I have the direct TV package, to encourage people to buy into HDTV.

[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:53.040]
What interest would they have?

[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.360]
CC have an HDTV?

[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:57.940]
Well, as a matter of fact, I got to hear some.

[00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:58.960]
I wasn't even going to use this.

[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.800]
You're going to have an answer to that question?

[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:02.760]
I'm very important because I was curious about that.

[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.140]
Curious about what?

[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:08.420]
You just let me find my crap here, if I'm helping you kill time, so you can find your crap there.

[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.320]
It's in my pile.

[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:10.180]
Well, there's Ricky Williams.

[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.180]
Do we want to talk about him?

[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:11.580]
No.

[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:11.880]

[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:13.320]
We're going to have to.

[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:14.740]
Oh, Ricky wants to go back.

[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.400]
Yeah, Ricky, I evidently, is out of money.

[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.060]
There you go.

[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:18.680]
On here we go.

[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:21.800]
Feds kick off digital TV consumer campaign.

[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:25.540]
It's one of the biggest technical changes in television since color TV.

[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:30.380]
The digital transition, and because many Americans are still in the dark about it, federal regulators

[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.180]
begin an education campaign Monday to enlighten them.

[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:33.640]
Okay?

[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.120]
This is the answer to your question.

[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:40.080]
Digital signals have snow or interference associated with traditional analog transmissions.

[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.080]
Digital, what I just say they don't have snow.

[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:48.120]
Digital also allows broadcasts to offer sharper movie theater quality pictures available as high-definition TV.

[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:54.380]
To see those eye-popping pictures, IPOs, however, will need a high-definition television set or HDTV.

[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:59.120]
For the vast majority of American households, digital television may be uncharted territory,

[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:04.400]
FCC Commission Chairman D. Umsha Subnoxius Michael Powell said, we will not let them go it alone.

[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.160]
At a news conference, Powell announced a new website to answer questions about digital TV.

[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:14.160]
It will explain what viewers will need once broadcasts their switch from transmitting analog signals to digital

[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.740]
and list high-definition programming offered in local communities.

[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.880]
Powell was also to appear on ABC's Monday and had football to push the transition to digital.

[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:28.100]
Congress had targeted December 2006 for broadcasts to share from analog transmissions to digital

[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:34.040]
that they disheartedly expected to slip because only a small slice of the population at digital television or a DTVs.

[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:39.900]
The Consumer Electronics Association estimates that about 10% of U.S. households 11 million and all have digital sets.

[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:44.960]
Last year about 4 million DTVs were sold on the Associated Space Americans to buy about 7 million this year.

[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:50.040]
Buyers have several options to heavily transition to an all-digital signal that can either kill themselves,

[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.560]
that can take their TV and shut it in the bottom of the swimming pool,

[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:59.040]
that can purchase a new digital TV set which costs from $500 to more than $7,000.

[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:02.360]
Oh, sure. Maybe Bush could put him in there again and he'll give you another TV.

[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.400]
Right. Huh? He'll give you a new HDTV brand new one.

[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.220]
Probably a tax break.

[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:11.220]
While expensive, prices have been coming down over the years and Powell said he expects to see the decline continue.

[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.420]
In fact, maybe the Panthers will give you a new HDTV.

[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.480]
So you can watch those hockey games in high definition if they ever decide to play again.

[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.300]
For those who don't have cable or satellite TV,

[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.280]
and don't want to show out hundreds of dollars for a new set,

[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.840]
a converter box will be available to receive and decode digital signals which costs about 200 bucks.

[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.600]
The FCC's Powell Plan staff, five member commission,

[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:33.860]
both this year on a proposal to set the end date for the transition to digital to January 2009.

[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:39.280]
The 2006 target they set by Congress was continued on 85% of the company being able to see the signals

[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.840]
good luck to you. No chance. They're going to push it back. They're going to push it back.

[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:46.580]
That's what that's all about. Michael Powell and his band of lunatics at the FCC.

[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:52.220]
Destroy you by the way, FCC. That's a raspberry. That's for all five of you, especially John with ittle steam.

[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.320]
Four minutes to tell the news, but I'm talking so fast because it seems like we only got two hours left now.

[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:00.780]
Is that possible? It seems like we just sat down. It's a great hour as you go.

[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.640]
If your profits are looking and feeling and smelling are not so great.

[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.180]
Here's the answer for a dry concept.

[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.600]
Don't forget your carpeting like I've been telling you for a long time.

[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.440]
It's as bad as your sink when it comes to collecting germs.

[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:14.940]
So call my good friends and dry concepts today and sanitize your home.

[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:17.780]
I've been using them for over 20 years in my houses.

[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:21.640]
And boy, did they do a job for you? And even as long as I've been using them every time they leave,

[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.920]
you just look at that floor and you say, how the hell did they do it?

[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.760]
They dry clean your carpet. Same idea is dry cleaning your clothing and believe you me.

[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.320]
The stains go away. They don't come back.

[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:35.440]
And don't worry about those scams. Those five-room scams are just because dry concepts and plenty of games with it.

[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:39.460]
They give you a written guaranteed price upfront before they start the job.

[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:43.640]
So whether it's your carpeting, your area rug, your expensive oriental rug, your furniture drapery,

[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.220]
all of these things, these are the folks you want to do business with.

[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:50.580]
Give them a call toll-free, 1-800-248-5071.

[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.520]
They show up on time. They give you nice rows at the end of the deal when you hand them a check.

[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.940]
And it looks like you had brand new lead right on your floor.

[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:01.080]

[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:05.080]
Dry concepts making carpet clean and soft floor dust since 1979.

[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:08.120]
You are listening to me, you will need a Roger's.

[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.060]
It's pollution-related, unbiased.

[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:11.760]
You need a new hand.

[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.040]
This is Mark Morgan.

[00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:18.060]
It's the 12-1 hour on Q8M.

[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.220]
To the whole, I'm going to install a fan.

[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.840]
Let's get that on her because what else?

[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:29.000]
I'm embarrassing you, you really need to be great at this.

[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.940]
I'm embarrassing you.

[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.460]
I am the best.

[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.480]
I am the best.

[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:57.040]
I am the best.

[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:57.560]
I am the best.

[00:57:58.220 --> 00:57:58.980]
I am the best.

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:58.980]

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:58.980]

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:58.980]

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:58.980]

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:58.980]

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:58.980]

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:58.980]

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:58.980]

[00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:58.980]

[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.880]
I am the best.

[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:01.880]

[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:02.800]
I am the best.

[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.700]
I am the best.

[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:05.060]
I am the best.

[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:06.480]
I am the best.

[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.800]
I am the best.

[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.920]
I am the best.

[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.100]
I am the best.

[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:11.680]
I am the best.

[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.020]
I am the best.

[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.300]
I am the best.

[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:18.700]
I am the best.

[00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:18.880]
I am the best.

[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:19.520]
I am the best.

[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:21.860]
I am the best.

[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.840]
I am the best.

[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:27.400]
I am the best.

[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.940]
I am the best.

[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:31.080]
I am the best.

[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:32.900]
I am the best.

[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.320]
I am the best.

[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:35.920]
I am the best.

[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.820]
I am the best.

[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.040]
I am the best.

[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:40.900]
I am the best, I am the best.

[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:40.900]

[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:40.900]

[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:40.900]

[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:40.900]

[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:40.900]

[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:40.900]

[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:40.900]

[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:40.900]

[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.300]
That same that hasn't got a clue.

[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.780]
I am the best.

[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.840]
But the dolphins have no fans, just 50,000.

[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.140]
Ah!

[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:55.500]
Oh, so concerning in the stance.

[00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:59.840]
They watch the game, and all they do is moan and gripe and bitch.

[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:07.000]
I wonder how Jo Robbie got the piece of that, and rich and they're the Miami dolphins.

[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.280]
Miami dolphins!

[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.260]
Miami dolphins number, how many jeans in the league?

[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:14.200]
I'm a zombie, no!

[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.020]
Miami dolphins!

[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.260]
Miami dolphins!

[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.320]
I hear the crowd begin to boo!

[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:29.120]
The dolphins have faith in her, that quarterbacks at you.

[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:33.600]
Run down the field, and he will go up past over you.

[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.120]
I'll never win a super bowl, you shouldn't be surprised.

[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:43.160]
When he gets cut, that doesn't mean that he was surreducised in there.

[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.200]
The Miami dolphins!

[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.400]
Miami dolphins!

[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.340]
Miami dolphins number, how many jeans in the league?

[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.760]
I hear the crowd!

[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.260]
Miami dolphins!

[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.460]
Miami dolphins!

[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.380]
J calls his signals in Hebrew!

[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:00.660]
Oh!

[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:07.300]
The dolphins have no defense in their offenses at joke.

[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:11.860]
Like George Bush eating pretzels, do know they're gonna choke.

[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:16.380]
They'll always disappoint you when they're in a playoff race.

[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.960]
With fewer points than fireworks on his ingas of leaf-facing.

[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.360]
They're the Miami dolphins!

[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.560]
Miami dolphins!

[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:29.040]
Miami dolphins number, how many?

[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.300]
32!

[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.400]
Miami dolphins!

[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.700]
Miami dolphins!

[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.080]
Miami dolphins!

[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.080]
Now they're through!

[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.140]
I'm dying out of here!

[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.380]
Here it is this Wednesday and no bomb!

[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.480]
No, Bob La Grande dropped over to the adult and came out.

[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.520]
I can't believe that, can you?

[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:52.640]
What about the Ricky thing?

[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.320]
What about it?

[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.500]
Well, he comes back, if the league lets him come back, he ain't gonna come back to the dolphins.

[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.040]
They don't mistake about that, no chance.

[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.700]
Look, if they could have Ricky at Williams, they could have Jim Brown,

[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.080]
they could have Gail Sears, Walter Payton, Sandy Payton,

[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.900]
and they still wouldn't be able to run with that offensive line.

[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:12.320]
They're living up to their name, they are offensive.

[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.540]
Unlike, of course, the thing we got on our website.

[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.420]
How come we didn't have any comment on that?

[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.380]
That's a fabulous comment.

[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.600]
Oh, I'm glad it's hot here.

[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.080]
On our BDU curtain, man.

[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.380]
That is just ass-to-ass.

[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.540]
That's all you could ever ask for.

[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.940]
I don't want to say Dick Cheney's a liar, but you know what?

[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.200]
What?

[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.060]
He's a liar.

[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.100]
Vice President Dick Cheney said this is on the ABC News website,

[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.360]
not some liberal comedy pink ole-fwing rag.

[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.680]
Dick Cheney said last night that he, during the debate with Senator John Edwards,

[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.400]
it marked the first time they had met, in fact,

[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.560]
the two of them at least three times previously.

[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.300]
He made the remark while accusing Edwards of frequent absences from the Senate votes.

[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.700]
See, again, Edwards' comebacks were so weak.

[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:56.860]
Like when he tried to like distort his thing when he was talking about 90% of the coalition casualties were American.

[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.860]
I mean, it was very obvious what those statistics have been about.

[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.740]
And, oh, you don't care about our Iraqis, you're minimizing the referty Iraqi soldiers,

[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:08.340]
you're about to buy the Iraqi troops, and you're making, oh, man, he let them just walk all over more that.

[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.240]
Well, country boy, John Edwards.

[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.520]
No wonder they've been keeping them in the broom closet most of the time.

[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:13.300]
And I'm small.

[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:19.500]
I mean, when they said about the campaign in Geneva, New York, then you know they don't want any high visibility for him, Johnny Boy.

[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.860]
He's not ready for prime time yet.

[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.800]
Anyway, Cheney lied.

[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:30.200]
I mean, Cheney said, now in my capacity as Vice President on the President of the Senate, the Presiding Officer, I'm up at the Senate most Tuesdays when they're in session.

[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:34.660]
The first time I ever met you was when you walked on the stage tonight, Cheney told me we're during the debate.

[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:41.680]
On February 1, 2001, the Vice President thanked Edwards by name at a Senate prayer brief, and sat beside him during the event.

[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:50.480]
On April 8, 2001, Cheney and Edwards shook hands when they met off-camera during a taming of NBC's meat-to-press moderator Tim Russoid said Wednesday on today.

[01:02:50.480 --> 01:03:01.040]
And on January 8, 2003, the two met when first the first term Rothschild on a Senator accompanied Elizabeth Dole to resoring in by Cheney as an Earth-Fear-Line as Senator Edwards also said.

[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.280]
Edwards didn't forget their prayer briefest meeting.

[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:10.460]
The Democratic Vice President shall candidate noted the discrepancy of post-debatem around the Inoclipan Park calling it an example of Cheney still not being straight with the American people.

[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.000]
That's fine. Why didn't he say during the debate last night, probably the millions of us who were watching?

[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:15.900]
God!

[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:26.000]
The Vice President said that the first time a Matt Senator Edwards was tonight when we walked on the stage, so I guess he forgot the time we sat next to each other for a couple of hours about three years ago.

[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:34.780]
I guess he forgot the time we went to the sworing in of another Senator, so my wife, Elizabeth, reminded him on the stage, Edward said, as the crowd roared, according to Edwards staff, Cheney replied, oh yeah.

[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:42.060]
She reminded him about the truth Edwards told the crowd, and come November, we're going to remind him the American people don't want four more years of George W. Bush, or their lies.

[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:47.220]
That's their specialty. We're lying over here. Some people say, I'm dying over here.

[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:53.040]
Those are the troops, of course, in all the innocent Iraqi people that were supposed to be emancipating and liberating, as if that's the business we're in.

[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.160]
I'm dying over here.

[01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:03.340]
The administration says, we're lying over here, just like that report today that says absolutely positively, this is the last until the next one report that there were no weapons.

[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.440]
1991, he destroyed all of them.

[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.660]
Chemical, biological, mineral, vegetable, all of these things.

[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.860]
Well, he should have attacked us.

[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.220]
That's right. That will teach him.

[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:19.560]
Martin Fort Myers sends me a very inspirational fact here today, which is good. I could use it today.

[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:23.940]
After all the hard yeoman work I put in last night to get this thing all back up with a phone company.

[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:34.680]
I don't want to pat myself on the back. I wouldn't even mention it. We're not for the fact that at the same time simultaneously, while trying to watch Fahrenheit and I'd love it again and getting ready for the 9 o'clock debate, simultaneously.

[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:39.600]
There was this latest QAM temper tantrum and this one's on the phone. This one's ever, oh, you did it.

[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.700]
And again, I'll go back to the fact that my agent is a nymphompoop.

[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.120]
He was at a play last night, by the way. He was at a play.

[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.580]
What kind of people go to play?

[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.000]
Fags.

[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:50.380]
Gay.

[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.960]
Martin and Fort Myers said, do you need a language?

[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.780]
I'm your longtime listener from the West Coast of Florida. I listen to your great show almost every day.

[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.460]
Your signal here is a little weak, but with good radio and antenna listable.

[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.040]
It's a little weak like El Martino's voice and a Godfather.

[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:10.380]
Thank you for entertaining us. People will still believe in free world, which is now in great danger for those Nazis who call themselves our leaders.

[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.280]
That's so little incorrect sir.

[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:18.460]
I heard you this morning talking about going to satellite radio. And I was Howard Stern is going to satellite radio, but it says, please go right now.

[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:24.080]
Okay. Even if you were the only show on satellite radio, it would be more than glad to pay those $10 monthly fees.

[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.580]
I wouldn't have to listen to Howard Stern to commercials, but I could listen to fart sounds, uncensored bits, and the full range of your language.

[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:31.280]
So please consider it and go.

[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.920]
Go now. Let's play that. The movie blues. What do you say?

[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:34.660]
All right. You got it there.

[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:37.000]
No, it's crazy though. It's another one that skips.

[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:37.400]
Sorry.

[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:42.280]
We need we need you on your nationwide. Thank you again and good luck to us all, especially in November says Martin and Fort Myers.

[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.180]
I thank you a lot Martin.

[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.960]
I echo your sentiments, baby. Let's go. In fact, you know something. I have to be a moron to like do any extension deal.

[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:54.020]
I'm not that it's going to happen anyway because there's no doubt that the normal can't have his factor to himself.

[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.400]
He's the a feared factor.

[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.660]
That's what the idiot in the end of fear. He's the feared factor.

[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:09.320]
Feared by anyone with a brain because he's just an accident away in the happen. He's created such an atmosphere of hostility now that there ain't no chance he's going to be negotiating anything happened to me.

[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:13.020]
So I probably just be smart just to kind of like wait it out, you know.

[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:15.380]
See what I'm saying?

[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:16.340]
Yeah, I heard you.

[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.040]
And then we go to serious or whatever.

[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:27.020]
Then we get serious in addition to which I may be wrong, but it seems to me that going to serious is not working for another radio station, right? That's correct.

[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.540]
Seems to be.

[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:37.340]
The whole thing is getting to be really ugly the whole situation there. Now that we got this stirring thing going to you know, I mean.

[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:45.280]
It's just again all the publicity now. He's been on CNN its headlines and every paper. I mean the master is not he's not the king of all media.

[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:55.320]
He's the king of hype. There's no other than I said that forever. Yes, you have. I have never seen anybody. I hit my hat to a man. I salute him who can get the hype that this guy can get.

[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.940]
And then more often than not about nothing.

[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:04.020]
But this is a big thing now. This you know that he says now he's got three channels that they're going to let him program put people on here.

[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:07.360]
Like I said, I always loved Howard a lot. You know what? Not that I would kiss his ass, but.

[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:17.100]
The theme says, OK, I rented for a night. I love and I started. It was great. The partner thought was very disturbing was that the Fox News Network announced that W. was winning Florida.

[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:25.500]
The entire election after the other members announced war with the winner. Also that W is nephew was working on that night. I'm watching coverage for Fox News. That is correct.

[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:40.220]
Lately my wife or register Democrat has been listening to am talk radio. Beck Russian Hannity. Oh geez. It's been leaning a little further Republican side. But after watching fair night and I live on the last night she's back on our team. She's been listening to Glenn Beck, Laura.

[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:50.860]
And John Hannity. Oh geez. Everybody see this movie before the election. I highly recommend that Steve dump his wife dump the bitch right now.

OK. Can you believe that she's listened to a bunch of right wing propagator and the Nazi. Well, I'll see one thing Steve. I don't the bitch right now. There you go. That's it. That's the answer to all your problems. If you ask me.

[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:15.960]
12 minutes past noon. We're going to take a million calls today between now and two because I'm sure that the audience is forming at the mouth about the serious thing about how it's doing. I think sure wouldn't notice it.

[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:25.980]
How's the pool coming? Speaking of getting serious. Which of these things would you most hate being thought of as well? I worded that pretty poorly, but I'm careful.

[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:39.760]
We don't worry about grammar or spelling crap like that on the show where it would. Anyway, 330 vote. Oh, but I just did. I just did something I want to do on her. How do I do that? 338 dumb 69 Republican 65.

Now there's the news day version of the eastern story in the serious thing.

[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:40.140]
How are you going to be leaving a syndicated talk show on infinity broadcasting corporate deal with satellite radio provider serious beginning January one two thousand six and.

[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.060]
Serious and stirring on today.

[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:47.260]
Serious didn't immediately disclose the exact size of the multi million dollar five year deal that the company did say.

[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:52.740]
Sure only need to generate approximately a million subscribers in order to cover the cost of the deal which is small but they does that.

[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:58.600]
Be easy total cost and producing the show should run every market across the country's estimated to be about a hundred million dollars.

[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:06.280]
So going to figures in the news release a matter of fact the sun several and some of the other papers are running polls on this would you a pay ten bucks to hear the stern show.

[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:13.980]
And like forty two I think I know only about three and a response is so far in the sun several one almost forty two percent say yes they pay the ten bucks.

[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.440]
So he don't need anywhere near forty two percent of the list and see what I'm saying.

[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:18.240]
That's what you say.

[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:26.160]
On his radio show this morning sperm said that as part of his deal he'll control the programming on three serious channels one of which will be a premium pay channel right now.

[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.820]
Stern syndicated to airs on WSRK K rock in New York.

[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.020]
I've decided what my future is during told us millions of listeners today I'm not it's not this kind of radio anymore no mo.

[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:44.540]
Stern who's battled for years with the FCC in the religious right over his Salatius shows content will move to the national distributor of commercial free music and sport programming.

[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:52.780]
It is contra for the infinity broadcasting aspires in fifteen months that it was signed today Stern said I mean Monday what's today Wednesday Monday.

[01:12:53.640 --> 01:13:04.840]
I'm tired of the censorship said Stern who's always dropped by media conglomerate cheek channel communications in April after the FCC proposed that almost half million dollar fine against it for comments made by the nation's number one shock job.

[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.080]
Oh don't you just love that term.

[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:06.600]
Oh yeah.

[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:07.920]
He's a shock job.

[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:19.100]
The FCC has stopped me from doing business during said clear channel you ex-loaders. I will bury you through an also expressed hope that his entire staff which was informed of the deal on the year this morning would join him when he moves.

[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:25.280]
Signing Howard Stern is without a doubt the most exciting and transformational event in the history of radio said well we already went to that puppies.

[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:34.320]
It's been my dream ever over did that they are the need to do the Stern is thought to keep you show on here in some conventional markets earlier this year we know about that.

[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:45.600]

[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:55.660]
How do you like that.

[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.360]
So there's the latest deal on that.

Let me do have never seen a response to anything like this in your life.

[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.100]
I've never seen it.

[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.660]
It's kind of like that debate last night coma inducing not much going on.

[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:09.780]
Well that's where you think you people are.

[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:17.120]

Okay, paly.

[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.320]
Hey listen I'm excited about it. I got a bit.

[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:26.460]
I already called brands figured out what it's going to cost me.

[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:33.800]
80 to 80 and 90 dollars plus you got to pay like 50 dollars for the cradle that the styrofoam goes in.

[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:42.980]
You know he's one thing that he talked about this morning is that he had people in mind already that he wanted to pull off radio and bring with them.

[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.240]
And I mean for somebody like you.

[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:46.880]
Exactly.

[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:48.580]
I mean you guys are great.

[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.000]
I love the way I can both share a lot.

[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:51.900]
You really do.

[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:58.400]
If you like it for now you guys you guys have a lot of opinions on a lot of things that match up identical.

[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.140]
And I think you'd be a great great asset to him.

[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.760]
He's still doing a morning show.

[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.760]
You can still have the 10 to 2 slides.

[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:06.080]
Right.

[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.460]
Screw the president.

[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:08.420]
We don't need to vote for that.

[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.520]
We need to vote near with the Cyrus radio.

[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:13.540]
Sounds good to me.

[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:13.720]

[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:14.200]
Let's go.

[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:15.340]
All right.

[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:15.940]
Let's see.

[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:17.280]
Let's get serious.

[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:19.340]
That would be my slogan.

[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.180]
I mean what's wrong with that?

[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:21.880]
I'm a ten out of three.

[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:22.820]
Let's get in fact.

[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.340]
Remember I used to do those awful appearances and sign those cards.

[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:26.120]
Get cereal.

[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:26.780]
I don't remember.

[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.280]
Get serious.

[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.200]
I think that's a great idea.

[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.080]
We got to have a motion campaign all set up.

[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:37.640]
And then we wouldn't have to worry about joys and about older peeing in their pants because we said this and we farted that.

[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.320]
You know, again he can't play in the company's for it.

[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:41.880]
It's just their reaction to it, a varying degrees.

[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:42.940]
But the fact that it matters.

[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:47.140]
You've got a bunch of you've got a fascist government there that doesn't want to allow anybody to say anything.

[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:52.500]
How the hell can you entertain people when they like tie both your hands behind your back and then put a bunch of duck people over your mouth?

[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.660]
Oh, you can't play that and you certainly can't say that.

[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:59.380]
And every time we say how about this and they check it out with joys over there on a West Coast.

[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.100]
Now you can't.

[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.340]
And by the way, Joe, we're on you.

[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:01.660]
Okay.

[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:01.880]
No.

[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.640]
What a turntable man.

[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:04.300]
What a phony.

[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.700]
Having to deal with all this.

[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.520]
See, I'm going to tell you if I had a real agent.

[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.960]
And we were involved with a real company.

[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:18.060]
As soon as Steer and made that announcement on the year this morning, which he was talking about it evidently all morning long from what we got the drift of it.

[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.040]
And we actually listened to some of it.

[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:25.620]
As soon as that happened, management of this station would have been on the phone with her if I had a real agent, which I don't.

[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.460]
With him and said, okay, let's do that.

[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.120]
We knew the amount.

[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.740]
And just to cover their ass, you know what I'm saying?

[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:30.600]
Just to have something.

[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:31.700]
That's right.

[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:35.340]
No, not just have something, but just to make sure that they extend their what they got.

[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:35.540]
Right.

[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:43.760]
Because when you have the opportunity, not only the content of the programs, but stop and think about the difference of the digital quality of what you're hearing is supposed to.

[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:50.300]
What you just wait, you got a Spanish language station in the back and then we're driving along out of the electric wires here on 441 and where.

[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:55.000]
Yeah, crank up some of that music in the back and I'll give you an idea of what AM radio sounds like.

[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.820]
Yeah, or too bad I didn't do that when we had the old compressor in here.

[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:05.540]
That would have done it.

[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.880]
Yeah, it would have been great.

[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:16.400]
So it's something to think about, okay, but no, I'm involved in the middle of all this mass mayhem and crazy people and egos.

[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:18.320]
No, I'll upset. Did you really say this?

[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:22.040]
And this is really, you know, why don't you people grow up already?

[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:26.660]
You can conduct business like business too much like I said monkey business both in a white house and at QAM.

[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.900]
And after mentioned, Norma can't that's another story for another day. That one at that Queen.

[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:31.880]
God.

[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.120]
Oh, speaking of that, Jeff throws out Louisiana game marriage band. Good segue. Thank you.

[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:45.040]
A state drug yesterday, throughout a Louisiana constitutional amendment ban in gay marriage less than three weeks after it was overwhelmingly approved by the voters.

[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:48.980]
And you notice both the chaining Edwards last night. They didn't want to touch any of that stuff.

[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:53.060]
They were tossing that hot potato back at what's your name there? What is your name? The host?

[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:55.280]
I was with the moderator. She was weak.

[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:06.800]
Come in.

[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.800]
Oh,

[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.420]
I'm sorry.

[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:45.420]

Cause the FEC is from my f***ing s***

[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:25.500]
I keep asking myself wondering how it goes to show their f***es

[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.980]
And I can say wow they have big desires

[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:29.460]

[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:32.040]

This is a s*** of throwing talent

[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.120]
All of us in the FEC 90 can be said

[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.520]

[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:49.120]
That FEC is that we have had enough

[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.620]

[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.940]

[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.820]
Comfort A2U, a one little nipple baby in this in America

[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.260]

[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:05.240]
Psychotic anti-sexual revolutionist

[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.480]
Revolutionist suppression

[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.300]
They were just looking for the excuse

[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.520]
Just like they were looking for the excuse to go to Iraq

[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.220]
408 votes on the poll

[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.160]
Which of these things would you most hate being thought of as

[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:20.400]
Domest of 79 allows you to lay 78 Republican 76

[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.940]
Fat Slob 50 religious fanatic 44

[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.080]
44

[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:27.660]
And what about if you're a fat Slob Republican religious fanatic

[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:30.200]
Annalausy lay and you're dumb or dirt which goes along with it

[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.080]

Boring 13, ugly 13, mint 12, golf and five and short only three

[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.480]

Right?

[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.680]

[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:46.660]
Yeah

[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.100]
Somebody says he's short

[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:49.840]
It's not like I hate all this type of thing

[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.460]
You're a fat too

[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:52.220]
Right

[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.880]
No that don't bother me

[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.060]
No it bothers me being short not being called short

[01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:58.880]
Jerry says I'm not sure if you're aware of this

[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.920]
But open Anthony of resurfaced on XM satellite where you want a new premium channel with cost next to a buck 99 a month

[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:07.060]

Everybody Bob Edwards fan

[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:12.300]
I have?

[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:13.240]
You're not?

[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:14.520]
I don't know who that is

[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.740]
From NPR

[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:18.060]
Yeah I know Phil Watson he's the only one I know

[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:20.560]
No you still listen before Phil Watson was like

[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.060]
That's right that's right because you know you've got to be sure he was asked

[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:27.380]
They wanted younger demographics and he was over the age of ten and so they wanted to you know

[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:28.060]
Well that case

[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:31.920]
The only thing is the open Anthony that's fine and I'm all for everybody in the business

[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:35.960]
Even people I can't stand I'm all for everybody because I'm for the people that do the entertaining

[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.300]
And then really you get the audience and bring all the money through you know

[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.780]
Sure even if it's that you're cup of tea

[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:46.900]
Right but the fact that matter is that Stern is the only one on an initial my basis who's really you know got the notoriety in the audience

[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:52.300]
And the power and the hype to be able to really get people make it work on a gigantic scale

[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:56.400]
Yes and this is only the beginning so I would give my number

[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.380]
Telled on Buckwald or I even talked to our buckwald

[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.420]
He's got a good sense of humor

[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:09.980]
Here's one from Henry and four Lauderdale who says I'm Henry the person that Lauderdale that did you what?

[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.080]
I test drove a car what I was doing at the parents' house

[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:17.620]
Oh I see great show long time listener I'm a great support I'm in great support of serious satellite radio

[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:22.940]
A lot of car makers including BMW offer serious satellite is either a factory option or a dealer installed upgrade

[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:28.240]
Well I'm constantly played by pro reception with the internet I'm played by long periods of silence

[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.360]
I think it would be yeah that would be another thing to you when you have to worry about all that silence of silence

[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.720]
Oh well we can't play the commercials on air because that the unions been on strike for 20 years now

[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.000]
I think I would enable people from other regions to appreciate and enjoy your shows and Georgia as well

[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.700]
A PS by now I'm hoping for the fins to go either one in 15 or what is that?

[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:50.180]
I don't know football language

[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:54.040]
I'm a good or oh in 16 so I'm just a little bit I guess that's what he meant

[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.120]
Thank you Henry and four Lauderdale and George like the car in fact you'd love to have you give it to him

[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.360]
He has give it to me

[01:24:59.360 --> 01:24:59.720]
Why?

[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:01.060]
What's wrong with that? Nothing

[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:03.920]
5607 0560

[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:07.940]
The 0560 and the Verizon singular wireless lines we got the mad dog or two

[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:08.860]
All right

[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:09.720]
Where's that's happened?

[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.600]
We have that in the ECS about the game on something that's fantastic play indeed we do

[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:15.580]
What do you say, Kurt?

[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.180]
The storm and they watched that?

[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:18.960]
It's storm?

[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:19.900]
Power

[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:27.500]
Put that baby on a ground again well he found out I would the football is pig skin you know

[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:31.640]
And it was not a good idea for a guy like Jeffy Lohr

[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.900]
He squeezed that pig skin so we got a little fat and he just tossed it

[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.220]
Yeah I liked it when we do what I started with that thing about game marriages between the Edwards and Cheney

[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:41.300]
Tossed that hot potato back and nobody wanted it

[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:42.360]
WQA and hello

[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:50.980]
Is Neil aware of the FDLE probe in the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in Leon County?

[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:52.260]
About what?

[01:25:52.760 --> 01:26:01.040]
It's on the front page 12A of today's post they tried to change a bunch of students to Republican 1500 of them

[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.120]
Oh beauty

[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:09.400]
Well look at the position the Palm Beach Post on page 12A it's called the FDLE probing voter forms

[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.620]
I think you might be interested in that

[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:11.660]
Okay thanks a lot, Praline

[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:12.280]
You're welcome

[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.000]
See you

[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.880]
How you like that it's in the Palm Beach Post I'll check it out during the break

[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:20.580]
Yeah well all you students out there you must be Republicans and we're going to put you in nice brown uniforms

[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:24.280]
with a nice high boots and you can march you can have those belt buckles if you qualify for the SS

[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.320]
It's going to be great

[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:26.840]
You're in love it

[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.620]
Line 9 I think the first time today QAM hello

[01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:30.420]
Ah yes

[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:37.000]
Did you notice how Cheney looked like he was just hunched over kind of like a almost half dead?

[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:37.740]
Right

[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:42.000]
Now I thought he was going to collapse I said that before in the second half hour looked like one point he put his

[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.660]
He put his chin in his hands and they kind of lurched I thought either he was having a

[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:48.540]
A coronary episode he was just going to go into a coma

[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:52.880]
Now this is a man that's our heartbeat away from being president

[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.400]
Yeah

[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:57.620]
Why don't people stop and think and say hey just that alone not just their policy

[01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:00.580]
Hey if it was good enough for Willie Mays say hey that's what I say

[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:05.520]
And you know I hope you go to satellite radio too because that would be really the best because

[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.440]
That would be the bomb man

[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:11.340]
Because you know it's going to happen it's sort of scraped full this is the 21st century 2004

[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:15.360]
If we have my part sounds I can't even pay my part sounds how do you like that?

[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:21.860]
That is just disgraceful that there's no excuse for that I can't believe it

[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:22.580]
That's right

[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:23.820]
I'm going to go be the other half

[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.360]
Okay pal I have a great day I see you in the border

[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:26.520]
Okay

[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.940]
Okay we'll keep the welcome hat up for you

[01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:33.560]
Oh I'm speaking to the board of Republicans say filmmaker Michael Moore and you've got a

[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.060]
Washington High 9 love and get your videos through today if you didn't do it yesterday shame on you

[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.420]
Shame on your ass

[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.340]
And get for night I love it and get a whole bunch of copies for your neighbors and your enemies and everybody

[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.460]
Stick out of those trailer parks

[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:53.520]
Republicans say filmmaker Michael Moore should be prosecuted for offering underwear patented suits and ramen noodles to color students

[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.920]
And change for their promised to vote

[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:02.900]
The Michigan Republican Party is asked for county prosecutors to file charges against Moore

[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:09.760]
Charging that is get out the votes that amounts to bribery. Oh my god talk about a sense of humor. Oh geez

[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.020]
We want everybody to participate in this year's election

[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:18.880]
But not because they were brought to coerced by the likes of Michael Moore said Greg made nearly executive director

[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.400]
The Michigan Republican Party

[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:25.860]
More Michigan native is touring the country and employing slackers who usually don't vote into the polls this year

[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:28.560]
Saying they could make the difference in their presidential race

[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.420]
Moore's made stops at three Michigan universities as part of a 60 city pre-election tour

[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.560]
During each program a

[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:41.320]
Bachelors are invited on stage to pledge to vote first time student voters are offered gag prizes such as clean underwear

[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:47.180]
The GOP said more also offered students a clean door and more years supply of hostigos and a package of ramen noodles

[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:52.980]
The GOP said it asked the prosecutors to charge more of John Kerry supported with violating Michigan's election law

[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:58.060]
Which prohibits a person from contracting with another for something of value in exchange for agreeing to vote

[01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:02.200]
Oh god wait a minute wait a minute what flavor around the noodles

[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.860]
He hasn't said you know okay because that means all the difference

[01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:12.080]
Mariah Maria Miller a spokeswoman of a pariah Miller spokeswoman for the Wayne County prosecutors office refused to comment on the matter

[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:18.560]
Costum or another prosecutor's word immediately returned yesterday. Oh yeah that's some maybe face to pride there at Michigan. God almighty

[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.900]
That is sad

[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.380]
Twenty to one at Q.A.M.

[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.720]
For the sake of me, you're right.

[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.440]
Exclusive one

[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:27.200]
Exclusive one

[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:27.980]
Yeah, I'm 60

[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:29.120]
You're right

[01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:30.740]
You're right

[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:41.460]
Oh, let's up you some more prisoners

[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:45.360]
Make them scream nice and loud

[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.380]
Get me some bars and a battery

[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:51.520]
I don't care if they

[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:52.700]
From my rack

[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:53.960]
Should be used

[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.220]
You choose to the torture

[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:59.320]
Cause they're just playing their game

[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.200]
In the past

[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.420]
It had to be worse Mr. Dumb

[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:07.000]
Who's saying

[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:18.660]
I'm a greybait, there's ain't a place to be

[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.660]
Friends, I'm living in the life for me

[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.420]
For the threats of you were sent worldwide

[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.740]
You might end up being one of those naked piles

[01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:31.460]
You're right, I know

[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.360]
It's just a few hours to pay

[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.580]
I've got a beautiful lesson today

[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.040]
God almighty

[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:47.240]
Now if just a few hours now

[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:47.520]
And they have done it

[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:49.980]
And they have done it

[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:54.220]
Doesn't feel firm

[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:54.840]
And they don't feel firm

[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.560]
That's how they're treating…

[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:56.780]
Sisters, are you proud to hear send your questions

[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:56.780]

[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:56.780]

[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:56.780]

[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:56.780]

[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:56.980]
My heart's in hurry

[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:58.520]
People seem to love me

[01:30:58.520 --> 01:30:59.020]
They look like they got to go

[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.240]
Oh, great, don't go there!

[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:02.380]
Oh!

[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.460]
Club 45 at 560 WQAM.

[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.560]
I looked at the Palm Beach coast on their website.

[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:08.140]
It really blows.

[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:09.080]
They got a bad website.

[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.060]
They don't have a search share thing on there.

[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.140]
Yeah, option.

[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.040]
Right.

[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.000]
There's no search option.

[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.540]
So as a result, you can't look anything up, especially if it's not on the first page,

[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:18.740]
A, 1 or 2.

[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:21.340]
So maybe somebody's got that story in their own effects.

[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.040]
And it was or not as a case, maybe, whatever.

[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:28.080]
560, 705, 60, 05, 60 on the Verizon and Singular Wireless Line.

[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.260]
WQAM, hello.

[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:30.540]
Yeah, you know?

[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:31.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:35.940]
Hey, listen, I was wondering if there's anybody out there who can tell me why there is still

[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:37.280]
this late stage of the game.

[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:39.080]
People who are undecided voters.

[01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:41.100]
They either love to tell the dumb people, man.

[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:41.880]
A lot of stupid people.

[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:42.640]
Yeah, you think?

[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:47.380]
You know, these are the same people standing line in McDonald's and, you know, I'd look

[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:50.000]
at the menu for 15 minutes before they decide what they want.

[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:50.600]
Uh-huh.

[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:55.940]
Yeah, anyway, you know, after all the debates and everything else is going on in this

[01:31:55.940 --> 01:32:00.880]
campaign, I just cannot understand for the life of me why somebody who has half a brain

[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.160]
can't decide.

[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:03.900]
You would have thought he just answered.

[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:05.080]
Yeah, you think?

[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:10.000]
Anyway, I just want to make that comment and see if there's anybody out there who knows

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.300]
why these people have cranial rectal inversion.

[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.200]
Okay, thanks for the air call, guys.

[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:18.680]
5.670560, 0.560 on the Verizon.

[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:21.500]
Do you say something about this, go and the singular wireless lines?

[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.200]
How many QA and hello?

[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:26.420]
QA and?

[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:31.740]
Hey, Neil, I just went out, uh, just kind of by, got my satellite equipment.

[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:32.840]
I'm ready to go.

[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:37.740]
And, uh, Neil, you see what a self promotion has gotten you?

[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:39.800]
Meaning what?

[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:44.700]
No, because you say it Howard, uh, he, you know, he boosts his ego in a self promotion,

[01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:46.620]
but the words got him and the right.

[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:47.780]
He's gotten you because he's the man.

[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:49.480]
Well, what's self promotion in my doing?

[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:50.460]
What was that mean?

[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:50.900]
Exactly.

[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:52.600]
You need a new agent, bud?

[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:53.560]
Yeah, you go now.

[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:54.080]
You're talking.

[01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:54.560]
That's right.

[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:55.200]
Now you're talking.

[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.200]
Okay, good luck, buddy.

[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:57.540]
Okay, let me know if you find a good one.

[01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:58.580]
Okay, maybe, uh, what's his name?

[01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.100]
Still around?

[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:00.680]
Janko.

[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:02.020]
Oh, yeah.

[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:02.700]
I'm going to say salt.

[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:04.240]
Oh, yeah.

[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.620]
Well, once they let Salad.

[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.260]
And that was, that was the training point of my life.

[01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:10.080]
Not only his good life goes south of that club, but that was the end of my career.

[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:14.240]
I mean, I'm doing fairly well, but that could have been, that could have been a contend

[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:14.540]
to baby.

[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.700]
This show could have been something with all of us, you and me and even Little Josh there.

[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.260]
We could all have been making millions.

[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:20.580]
So, for the whole of us, huh?

[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:24.040]
And of course, Volker Brian, he could be like even retirees ball spot.

[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.640]
He could actually afford to buy a car.

[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:26.180]
Right.

[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.120]
And a herpes.

[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:30.680]
He said that, so he asked Marilyn Monroe Wiggies where and whatever the thing is.

[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:31.460]
We need a hay work.

[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:36.120]
Yeah, we could, uh, but it's just, you know, when you deal with a guy who thinks he's

[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:39.560]
something that he's not and who wasn't worried about his own ratings, houses ratings at

[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:40.980]
FTL on Saturday morning.

[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:45.080]
And is anybody at the courthouse listened to Norma Kent under radio because he's a big

[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:50.300]
high-chotterny and he sold his tag magazine and he said, the play last night, oh, dude,

[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.600]
well, how did I get the involved in that?

[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:52.940]
Yeah.

[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.000]
How did I get involved in that?

[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:55.240]
Yeah.

[01:33:57.060 --> 01:34:00.600]
Trying to be something that you're not a radio maven.

[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:05.500]
And when he called me this morning about eight o'clock, I know about 10 o'clock, excuse

[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:05.720]
me.

[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:08.420]
He would just barely do anything about the stern thing.

[01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:08.680]
Okay.

[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:12.680]
Now, anybody who's involved even peripherally in the broadcasting industry, that had to be

[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:15.680]
the biggest story in years in a long, long time.

[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.280]
And all he's worried about is the fact that Joyce is picking on him over their enables.

[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.840]
You go, Joyce, rip him an ass.

[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:22.220]
Okay.

[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.220]
And by the way, you ain't no prize either, honey.

[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:29.220]
5'6, 7'0, 5'60, pound 5'60 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.240]
Look at these phones, man.

[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.100]
Are they smoking or what?

[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:32.120]
See, that's it.

[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:33.160]
That was the one.

[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.620]
Well, like I said, I know what they're doing.

[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.440]
They're busy smoking, and they shouldn't call on us.

[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:39.800]
WQAM, hello.

[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:40.920]
I don't find either, honey.

[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.160]
QAM.

[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:43.300]
Yes, sir.

[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.280]
Yeah, I'm going to talk to Neil.

[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:45.940]
Speaking.

[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.060]
Roger?

[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.600]
No, down.

[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:55.160]
WQAM, hello.

[01:34:56.340 --> 01:35:02.900]
I had the misfortune of catching some of your agent's radio show on Saturday morning.

[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:04.060]
Oh, you're the one.

[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:08.860]
It was soon after the Democratic Convention, and he makes this assamine statement.

[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:14.620]
He goes, the Democrats and the Boston Reds to Action have their convention in October,

[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.220]
because they both, you know, fall out of the race.

[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:17.640]
That's cool.

[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:18.420]
Oh, boy.

[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:20.980]
I mean, I think there's always some baseball analogy.

[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:23.160]
There's always some idiotic baseball comment, I even.

[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.000]
I got to pick some stomach listening to that.

[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:26.480]
I mean, yeah.

[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:29.440]
I thought he's supposed to be some sort of a liberal kind of a guy.

[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:31.940]
I mean, if you, oh, I don't know him, so I don't know.

[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:34.240]
Well, let me tell you one thing right now that he is not, OK?

[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:35.680]
And that is two things he's not.

[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.780]
A broadcaster or a broadcaster agent.

[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:39.000]
Other than that, he's some anything.

[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:40.860]
Some of which we can't say.

[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:45.300]
5'6, 7'5, 60, 0.5, 60 on the Verizon and Singular lines.

[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:46.480]
Line nine, though.

[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:47.420]
QAM, hello.

[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:48.340]
Neil.

[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:49.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:50.240]
Hey, what's going on?

[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.440]
I wanted to mention that, though.

[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:56.600]
My favorite line last night was, for real, it was exactly, it was repinal, but it

[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:00.920]
was, uh, ended with, uh, and that's the height of hypocrisy is what he said.

[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.160]
That was great.

[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:04.920]
But I dreamed that that that was great.

[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.260]
That was great.

[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:09.540]
Why not?

[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:11.980]
You know, something you may have a point that may have been in words, best line.

[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.520]
And we're not, not any good lines from that debate last night.

[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.280]
It was, uh, horrendous.

[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:20.340]
And the fact that there are even people discussing it now, I mean, just forget about it.

[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:23.660]
It was, it was, uh, nobody votes because of who's going to be the vice president.

[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.020]
It's always a heartbeat away.

[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:25.980]
Nobody cares about that.

[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:27.660]
Nobody gives a flying crap.

[01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:33.820]
I think what they ought to do is all a favor and just eliminate, uh, vice presidential

[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:34.300]
debates.

[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.120]
Like a horrible bomb with julieverman for years here.

[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:41.460]
I think that Tom Ridge is a very honorable man.

[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:42.960]
Oh, God.

[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:45.440]
Pretty sad.

[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.440]
Dan says the ACLU is having people take over voter empowerment cards to polls.

[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:51.140]
What is it?

[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:54.740]
They're taking voter empowerment cards to poll so that when they try to screw us out of

[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.440]
our right to vote, people know what to do.

[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.480]
You can get them from the ACLU website.

[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:01.520]
I attached one way to waste backstab the ACLU agenda right now.

[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.760]
Go to the ACLU website to give it like a little thing, a little three by five thing.

[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:09.420]
And if they try to do it, whether it be a polling place, it tells you exactly what to do,

[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.300]
where to go, where to stick it, all of these things.

[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.520]
WQA and hello.

[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:14.820]
Hello?

[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:15.680]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:16.880]
Yeah.

[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.760]
They've, uh, could you find out from the listeners have like a Spanish language in the background

[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.080]
on your, on your certain?

[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:23.400]
Yes.

[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.860]
All of them.

[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:26.480]
Well, it's crazy.

[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:27.740]
Where do you live?

[01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:29.420]
For a lot of them.

[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:31.060]
In for a lot of them?

[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:31.620]
You hear anything?

[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:32.360]
Yes.

[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:33.720]
Is it loud?

[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:39.300]
No, it's not loud, but I can make it out sometimes when you're quiet or something.

[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:40.640]
And it's annoying yourself, right?

[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:41.620]
Yes.

[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.980]
One more good reason to be on satellite radio, right?

[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:45.780]
Exactly.

[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.220]
Thanks for the bad news, my friend.

[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:47.620]
Okay.

[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.640]
So there I have it.

[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.620]
Even in for a lot of them, maybe we'll be like, well, I'm probably still with the AM

[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:52.340]
signals weak.

[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:53.020]
Yeah.

[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:56.900]
So that the other stuff filled us through with the 80 billion watts of casters cranked

[01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:01.340]
up at I sure wish that somebody at that radio station would take note of this and start

[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:02.000]
light right now.

[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:02.860]
Yeah, right.

[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:09.360]
And what I said yesterday happened to W. News, so I know all about this when casters cranks

[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:09.480]
it.

[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:10.540]
Let's see.

[01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:11.940]
Tom said, oh, thank you very much.

[01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:12.900]
Tom, here's that story.

[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:18.060]
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating 1500 voter registration forms

[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:21.920]
received by the Leon County Election Dwarfist that apparently were altered to register

[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.440]
local students as Republicans.

[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:25.100]
What a surprise, huh?

[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:26.360]
What a surprise.

[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:29.420]
After there's a big scan going on a floor, anything like that.

[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.460]
There ought to be like a revolution in the state of Florida.

[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:34.460]
People ought to be going crazy about this.

[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.340]
It wasn't bad enough that they stole it right off of under your ass four years ago.

[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.000]
Now you guys sit back and let them do it again.

[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:41.620]
Do it against Bruce again.

[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:42.620]
I'm going to play that.

[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:44.300]
I'm so whipped up.

[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:45.280]
Can't you tell?

[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:45.880]
I can't.

[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:51.040]
County Election Supervisor Ion Centro said it was suspicious enough that the registration

[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:55.300]
forms were all photo copies, but the new voters were also between the ages of 18 and

[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:58.080]
24 groups that often registered with no party affiliation.

[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:02.360]
When we saw that all of these individuals were registered as Republicans, a buzzer went

[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:02.680]
off.

[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:08.660]
Centro said, most were students at Florida A&M University, Florida State University, or

[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:09.840]
a town I have a community college.

[01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:14.320]
The office began calling the applicant's contact a couple of dozen before deciding to turn

[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:15.380]
the voter forms over to the FDA.

[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.720]
The Leon County cases one of several being looked at around the state.

[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:23.100]
As voter fraud continues running rampant in Florida under the leadership and encouragement

[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.560]
of your fat ass governor and Glenda in the hood.

[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:29.540]
Oh boy, Captain Harris, your small potatoes, baby, they're going to make you look like

[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.080]
an honest bitch before they get done.

[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:32.220]
What a joke.

[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:33.200]
What a tragedy.

[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:37.920]
Man, all you carry people out there, vote four or five times to be sure.

[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:42.180]
One of them just might count unless, of course, you're darker than Brown, than Lake Brown.

[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:44.600]
Darker than like a paper bag.

[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:47.120]
WNQAM, hello.

[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:48.360]
Hey, what's up, Neil?

[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.040]
Call up the radio station about what you were saying before and just ask to speak to the,

[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:53.640]
I got it once.

[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:56.680]
The stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, advisor.

[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:57.380]
I like that one.

[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:58.160]
The stupid advisor.

[01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:58.580]
Bye-bye.

[01:39:58.820 --> 01:39:59.080]
Love you.

[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:03.500]
Wow.

[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:06.700]
A little emotional, wouldn't you say?

[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.360]
560, but 0560, you're just cracking his buckles again.

[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:14.580]
It's extremely annoying to impound 560 and he arrives in singularity.

[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:15.200]
I'm going to get you to the right of this line.

[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.400]
70QAM, hello.

[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:19.520]
QAM.

[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:20.660]
Hello.

[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:21.600]
Yes, sir.

[01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:22.500]
Hi, Neil.

[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:22.960]
How are you?

[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:23.660]
OK.

[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:28.200]
Are you broadcasting from Toronto or from Florida?

[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:29.140]
Not yet.

[01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:32.000]
Why do you want to know?

[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:33.560]
They'll tell you.

[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:34.520]
Are you going to vote?

[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:35.940]
Am I what?

[01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:38.420]
Are you going to vote if you're in Toronto?

[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:39.900]
It'll be difficult for you to vote, right?

[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:40.880]
No, we're not going to vote.

[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:42.800]
You're giving your absentee to that one, don't you?

[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.340]
I beg your pardon?

[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:48.980]
You know it's curvy about carry.

[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:50.100]
What is that, sir?

[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:50.780]
It's white.

[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:51.900]
Yeah.

[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:54.540]

Number of a Zio in Pia, you don't give me $10 and they give you $20.

[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:55.200]
You pay $10 cash and you get $20 in Pompato Park money to buy food and beverage.

as I want to.

[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:36.820]
Mm-mm.

[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:37.460]
Mm-mm.

[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:43.260]
Mm-mm.

[01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:46.100]
You know, me, so you're my name.

[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:49.520]
This is my 15 minutes of fame.

[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:51.220]
Your ears are yours,

[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:53.880]
and I'm screaming away like them songs.

[01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:55.340]
Yeah baby.

[01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:59.540]
You know me, in the shade.

[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.920]
I might give you, I might own private place.

[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:05.880]
I can't get rid of, and then put these into,

[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.740]
but I can't and, no baby.

[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.840]
Cause I thought, I thought, no baby,

[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:14.680]
side of all, I don't want.

[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:18.080]
I'm ready, I just have some money,

[01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:19.380]
so I'm out of luck.

[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:23.080]
Right first race, for the fact you're going on me.

[01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:26.480]
I thought, I thought, oh, let me,

[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:29.740]
I thought, I thought, oh, let me,

[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.620]
I'm just sending a plastic email to the Norm Cannon.

[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:35.120]
I'm thinking, I don't want to be his theme song.

[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:37.620]
It's a minute after one at 560 W.Q.

[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:40.720]
I'm be sure enjoyed George Broker-Brine and my, I'm Miguel.

[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.840]
Five to seven for Appy Hour Treasure Island,

[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:43.940]
and they located off the palm,

[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:46.640]
that were just north of the 122nd Sweden exit stop by,

[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.600]
for prizes, various specials in this week's feature,

[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:50.940]
the lovely A.S. in Rain.

[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.160]
Here's a good story.

[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.020]
In fact, I wonder why we didn't hear about this last night.

[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:58.000]
How Chinese firm routed $132 million in Nigeria

[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.780]
via Tottenham Lawyer?

[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:03.160]
An attorney, and this is again from one of them brick papers,

[01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:05.720]
a lawyer based in offices in a rundown part of North London,

[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.960]
worked with three British executives from the U.S.

[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:11.100]
construction group Halliburton to pay at least $132 million

[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:13.760]
in unjustified fees to contracts in Nigeria.

[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.040]
These payments, many of which occurred,

[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:18.060]
when Halliburton was being run by Dick Cheney,

[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:20.120]
now the American Vice President,

[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:22.020]
helped the consortium, including the U.S.

[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:23.580]
worked to win a $12 million contract,

[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:26.300]
and built a gas terminal at Bonnie Island in Nigeria.

[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:27.420]
How do you like that?

[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:30.180]
As the criminality continues around the world,

[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:31.600]
choking and surrounding the globe.

[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:34.340]
I thought really it would let him off the hook

[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:35.940]
on Halliburton stuff last night, didn't he?

[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:37.320]
He pressed that well at all.

[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:40.020]
And as he always does, he just left the job,

[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.680]
wow, they just throw out Gnach Halliburton,

[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:43.520]
just to change the issue, it changes that right.

[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:47.060]
In court documents submitted away French corruption investigation,

[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:50.360]
Halliburton submitted a paid $132 million to Jeffrey Tesla,

[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:51.660]
a UK lawyer.

[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.680]
Mr. Tesla's firm, K Tesla,

[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:55.640]
is based on a rundown, high street,

[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:56.940]
and taunting hand north London.

[01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.360]
Mr. Tesla would not return calls,

[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:01.840]
but his French solicitor admits Mr. Tesla received the money,

[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.520]
his French lawyer admits Mr. Tesla received the money,

[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:05.740]
which he said was for advisory,

[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:07.480]
and other legitimate fees, right.

[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:10.960]
It goes down to length.

[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:11.780]
It's on our website.

[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:13.100]
It's a youthly story.

[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:15.880]
Cheney's firm bought an $132 million in Nigeria,

[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:17.460]
and we're talking really big news here.

[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.780]
Millions of the small potatoes compared to the february,

[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.540]
the highway robbery that goes on,

[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:23.160]
Edwards was weak.

[01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:24.360]
I don't care what anybody says,

[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:25.440]
maybe he liked the way he looks,

[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:27.240]
maybe he liked that big trippy on his upper lip,

[01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:28.460]
I don't know, but I thought he really.

[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:30.700]
It had shrunk a little, I was relieved to see that.

[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:31.520]
Oh, I had it really.

[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:31.940]
Oh, yeah.

[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.360]
Maybe they worked on it.

[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:35.280]
And the trippy too.

[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:38.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, come on now,

[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.100]
that whole Howard Stern thing,

[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:42.360]
he goes to show you the national networks,

[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:43.180]
every newspaper,

[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:44.760]
even the weekly reader, man,

[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.440]
readers discussed, they all got it.

[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:48.880]
And you ought to see the headline,

[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:50.560]
and at first I'll print it out this morning,

[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:53.460]
man, Howard Stern and Sirius announced the most important deal,

[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:54.580]
in radio history.

[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:55.560]
Oh, my God.

[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:58.040]
Not since Grant took Richmond,

[01:45:58.360 --> 01:45:59.320]
but in radio history.

[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:01.400]
Oh, my God, my God.

[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:02.840]
Right, right.

[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.500]
Since Marconi was an infant,

[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.600]
as Howard Stern announces,

[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:10.280]
just to unbeknownst even to his management,

[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:11.780]
this morning that he is leaving,

[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:14.240]
at the end of his contract following the end of the next year,

[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:16.000]
in December his 205,

[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.140]
and starting January 1, 2006,

[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:20.140]
going on Sirius Radio.

[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:22.780]
He's going to get Sirius,

[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:24.480]
at which case they'll be able to play

[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:25.240]
and say whatever they want.

[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.980]
And I'm sure that's going to really frustrate somebody,

[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:29.460]
a word police types out there in radio land.

[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:30.960]
Oh, what am I going to do now?

[01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:32.640]
What am I going to do now?

[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:33.460]
They have this.

[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:34.200]

[01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:36.360]
They'll find some new hobbies,

[01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:37.460]
some new people to harass,

[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.840]
some new outlets for their frustration,

[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.840]
and their history, their closet items.

[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:45.120]
I'm sure it'll happen.

[01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:47.440]
Deputy QA and Hello.

[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:50.300]
We have one thing I hope Bush would win,

[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.360]
because that's no one at the Oscars.

[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.540]
Deputy QA and Hello.

[01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:57.080]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:57.880]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:58.300 --> 01:46:59.480]
Yeah, I just called to say,

[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:01.580]
you'll be able to call Hello!

[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:02.800]
Deputy QA and Hello.

[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:04.080]
Neil.

[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:05.140]
Mm-hmm.

[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:06.760]
I got one for you.

[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:07.700]
I think it's a scam.

[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.800]
I got home yesterday,

[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.320]
and I got a letter from the Democratic Party saying

[01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.640]
that I could mail in my absence be valid.

[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:17.420]
I got quite a laugh from that,

[01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:18.860]
because four years ago,

[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:20.260]
I voted in D-town,

[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:22.180]
and they managed to lose my ballot

[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:23.360]
as it was like that.

[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:24.140]
So I go, yeah.

[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.940]
You've got to be kidding me.

[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.000]
And I moved up to Broward,

[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:29.440]
and I'm going to try voting up here

[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:31.940]
and see if that works any better.

[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:32.920]
Now, I'll try and then Broward,

[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:34.120]
Tom Beats. Go down to Monroe County.

[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.400]
Go to the Keys and give it a shot there,

[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:37.000]
until K-4 be a good number.

[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:38.800]
Tom Beats stayed Broward in Monroe.

[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:40.980]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6.

[01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:41.380]
You know, seriously,

[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:42.220]
if you vote four times,

[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:43.760]
you've got a chance they might count one,

[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:44.620]
if it's for Kerry.

[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:46.800]
If you vote four times for Bush,

[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:47.560]
I'll count it as eight.

[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:49.700]
Somebody Q-A-N,

[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:50.620]
hello, that's the new man.

[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:51.400]
Q-A-N.

[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:53.440]
Neil, I am so upset.

[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:54.460]
I'm a black woman.

[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.000]
I'm going to vote for Kerry this year.

[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:56.600]
Thank you.

[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:57.920]
But every time you talk about

[01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:00.080]
what's going on with the voting

[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:02.160]
and our vote's going to count,

[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:03.060]
I want to scream,

[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:04.200]
why aren't we doing anything?

[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:05.160]
What do we need to do?

[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:06.240]
Who do we need to call?

[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:07.660]
What do we need to march?

[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:08.960]
Do we need to block up U-S-Y?

[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.740]
What can we do?

[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.000]
All of these things are on of these things.

[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:13.900]
Yeah, I would say...

[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:15.400]
Who's with us?

[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:16.340]
Who's helping?

[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:18.480]
The ACLU.

[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.060]
When we call them,

[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:20.620]
what do we say?

[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:21.260]
What do we...

[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:22.880]
Go online on the ACLU.

[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:23.440]
Go on the website.

[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:24.880]
They've got a little instructional thing there

[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:26.020]
to make sure that you vote counts.

[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:26.780]
And if they have any,

[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.140]
if they give you any flag at the polling place,

[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:31.000]
it's got all the instructions on what to say

[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.780]
and where to go and who to choke.

[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:34.240]
All right, black people,

[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:35.820]
show up the numbers,

[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:36.560]
bring your people,

[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:38.160]
don't miss out on this one.

[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:40.780]
I would jam like 20 or 30 in the car,

[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:42.060]
man, and then you can drag them all in here.

[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:43.720]
I'm taking them off,

[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:45.340]
and we will be there.

[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:46.340]
Good job, sweetheart.

[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:46.680]
Thanks.

[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:47.460]
Bye-bye.

[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:48.300]
See, I do like that.

[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:50.860]
There's a nice black lady who's just foaming at the mouth

[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:52.160]
because she wants her vote counted.

[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:53.060]
She's been disenfranchised,

[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:54.240]
just like,

[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:55.420]
how do you like it?

[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:57.940]
Oh, man, that's opening one of the opening scenes there.

[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.460]
Right, in 2009-11.

[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:01.280]
The role where they got all the mostly vote.

[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:01.620]
Oh, hello.

[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.280]
We just had a power thingy here.

[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:04.840]
Yeah, and I was so worried.

[01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:05.860]
You know, yeah, yeah, we're...

[01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:07.400]
Well, I guess maybe...

[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.000]
Okay, well...

[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:08.900]
It's going to keep talking.

[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:09.760]
I'm curious, good practice.

[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:11.300]
And in Furnight 9-11,

[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:13.000]
one of the early scenes where they members...

[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:13.860]
Right after the election,

[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:15.660]
where he says that we really go through this,

[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:16.480]
or were we sleeping?

[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:17.340]
Was it just the nightmare?

[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:18.540]
After...

[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.240]
Listen, there's an FU there,

[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:21.900]
and the right wingers at Fox said,

[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:22.460]
oh, guess what?

[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:23.320]
Bush really won,

[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.580]
and we're declaring Bush the winner.

[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:27.080]
One Florida.

[01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:28.600]
At any rate,

[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.160]
they kill the members of Congress.

[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:31.760]
And there's Gour,

[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:34.100]
who's of course serving as a speaker of the Senate,

[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:37.000]
of the joint second of Congress.

[01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:39.300]
And he's up there with a gavel,

[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:39.980]
and he's shutting us.

[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:40.840]
See, this is it.

[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:41.720]
Blame the Democrats.

[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.140]
Don't blame Bush.

[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:44.160]
Don't blame the right wingers.

[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:46.100]
Not season Jim Baker and all these other turd burgers.

[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:47.720]
Blame the Democrats for coming in,

[01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:48.880]
just like Michael Moore showed there,

[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:50.140]
a dash on Gephardt sitting there,

[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.280]
waiting for the phone to ring.

[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:53.560]
This kind of like Norma can't wait for the phone to ring.

[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.460]
Hey, Norma, you're an idiot, by the way, okay?

[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.140]
You're pathetic.

[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:56.500]
You're a Republican.

[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:57.520]
You're an income poop.

[01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:59.080]
But nevertheless...

[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:02.500]
And then Elkhor is shouting them down.

[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.200]
Wow, the rules say the Australia,

[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:05.640]
and not one member of the Senate.

[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:06.800]
Not Tom Godd,

[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:07.480]
from Connecticut,

[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:08.420]
not Ted Kennedy.

[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:10.000]
Not nobody.

[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:12.640]
With sign-on.

[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:17.400]
For block the certification of the Vogueous vote,

[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:18.220]
tragic.

[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:20.320]
Tragic is not even close.

[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:22.620]
And I thought,

[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:24.460]
in taxi, who won, who's from California saying,

[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:25.340]
I don't care.

[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:27.180]
I can don't care what the rules say.

[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:27.840]
That was great.

[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.160]
Yeah, I don't care about the Senate.

[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.080]
And Gorsar's, well, the rules do.

[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:34.460]
And then they show all the Republican Senate.

[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:35.860]
It's going to hell.

[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:36.700]
The case didn't really happen.

[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.260]
But it must have been a lot of money in that bag.

[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:38.740]
Let it go.

[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:39.080]
Boy.

[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:39.760]
Yeah.

[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:41.580]
What a joke.

[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:44.400]
And the mass media, how come...

[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:45.460]
It's really sad.

[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:46.920]
And he also shows all the headlines.

[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:48.640]
And there's Jeffrey Tuben, I'm CNN,

[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:50.880]
like months after the election was over after he stole it.

[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.200]
Saying, by every recon under any measure,

[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.680]
under any survey,

[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:56.260]
grow one in Florida.

[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:56.900]
He won the election.

[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:58.760]
Well, a lot of good that does this now.

[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.400]
A lot of good that does all that 1056 dead Americans

[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:03.340]
over in Iraq and their families.

[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:06.000]
Not to mention all the dead Iraqis.

[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.900]
You see, you know, here's a chainy on their bragging about the fact

[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:10.820]
that we got all these Iraqi soldiers who were dead.

[01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:12.240]
Not to mention the Iraqi civilians,

[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:13.680]
which you know, to see them mention that.

[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:15.420]
He's bragging about it.

[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:17.960]
I mean, did they ask for this?

[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.220]
Did they want any part of it?

[01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:19.360]
No.

[01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:20.920]
They're thanking us.

[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:21.680]
Don't you see it?

[01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:21.820]

[01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:23.240]
Candy and flowers every round.

[01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:23.960]
Like the little kids.

[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:25.960]
They were going to get some of that candy,

[01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:27.360]
but I'm being their dead too now.

[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:28.340]
Those 30-5 kids.

[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:30.060]
Just collecting it to give it back to us.

[01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:31.440]
Somebody QA and hello.

[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:33.120]
Raise high on the heart.

[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:34.520]
Somebody QA and hello.

[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:34.560]
Hello.

[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:35.840]
Hello.

[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:36.560]
How you doing?

[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:37.380]
Okay, sir.

[01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:38.980]
Hey, listen, four years ago,

[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:40.520]
there was a candidate running for president.

[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:41.820]
I know you probably don't have a chance.

[01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:46.960]
You remember somebody by the name of Harry Brown for the Libertarian Party?

[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:48.040]
What about him?

[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:51.660]
Well, I just wondered who's on the ballot for the Libertarian Party.

[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:52.300]
I don't know.

[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:52.820]
I don't care.

[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:53.340]
I don't care.

[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:53.340]

[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:53.980]
I don't care.

[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.140]
I don't know what I don't care.

[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:55.460]
Okay.

[01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:58.160]
And quick to look at the excuse to throw your photo where you're more on you.

[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.860]
Who's on the ballot for the Libertarian Party?

[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:01.820]
Oh, boy.

[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:03.540]
There is a voice of reason for you, man.

[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:04.440]
A real voice of reason.

[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:04.800]
Yeah.

[01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:09.080]
Who can I throw my just right in a dumb bow?

[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:09.480]
Okay.

[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:10.020]
I forgot.

[01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:10.860]
He's already president.

[01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:11.760]
AB ish, Kibbil.

[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:13.760]
Somebody QA and hello.

[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:16.300]
QA and?

[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:17.880]
New.

[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:18.800]
Yes, sir.

[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:26.760]
Just a little bit to know that the signal up here in North-Browett is also playing some music in the background.

[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:28.160]
Some status stuff going on.

[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:28.880]
Uh-huh.

[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.620]
And it's getting out of control.

[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:31.740]
Uh-huh.

[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:35.140]
It's kind of journey out to some of the distant and clean as far as the background.

[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:39.000]
So I'm not really sure what's going on, but it's probably a Republican plot of yes, man.

[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:39.320]
Yeah.

[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:44.040]
Speaking of those Republicans, I mean, I don't know if it's you, but definitely it's like an operating newman.

[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.380]
And one of the bad ones are five.

[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.820]
You're going to be leading our country next.

[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.680]
And we're looking at him right now.

[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:54.780]
The pressures that Howard Dean represented often we expect him to stand up throughout KIDA.

[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:56.480]
Yeah, keep bringing your hands there, Dick.

[01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:58.920]
Keep bringing your hands.

[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:00.560]
Okay, here's a look at the poll.

[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:07.100]
Which of these things would you most be, hey, would you, hey, most hate being thought of as being?

Ugly 16.

[01:53:24.460 --> 01:53:25.380]
How about an ugly doll fan?

[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:26.840]
So a lot of those ones to go over games.

[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:29.400]
Wimp 15 and short four.

[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:32.900]
Martin sure it would be okay, but just generally generic short.

[01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:33.720]
Not too good.

[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:37.140]

At Guaranteed mortgage bankers, they've all used to build a lifelong relationship with their customers.

[01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:01.300]
They did just that with a couple of move down from New Jersey, hadn't started their new jobs yet, but found a house they loved.

[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:05.840]
The couple hadn't lived in town for more than a week, had very little money to put down and wanted to close in 10 days.

[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.860]
And the good news is that Guaranteed mortgage bankers was able to secure their buyers' needs in order to close on time.

Don't lie.

[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:06.360]
All the heartburn.

[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:11.360]
Don't go dumb, every time I see.

[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:14.840]
Don't go dumb, every time I see.

[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.760]
Every part of him wins.

[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:22.620]
Don't go dumb, all in my TV.

[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:26.340]
He's president of the f***er.

[01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:31.740]
Repubbing it must have been in our chamber in the idiot.

[01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:37.880]
I don't know why they wouldn't want to shove a nice shirt.

[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:40.440]
First room to live for you.

[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:44.740]
Oh, with president of f***er.

[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:52.640]
Oh, what I get to, the most unsposed.

[01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:56.980]
And get to we all voted for.

[01:55:56.980 --> 01:55:59.400]
Oh, why?

[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:02.480]
Yeah, you want this?

[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:07.820]
Don't go dumb, it's running stupidly.

[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:13.740]
Don't go dumb, I'm this drunk, it's rich here.

[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:17.060]
I'm gonna make you a dumb, he's even.

[01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:19.040]
No more than me.

[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:22.400]
He's president of the f***er.

[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.280]
Yeah, don't care what it is.

[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:28.720]
You got him here by her bro, the Chris.

[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:33.700]
Oh, what better if you and I have a little fear.

[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:36.380]
We've got a great leader here.

[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:37.540]
What's all this?

[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.120]
President of f***er.

[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:42.180]
President of f***er.

[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:46.600]
Don't even think of Boxes, that's just why I asked you to.

[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:50.360]
Anyway, Doug Thompson writes this rant on Capitol Hill,

[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.300]
blue which you don't like his website too much, but I do.

[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:55.840]
Pathological liar is from 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue.

[01:56:55.900 --> 01:57:00.060]
He says you almost have to feel sorry for the bumbley idiots that infect the Bush administration like Lice.

[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:00.800]
Almost.

[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:03.920]
They've pulled so many lies, twisted the facts so many times,

[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:10.000]
and changed their story so often that you need a playbook to keep tabs on all the misinformation that comes out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

[01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:15.060]
From the time George W. Bush started building his propaganda campaign to justify the invasion of Iraq,

[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:19.580]
he insisted his administration had conclusive evidence of a link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda,

[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:21.460]
the masterminds of the 9-11 attacks.

[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:24.340]
A CIA report sent to the White House last week, however,

[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:28.600]
affirms what the agency has said all along that no conclusive evidence exists of such a link.

[01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:33.800]
If Vice President Dick Taney continued to preach the company line last night as the baby challenge had gone Edwards,

[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:38.760]
the Defense Secretary Rosefeld changed two stories over the weekend and then changed the back again.

[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:44.740]
Firstly, Saddam never saw any proof of a link and then he said he was misunderstood in the speech where he said that the proof didn't exist.

[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:49.260]
He also said in the TV interview on Sunday that a rax mysterious weapons of mass destruction did not exist,

[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:51.060]
then claimed on Monday that they did.

[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:58.000]
The President said earlier this year that there was never any question that aluminum tubes sucked by Hussein were to be used for the production of weapons-grade uranium,

[01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:04.380]
but National Security Advisor, Khan Ali Zerai, said over the weekend that there were doubts all along about the real purpose of the tubes.

[01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:10.120]
The tubes, maybe those were the applicator tubes from Preparation Rush from the OIVB, whatever it is.

[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:14.580]
First told the American people over and over again that there were enough troops to interact to get the job done,

[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:18.160]
but Paul Bramber, the first man put in charge of a rax reconstruction, says we never did.

[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:22.800]
We paid a big price for not stopping it because it established an atmosphere of lawless-

[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:26.980]
lawlessness we never had enough troops on the ground. Bramber said money of news conference in West Virginia.

[01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:33.600]
This pattern lies doesn't stop with Iraq, the White House ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to withhold the truth about health hazards

[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.300]
in the Iron Man Hatton after the World Trade Center towers collapsed.

[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:41.600]
The Bush administration would held the true cost of the so-called Medicare reform from Congress to make sure that the bill passed,

[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:45.760]
and the President's lie consistently about progress or lack thereof of his war on terror.

[01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:50.660]
Bush has a pattern of lying, a pathology as deep as Bill Clinton's inability to tell the truth,

[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.140]
his pathological lies, however, are far more dangerous.

[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:58.360]
Clinton lied about banging interns, Bush's lies, about issues that send Americans in a harm's way,

[01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:01.160]
and has today brought more than 1,000 home-and-body bags.

[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:07.200]
His lies have torn our country apart, places in a war we probably can't win, destroyed American credibility with its allies,

[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:10.380]
and left most of us wondering as helpless as any victim of a com game.

[01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:14.540]
They like that. Pretty good stuff he writes. I sure would go to the point.

[01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:16.980]
Doesn't the poll any punches, mince any words?

[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:18.700]
Yeah, in spite of that, Losey website.

[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:21.340]
Right, the one that you don't like.

[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:22.260]
Right, yeah. I forgot.

[01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:27.860]
560-70560, £560 on the Verizon singular wireless lines.

[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.600]
As the phones are just smoking today because of the Howard Stern announcement,

[01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:37.160]
and giving serious going on to West Syrias January 1, 2006,

[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:39.200]
WQAM, hello.

[01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:42.280]
Not there. They weren't serious. WQAM, hello.

[01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:46.120]
And back at you. Oh, they're all coming out now.

[01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.900]
See, they're kind of hanging back a couple of days, but now they're coming out.

[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:52.220]
That's good. At least we know this whole life. Like I said, that's bad.

[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:53.460]
WQAM, hello.

[01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:59.380]
560-70560, £560, just bang on it. WQAM, hello.

[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:01.760]
Victoria, God, he's a hottie.

[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:05.100]
They're great. WQAM, hello. In the show still sucks. QAM, hello.

[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:08.220]
Yes, one of the couple about the IPVB last night.

[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:10.920]
Yes. Go ahead.

[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:17.120]
I just think that you know that a lot of people are saying how chaining just destroyed Edwards.

[02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:20.520]
Who said that? Well, Chris Matthews said it.

[02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:23.180]
Well, that must make it so there, huh?

[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:29.020]
Tommy Gettysmouth fixed. 560-70560, £560 on a Verizon and single wireless.

[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:33.880]
The MSNBC pool of 1.7 million people voted 60% said it was one of the debate.

[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:38.480]
40% said chaining one of the debate. Like I said all along, it was coma inducing.

[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:40.900]
It was ponderous. It was needless of the necessary.

[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:45.240]
Both of them, I give them both an F on their performance for failure.

[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:46.840]
Oh, I was going to ask for it.

[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:49.280]
Or maybe we'd like to drop the F bomb as I mean.

[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:52.280]
Maybe that's just what he meant with Pat Leahy that day in the Senate.

[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:54.980]
You're just a failure as in failure you.

[02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:57.980]
Maybe that's where he went to school, failure you.

[02:00:58.820 --> 02:00:59.500]
WQAM, hello.

[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:00.420]
Neil.

[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:01.220]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.680]
Regarding last night's debate, I kind of like Edwards' approach.

[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:09.260]
But Cheney, for the way he was sitting, he was mumbling his microphone.

[02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:12.600]
Uh-huh. And he just wanted me to go, uh-huh.

[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:13.680]
Oh, yeah.

[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:18.300]
WQAM, hello.

[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:18.960]
How's that?

[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:21.340]
Wow. WQAM, hello.

[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:22.660]
Hello.

[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:23.560]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:24.320]
Neil.

[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:25.000]
Yes.

[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:27.760]
Yeah. What age do you stop being a bedwetter?

[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:28.340]
Okay, great.

[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:29.360]
WQAM, hello.

[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:31.920]
QAM.

[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:33.240]
Hello.

[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:34.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:35.300]
Yes.

[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:36.500]
I have a question for Neil.

[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:37.380]
Speaking.

[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:38.880]
Or a statement actually.

[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:39.320]
Yes.

[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:40.420]
Just a different.

[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:41.500]
Okay.

[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:45.960]
I'll just take that up Fahrenheit 9-11 at that time.

[02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:46.500]

[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:47.960]
For $14.

[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:48.800]
Really?

[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:49.760]
And uh-huh.

[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:50.360]
And uh-huh.

[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:52.740]
And uh-huh.

[02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:53.240]
And uh-huh.

[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:53.940]
And uh-huh.

[02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:55.420]
Didn't make for us such sweet dreams.

[02:01:57.420 --> 02:01:57.800]
Right.

[02:01:58.920 --> 02:01:59.300]
Why?

[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:01.420]
I just-it is a lot of the Thursday and Thursdays.

[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:01.560]
Why?

[02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:02.180]
I said right.

[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:02.920]
And have a great day.

[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:03.200]
Okay.

[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:04.220]
I think he had a little way.

[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:04.520]
Have a little way.

[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:04.820]
Have a little way.

[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:05.040]

[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:08.040]
Okay.

[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:08.040]

[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:08.580]
So, I think we have a lot of questions.

[02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:08.580]

[02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:08.600]
I don't know.

[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:08.680]
I don't know.

[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:09.760]
So, I think we have a question for you.

[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:09.760]

[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:09.760]

[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:09.820]
I don't know.

[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:10.400]
We have a question for you.

[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:10.400]

[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:10.400]

[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:10.400]

[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:10.400]

[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:10.400]

[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:10.400]

[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:10.400]

[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:12.540]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:15.940]
A couple of calls though you have someone who just absolutely prize me

[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:18.240]
knows when they got talking about this little macaron party craft.

[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:18.900]
Yeah.

[02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:20.480]
And you handle it very nicely.

[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:24.140]
But I had a argument that special friends here today and I think we like it a lot.

[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:25.340]
It's a two party system.

[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:26.060]
And you do.

[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:26.300]

[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:26.820]
And you do.

[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:27.040]

[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:27.080]
And you do.

[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:27.640]
And you do.

[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:28.320]
And you do.

[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:29.340]
And you do.

[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:35.980]
And you do.

[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:36.480]
And you do.

[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:36.480]

[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:37.700]
And you do.

[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:38.020]
And you do.

[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:38.340]
And you do.

[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:38.520]
And you do.

[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:38.520]

[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:38.560]
And you do.

[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:38.560]

[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:38.800]
And you do.

[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:38.840]

[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:40.640]
And you do.

[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:43.060]
And you do.

[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:43.960]
And you do.

[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:44.540]
And you do.

[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:44.540]

[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:44.540]

[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.080]
Only the commentator has in a message can tell you.

[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:45.080]

[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:45.080]

[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:45.080]

[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:45.080]

[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:45.080]

[02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:47.660]
People did.

[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:55.640]
They are not there who is with you.

[02:02:56.380 --> 02:03:01.040]
They are with us there.

[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:06.840]
They are in a rather difficult situation when they want you to join

[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:07.060]
three of sequins for the Zaplocks.

[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:09.840]
I do not think they are there.

[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:13.940]
When they are in a

[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:17.640]
Or maybe I'll get secret agent man, maybe that'll do.

[02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:19.180]
Maybe Johnny Rubber is like to handle the deal.

[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:20.820]
Or secret agent that will be working.

[02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:22.800]
He'll be pressing the email me something that I can't open it up in.

[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:23.900]
No, I'm just going away.

[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:27.620]
Okay, just take your baseball cards and all your jocks, wraps and your baseballs, not

[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:28.360]
your fag knives.

[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:29.160]
Just go away.

[02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:30.280]
Okay, don't bother me anymore.

[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:31.720]
Don't call it here just to leave me alone.

[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:34.260]
He just makes my skin crawl.

[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:36.060]
Somebody QA in, hello?

[02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:38.580]
QA in?

[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:40.620]
Hey Neil, can I have your sir?

[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:45.660]
Listen, far as I'm going to serious, I kind of predicted that.

[02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:50.560]
I'm a lifelong Republican, but I never go to Virginia credit in my life and I'm going

[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:51.740]
to vote for Kerry this year.

[02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:52.800]
I don't even like the man.

[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:56.960]
I don't even like the man, but I like the Bush regime even less than the far right

[02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:57.900]
taking over the party.

[02:03:58.160 --> 02:03:59.100]
Well, he's about to die.

[02:03:59.200 --> 02:03:59.680]
That's what we need.

[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:00.540]
We got to have the buffer.

[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:05.500]
And I'm a little upset with this Democrat for completely ignoring that the way our civil

[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:06.620]
liberties are being taken away.

[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:08.140]
No one's even brought that up yet.

[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:09.400]
Everybody's afraid of that subject.

[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:14.560]
Well, they've once in a while to make some minimal comment about the Patriot Act and about

[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:18.140]
eroding our liberties, but at least about 10 seconds and then they go back to the other

[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:18.860]
scripted press.

[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:20.840]
Right, well that's the thing that concerns me the most.

[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:24.220]
Whoever's going to be empowered by take care of work to our state, I'm not worried about

[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:26.460]
that, but I am worried that was going on internally.

[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:30.200]
And that's why I got to vote for Kerry this year for the first time I'm going to vote

[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:30.500]
for a Democrat.

[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:31.400]
And that's it.

[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:32.160]
Excellent.

[02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:32.660]
Good news.

[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:33.360]
There's a lot, Kelly.

[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:34.720]
And you like that?

[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:35.260]
There's one.

[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:38.600]
We're building them one at a time, whether our fat ass governor likes it or not.

[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:39.440]
Hey, Jan, guess what?

[02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:40.180]
You lose.

[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:40.960]
You lose.

[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.620]
I don't care about any polls.

[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:43.420]
You're going to see it.

[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:45.320]
It's going to be 80 trillion dark folks are going to be voting.

[02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:49.560]
And a lot of those old Julios are pissed off and fired up about the new Bush policy on Cuba.

[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:50.740]
And I got it, huh?

[02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:51.220]
See?

[02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:52.060]
That's right.

[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:55.100]
And the Arabs, we know that a lot of Arabs in Florida.

[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.120]
But third man.

[02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:59.580]
Well, at least the ones in Dearborn, Michigan, they're all voting for all of you know, I didn't

[02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:00.100]
like again.

[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:03.380]
I didn't mention this on the air, but no, we talked about it before the show.

[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:04.520]
What else was he going to say?

[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:06.740]
The one question, oh, what do you mean what was he going to say?

[02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:09.320]
He shouldn't have said something about the Palestinians.

[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:11.480]
Political suicide.

[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:15.540]
And both Karen Edwards, man, sucking up for that Jewish vote, and I was disgusting last

[02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:17.300]
time when she asked the one question down there.

[02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:18.560]
Of course, she was so weak.

[02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:19.880]
She was tragic.

[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:22.820]
Man, the moderator, PBS, my ass.

[02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:24.260]
How do you do that?

[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:27.840]
You know, nothing at all about you know, we can't have any more of these suicide bombers

[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:29.000]
killing those poor little children.

[02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:31.280]
And of course, the Palestinian children are dying over there.

[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:32.060]
Forget about them.

[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:33.900]
Okay, their animals anyway, let them lose their schmock.

[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:35.060]
Three to one to his lower sand.

[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:35.480]
Yeah.

[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:36.460]
Forget about that.

[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:40.700]
And then I thought it was going to start saying something about Ariel Shiro and that's

[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:41.080]
bad ass.

[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:44.240]
I thought he was going to actually say something good at all about his courageous

[02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:46.280]
stance of, you know, closing down the settlements.

[02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:47.140]
Yeah, right.

[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:48.100]
Close and wide.

[02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:49.440]
Who knows?

[02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:51.380]
Who the hell has any idea?

[02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:56.360]
All we know is we need a lot bigger fences and a lot more dead Palestinians.

[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:58.900]
That's the Shiro and Middle East peace man.

[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:03.380]
27 past one at five, 60 WQN.

[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:07.440]
Emerald Coast South Florida's best Asian buffet is excited around the arrival of lobster

[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:07.740]
fest.

[02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:08.420]
Ready, Josh?

[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:10.220]
Ready.

[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:14.440]
Every weekend I come and enjoy as much main lobsters you can eat.

[02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:15.020]
That is correct.

[02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:16.220]
All you can eat lobster.

[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:19.020]
Whoever heard of that who else in South Florida would even think about offering a

[02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:19.140]
bet.

[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:24.080]
Also, Emerald Coast is serving lobster, bisque, Jonas Stone crab, roasted duck and grilled.

[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:24.980]
See him.

[02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:29.020]
Emerald Coast is no ordinary Asian buffet like so many of the other pedestrian ones out

[02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:32.520]
through the services impeccable and you never leave empty stomach there.

[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:36.500]
Start off your delectable eating experience with six different soups dozens of succulent

[02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:36.900]
on phrase.

[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:38.180]
Hey, Joyce, can we say succulent?

[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:38.620]
No.

[02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:43.340]
Dozens of delicious on phrase like the Earth's Strip made order as well as grilled salmon.

[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:46.980]
And if you still have room sample, they hand-track prime rib and their new Thai specialties

[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:51.960]
to the Emerald Coast promotes the healthy living because they use no crap, no MSG, no corn

[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:52.260]
starch.

[02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:54.220]
They cook everything only in cholesterol for your own.

[02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:58.820]
And the buffet features a huge salad bar full of Chinese food on up in the brand new sushi

[02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:00.380]
bar because it is urban as well.

[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:02.160]
A full dessert bar too if you have any room left.

[02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:06.400]
Feed during Belgian waffles, pies, cakes, pastries, ice cream with all your favorite toppings,

[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:07.720]
even fresh fruit.

[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.420]
The perfect ending to a real pig out.

[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:10.440]
Three locations for you.

[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:13.860]
You'll find the Emerald Coast in sunrise, sunny hours and even pember pies.

[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:18.020]
So if they got some fish, foja, the entire family or your next business lesson right now

[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:19.480]
take out the living always available too.

[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:23.980]
Emerald Coast was voted number one by Zagat restaurant reviews and the prestigious Psychotic

[02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:26.360]
WSV and News and Southflow is best Asian buffet.

[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:31.680]
For information or reservations called 9-5-4, 572-3822.

[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:37.540]
That's 9-5-4, 572-3822 for the unbeatable Emerald Coast Chinese buffet.

[02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:42.920]
You are listening to meaningful news of Russia's exclusive late un-5-6-8.

[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:49.080]
Only in the Banana Republic baby, only in Miami.

[02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:59.060]
Here goes automatically, got humiliated by the shooters at the DOP.

[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:53.400]
The most defended by most hating thought of as dumb 119.

[02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:54.820]
So he said, where are you dumb?

[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:59.460]
The Republican 108 allows you to lay 106 fat slabs 74.

[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:03.420]
It would be higher except most of us are fat slabs.

[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:06.280]
Religious Fanatic 73, that moved up nicely, didn't it?

[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:08.200]
Good job Neil, thank you.

[02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:11.440]
A Homo 41, oh no, no Homo.

[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.500]
Boring 26, only 21, Dolphan 20, a Wim 15 and short only 4.

[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:19.740]
Nobody would mind me if thought of as being short.

[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:23.200]
I guess that's probably because there aren't that many short people anyway.

[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:27.960]
I'm not thinking about you necessarily, although probably.

[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:29.820]
But there really aren't that many short people.

[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:32.100]
As you and Andy Calb was real short, real sheep.

[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.640]
And we got Maddie Bell.

[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:39.520]
Many bellicians are short, he's like little fusion.

[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:44.800]
In other words, he's small, he's a teeny tiny little makefully person, underlying the

[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:45.440]
makefully part.

[02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:46.900]
WQA and hello.

[02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:49.720]
WQA and hello.

[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:51.720]
I've talked to my parents.

[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:52.740]
Welcome, congratulations.

[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:53.820]
Dominic QA and hello.

[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:54.680]
Neil.

[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:55.560]
Yes sir.

[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:58.460]
For your post, you need to hold them young on there.

[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:00.520]
You know, they've been called old.

[02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:02.540]
I like that, old is good, yeah.

[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:06.580]
Hey, Oliya, could you play on top of old one, the election?

[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:08.320]
How to vote?

[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:10.320]
Yeah, I like to know.

[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:13.460]
Maybe you can just sing it.

[02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:15.000]
Can't do that.

[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:16.980]
That's soon I have this love, man.

[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:18.780]
It'll tell some of our valuable air time here.

[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.480]
And we won't be able to get on those great calls, like we've had this hour.

[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:24.760]
Oh, I'd like to know who won the election.

[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:29.220]
Said I'd like to know who won the election.

[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:31.460]
How to vote?

[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:32.360]
How to vote?

[02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:32.700]
How to vote?

[02:11:32.700 --> 02:11:32.700]

[02:11:32.700 --> 02:11:32.700]

[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:33.660]
How to vote?

[02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:35.000]
How to vote over?

[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:36.120]
How to vote, man.

[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:36.680]
How to vote?

[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:38.480]
How to vote over?

[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:39.920]
How to vote over?

[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:40.520]
How to vote?

[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:40.560]

[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:46.800]
Evan says this presidential race we came.

[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:50.640]
I've often wondered who was going to win.

[02:11:51.900 --> 02:11:55.640]
Some party people went to do their voting job.

[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:00.540]
So count up all the ballots and find out who's gotten more.

[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:06.640]
Those who've seen that have one thing in common.

[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:08.640]
What's my bother them?

[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:11.500]
Just give their votes to Patrick, you can.

[02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:13.400]
Oh, my God.

[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:13.600]
No better than fighting for now.

[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:13.600]

[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:13.600]

[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:13.600]

[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:13.600]

[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:18.780]
So I'd like to know who won the election.

[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:23.180]
if I'd like to know who won the election.

[02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:25.660]
Countable vote?

[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:28.700]
Jiequlement baby countable vote?

[02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:35.660]
Countable, countable, countable, baby, countable, countable, countable, countable

[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:40.800]
The final tabulation started coming in

[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:44.880]
Then I saw a new slash on Channel 10

[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:49.640]
Some may read people all together been a bunch

[02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:54.600]
They said they were confused and didn't know which hold a bunch

[02:12:56.980 --> 02:13:00.660]
Those old folks seem to have one brain in common

[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:04.380]
Looks like lots of them just give their both soups

[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:06.260]
I drink you can't it

[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:12.800]
So I'd like to know who won the election

[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:17.240]
Said I'd like to know who won the election

[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:21.480]
or why'd I like to know who won the election

[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:26.120]
Yes I'd like to know who won the election

[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:31.200]
Countable, countable, stand, countable, countable

[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:37.780]
Countable, countable, countable, countable, countable, man Ye Jehovah

[02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:47.220]
Countable, countable, countable, Irene think they just won't do any job

[02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:52.440]
22,000 to 2 AM. The Stantford Program is awarded an explicitly anti-feminist U.S. Group

[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:57.860]
part of a $10 million grant to train Iraqi women in political participation and democracy.

[02:13:58.700 --> 02:14:03.380]
The group who are based independent women's forum, IWF, will help implement the Administration's

[02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:08.160]
Iraqi Women's Democracy Initiative, along with a number of groups that, unlike the IWF,

[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:11.740]
have experienced an international exchange in democracy promotion activities including

[02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:15.480]
the Meridian International Center, the International of Public and Institute and the National

[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:20.980]
Liberal Democratic Institute. The participation of IWF, which has a

[02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:24.760]
recorded Iraqi women, selected by the State Department around power and media centers around

[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:29.340]
Washington, is the most controversial. The organization was founded in 1991 by a number

[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:32.440]
of prominent right-wing Republican women who worked as a counterpoint to what they called

[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:37.060]
the radical feminism of the National Organization for Women, a grassroots group with about a half

[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:44.200]
of millions of subscribing members nationwide. Among the founders were Lynn Cheney, the

[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:48.520]
Labor Secretary Elaine Chow, Keith O'Burn, Washington Editor of the right-wing National

[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:53.480]
Review and a former senior vice president of the UNCHES Heritage Foundation, and Midsdector

[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:58.360]
of the former co-chair with Donald Rumsfeld, the committee for the free world. And one

[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:02.440]
of the founders of Neo-Conservatism along with his spouse, former commentary editor Norman

[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:07.120]
Pajoritz. Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paul Dobriensky announced the

[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:11.760]
grandad press briefing last week, also served on IWF's Board of Advisors. Talk about

[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:16.600]
an inside deal. The IWF represents a small group of right-wing Wheeler dealers inside

[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:20.680]
the Washington Beltways hit on her smear, presently feminist majority foundation.

[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:27.880]
Well, this is Gozad. It's his par for the court, it's typically anti-human. And let me ask

[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:30.520]
you something. And hopefully tomorrow night is when it's going to come up. Do you hear

[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:33.820]
anything last night about stem cell research and the vice presidential debate? No.

[02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:38.460]
Do you hear a word about that? Well, but there's the audience reaction.

[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:43.000]
The government should sanction or prove or give that to those little things, little rods

[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.160]
hooked up to their genitals. Look at that. That's the initial.

[02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:50.120]
He threw them away up there when he said, oh, my fang daughter, she's okay in my book,

[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:55.740]
something like that. Is that what he said? Cheney? He said, he didn't know my keys or

[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:18.160]
my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:35.500]
my, my, my, my my, my, my, my,

[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:36.360]
I think four plays.

[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:49.560]
Welcome back to our 90th of the Owl Franken Show.

[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:53.160]
I'm Owl Franken.

[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:55.540]
It's I'm Castle in Lampor.

[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:02.080]
Now it's been brought to my attention that I don't know how to do a radio show.

[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:10.820]
Well, let me assure you that this is cutting edge radio.

[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:20.180]
And to illustrate what I refer to as a theater of the mind.

[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:26.500]
We have for you today a new Robert Smigel cartoon on TV.

[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:29.440]
Behind you always always a panic.

[02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:32.880]
Could you roll that for us please?

[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:37.740]
John, if you look at that, now hold it.

[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:38.800]
It's hilarious.

[02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:47.480]
I can't stress enough about how funny and entertaining this TV is.

[02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:52.340]
I thank you for that.

[02:17:52.340 --> 02:17:56.300]
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

[02:17:56.600 --> 02:18:00.020]
And I'm certain our audience did as well.

[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:03.380]
Now, do we have a break?

[02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:07.820]
Is this a weak break or a strong break?

[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:10.200]
Another weak break?

[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:11.600]
Okay.

[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:19.100]
When we come back, we'll be joined by TV legend.

[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:20.880]
Soupy sales.

[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:23.140]
Who will engage us in a fight?

[02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:26.540]
After it's all.

[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:29.880]
That's great.

[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:32.080]
Let's play the ending of that one again.

[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:32.640]
One more time.

[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:36.020]
That's way funnier than the actual show.

[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:36.960]
Oh, wait a minute.

[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:39.520]
I don't know if it'll do it.

[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.680]
This one won't go back over that track.

[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:43.340]
How do you like that?

[02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:45.740]
Maybe I'll have to play the whole thing again.

[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:11.060]
You go through that.

[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:11.460]
Okay.

[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:23.940]
I'm sorry.

[02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:23.940]

[02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:23.940]

[02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:23.940]

[02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:23.960]

[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:26.220]
I'm sorry.

[02:19:26.220 --> 02:19:26.300]
I'm sorry.

[02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:26.300]

[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:57.880]

[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:57.880]

[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:57.880]

[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:57.880]

[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:57.880]

[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:57.880]

[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:57.880]

[02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:58.280]
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

[02:20:55.780 --> 02:20:55.940]
I'm sorry.

[02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:57.900]
I'm sorry.

[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:50.680]
I'm sorry.

[02:21:51.660 --> 02:21:52.740]
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

[02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:53.160]
I'm sorry.

[02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:00.700]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:03.500]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:05.720]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:07.160]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:11.460]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:14.940]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:17.940]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:20.700]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:20.700]

[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:20.700]

[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:21.140]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:22.740 --> 02:22:24.240]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:25.760]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:26.340]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:26.340 --> 02:22:27.360]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:28.420]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:33.840]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:35.640]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:44.720]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:44.920]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:45.540]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:46.660]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:50.200]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:50.240]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:50.240]

[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:51.000]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:53.020]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:56.180]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:57.180 --> 02:22:58.700]
I'm sorry.

[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:00.200]
I'm sorry.

[02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:02.640]
I'm sorry.

[02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:11.980]
I'm sorry.

[02:23:11.980 --> 02:23:15.920]
I'm going up my line for the season

[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.480]
Gosh, my hopes of memory bliss

[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:23.580]
Here's well off in my eyes

[02:23:23.580 --> 02:23:27.560]
For no one parapries with me

[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:30.460]
I like bustle-telverduce

[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:35.080]
There's a way, see, in my trailer

[02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:39.900]
And then I find you no longer here

[02:23:40.900 --> 02:23:44.680]
You navigate my life, that's a failure

[02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:49.400]
And it'll go on, above all those horsewears

[02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:51.740]
And no one else is concerned

[02:23:51.740 --> 02:23:54.440]
I'll never jump

[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:58.820]
It's your toes I've walked in by now

[02:23:58.820 --> 02:24:01.180]
I think half of the signs

[02:24:02.240 --> 02:24:05.160]
That's life's form of a radio

[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:09.560]
No one will leave us like we do

[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:12.700]
Now only Shacks won't weaken

[02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:15.200]
We can't leave us like we do

[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:15.580]
Welcome!

[02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:19.060]
That's it! 157.560

[02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:20.400]
See, we got a bit for everything

[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:21.660]
You know, it just amazes me

[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:22.120]
A little bit

[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:23.900]
We got a little bit or a big bit

[02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:27.020]
Now, is this going to be a weak break or a strong break?

[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:29.020]
Oh man

[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:31.860]
How can we compete with a show like that?

[02:24:33.020 --> 02:24:34.720]
I think we got a big surer

[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:36.720]
So I'll rise without franken on the ear

[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:38.480]
He is just dynamic

[02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:42.140]
And that cat or what's the name of the cat?

[02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:45.100]
Oh she is from what I'm hearing

[02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:46.520]
A real peace

[02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:48.480]
Don't forget to speak to a real peace

[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:50.360]
Join George, Miguel, Volker, Brian, 5-7

[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:51.660]
Happy, our treasure island of the day

[02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:52.980]
Just about every Wednesday

[02:24:52.980 --> 02:24:54.680]
No projectiles today though

[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:55.360]
We'll take

[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:56.880]
You never know

[02:24:56.880 --> 02:24:59.520]
Never know what might be floating through the air

[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:00.080]
Or us

[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:01.760]
Anyway, I'm not going to say it

[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:04.220]
Located off the Palmetto just north of the 120-second

[02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:04.920]
Street exit stop

[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:06.960]
For prizes, various specials

[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:07.720]
And this week's feature

[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:09.080]
Ask, Penrain

[02:25:10.660 --> 02:25:11.480]
Which of these things

[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:13.340]
Would you most hate being thought of as?

[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:15.620]
Now, what are the ones we just put on our dishonest already got six?

[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:16.420]
See, that's a good one

[02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:17.640]
Excellent job, sir

[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:19.280]
I'm glad we got that on before the end of the show

[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:19.600]
You know?

[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:21.520]
Because nobody likes a liar

[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:24.480]
Nobody likes people who are like chronic liars

[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:26.580]
Who have no credibility no matter what they say

[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:27.580]
If they tell you it's Wednesday

[02:25:27.580 --> 02:25:28.400]
Look at the calendar

[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:29.680]
If they tell you it's two o'clock

[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:30.500]
You look at your watch

[02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:32.000]
If they tell you the sun is shining

[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:32.760]
You look out the window

[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:33.600]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:34.400]
What are you talking about?

[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:37.680]
Professional compulsive BS artist liars

[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:39.480]
In fact, I'd like to change my vote

[02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:41.940]
Man, anyway

[02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:43.900]
Dumb, 133

[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:45.240]
Nobody wants to be thought of as dumb

[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:46.940]
Although, they're awful lot

[02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:49.480]
Dumb, stupid, idiotic, moronic

[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:51.480]
Republican 114

[02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:52.720]
Oh, I just said it

[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:54.420]
Allows you lay 113

[02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:55.960]
Fat slaw of 80

[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:56.540]
That's me

[02:25:56.540 --> 02:25:58.720]
Although, I don't know, it's so relative now

[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:00.380]
I don't really even think I'm a fat slaw of fat

[02:26:00.380 --> 02:26:01.740]
Yes, but a fat slaw of 80

[02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:02.460]
I don't know, what's that?

[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:04.140]
See, fat yes, slaw of 80

[02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:05.940]
It's been not necessarily fat slaw of 80

[02:26:05.940 --> 02:26:06.900]
When I think of slaw of 80

[02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:08.540]
I think of very people who don't bathe

[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:11.340]
Have a lot of food on the front of their shirt

[02:26:11.340 --> 02:26:13.480]
There's people who are fat and just have like

[02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:14.860]
Word t-shirts

[02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:16.280]
There's just a fashion law

[02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:18.440]
That's not a slaw of 80

[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:18.440]

[02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:21.340]
The fact that at least according to you

[02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:22.800]
You don't wear a trendy clothing

[02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:24.520]
Fat slaw of 80

[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:25.440]
What do you mean according to me?

[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:26.980]
You're the one that's always knocking my shirt

[02:26:26.980 --> 02:26:28.560]
Somebody there, no matter what's your hour

[02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:30.340]
And I'm lovely shirt today by the way, it's lovely

[02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:31.900]
Get fine shirts, you get green

[02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:33.520]
Canadians have this habit of saying lovely

[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:34.820]
And they don't realize it's kind of

[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:36.300]
Faggy, Christmas, Canadians are

[02:26:36.300 --> 02:26:37.380]
Fat slaw of 80

[02:26:37.380 --> 02:26:38.640]
Religious fanatic 78

[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:39.440]
Homeal 4060

[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:41.000]
Voring 29

[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:42.260]
Doll fan 25

[02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:44.060]
No coming, no, Doll fan, which I'm not

[02:26:44.060 --> 02:26:46.780]
Ugly 22, my teens on the feet of 18 in a row

[02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:48.660]
Wim 17, dishonest 7

[02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:50.380]
Lier, liar, your things on fire

[02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:51.780]
Short, foreign, old

[02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:52.520]
Uh oh

[02:26:53.460 --> 02:26:53.900]
Old

[02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:54.480]
Ancient

[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:55.360]
Old farts

[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:00.040]
Won't be long and social security checks are going to start coming in

[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:02.280]
I can get my seniors in this counts

[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:04.320]
I'm going to start taking my men amusement everyday

[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:05.380]
Bye, bye, bye

[02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:06.540]
I'll start you off

[02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:09.180]
I'm going to start you off

[02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:11.300]
I'm going to start you off

[02:27:11.300 --> 02:27:12.920]
I'm going to start you off
