[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.980]
I'm a man in the air, as you see KS

[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.180]
Hey kids, don't play ball, play the odds with the beat Rose Talking Baseball Card

[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.980]
Let's go better off ball game and make a sound big box

[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.500]
We don't care who loses or wins as well as we make the spread again

[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.540]
That beat Rose Talking Baseball Card, it's fun, it's profitable, it's educational, it's illegal

[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.860]
The beat Rose Talking Baseball Card will have the fans calling foul

[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.480]
Only 1495, we're 5 to 3 or 8 to 6, get yours, wherever racing forms are sold

[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.320]
Sports!

[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840]
101560W, no one out on the level just dropped off to nothing

[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.360]
Hmm, what's going on here?

[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.080]
This is just like last time I was here

[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.220]
I don't know, crank the overhead part

[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.820]
I'm cranking it, I'm cranking everything in my hands on that too

[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.360]
Anyway, 101560W, I mean, doesn't sound good again, sounds like crap, doesn't it?

[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.060]
Weird, different

[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.660]
Jesus, what do I come back here for?

[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.540]
This is just exactly an instant replay in November

[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.720]
And if this month is going to be an instant replay in November

[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.480]
We're upshmets Creek, everything is like all over the place in here

[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.500]
How's that possible?

[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.260]
Huh?

[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.060]
Who are you pointing at?

[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.320]
The control rules

[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.240]
It was the clearance did it

[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.560]
Yeah, the asshole

[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.240]
Hey clearance, you're an asshole man, I took it that right to your face

[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.860]
See one thing about me, I'll tell you right to your push, the same crap I'll say on a year

[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.120]
I'm not one of those backstabbers, I'm a frontstabber

[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.280]
That's right

[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.980]
I looked at him right in the face and said, what a quizzling man, what a phony piece of crap

[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.960]
Covered up for that dottering old man, which the bad news is I missed my good close buddy

[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.000]
We didn't, uh, no, we didn't cross paths this morning in the hallway

[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.800]
We didn't get a chance to bond in the tea room or anything like that

[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.620]
In fact, he had Zach in there cleaning out the bag again, which I thought

[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.840]
You know, when you think of you, if you kick somebody off, they're sure you would make him clean out their bag again

[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.200]
This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this

[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:43.300]
Yeah, and then I'm here, I saw the beast holy crap man Jesus God Almighty somebody wants to stucca I think mo to get even with a must to Stucca bicycle pump up his ass and blown it, didn't I tell you? Wow. He looks like the inflatable beast.

[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.780]
I'm serious! He's like a human accordion blow up party beast. Wow wow wow wow

[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.300]
when did that blow it out? And anyway then I hear Zach is the door man at the

[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.680]
Da House? Good news I heard Joe going on a great like the about that. Of course I

[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.940]
hate to break the news dude you ain't got to get any. Can you even begin to

[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.880]
imagine that? No. I wasn't trying to. Well I'm just saying you can't even begin to

[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.060]
imagine it. Anyway I saw that debate last time release most of it on MSNBC. What

[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.360]
is my cable company is it Media One which used to be a hundred different things

[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.340]
used to be store and it used to be this. It used to be all these other homecasts.

[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.520]
Homecasts and Type Ks.

[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.660]
Homecasts. Whatever it is. So what they've done is they moved a whole bunch of

[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.360]
channels from months now we haven't been able to find Fox Sports Florida where

[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.140]
the Panther games are which we got to satellite dishes so you can still see

[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.260]
about the fan in the ass come to find out they moved it from 24 to I think 42.

[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.480]
They just keep moving crap around all over the place without telling you. So they

[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.800]
moved MSNBC which used to be five and now it's channel 73. So I'm surfing and

[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.960]
surfing and surfing looking for the debate last night. It took me about 20 minutes

[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.240]
to find a guy to him thing. Of course their response would be well nobody watches

[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.720]
MSNBC anyway anyway which is a good point. So we might even make a channel

[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.240]
173 but so I saw that debate last night. I want to tell you right now folks and I

[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.580]
know this isn't going to win any friends in this audience because they got to

[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.600]
results what I do with them. I saved the polls from the weekend which I have

[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.620]
them here somewhere. See I'm disorganized now because all those sales assholes

[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.660]
coming in here. Nice seeing you, Skruando ever put your ugly pussy here again.

[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:34.620]
Okay. God do I hate that bitch. I don't know what the hell happened to them. I had

[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.240]
with the second one because you screwed up bad on Friday. What because you

[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.840]
forgot to fax Eric the third poll for when we were leading you didn't know I

[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.400]
faxed it after the show but I faxed it at what time because I faxed it to well

[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.400]
whatever okay so let's say he screwed up because he's kind of a painly I screwed

[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.600]
up. Okay somebody screwed up. So anyway when the because the poll with Dean and

[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.700]
Bush kept going so when it got to 499 I printed it out so we'll have exactly

[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.260]
the same number of votes. One that pretty clever of a dodging old fool like me

[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.260]
by the way I got to say this also I come in here and I'm wearing a shirt that

[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:17.000]
probably is the the oldest old man shirt I have ever worn in my life looks

[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.640]
older than you. Right in other words this is the typical South Florida old man's

[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.020]
outfit. Buttons biggest saucers. Right. I mean not found you have to be I don't

[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.020]
even know why I put it on. I guess it was just having to be hanging there you know

[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.020]
what do I care. I'm in the museum. This you would agree this is an old man now all I

[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.620]
ever hear at this place. Oh Gido shirts he wears there's nothing wrong with a

[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.580]
shirt side wear it off this one and what do I hear this one beast oh nice shirt

[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.560]
new shirt nice shirt. Well of course compared to him I'm a fashion player you know

[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.520]
when you weigh 600 pounds what are you gonna wear beside a pup tent and an awning right

[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.040]
right but I'm almost embarrassed to wear this thing but it's one of those you can

[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.660]
wear on the outside of your pants and still you like fat ridg again now. I think it's made

[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.380]
out of material that's illegal now with the guaya berra kind of look you know when

[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:08.200]
you got a big fat puppy pretend you're Cuban man. Oh and speaking of specs wow who

[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.080]
was that bitch I bet you somebody this audience knows who that broad was last night the

[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.140]
weekend the weekend bitch I wish you the scene that she made Rosanne Rosanna Dennis

[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.240]
seem articulate that that's how she she was talking like this about her Chibi and about

[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.440]
the yeah oh my god and and she was supposed to be one of the moderators on the brown

[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.280]
and black caucus lester holt was there for kind of like the chocolate brown people or

[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.940]
whatever he is I said and he was good like he always is and she was supposed to be the

[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.300]
spick moderator while she wasn't satisfied with being a moderator she was like making

[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:44.220]
up her own questions her own answers her own commentary really she you would have been

[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.540]
so humiliated and thank God she was reacon because then you had to pick on him some more

[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.720]
but man where did they find that bitch she was ridiculous Rico and she had no idea it

[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.180]
was pathetic we're in a sad state man just look around you we're in a sad state so anyway 499

[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.300]
votes for each on Friday and we asked if the election were held today who do you vote for

[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:10.340]
uh westerly Clark had 344 bush 87 I wouldn't vote 68 so the percentages were westerly Clark had 69

[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:19.760]
percent bush 17.4 and wouldn't vote 13.6 following that Howard Dean 72.1 percent bush 15.4

[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.640]
and I wouldn't vote 12.4 so Howard Dean uh let's see the little over 3 percent more and bush

[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.980]
a couple of percent less so Dean did a little bit better than Clark in this crowd but when I tell

[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.980]
you what I have to say today about Howard Dean there are going to be a lot of people unhappy but

[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.020]
that's okay I don't really care I'm not one of those suckles that's going to come on here and

[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.740]
pander to anybody I'm going to tell you exactly the way I see it oh poor Dennis Cassinus man

[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:47.080]
how sad it is can we get him in touch with Chuck Alphyr and get him some better looking here huh look

why not that's what he needs oh hey look look at this you see the new back I don't I don't read it

[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.200]
you can write off the bat starting with his squiggly little I don't read it little goofball on the

[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.880]
facts machine now especially now that he puts the background I know you're so stupid it's like a bulletin

[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.380]
like the drawing a arrow to it not read that cynnishman can't already shmithead

[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.500]

[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.280]
while we were talking about important things not talking about world events which is a little bit

[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:52.700]
beyond his scope talking about things that really matter if I can find it in here that's it 10 13

[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.680]
morbid song I would fit right in with this place today now what is that what was that was that his

[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:45.780]
cell phone going yeah yeah man if I could tell you how much I hate that every where you are you're

[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.160]
sitting there having dinner or whatever you might be at a ballgame you hear me I have all these

[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.220]
little tone going off and everybody with a cell phone and now that we got the fancy schmancy

[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:58.740]
cell phones that you can do everything with you can watch a porn oflix on it you can you can see

[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.600]
what your mother-of-the-law is doing you know with the with the postman all the other stuff you

[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.700]
just it's great it's like Alistair on passions you can watch it but everybody else in town is doing

[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.100]
so I'm just bringing the proceedings to a halt I'll give you the new poll that'll give you

[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.940]
something to do anyway because I do want to talk about that debate last night I'm sure some people

[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:25.520]
saw it the one in Iowa it was the brown and black debate I say because no we know that I've a lot

[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:32.100]
of minorities in Iowa and many in Vermont no I wouldn't I wouldn't get that carried away it's in

[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:38.420]
and Vermont maybe yeah so when Al Sharpton attacked Dean but the only problem with that is that

[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.680]
Dean now is like so much out of the defensive that he's losing it he is so so weak and so lame he's

[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.740]
just falling off but he's just falling off course and I can see it's slipping through his fingers

[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:53.340]
badly now what do you think if you're going to be in a debate on minority issues that you would know

[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.940]
that somebody was going to ask you about your record in Vermont were there any minority members

[00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.720]
in your cabinet wouldn't it be likely one of the questions that somebody was going to ask you since

[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.320]
they're asking each other questions if they're trying to nail your ass to the wall of course it would

[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.640]
was he prepared to answer the question of course not but a beep but a boop but about fumbling and

[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.660]
bumping again with at the jaw that thing with his jaw what is that thing with his jaw I don't know

[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.880]
what are you talking about does he do it side to side like that like a fat jar or something he just

[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.560]
I don't know see I'm trying really hard to like him again which I always have like him in fact

[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.080]
that was one of the first ones to like him but he's starting to scare the crap out of me now

[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.840]
and the one that I do like a lot is Dennis Kassant have I been saying that consistently

[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.800]
he says he tells it like it is he's the one that brought up the thing about Paul O'Neal

[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.620]
and this book coming on the fact that O'Neal says that the Bush the Bushites had the

[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:45.740]
Iraq attack all set up long before 9-11 which is why they had to make up all these lies to

[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:51.140]
justify going in there and one of the things they want to know about is how we divvy up the oil

[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:57.040]
by the way I can't wait to get a hold of that book tomorrow what's it called something

articulating your views do you understand the question see there could be a difference

[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.600]
but I don't think there will be they're all foolish mid 29 I'm starting to believe that one

[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:03.500]
foolish mid 29 Clark 23 a dean rather 23 Clark 15 because in his 13 sharp to eight

[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:09.080]
bush seven Edwards three carry three Libra Bintu Gabbard two and Caramose Lebron she's got one

[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.720]
probably bigger than one they got to

[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:37.740]
weird with long hair and a beard he was hiding just like a mole take a snack smell the stench

[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:44.160]
you might almost think he's French his facial hair is not so nice check to carefully for

[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:55.360]
lice hey you there goes the great sedom yeah the doctor said sedom open wide but he couldn't find

[00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:04.140]
any weapons inside spider hole spider hole that is where we found this troll raised his hands and

[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:11.700]
where himself very soon he will rock and help at last president bush is so glad because the

[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:19.980]
down this gone back down in spider hole 10 46 so anyway I started to bat last night like I started

[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:26.360]
to say about 45 minutes ago until we got everything working here and Howard Dean is imploding I know

[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.900]
that comes as bad news to you but the fact of the matter is he is imploding and after the after

[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:37.200]
the debate uh Chris Matthews and uh and uh what's his name lister hold oh we're talking to him

[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.560]
and they talk to some of the other people sharp in a few of the others and well when he asked him

[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.440]
that he's got all these pet answers like on three by five cards now and I guess because his

[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.160]
aides are so afraid that if he speaks spontaneously he's always going to blurt out something uh you know

[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.980]
and and then they'll make a big simmissabotter so he just gives pet answers to everything like well

[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.560]
you know another year the front runner and they're all attacking while there's only one front

[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.480]
runner and that's George Bush with his $210 million in campaign contributions and the

[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.140]
other dog here is the american public how many times do we hear him say that but third man the same

[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:14.120]
trite responses now what happened to the gutsy ballsy Howard Dean this is this is what happens when

[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:18.340]
the handlers get a hold of these guys and when they try to shut them up and not make any mistakes

[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:22.340]
when they try to play it safe like green baited yesterday play it safe and you want to blusing

[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:27.900]
I'm afraid he might turn out to be the green bay packers of politics oh yeah

[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.040]
what does that mean that means loser that's what it means lose blowing it blowing a lead

[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.940]
in other words about him trying to say as he wishes the Iowa caucus would have been about a

[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:45.260]
week ago but didn't happen this is a letter in fact it's going to be on our website I guarantee

[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:51.060]
that because I uh faxed it to Eric project for the new american century and the date of this letter

[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:58.100]
is January 26 1998 and the letter is written to this is from pinak to the honorable William J. Clinton

[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:03.360]
Bubba dear mr president dear Bubba we are writing you because we're convinced that current

[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.400]
american policy toward Iraq is not succeeding and that we may soon face a threat in the

[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.320]
middle east more serious than they we've known since the end of the cold war in your upcoming

[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.820]
state of the union address you have an opportunity to chart a clear and determined course

[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:19.000]
for meeting this threat we urge you to seize that opportunity and to announce you had a new

[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.260]
strategy that would secure the interest of the u.s. and our friends and allies around the world

[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.360]
this strategy should aim above all at the removal of sottom who saves

[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:32.000]
regime from power we stand ready to offer our full support and is difficult but necessary endeavor

[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:39.940]
keep in mind January 26 1998 the policy of containment of sottom who say has been steadily eroding

[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.520]
over the past several months as recent events are demonstrated we can no longer depend on our

[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.500]
partners in the Gulf War coalition to continue to uphold the sanctions or to punish sottom when

[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.480]
he blocks your evade's with inspections our ability to ensure that sottom who say is not

[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:56.080]
producing weapons of mass destruction therefore has substantially diminished even if full

[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.900]
inspections were eventually to resume which now seems highly unlikely experience has shown

[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.820]
that it is difficult if not impossible the monitors Iraq's chemical and biological weapons

[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.320]
production the lengthy period during which the inspectors will have been unable to enter many

[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.420]
Iraqi facilities has made it even less likely they'll be able to uncover all of sottom secrets

[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:15.180]
as a result in the not too distant future will be unable to determine with any reasonable level

[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:20.520]
of confidence whether Iraq does or does not possess such weapons such uncertainty will by itself

[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.220]
have a seriously destabilizing effect on the entire Middle East it hardly needs to be added that

[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.020]
if sottom does not acquire the capability to deliver weapons of mass destruction as he's almost

[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:33.100]
certain to do if we continue along the present course the safety of American troops in the region

[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.000]
of our friends and allies like Israel and the moderate Arab states and a significant portion of

[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.860]
the world's supply of oil will all be put at hazard as you have rightly declared Mr. President

[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.800]
the security of the world in the first part of the 21st century will be determined largely by how

[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.340]
we handle this threat given the magnitude of the threat the current policy which depends for its

[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.660]
success upon the steadfastness of our coalition partners and upon the cooperation of sottom who say

[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:59.660]
is dangerously inadequate the only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility

[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.700]
that Iraq will be able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction in the near term

[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:08.260]
this means a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing in the long

[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:13.060]
term it means removing sottom who say in his regime from power that now needs to become the aim

[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:18.820]
of American foreign policy we urge you to articulate the same to turn your administration's attention

[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.120]
to implementing a strategy for removing sottom's regime from power this will require a full complement

[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.260]
of diplomatic political and military efforts although we're fully aware of the dangers and difficulties

[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:31.740]
in implementing this policy we believe the dangers of failing to do so are far greater we believe

[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.600]
the U.S. has the authority under existing UN resolution to take the necessary steps including

[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.680]
military steps to protect our vital interest in the Gulf in any case American policy cannot

[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:45.900]
continue to be crippled by a misguided insistence on unanimity in the UN Security Council we urge

[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.740]
you to act decisively if you act now to end the threat of weapons of mass destruction against the

[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.400]
U.S. or its allies you'll be acting in the most fundamental national security interests of the

[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.880]
country if we accept the course of weakness and drift we put our interest in our future at risk

[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:02.320]
sincerely Elliott Abrams Richard Armageddon William J. Bennett Jeffrey Bergner a

[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:08.720]
bunch of other names William Crystal Richard Purl Donald Rumsfeld Paul Wolfowitz James Woolsey

[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:14.140]
in a bunch of other lunatics January 26 1998 and speaker of those weapons of mass destruction

[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:19.720]
right on the heels right on the heels of the announcement of Paul O'Neill's

[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:24.980]
damning condemnations of Bush and him letting all of this stuff out of the closet about the

[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:30.240]
Iraq attack all the Danish inspected there are friends the Danes Dana soldiers have uncovered

[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.400]
chemical weapons in Iraq and come to find out it's a bunch of 10-year-old canisters of mustard gas

[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:40.200]
that you couldn't kill a fruit fly with very deep underground and then they showed the pictures

[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.540]
the other day so they they Schmidt can't that pretty fast oh we got it oh we don't got it well

[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:49.180]
we thought we had it we got it and of course it wasn't us it wasn't the Americans they found it it

[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:54.400]
was the Danes we got it with the Danes because we know that if the Americans found it somebody

[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.140]
would have questioned well they planted it but the Danes found a bunch of old mustard gas canisters

[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:03.060]
leaking about as effective as farting in a windstorm yeah that would even that would be more

[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:08.600]
dangerous especially if Moe cut it so how do you like that so they tried to float that out there

[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.220]
that didn't work now the deal is well Paul O'Neill it's our grapes because he got fired and he's got

[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:16.260]
no credibility anyway we wouldn't listen to money with secretary treasury why would anybody

[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:22.880]
listen to him now right here is that letter I just read from PNAC the project for a new American

[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:28.080]
century there's enough evidence here in a court of law to impeach this whole bunch not just Bush

[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.820]
but this whole bunch of great robbers around him more your liberal lives they all had this plan

[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:39.080]
out like we told you before in the late 90s this was part of the game plan and the thing that

[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:44.600]
really I find very disturbing along with everything else if you read the stuff that he was saying

[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:49.540]
in those meetings he kept when he was being advised about Saddam Hussein and about the

[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:53.200]
Iraqi attack and all this other he kept saying well that's great but you've got to find me a

[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.880]
way to do this find me a way to do this in other words find a way that we can invade Iraq that will be

[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:02.380]
palatable and accepted by the American public and then along came 9-11 I'm not thinking any

[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:08.560]
suggestion you understand of course that but along came 9-11 how do you like that are you

[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.640]
suggesting and of course it wasn't the Iraqis it was our good Saudi friends who were all involved

[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.440]
in 15 out of the 19 anyway they're their family friends right that's right and you don't miss

[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:26.220]
with family now report blisters bushes handling of the terror war a scathing new report published

[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.300]
by the army war college broadly criticizes the bush of administration's handling of the war on

[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:34.460]
terrorism accusing it of taking a detour into an unnecessary war in Iraq and pursuing an

[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:38.500]
unrealistic quest against terrorism they may lead the US wars without wood states that pose no

[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:44.320]
serious threat and let me just interject that yesterday the crazy it asks lunatic Richard purls

[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.180]
on making the rounds and all the shows and he was under with wolf blitzkrieg going on about

[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:52.500]
Lebanon and about Syria and Iran if it's up to these people will be a war with the whole god damn

[00:45:52.500 --> 00:46:00.120]
world right sounds like ww3 to me for fun and profit profit that's profit the report by visiting

[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.120]

base alabama warns that as a result of those mistakes the army is near the breaking point it

[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.680]
recommends among other things scaling back the scope of the global war on terrorism instead

[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.860]
focusing on the narrow threat posed by the al-Qaeda terrorist network what a concept

[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:22.580]
the global war on terrorism is as currently defined and waged as dangerously indiscriminate

[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:26.880]
and ambitious and accordingly its parameter should be read read adjusted record rights currently

[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.900]
he adds the anti terrorism campaign is strategically unfocused primer promises more than can

[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:36.060]
deliver in threatens to dissipate u.s military resources in the endless and hopeless search for

[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:42.260]
absolute security and don't forget of course about the man on the moon isn't that us and the trip

issues was an aid to former senator sam nun when the Georgia Democrat was chairman of the

[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.060]
senate armed services committee and discussing his political background record also noted that in

[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.580]
1999 while on the staff of the air war college he published work critical of the Clinton administration

[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:04.980]
and it goes on and on and on many of records arguments such as the contention that

[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:09.000]
Saddam Hussein's Iraq was deterred and didn't present a threat had been made before by critics of

[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.040]
the administration Iraqi concludes was a war of choice distraction from the war of necessity against

[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:18.720]
al-Qaeda but it's unusual to have such views published by the war college the army's premier

[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.780]
academic institution so now he's getting it from all sides of the bushmeister

[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:28.240]

[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.940]
on a website right now nice going erick right under the right under the pool right under that little

let it a president clinton on i rack anyway the name of the book is the price of loyalty

[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:18.160]
by ron susskind people it's your prize winner ah the appalemial revelations and i'll say it again it

[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:23.100]
wasn't just a bunch of stuff he made up he actually provided to a ron susskind thousands of pages

[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:29.460]
of documents including uh stuff from transcripts of meetings no yes no national security meetings all

[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:34.280]
of these things you dirty like he says that none of these meetings ever was there any evidence of any

[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.160]
weapons of mass destruction or any of these things or any of their allegations the lies that were

[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:43.420]
made to justify the irracate act i do you think that they get really bored if i played the

[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:51.540]
lesslie stall interview with uh polonial no year ago polonial was fired from his job as jord bush's

[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:58.160]
treasury secretary for disagreeing too many times with the president's policy on tax cuts tonight

[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:04.880]
o'neal who is known for speaking his mind talks for the first time about his two years inside the

[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:10.700]
bush administration his story is a centerpiece of a new book being published this week about the way

[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:17.300]
the bush white house is run entitled the price of loyalty the book by a former wall street journal

[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:23.160]
reporter draws on interviews with high level officials who gave the author their personal accounts

[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:30.840]
of meetings with the president their notes and documents but the main source of the book was polonial

[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:37.420]
polonial says he's going public because he thinks the bush administration has been too secretive

[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:45.060]
about how decisions have been made contrary to how we practice politics today in this country there is

[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:52.020]
some market for the truth somebody's going to call it a kiss and tell book i've come to believe that

[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:56.420]
people will say damn there anything so i'm sure somebody will say all of that and more

[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:03.420]
o'neal who was jord bush's top economic policy official says in the book that the president did not

[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:10.840]
make decisions in a methodical way there was no free flow of ideas or open debate at cabinet meetings

[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:17.040]
he says the president was like a blind man in a room full of deaf people there is no discernible

[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:22.680]
connection forcing top officials to act on little more than hunches about what the president might

[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:29.140]
think this is what o'neal says happened at his first hour long one-on-one meeting with mr. bush

[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:36.480]
i went in with a long list of things to talk about and i thought to engage on

[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:45.260]
and as the book says i was surprised that it turned out me talking and the president just listening

[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:50.840]
he never asked a single question yes i recall it was it was mostly a monologue

[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:56.840]
president bush was disengaged at least on domestic issues he says and that disturbed him

[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:03.680]
this is a photograph of president nicklant me there he told us that wasn't his experience when he

[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:09.100]
worked as a top official under president's nixon and forward or the way he ran things when he was

[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:16.360]
chairman of alkoa o'neal readily agreed to tell his story to the book's author ron suskind o'neal

[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:21.700]
says he's taking no money for his part in the book you interviewed how many other people

[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:27.100]
oh hundreds of people hundreds of people how many other cabinet members um several what should say

[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:34.040]
several but o'neal is the only one who spoke on the record didn't someone in this administration

[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:40.340]
hi up yeah call him on the phone and warn him not to do this book yes yes and who was it don runs

[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:48.500]
out was it a warning or a threat i don't think so i think it was the white house concerned

[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:55.000]
understandably because o'neal has spent extraordinary amounts of time with the president

[00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:01.760]
they said this could really be the one moment where things are revealed

[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:10.200]
and they are not only did o'neal give suskind his time he gave him 19,000 internal documents

[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:15.260]
i mean everything's there member and to the president handwritten thank you notes

[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:22.280]
hundred page documents stuff that's sensitive stuff that's sensitive right yeah transcripts

[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:26.980]
of private meetings yeah in some case high level yep national security council you don't get

[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:32.440]
higher than that and what happened to president bush's very first national security council meeting

[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:39.000]
is one of o'neal's most startling revelations in the very beginning there was a conviction

[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:47.560]
that Saddam Hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go he says that going after Saddam Hussein

[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:55.520]
was topic a 10 days after the inauguration eight months before september 11th from the very first

[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:03.280]
instance it was about a rock it was about what we can do to change this regime now everybody else

[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:10.140]
thought that grew out of 9 11 no but this book says it was day one of this administer day one

[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:17.660]
these things were laid and sealed as treasury secretary o'neal was a permanent member of the

[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:23.640]
national security council he says in the book he was surprised at the meeting the questions such as

[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:31.100]
why Saddam and why now were never asked it's all about finding a way to do it that was the tone of

[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:41.020]
the president saying go find me a way to do this for me the notion of a preemption that the US has

[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:50.740]
the unilateral right to do whatever we decide to do is a is a really huge leap and that came up

[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:57.680]
on this first meeting okay o'neal told us the discussion of a rack continued at the next national

[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:03.200]
security council meeting two days later he got briefing materials under this cover sheet

[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:12.520]
there are memos one of them mark secret says plan for post Saddam or rack nation building

[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:19.040]
absolutely they discussed an occupation of a rock in January and February of 2001

[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.700]
based on his interviews with o'neal and several other officials at the meetings

[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:29.640]
susskind writes at the planning and vision peacekeeping troops war crimes tribunals and even

[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:37.220]
divvying up a racks oil wealth susskind obtained this Pentagon document dated March 5 2001

[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:44.560]
entitled foreign suitors for Iraqi oil field contracts it includes a map of potential areas for

[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:52.700]
exploration it talks about contractors around the world from you know 30 40 countries

[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:58.440]
and which ones have what intentions or on oil on oil in Iraq

[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:06.400]
during the campaign candidate bush had criticized the Clinton Gore administration for being

[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:13.380]
too interventionist if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building

[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:18.040]
missions then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road and I'm going to prevent

[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:25.840]
the president had just run a campaign about being humble and not engaging in that and nation building

[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:32.940]
the thing that's most surprising I think is how infatically from the very first the

[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:40.620]
administration had said X during the campaign but from the first day was often doing why not

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:47.600]
just saying why but actively moving toward the opposite of what they had said during the election

[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:54.380]
but the president had promised to cut taxes and he did within six months of taking office

[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:59.620]
he pushed a trillion dollars worth of tax cuts through congress this is significant

[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:06.680]
and this is only the beginning but O'Neal thought it should have been the end after 9-11

[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:12.780]
and the war in Afghanistan the budget deficit was growing so at a meeting with the vice president

[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:19.380]
after the midterm elections in 2002 suspect rights that O'Neal argued against a second round

[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:29.320]
of tax cuts chainy at this moment shows his hand he says you know Paul Reagan proved that deficits

[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:38.220]
don't matter we won the midterm elections this is our due we earned it exactly what is O'Neal

[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:45.740]
O'Neal is speechless it was not just about not winning a tax that way it was about how to use

[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:54.220]
the nation's resources to improve the condition of our society and I thought the weight of working

[00:58:54.220 --> 00:59:01.820]
on social security and fundamental tax reform was a lot more important than a tax reduction

[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:09.140]
did you think it was irresponsible well it's for sure now what I would have done O'Neal

[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:14.980]
accuses vice president Dick Cheney of not being an honest broker but with a handful of others

[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:22.060]
part of a Praetorian Guard that encircled the president to block out contrary views O'Neal says

[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:28.180]
this is the way Dick likes it meanwhile the White House was losing patience with O'Neal

[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:34.300]
he was becoming known for a series of off-the-cuff remarks his critics called Gats

[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:41.560]
one of them sent the dollar into a nose dive and required major damage control twice during

[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:47.300]
stock market meltdowns O'Neal was not available to the president he was out of the country

[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.960]
one time on a trip to Africa with the Irish rock star Bono

[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:04.900]
Africa made an enormous splash it was like a road show he comes back and the president says to him

[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:12.980]
at a meeting so you know you're getting quite a cold following and it clearly was not a joke

[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:19.240]
and it was not said it was it was Saskein writes that the relationship grew more tense

[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.740]
and that the president took a jab at O'Neal in public at an economic forum in Texas

[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.680]
and I'm just honored to be sitting beside one of my heroes

[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.580]
who O'Neal

[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.620]
with fair one O'Neal

[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:44.740]
the two men were never close O'Neal was not amused when Mr. Bush began calling him the big O

[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:50.040]
he thought the president's habit of giving people nicknames was a form of bullying

[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:56.620]
everything came to a head for O'Neal at a November 2002 meeting at the White House

[01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:03.380]
of the economic team well it's a huge meeting you got dick chaining from the you know secure

[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:09.460]
location on the video president is there Saskein who was given a nearly verbatim

[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:15.140]
transcript by someone who attended the meeting says everyone expected Mr. Bush to rubber stamp the

[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:21.960]
plan on a discussion a big new tax cut but according to Saskein the president was perhaps having

[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:27.520]
second thoughts about cutting taxes again and was uncharacteristically engaged

[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:33.860]
he asked um have we already given money to rich people the second tax cuts going to do it again

[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.460]
the president himself says but we already gave it to the rich people

[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.680]
yes why are we we already and why are we doing it again yes that's why are we doing it again

[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:47.360]
now as advisors they say well Mr. President uh the upper class they're the entrepreneurs

[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:52.620]
that's the standard response and the president kind of goes okay that's the response and then he

[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:57.640]
comes back to it again well shouldn't we be given money to the middle won't people be able to say

[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:03.960]
you did it once and then you did it twice and what was it good for but according to the transcript

[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:11.400]
white house political advisor Carl rove jumped in Carl rove is saying to the president a kind of mantra

[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:17.860]
stick to principle stick to principle he says it over and over again and he's saying stick and don't

[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:24.160]
waver don't waver in the end the president didn't and nine days after that meeting in which

[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.760]
O'Neal made it clear he could not publicly support another tax cut the vice president called

[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:36.880]
asked him to resign with the deficit now climbing toward four hundred billion dollars O'Neal maintains

[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:43.620]
he was in the right but look at the economy today can't the white house say look we were right no

[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:50.620]
Neil was wrong well uh in the last quarter the growth rate was 8.2 percent wow it was terrific

[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:55.440]
is it because of the tax cut I think the tax cut made a difference but without the tax cut we

[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:01.160]
would have had six percent real growth and the prospect of dealing with transformation of

[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:09.300]
social security and fundamentally fixing the tax system and to me those were compelling competitors

[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:17.200]
for against more tax cuts while in the book O'Neal comes off as constantly appalled at Mr. Bush

[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.100]
he was surprised when I told him I found his portrait of the president unflattering

[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:31.180]
you really think so are you joking no no I you know are you teasing me because I'm not a

[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:39.020]
I really jumps out well you're giving me the impression that you're just going to be stunned

[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:46.520]
if they attack you for this book and they're going to say I predict you know it's solid grapes

[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:53.280]
he's getting back because he was fired I will I will be a really disappointed that they

[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:59.960]
react that way because I think they'll be hard put to prepare for it well I don't think I need to

[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:07.140]
be because I I can't imagine that I'm going to be attacked for telling the truth why would I be

[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:11.000]
attacked for telling the truth right why would anybody be attacked for telling the truth that's

[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.120]

You believe what they say like they're called a colorful as they are.

[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:33.180]

1121 at 560 WQM Happy Monday to you.

[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.740]
So anyway last night we discovered from all of the Democratic candidates all of these week need declounds.

[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:04.280]
That we're going to let everybody in all illegal aliens let them all pour in.

[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.660]
Give them all the right to vote.

[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.920]
Give them all a green card a 57 Chevy.

[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.060]
All of a sudden that joke.

[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:10.640]
Congratulations.

[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:11.200]

[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:11.880]
Right.

[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:12.860]
In a joke.

[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:13.560]
That's right.

[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.760]
No more because they're all a week named.

[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.920]
Except for Dennis Kassinich.

[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.480]
He's the only one with any balls at all.

[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:22.360]
273 votes on a poll regardless of which candidate you support.

[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.280]
Out of course Dean now the new line is well you know he was against the war from the beginning.

[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:28.140]
He was the only one who had the balls to stand up to Bush.

[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.920]
But now that we're there we're going to be there for years.

[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:33.080]
And he doesn't he doesn't refute that every time they throw that in his face.

[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.500]
He just but it will be doesn't refute it.

[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:39.340]
Whereas Kassinich says let's get the international peacekeeping force together.

[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.940]
Let's get those troops home and get them out of there right away as in like now.

[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:47.120]
To which we say by the way another dead American soldier while we were talking.

[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:47.900]
Yeah who's counting.

[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:48.440]
That's right.

[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.200]
That one website.

[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.440]
273 votes regardless of which candidate you support which contender is best articulating your views.

[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.980]
Well a lot of big words in there Neil.

[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.540]

[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:06.760]
Or whiz whiz or what what anyway they're all full.

[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.540]

[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:30.740]
And then we're going to get the first one.

[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:30.760]
And then we're going to get the first one.

[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:30.780]
And then we're going to get the first one.

[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:30.820]
And then we're going to get the first one.

[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:30.840]
And then we're going to get the first one.

[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:30.840]

[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:30.840]

[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:30.980]
And then we're going to get the first one.

[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:31.300]
And then we're going to get the first one.

And then we're going to get it.

[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:55.240]

[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:55.240]

[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:55.240]

[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:55.260]
And then they're going to get the first one.

[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:55.300]
And then we're going to get the last one.

[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:55.320]
And then we're going to get the first one.

[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:55.420]
And then they're going to get the first one.

[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:56.580]
And then they're looking at these new puzzles now,

[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:56.580]

[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:56.620]
customized version of how they play Christmas.

[01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:56.840]
That only happens because I bet that the other primera participant obviously that should.

[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.520]
The other three of the players that play Christmas.

[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:06.160]
So repair.

[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.320]
drug people hey mark thanks for the good stuff but just calm down a little bit

[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:13.480]
okay it says this report now strangely forgotten confirms the bush he's

[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.060]
ready to grab 9-11 is a pretext for it re-invading Iraq within hours of the

[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:19.840]
attack they were just looking for any excuse to which you are absolutely

[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:26.320]
like I said keep the good stuff coming mark anyway Sunday Harold and Scotland

[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.880]
rights Bush-Planley-Rack regime changed before becoming president the whole

[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.220]
world is starting to catch on now huh how come we don't have the impeachment

[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.180]
hearings going on right away mean nobody got a blow job somewhere we got a

[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:41.340]
whole bunch of people got blown away but I guess that's a different story see

[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:45.320]
that's the the Neocons motto is blow jobs are bad but getting blown away

[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:50.900]
as well as somebody else away a secret blueprint for U.S. global

[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:54.060]
domination reveals that President Bush and his cabinet were planning a

[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:58.440]
premeditated attack on Iraq to secure regime change even before he took

[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:03.200]
power in January 2001 the blueprint uncovered by the Sunday

[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.280]
Harold for the creation of a global Pax Americana was drawn up by Dick Cheney

[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:11.380]
Donald Rumsfeld Paul Wolfowitz George W. Bush's younger brother Jeb and

[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:16.080]
Lewis Libby Cheney's chief of staff the document entitled rebuilding America's

[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.260]
defense strategies forces and resources for a new century was written in

[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:24.460]
September 2000 by the Neocon think tank project for the new American century

[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:29.280]
Penaq the plan shows Bush's cabinet intended to take military control of the

[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.140]
Gulf region whether or not Sodom Hussein was in power it says the United

[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:36.080]
States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional

[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.580]
security while the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate

[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.980]
justification the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf

[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:47.580]
France sends the issue of the regime of Sodom Hussein the Penaq document

[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.720]
supports a blueprint for maintaining global U.S. preeminence

[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.420]
precluding the rise of a greater power rival and shaping the international

[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:57.660]
security order in line with American principles and interests this American

[01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:01.500]
grand strategy must be advanced for as far into the future as possible the

[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:05.440]
port says it also calls for the west to fight and decisively win multiple

[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.140]
simultaneous major theater wars as a core mission so that's why a pro was on

[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:15.120]
yesterday talking about Lebanon and Syria and Iran and maybe a Haiti too I

[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.640]
read it to say what they're a state of it or he's our he's our butcher don't

[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.760]
go to Haiti by the way folks they're doing they're doing the old Mexican thing

[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.860]
now no serious that there is just about to go they're abducting people and

[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:29.580]
they're like you know kidnapping and butchering and robbing and mutilating and

[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:33.640]
all those nice things tourists maybe that's why the people in the streets are

[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:37.780]
like a little revolting tourists going to Haiti ever met any revolting

[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:42.260]
Haitians the report describes American armed forces abroad is the cavalry on

[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:45.900]
the new American frontier the Penaq blueprint supports an earlier document

[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.080]
written by Wolfowitz and Liby that said the U.S. must discourage advanced

[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.560]
industrial relations from challenging our leadership or even aspiring to a

[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.460]
larger regional or global role the Penaq report also refers to key allies

[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:00.860]
such as the UK as the most effective and efficient means of exercising

[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:07.800]
American global leadership in other words they can be our pawn yeah especially

[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.740]
since Prince Charlie's like bending down and dropping a soap all the time

[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:14.580]
describes peacekeeping missions as demanding American political leadership

[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:18.420]
rather than that of the UN reveals worries the administration that Europe could

[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:22.420]
rival the USA says even should Sodom pass from the scene bases in Saudi

[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:26.360]
Arabian Kuwait will remain permanently despite the domestic opposition in the

[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.900]
Gulf regime to the stationing of U.S. troops as Iran may well prove as large

[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:35.460]
a threat to US interest as Iraq has spotlights China for regime change saying it

[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:39.040]
is time to increase the presence of American forces in Southeast Asia this

[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.960]
it says may lead to American and allied power providing the spur to the

[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.020]
process of democratization in China calls for the creation of U.S.

[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:48.920]
space forces to dominate space and the total control of cyber space to

[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.180]
prevent enemies using the internet against the U.S.

[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:55.400]
Hence that despite threatening war against the Black for developing weapons of

[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.800]
mass destruction the U.S. may consider developing biological weapons which

[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.140]
the nation is banned for decades to come it says new methods of attack

[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:06.100]
electronic non-lethal biological be more widely available combat likely will

[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.260]
take places in new dimensions in space cyber space and perhaps the world of

[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:13.200]
microbes advance forms of biological warfare that can target specific geotypes

[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.580]
may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically

[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:22.040]
useful tool like all universal South area fags liberals Jews

[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:23.600]
far too

[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:28.200]
and pinpoint North Korea Libya Syria they ran did I just got through saying that

[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.000]
I left out North Korea mods obvious as dangerous regimes and said the

[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.960]
resistance justified the creation of a worldwide command and control system

[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.120]
Tom Daliel the labor MP rather the House of Commons want the leading rebel voices

[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.860]
against the war with Iraq said this is garbage from right wing think take

[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:47.060]
stuff with chickenoffs men who've never seen the horror of war but are in love

[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:50.700]
with the idea of war men like Cheney who were dragged on just in the Vietnam war

[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:54.020]
this is a blueprint for U.S. world domination a new world order of their making

[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:58.260]
these are the thought processes of fantastic fantasist Americans who out of control

[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:01.340]
the world I'm appalled that a British labor prime minister should have gotten

[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:04.260]
into bed with a crew which has this moral standing he said

[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:08.860]
I just mentioned that in passing from Sunday Scotland Sunday hero out of

[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.940]

I'm gonna change my looks, gonna make it depends, gonna be your white

[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:08.200]
As I turn on the radio, I fit in up my nose, this news is blowing my mind

[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:15.660]
I'm a puppy, it's my feet, it's been a night with me, can't deny I'm a guy

[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:24.700]
Defending for the dead needs, I gotta think for touch and plastic surgery lines

[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:36.520]
I'm a woman, we just show, follow it by tomorrow, here my girls, for news I know where I'll go

[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:42.860]
And the next thing you know, I'm looking at the mayor in the prison

[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.680]
He's asking me to bend his way

[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:52.320]
And now I'm less it's good, I've been any clearer

[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:58.120]
If you wanna make your world, I'm meant to place Michael Drop the soap and bend this way

[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:02.120]
I don't think Howard D needs a sin job, he plays the mean chin boy

[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:06.900]
I like Howard a lot but he needs, I mean Howard D needs something with that chin, huh?

[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.460]
I'll make over, you don't think? I don't know what you mean

[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.060]
There's something like a fag jaw, either something, they just showed him on again

[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:19.680]
I was sharp in ripping him and I asked about how many of minorities does he have in his cabinet when he was governor for one five times

[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.880]
He went by the beat but it booted by a nun, they do have a thing for that actually

[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.380]
Do they?

[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.100]
Like Lyple Sucked in

[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.540]
Well let's do it, let's do it before it's too late man, or before they have another debate god forbid

[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:32.740]
He should do like Wesley Clark and just kinda like well I'm not doing this one, you know

[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.620]
Well he's 10th homies busy

[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:40.520]
312 votes regardless of which candidate you support, which I silly me, you know, they're not gonna do that, are they?

[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:45.420]
No, which contender is best articulating your views, huh?

[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.100]
They're all full of shmett 103

[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:51.160]
Dean 59, Clark 39, Cousinus 35

[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.460]
He was great last night, in fact the audience gave him several ovation

[01:18:55.460 --> 01:19:01.200]
I mean you know they were doing little applauding for the other ones but boy, every time he finished speaking with an answer or his closing statement

[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:08.900]
It was great, I still wanna know who that Mexican bimbo or Puerto Rican bimbo was, it was on her last night that Chiquita Banana Bitch

[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.440]
You have never, she made Celia Cruz seem coherent

[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.940]
That's how bad she was, she was ridiculous

[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:21.780]
She was a worse stereotype, I mean if Hispanic America came to better than that and putting a moderator in there and good luck to you

[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:23.720]
Who could we have put in there?

[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:26.380]
Even what's your name that does the talk show what the hell is her name?

[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.480]
Christina, Christina would have been out there

[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.380]
Huge improvement, she's articulate

[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:35.940]
She would have just read the questions of three by five cards instead of trying to interject all of this crap about

[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:39.600]
But you know Puerto Ricans, a lot of the Puerto Ricans sign up for the military because they wanna help the U.S.

[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.400]
You know, which they're all citizens anyway so what would that have to do with the question?

[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.460]
Nothing, but she must have said that many times

[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.440]
Because at least maybe she's running too, I don't know

[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:52.640]
She's probably got one of those flags from her hanging from her review mirror

[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.720]
Oh yeah, one of them recon flags

[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.980]
Don't start picking on her weekends again man

[01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:58.440]
Why not? Because they'll cut you off

[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.160]
They'll talk to her Jamaican brandy up

[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.300]
They'll cut you up and then they'll cut you off

[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:08.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Live

[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.820]
Somebody will know what her name was WQAM, hello

Hello, Nioh, yes sir

Oh, you're boring as hell man

[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.820]
Get back at the town and there's same losers

[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.340]
Same bunch of losers, oh, gotta get out of here fast

[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:28.520]
WQAM, hello

[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.720]
You're preaching his boy

[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:30.240]
Hello, Nioh

[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.240]
Maria Saleste Adara

[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.240]
That's it, who the hell is she?

[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.140]
She works for channel 23

[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:42.760]
Oh, you have to be kidding me

[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.980]
Yes you do, for one division, one division

[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:47.200]
She can't speak in a language man

[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.760]
Man, she was horrible

[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:51.440]
No spigotting lesson and she was amateurish

[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.600]
They would have gone through off the gong show in 5 seconds

[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.480]
Through amateur

[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.020]
Yeah

[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:57.660]
Well, I was just calling to tell you that I didn't keep up the good job

[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:59.280]
Did you see the debate obviously?

[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.500]
Yeah, I did, I did

[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.600]
And who did you like?

[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.820]
I liked the guy with the bahirkar

[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:07.740]
Alright, thanks a lot pal

[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:10.980]
So we gotta get a next job for Howard Dean

[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.280]
And a win for Kucinich

[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.200]
What about his teeth?

[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:15.700]
There's nothing wrong with it

[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:17.420]
I don't ever look at his teeth

[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:18.960]
Because I'm too transfixed on a herpes

[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.420]
I never looked down at it

[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:21.940]
They can't be real, those have to be dentures

[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:25.100]
Plus he stands on four phone books to get on at podium too

[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.600]
He's great though

[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.100]
See, the base ought to be on radio

[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.000]
Right, not on television

[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.560]
That's that Nixon-Kedity thing over there

[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.280]
He's not made for TV at all

[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.060]
All he does is sweat a lot like tricky dick

[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.900]
5,6,7,3,3,4,5

[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:43.460]
Oh, he's gonna be on the Joe Castello set any morning on a racing show

[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.120]
Dick Lee Trickle

[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:47.980]
Now don't tell me line one is that again, that would give me really pissed off

[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:50.780]
Nice work and thank god I don't want to have fix it, I have to come in here again

[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:53.060]
What a technical disaster this place is man

[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.760]
We apologize for this place

[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:56.520]
WQAM, hello

[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:57.660]
Neil?

[01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:58.300]
Yes sir

[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.100]
Yeah, that fellow was right

[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.900]
That lady is a new anchor for Telamundo

[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:05.520]
Oh, you have to be joking me

[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.320]
That she is

[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.880]
How is that, well she obviously an espagnol

[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:09.200]
See

[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:12.160]
Oh, because she sure knows how to speak in English

[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.460]
That was, I mean she made Desiarnessim a little bit

[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.020]
Absolutely

[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.820]
Okay, thanks a lot of time

[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.120]
So I said there's a couple of people saw the debate

[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.160]
I bet you saw it

[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:28.140]
They could found MSNBC, it's channel 622 by the way, most of your cable systems

[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:30.520]
They keep trying to shove it off the edge of the dial

[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.300]
Because nobody watches it

[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.940]
I bet you don't have that I'm just so boring thing in here do you know

[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.460]
No, because you didn't bring it till now

[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:40.000]
Till now, always you think it's in one of these

[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:40.760]
Oh, I hope

[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.280]
That goes back aways

[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:44.640]
Oh, I don't think it's on any of these

[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.640]
I never got it in here, it's never been in here

[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.800]
It hasn't, you discovered that up there somehow

[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.340]
Oh, but I've been playing that for months

[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:54.540]
These are, these are recent stuff like December January that goes back aways

[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:55.660]
You're not going to have that

[01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:57.400]
Ah, well too bad you lose

[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:01.200]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, say I'm going back

[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.320]
This is ridiculous

[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.340]
I don't care how cold it is, I'll just stay indoors

[01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:06.020]
You can stay here, I'll go up there

[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:07.240]
No you won't

[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:08.740]
331 votes

[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:10.820]
We got their all-folishment 113

[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:14.120]
Dean is best articulating your review 61 Howard Dean

[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.700]
Who needs a Chinna transplant

[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.600]
Clark 42

[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:20.260]
Dennis Gussettich 38 needs a long chat with Chuck Alfie Erie

[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:22.240]
George W. Bush 23

[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.260]
Only 7% for the Bushmeister

[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:26.520]
Sharpton 17 Edwards 14

[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.300]
Carrie 10

[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:28.760]
Carol Mosley-Bron 6

[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.300]
Gebhard 4 and Jew Lieberman's all the way down to 3

[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:33.920]
He can't even find two tutsitsis to rub together

[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:34.900]
But he liked that

[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:35.920]
Good

[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.460]
You ever rub two tutsitsis together?

[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:39.880]
Just this morning probably with your head between it

[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:42.560]
21 till noon at 560

[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.840]
We got the mad dog at 2

[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.540]
We got the hopper who's back from the sick bed

[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:47.680]
He was on Friday some little bit on the scratchy side

[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:48.500]
He'll be okay

[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:50.080]
And spite of what Dave Hyde says about

[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.680]
Don't you want to hear a lot more of the booster?

[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:52.040]
No

[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:53.820]
Just on the Marlin Games okay Dave?

[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:56.980]
Quit like playing fast and loose with everybody's emotions here at QAIM

[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:58.400]
You asshole Dave Hyde?

[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.320]
If I was you, I'd go see Mr. Jika

[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.860]
You know Mr. Jika and Dr. Hyde or however that goes here?

[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.320]
And then we got a bunch of stuff after a hopper

[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.100]
You don't want to hear any of it?

[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.820]
Well it's still a Joanmar and Eddie Kay

[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:09.980]
You don't want to pick on him right?

[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:10.540]
Right

[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:13.420]
Well he sure don't want to hear who we're calling a hurrakhan-ha-ha-lai

[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.920]
Or the big O'Neal

[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:17.220]
Oh!

[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:18.460]
In fact I think that'd be a big improvement

[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.800]
Let's give him a Paul O'Neal-a-show

[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.440]
He's got a little feats here

[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.880]
Well he's got a little speci-effect

[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:23.940]
But he's got a lot to show

[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:24.360]
Right

[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.260]
He has a lot to show and don't let that get in the way

[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.240]
And maybe he's a little...

[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:29.800]
No he's got a way

[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.920]
Well is if that proves it

[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.620]
20 till noon at 5.60

[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:34.920]
Don't start with the fact stuff

[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.320]
Let me tell you about some great stuff

[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.200]
I got a whole bunch of it

[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:37.980]
Thank goodness it's in here

[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.280]
I am so pleased

[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.880]
You saw me you actually witnessed

[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.560]
I'd rank one of those breakfast this morning

[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:43.540]
That's stuck at the lunch time

[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:43.760]
Good for you

[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:44.480]
Thank you very much

[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.680]
I really love this stuff

[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.680]
I'm not saying that

[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.080]
I mean you don't like it but that's okay

[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:48.920]
That means you won't steal it

[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:49.200]
Oh what a way

[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.180]
By the way, Troy Stratford

[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.860]
Quit stealing my inter-ex-diabetic drink

[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:53.200]
You're not diabetic and you're not fat

[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.480]
So quit stealing a Troy

[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.720]
You freeload and you spook

[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:59.360]
Inter-ex-diabetic is a truly delicious meal replacement drink

[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.280]
That just happens to be made for people like me

[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.020]
Living with diabetes

[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:04.540]
But anybody who's sick and tired of drinking all kinds of stuff

[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:05.140]
Load of wood sugar

[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.040]
Can take this and really enjoy it

[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.440]
Inter-ex-diabetic is sweetened with splendor

[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.840]
Which is made from sugar

[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:14.440]
So there's no nasty aftertaste like you get with aspartane and saccharine

[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:18.200]
Recommended by doctors and dietitians for people who can't sacrifice proper nutrition

[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.700]

[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:23.120]

Plus fiber and antioxidants

Of easily-digested nutrition

[01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:40.820]
Tried once and you never go back to drinking that chalky tasting crack

[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.480]
Used to drink before whatever it was

[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:47.700]

My life is local

[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.880]
Here's sports radio 560, she went U-A-S

[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:29.600]
That, yes

[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.240]
Am I sorry I spoke out?

[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:31.880]
No

[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:36.420]
Am I sorry that I asked questions and that I don't just follow?

[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:37.220]
No

[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:40.460]
To announce that there must be no criticism of the president

[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:43.140]
Or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong

[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.800]
It's not only unpatriotic and survival

[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.220]
But is morally treasonable to the American public

[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:52.140]
We kicked off our tour and sold our shows

[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:55.040]
People were going insane

[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.840]
Then I opened my mouth and now the whole world knows

[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:02.460]
That the chunky one is lacking a brain

[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:07.700]
I thought that just because I know how to sing

[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:11.680]
I also have something to say

[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.700]
I opened up my trap and it was full of crap

[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:19.140]
The dicks, the chicks are gonna pay

[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.560]
Well, it didn't take long

[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:28.540]
Everyone I said our fans began throwing fits

[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:33.080]
If stations are playing and fans are paying

[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:37.540]
I'll be in strip shows when my tits are all right

[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.520]
I thought that I was born old

[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.960]
It's too fit to get fun

[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.120]
I never should have put push down

[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.960]
Myself, the steam was dropping

[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.120]
So I grabbed a pack of tankies

[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.460]
And I gained another 15 pounds

[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:56.640]
I run just a musician

[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.320]
That a real politician

[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.840]
My opinion doesn't matter at all

[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:04.260]
I know I'm a cream

[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:06.360]
And I got us in deep

[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:09.460]
And I career's all taking our fall

[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.360]
You're wondering why

[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:17.480]
You'll be in a big family long girl

[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.160]
I know my knees

[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:25.100]
I'm never playing girls

[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:26.820]
I'll never speak

[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.440]
You're a perfect girl

[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:28.900]
I'm sorry

[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:33.760]
I'm sorry

[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.660]
I'm sorry

[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:39.580]
I'm just a long girl

[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.280]
I'd like to say I learned to think before I talk

[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.400]
You're with us or against us

[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.140]
That's not true

[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:53.840]
That's not true

[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:56.060]
14 to no yes it is

[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.260]
Talk Show Host and Phoenix Found out

[01:28:58.260 --> 01:28:59.400]
It was two that's the reason I played there

[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:03.100]
Charles Goyette was named the best talk show host of 2003

[01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.200]
by the Phoenix New Times

[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.040]
And guess what Clear out channel did to him

[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.160]
I don't know if I heard him

[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.460]
They shoveled him off while he didn't fire him yet

[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:10.360]
But they will soon

[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:12.860]
They shoveled him off like to three to four in the morning

[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:14.680]
You know what you do with people who are not light

[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:16.600]
You shovel him off into the wee hours of the morning

[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:17.600]
You know what I mean

[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:18.760]
Absolutely right

[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.680]
Anyway, and you know why they did it?

[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.340]
I give up

[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:24.760]
And this article by the way is from the American Conservative

[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:25.840]
Papu Canans magazine

[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.680]
Right, a real conservative magazine

[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.580]
Which is right online

[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.060]
With what they ought to be

[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.060]
Clear channel, a gagged and anti-war conservative

[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.300]
Because he was against the war

[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:36.200]
Conservative guy

[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.000]
I'm not going to read a whole article

[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:38.640]
It's very long

[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.560]
But it says Clear channel made it clear with you

[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.420]
I feel like I'm managing the Dixie chicks

[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.460]
And they said my program director

[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.100]
And they would like to fire me anyway

[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.980]
While a well-drafted contract made that difficult

[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:49.960]
It didn't prevent them from tucking me away outside prime time

[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.720]
Stickin' more nobody would hear him in his contract

[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.580]
It's going to be a very shortly

[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:53.140]
And they'll say

[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:53.940]
Bye-bye!

[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.520]
That's cheap channel for you baby

[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.500]
Because that's the new American FN way

[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.680]
You either go step in line with a party line

[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.780]
Or you're off the air

[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:02.100]
That's what it boils down to

[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.480]
That's why some people we know

[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.720]
Are you sure are like go step in themselves

[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:06.860]
People that we would have thought

[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:08.820]
Would have been a little bit to the left of it till the dawn

[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:11.180]
But now all of a sudden are operating that party line

[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:12.020]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.020]
Yeah but wait a second

[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:14.260]
Yeah wait on this

[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.820]
The article by Neil McCabe bush planned the rack regime change before becoming president

[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:20.540]
That's on there

[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:22.520]
You ready for that?

[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:23.380]
I'm ready

[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:24.300]
Eric is really doing it

[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.380]
So we got the letter from Pnec to Bill Clinton

[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.660]
And that article as well

[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.100]
I mean there's a mountain of evidence here in a public is going

[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:31.760]
Like that

[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.700]
And the Democrats most of them are going

[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:34.840]
Like that

[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:38.480]
Last night in that presidential debate the black and brown debate in Iowa

[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:43.060]
The one candidate who had the balls and they wisdom to open up his mouth about the polo

[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:44.340]
Neal statements in that new book

[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:46.240]
I mean I was just called the price of loyalty

[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.660]
Was Dennis Kassinich

[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.120]
He was screaming about it

[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.020]
He said we all ought to be talking about that

[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:55.920]
And they ought to be instead of ripping each other up

[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.980]
Instead of all this you know who can piss on each other the best

[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:02.220]
Instead of that what they ought to be doing is ripping bush and ass all of them

[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:06.860]
But the Democrats have this death wish they have this collective death wish

[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:08.240]
And it's just astonishing to me

[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.240]
Why aren't they calling for his resignation or impeachment right now?

[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:11.540]
Who?

[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:13.480]
Them Democrats

[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:15.780]
The so-called loyal opposition

[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.100]
Oh they don't want to look bad

[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:17.860]
Oh I see

[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.100]
Dennis Kassinich how her dean didn't bring it up

[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:25.960]
Julie women who courses nothing but an appeaser and a war monger

[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.300]
He sure is how they're repulsed up

[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:30.680]
Right and a Republican dressed in drag with the armaka and the citizens

[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.700]
And to fill in

[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:37.000]
Yeah they offered him some dessert after that big dinner they had in Washington

[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.580]
He said that's to fill in

[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.740]
364 plus it was trough

[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.840]
364 votes on a pool

[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:46.040]
Regardless of which candidate you support

[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.660]
Which contender is best articulating your views

[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:49.980]
Do you understand that question?

[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:50.180]
No

[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:50.720]
You get it

[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:50.980]
No

[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:51.540]
You care?

[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:52.560]
Oh I know that

[01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:54.620]
They're all full of Schmidt 125

[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:56.980]
I mean that thing about immigration is so pathetic

[01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:57.520]
Yeah

[01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.760]
Illegal aliens we've got millions of illegal aliens pouring across the borders

[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.180]
Mostly in the southwest

[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:07.720]
From Mexico and they're not all Mexicans either they come up from all over Latin America

[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:11.160]
And they pour in through that poorest Mexican border and they just pour in

[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:11.800]
Right

[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:16.320]
And now the new deal is and of course bush being desperate to pander to Mexicans to Hispanic voters

[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.660]
Comes up with his cock and maybe deal which is never going to go through Congress by the way

[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:25.060]
His own his own Republican party like Dave sure with that it's still just another kiss for big business

[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:25.980]
Right agriculture

[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:30.580]
Right more cheap labor but more more over than that and attempt to say oh you see we want all you people to come on

[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:34.380]
And we want to give you all these rights we want to give you a green card and a blue card and a purple card

[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:35.920]
And a driver's license

[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:39.080]
Why should illegal aliens have driver's license?

[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:41.200]
They shouldn't they shouldn't be here

[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:44.100]
Why should most of the abandoned people will come in here on rubber rafts

[01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:46.260]
Why should they have driver's license at a 57 Chevy?

[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:50.640]
They shouldn't

[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.120]
They shouldn't be doing on air last night seriously if she is honestly I

[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:57.780]
I wish you would have seen it I just would have given anything if you could see it

[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:02.380]
You would be so amazed I'm not exaggerating she was like chowro

[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:05.160]
I don't want anything to a word my love her presentation was like

[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:05.640]
Chowro

[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.380]
I'm surprised she didn't say

[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:08.640]
Kuchi Kuchi

[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:10.060]
Yeah

[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:15.980]
I think she poked Al Sharpton in the puppet she thought it was a dark pills braid doughboy

[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:17.640]
Kuchi Kuchi

[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.120]
She was pathetic

[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:24.880]
And plus of course a professional Puerto Rican I mean just on and on about the Puerto Ricans are doing this

[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:27.180]
Well fine okay they got all the rights

[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:29.220]
Yeah

[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:31.380]
Driver's license

[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:32.400]
Sure they can vote

[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:35.660]
58 Chevy switchblade I mean what's all more do you need?

[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:36.460]
Upcaps

[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:36.780]
Right

[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.460]
567 0560 pound 560 on EAT&T

[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:43.600]
Let's get some of that Puerto Rican cuisine for lunch

[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.560]
Just kidding there's no food coming in here

[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:50.100]
What is there Puerto Rican when he brought that up somebody called and said something

[01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:52.660]
Something about he had a city had a big Chalupa

[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:54.820]
WQIM

[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.280]
Good morning

[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:56.960]
Wayne Estella

[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:58.440]
Wayne Estonia

[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:02.240]
Puerto Rican cuisine I think that's over by the community society anyway

[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.900]
No that's Chinese cuisine

[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.500]
That lady of the illiterate one who's on the debate

[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:08.940]
Yes

[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:12.760]
She works her telemundo and she even minds who owns telemundo NBC

[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.600]
Which is nothing but clear channel with pictures

[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:20.160]
Right so they had Lester Hold on there from MSNBC with the MS and they had her on there from a telemundo

[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:20.820]
Yes

[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:24.800]
Lester Hold with the stiff upper lip because you must have rubbed by agronidors

[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:25.720]
No no no no

[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:26.320]
He was still

[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.460]
But it's just like and you know why is this is being carried

[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:33.880]
Well I don't know why she was there because so I thought I checked there

[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:37.540]
There can't be more than like 20 Hispanics in Iowa you know what I mean

[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:38.740]
Doctor to man

[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:43.400]
Okay what that was that I think that was a CIA 10

[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.520]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Horizon Wireless Line

[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.140]
We're off to the races here baby we're doing it

[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:51.260]
Are we doing it?

[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:51.580]
No

[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:52.600]
I feel like we're doing it

[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:53.100]
Doing something

[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:53.520]
Yeah

[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:54.940]
Killing some good time

[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:58.120]
Don't forget that book to price a loyalty

[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.660]
Don't let me forget I gotta go out and get it tomorrow by Ron Suskine

[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:00.900]
All right

[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:02.020]
People it's a prize winning author

[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:03.600]
He's damn good

[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:06.620]
He was the one whose voice you heard along there with Paul O'Neal and Leslie Astal

[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:10.080]
And at 60 minutes piece from last night which will play it again and again and again

[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:14.420]
See how I see if I really thought that anybody cared about that and that they were you know

[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:17.240]
That it didn't be good that I'd really be excited although I know better

[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.940]
I've learned but it killed some good time

[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:21.060]
WQA am hello

[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:22.520]
I nailed it

[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:23.600]
Do I eat four a week in total?

[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.200]
WQA am hello

[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.000]
Lock it in

[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:30.260]
What was it?

[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:31.140]
Lock it in

[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:32.220]
Oh lock it in

[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:33.860]
Hey don't you remember that?

[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:35.840]
That's an old IOD thing

[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:36.700]
No I don't

[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:38.080]
That was jazz mk I see

[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.240]
WQA am hello

[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.100]
Yeah so much to talk about

[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.880]
I saw that debate last night

[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.100]
Yes

[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:44.540]
And there's so much to say

[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:45.760]
Go right ahead take your time

[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.000]
Okay it won't be as good as the last call but give it a shot

[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.460]
We're all gonna give my best shot

[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:55.740]
It's too bad that we can't go with who says the best and who instead of who's the most electable

[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:57.320]
I think who's the best

[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.520]
Well my question wasn't who's the most electable

[01:35:59.520 --> 01:35:59.980]
I know

[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:05.360]
I know but it's too bad I mean when it comes to the election itself that we can't vote for who says the best

[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.740]
And that's the most electable

[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.780]
I mean I read this point of view

[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:09.280]
You like to vote?

[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:10.900]
You're not electable

[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:13.040]
But I'm disappointed with Dean

[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:13.820]
Yeah

[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:15.320]
In the more I see a

[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.220]
See this audience doesn't want to say that I mean it can pour in all the votes they want

[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:21.440]
And I have no problem with that other than the fact that he's just losing it now

[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.320]
All these strategists are turning him into a quizzling now in a week need weakling

[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.240]
And he just kind of stands there in a hams and hams

[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.600]
And it's like he doesn't want to say anything and he's afraid to really speak

[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:33.500]
And it comes up with all the trite cliches about the American people are the underdog

[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:36.240]
And I mean we've heard all of that before answer the question

[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:39.160]
Oh and then on other thing he did last night which I haven't even mentioned yet

[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:43.620]
There was that part of the debate several times during the debate and I do like that where there are a lot to ask

[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:44.920]
One of the other candidates a question

[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:49.020]
And instead of asking the other candidate he had some stooly some pigeon in the audience

[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.040]
Some minority guy that he was going to ask a question in the color

[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.860]
And then please tell us about this

[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:55.880]
And then the lester Holt is credited

[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.460]
But we can't do that governor because the candidates have all agreed to the rules

[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:01.680]
And we can't go out of the audience to ask people

[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:05.960]
You've got to ask the other candidates a question or take a pass and go out of the

[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.180]
He said oh I guess then I'll pass

[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:09.660]
I mean totally unprepared what is that

[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:11.700]
He's coming across as being stupid

[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:14.720]
Right he makes himself look bad which is exactly what they want

[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.480]
And the other thing is and then they start you know when they start you know going after each other

[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:24.140]
And I can't believe that Braun basically told Sharpton to shut up about playing the race car

[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:25.240]
Yeah if she was good

[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:28.140]
She was good but you know again she's not like the boy is not going to happen

[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:31.800]
No you know it's just so disappointing

[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:39.660]
But when you think that in a debate that Braun and Black caucus you know what the nature of most of the questions

[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:44.300]
You know they're going to be asking you about what you did as governor of remand and who was on your staff and in your cabinet

[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.480]
And how can you be that unprepared

[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.200]
Absolutely

[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.420]
His handlers are more concerned about shutting him up than really preparing him to answer the questions

[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:55.780]
And showing the kind of dean that we saw a few weeks and months ago

[01:37:55.780 --> 01:38:02.020]
I'm hoping that the real thing that comes across with dean's campaign is that it energizes enough people to pay attention

[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:04.140]
They get out there and vote for somebody other than Bush

[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:07.180]
Yeah you know and the other thing and then I'll go

[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:13.780]
The other thing is on your website I think it's interesting that two of the articles are most thinking about Bush

[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:18.820]
And how they created Iraq were written by Republican Paul Neal and Kevin Phillips

[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:22.020]
And then these are not left winging

[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:23.380]
And either as Pat Buchanan

[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:24.200]
Yeah

[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:29.500]
But you're not going to hear the right side saying about these three guys

[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:31.340]
They're going to probably be quiet about them

[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:33.380]
And they say oh it's still a little bit of liberal media

[01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:37.460]
And they better take care of Neal and they better ignore Bush if you can

[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:39.020]
And they'll all push him to the side

[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:39.940]
Pretty sad

[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:41.420]
Hang in there, Palley

[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:42.400]
Yeah I'm moving to Canada

[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.280]
See you at the border man

[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:43.600]
Bye

[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:45.740]
Yeah we'll smuggle them in

[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:52.040]

[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:53.820]
How do my good friends at here at Canada

[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:56.760]
Well I tell you it was a nice command performance coming down yesterday morning

[01:38:57.460 --> 01:38:59.220]
Three people in business class on my flight

[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:01.200]
Two flight attendants going to the next job

[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.780]
Yeah sound asleep and me in the front row

[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:04.180]
And I was it

[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:04.780]
Excellent

[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:06.820]
Back at a plane with all the peasants

[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:08.320]
You know that was pretty well loaded

[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:09.940]
Were they hot? The flight attendants?

[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:12.320]
No, they weren't even lukewarm

[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.800]
But at any rate

[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.840]
Three minutes till noon at 5, 60 WQ

[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:19.580]
In fact they were about as hot as it's been in Toronto last a weekend

[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:22.300]
Wow, man oh, man oh, man

[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:24.200]
I've experienced cold in my life

[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.620]

[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:27.200]

I thought I'd experienced it all but Friday

[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:34.460]
When they came on the news and they said it's actually colder in Toronto right now than it is on Mars

[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:35.420]
Yeah

[01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:39.940]
They were serious they said the temperature on the surface temperature Mars is 15 below 0 Fahrenheit

[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.440]
And it was 18 below Fahrenheit in Toronto

[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.580]
It was 35 below 0 Celsius

[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.360]
Sounds like move to Mars

[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:50.260]
No it sounds like you wouldn't get a couple of good toot time to me

[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:51.220]
It's toot time

[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:54.960]
Which you always think it's toot time but in Canada it's toot can toot time

[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:56.220]

Anyway here's a couple of facts as they came in that's something

[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:42.040]
All of us on all of these Latoya and this one are all coming up because they want to

[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.440]
They don't want to lose that gravy train of course Michael says he's never going back to Neverland

[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.060]
Because they cleaned out little boys out

[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.080]
So we rented he rented another gym

[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.280]
You see that other mansion he rented right he only rented it on a you know

[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:53.300]
That's just a dollar house

[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.300]
No it's not my home

[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:54.980]
Option to buy

[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:58.180]
We know where the big house is and that's going to be his home

[01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.120]
Yeah all only wait

[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:00.200]
Can you imagine?

[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:01.200]
Wow

[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.380]
He's going to be the soap boy

[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:05.460]
This will be get father degan's old roommate

[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:10.280]
And would that be something I think when you wear them silver gloves like that you keep dropping the soap all the time is what I hear

[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.520]
I have people who know

[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:18.320]
Is someone says this facts is someone stupid enough to think that the war in Iraq was about anything other than oil and world domination

[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.800]
Yes it's called Americans

[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.600]
If someone actually shocked that Bush had a plan to invade Iraq before he was elected

[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.040]
Yes it's called Americans

[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:30.360]
It says he even had a plan to win the election because he wasn't voted in his brother just so happy to be the governor of that state

[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:34.580]
And also a member of P-NAC that had a ballot problem as notorious for bogus elections

[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:34.980]
Yes

[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:37.520]
The answer is obviously for both questions

[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:38.940]
Are most people stupid and gullible?

[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:40.860]
Yes it says especially Americans

[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:41.560]
Yes

[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:46.080]
It says I don't want Bush to win Neil God forbid but the stupid people in this country will probably elect him again

[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:46.420]
Yes

[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:53.080]
Yeah he ought to be impeached right now but instead he's probably going to get in and again because the Democrats are too busy chopping each other up into smithereens and rule pieces

[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:58.440]
See the whole system is sorry it's like the electoral college how ridiculous that is

[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:04.300]
And this thing with the caucuses and the primers who that hell gives a flying fugue about New Hampshire and Iowa

[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:05.060]
Huh?

[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:07.880]
What are they representative of anything?

[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:08.440]
No

[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:08.960]
No

[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:13.780]
New Hampshire is about to balloon those right wing assholes and the Iowa is what did I say?

[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.120]
No I was just saying New Hampshire

[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:16.780]
Oh New Hampshire

[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:17.200]
Yeah

[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:22.640]
And Iowa is a corn country man they're busy cornhole with each other but that's all that's all about right

[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:25.440]
How do you think they get the corn off the cob man?

[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:26.120]
Sure it's special

[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:29.240]
Yeah that's right got like its own gravy on it

[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:29.800]
Oh shucks

[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:33.220]
Yeah it's own special gravy special sauce makes it's own sauce

[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:33.920]
Oh God

[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:37.680]
Anyway here's another fact that said oh this is great

[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.100]
I'm I'm would be amazed

[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:43.560]
Well he's he we only hear you'll see he's a little bit emotional

[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.200]
I'd be amazed if the Southwest has more illegal aliens than North Broward County

[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.760]
Dear Field Beachers the new Brazilian frontier with these stayovers

[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.240]
Pompano is Haitian Dominican and Central American

[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.920]
The Q and Fr. the dear field beach office of license bureau is 200 deep by 6.30 a.m. every morning

[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.780]
The blue and green flag flies from every pole in dear field beach

[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:03.300]
Did you know that?

[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:03.980]
I had no idea

[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:05.620]
Well now we got Brazilian beach

[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:06.300]
Little Brazil

[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:07.400]
Little Brazil

[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:08.200]
Brazil

[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.240]
The Portuguese

[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:12.340]
No

[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:15.600]
Portugal I mean Brazil where the men are men and so are most of the women

[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:18.000]
Believe me that's what I hear

[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.060]

[01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:29.720]
It's the QM fugant way it blows

[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:34.480]
Jesus Greg I mean after all of these years can't the beesleaves afford to put a real joint in here

[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:34.640]
Oh

[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:37.480]
It's a joke I got a better studio in Toronto than this piece of crap

[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:39.980]

[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:07.580]

Neil yes sir

[01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:25.880]
Hey I'm looking at an article here on slate.msn.com

[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:26.100]
Yes

[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:31.560]
And it's going into how Bush has turned to Social Security trust fund into his own personal ward chest

[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:35.560]
And basically how they have no plans on replacing the money that they've taken

[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:41.280]
And basically George and I will have to join the homeless voice over there on a polywood board

[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.480]
Oh good we got it out for the rig and I so aren't sure ready for any no problem

[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:44.900]
Exactly

[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:51.900]
Hey my opinion of Dean is definitely becoming more and more different franchise with him

[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:52.600]
Disenchanted

[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:53.760]
That too

[01:46:55.080 --> 01:47:01.500]
What is your I know your opinion on this image but what is your opinion on Edwards

[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:03.560]
Oh my God Juleen Yahoo

[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:04.940]
Well

[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:07.620]
But Juleen Yahoo man

[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:08.240]
Okay

[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:08.840]
Yahoo

[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:09.580]
Okay

[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:14.020]
That's my opinion you ask me about it and then one of my thing I think you like the way he looks

[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:16.260]
Do you want to do him is that it?

[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:19.000]
Well and the other thing I want to do him

[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.940]
You like to crawl right up above behind him and sneak right in there

[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:23.860]
Well the other thing I don't like it

[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:25.160]
The one to mention is

[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.140]
Art Bell was actually ripping

[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.340]
Oh okay see ya

[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:32.380]
Fine I don't talk to art bell people okay

[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:34.200]
The only art bell person I'll talk to his sons

[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:36.980]
Does he listen to Art Bell?

[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:37.560]
Oh I don't know

[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:38.260]
Yeah

[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:43.040]
I guess somebody's got to and you know who else used to listen to art bell

[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:44.580]
Yeah I know

[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:47.600]
What do we got it what is that under there?

[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.680]
I put it in on the hotkey I don't know if it's in there

[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:52.600]
It's on a hotkey on my bank

[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.660]
Ah on your bank

[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:56.340]
Be an herb boy I don't have time to dick around with that

[01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:57.500]
Hey be an herb boy

[01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:59.160]
I get out of here

[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:01.160]
So I'll see you then right now

[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:02.640]
Yeah

[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.460]
The poll question is did Paul O'Neal be true the president

[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:06.440]
Oh my God

[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:08.640]
I'm not talking about a slanted answer question

[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:11.820]
How do you believe what he said is about did he be treated president?

[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:12.820]
Is that on their website?

[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:14.560]
That's on the MSNBC

[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.620]
Oh on MSNBC's question

[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:17.480]
Oh there's cabinet

[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.220]
That was black or lots of gold brown

[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:21.900]
We had a senior member of my staff on my fifth floor

[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:24.220]
No we did not

[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:26.740]
That was just part of their exchange last night

[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:31.660]
And our new poll out today shows a statistical dead heat for the Iowa caucus

[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:33.940]
How are Dean Topp today's MSNBC

[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.180]
Reuters Zogby Poll with 26%

[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:40.620]
Congressman Richard Gephard is in second place with 23%

[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:42.060]
They are statistically tied

[01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:44.000]
Because of the margin of error of course

[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.080]
Senator John Kerry has 16%

[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.940]
Senator John Edwards 12%

[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:51.920]
Here's a telling number 14% of Iowa's have not yet dissapeared

[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:53.560]
You see I know it makes a lot too much sense

[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.760]
But the idea of a national primary

[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:57.280]
When all the states vote on the same day

[01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:58.700]
People with brains

[01:48:58.700 --> 01:48:59.880]
Who are you suggesting that for a long time?

[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:00.440]
What are you saying?

[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:02.360]
You see and then that way you don't have to raise millions

[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:04.420]
You see like now is it endurance contest

[01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:07.900]
And people that can't raise enough money to keep participating and competing

[01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:09.120]
They fall by the wayside

[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.260]
It happens every four years

[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:11.720]
But if you had a national primary

[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.760]
You have a certain like a January and February

[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:16.940]
Whatever the period of time is that a window where people campaign

[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:19.080]
They have a little bit of number of debates

[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:21.120]
And then there's a national primary on one day

[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:24.020]
And voila as opposed to wow you got to win an Iowa

[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:25.940]
New Hampshire South Carolina

[01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:28.060]
Talk about a bunch of drooling Yahoo's

[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.460]
You're talking crazy talk

[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.260]
Oh I know because it makes too much sense

[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:34.080]
Because the American whole political system is a piece of crap

[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:35.060]
It's a joke

[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:38.040]
If we didn't have that freaking electoral college

[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:39.320]
We wouldn't be going through this right now

[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:40.520]
Because the hell of a lot harder

[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.280]
Unless you know the people that die bold

[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:44.320]
You put a lot harder to see all the way under vote

[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:46.100]
Unless you know the people that die bold

[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:50.580]
You asked to push for airlines for passenger records

[01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:53.920]
Despite stiff resistance from airlines and privacy advocates

[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:57.440]
The US government plans to push ahead this year with a vast computer-wide system

[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:00.380]
The probe the backgrounds of all passengers

[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:02.160]
Boarding flights in the United States

[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:03.700]
You ready for that?

[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:04.340]
Okay

[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:06.300]
That's right when you pay it says on here

[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:07.620]
Wherever fax this it says

[01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:09.900]
Now when you pass through the airport they'll know you're gay

[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:12.340]
Oh wait till you see I'm gonna start swishing real good

[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:13.420]
So they have to check the records

[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:14.520]
Where pink panties

[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:15.960]
Oh I'll wear pink panties in a whole outfit

[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:16.660]
I'll dress up

[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:19.240]
I wear my current Miranda bananas on my head

[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:20.420]
I know you can borrow some clothes from

[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.440]
Not freaky carloas

[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:25.600]
The government will compel airlines in here

[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.060]
How about the clearance?

[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:28.140]
He's got quite an outfit

[01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:30.320]
That's what I'm here and that's what mode told me this morning

[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.240]
Stuck referring to our programming department

[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:35.000]
He said the clearance likes to dress up before we let them stick it in there

[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:36.820]
I don't know what he was talking about

[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:39.740]
The government will compel airlines and airline reservation companies

[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:42.520]
To hand over all passenger records for scrutiny by US officials

[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:46.140]
After failing to see the reason that clearance loves to have me here so much

[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:49.340]
Because he knows that when I'm not here this place is his boringest dog crap

[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:51.820]
That's the reason that they're all so crazy to have me here

[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:53.920]
Because I bring a spark of life into this place

[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:55.700]
Well we can have some excitement in the morning

[01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:58.220]
What is that?

[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:00.400]
What is that going to happen?

[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:03.120]
Well with the firings and what nots

[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:04.720]
Oh you mean like that?

[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:06.800]
I'm going to kick his ass and then I'll steal his two pants

[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:07.740]
Yeah we had that excitement

[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:11.400]
And maybe I guess they thought it was a little bit too exciting

[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:13.140]
By the way, Ferrell's got the bad flu

[01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:14.020]
He's got a real bad case

[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:15.980]
Yeah we'll keep them posted with what's going on

[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:17.260]
Is he still on there with a mad cow?

[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:18.120]
A birdie cow

[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:20.540]
He's still got his man cow disease in Chicago

[01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:22.620]
And he's working on that show

[01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:24.000]
I don't know what the deal's going to be with him

[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.160]
He needs a spanking

[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:26.380]
Is what he needs

[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:27.920]
I'm sure he'd go for that

[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:29.180]
Not by me

[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:29.520]
Oh

[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:31.940]
No he needs 34C or somebody to put them over their knee

[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:34.040]
And just give him an old-fashioned spanking like a child

[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:35.760]
And just straighten his ass out

[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:37.600]
If he just tone it down a little bit

[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:38.160]
That's all

[01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:39.780]
Just a wee little bit

[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:40.940]
Just calm it down man

[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:41.860]
A wee wee

[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:43.440]
A wee ton that wee wee down

[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:45.840]
It's a lot of the past noon

[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.020]
I'll tell you a fat boy must've lost an answer to, huh?

[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:52.600]
Maybe he and his wife are doing an exercise on that brand new macrosis

[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:53.880]
You've got from Donald macros you think?

[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:55.340]
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you?

[01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:56.300]
I have to go now

[01:51:56.300 --> 01:51:58.400]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:00.320]
Wouldn't you love to be ear witness to that?

[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:01.800]
Wooo wee

[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:02.600]
Man

[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.480]
That would sure knock my socks right off

[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:08.020]
You know what? Knock off my jock

[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:12.200]
Anyway, I knew macrosis from Donald macrosis is a great idea for the new year

[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.700]
Oh thank god I don't have to be here all the time to do hyperventilating

[01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:19.020]
You're almost as good as the pretzel pukin' president

[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:22.700]
But that's the old ppp, man, the pretzel pukin' president

[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:27.920]
Anyway, celebrate the new year in starwin' and comfort with a brand new macros from Donald macros

You can't beat it so the old macros ain't cuttin' it anymore for you if it's worn out and lumpy and bumpy

[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:36.340]
If you wake up in the morning feeling like you didn't sleep at all

[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:40.320]
Donald macrosis is the place to call 1-800-MATRICE-TULLE-FREE LIKE I ALWAYS DO

By making it one easy call 1-800-MATRICE 1-800-MATRICE-TULLE-FREE

[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:33.100]
On the website it's macros.com

[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:36.300]
5-6-5-60

[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:38.540]
3-6-7-10

[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:40.300]
2-8-10

[01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:45.760]
O-N-P-A-Y-S-U-C-A-S

[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:59.580]
Come by some afternoon

[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:04.840]
He's got this place for you

[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:09.580]
One thing you might remove

[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:14.480]
The ash cast the gash discovering you

[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.980]
One mouth to every scary angel

[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:24.980]
His face like a bonsulin

[01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:30.760]
One pair of moonwalk blades

[01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:33.220]
A wonderring tongue

[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:34.700]
Chess

[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:40.000]
Besides the white blood he's making

[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.580]
Chess if he takes you under

[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:47.640]
His blankets take his nose a plastic

[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:51.260]
And break it might know

[01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:54.240]
You'll just found to be a lost survive

[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:58.220]
When your body is a neverland

[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:05.840]
Watch for his hands

[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:09.240]
When your body is a neverland

[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:14.580]
So never twisted about that

[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:17.340]
Don't let me figure out my next break to check the AHSNBC website

[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:19.360]
Because we were taking that pool online

[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.700]
And we really interested to see what the responses about polo-nil

[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:25.120]
I mean to word the pool I weigh it so obviously

[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:29.060]
The real question should be plain and simple

[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:55.100]
Do you believe polo-nil's allegations about the administration no one

[01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:58.660]
Jerry Brown was in it and Shirley Black

[01:55:59.440 --> 01:55:59.840]
Temple

[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.760]
I'm sure we temple black

[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:03.700]
Sure, yeah

[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:06.840]
Anyway they're all full of Schmidt 148 you say that

[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:09.280]
And I can't debate with that too much

[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:10.260]
Boy it's so sad

[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:14.060]
Especially when you get to the immigration thing and they're all like pandering and bending over backward

[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:17.040]
They have four chiropractors there to straighten them out after that question

[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.660]
After Chequita Banana can't push that thing about the weekends

[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:25.880]
Dean 78, Clark 54, Cousinets 48, he's doing well and you know he should

[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:30.080]
Probably just because I said that but if they saw it they I mean he's he's great

[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.120]
He's not good he's great he's got balls

[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.740]
He's a little guy with big balls like Tom Denenberg

[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:38.520]
Or Tom Denenberg it weren't for a cheap channel no more do you know that?

[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:39.860]
Yes I did. Are you told me that?

[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:41.540]
Well I was here when you got it. I scored Tommy

[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:44.720]
Cousinets 49 now he's moving up

[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:46.580]
He's given West Clarker one for his money for a second

[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:50.100]
I wish he was doing as well in the in the voting polls as he is on this pool

[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.600]
Bush 29 sharped in 24 Edwards 22 carry 15

[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:58.380]
Mostly bronze got seven Jewelie, Roman six and Dick Edwards only got four

[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:00.140]
He has his pasty and boring man

[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:05.020]
Wow as a leprechaun

[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:06.580]
And he said yeah

[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:09.320]
Paste the old Irishman man he is so bland

[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:12.760]
No you know I see at least Howard Dean when he had the veins popping out of his neck

[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:15.320]
And he was excited and animated and really rip it as

[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:18.400]
That's the Howard Dean we knew and love that's when we got excited about him

[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:24.080]
He needs to stop listening to those people. Yeah he needs to stop listening because they'll do the same thing that Gora's advisors did to him

[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:28.520]
And he kept reinventing him and reinventing him yesterday's Al Gore next week's Al Gore you know

[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:33.260]
The more animated Al Gore Al Gore with the beard the fat Al Gore the not so fat Al Gore

[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:37.260]
Of course the one thing and all we would be stiff boring Al Gore that never changed

[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:40.540]
Anyway getting back to this airline thing wait till you hear this

[01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:43.020]
See there's a part of it I like

[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:44.780]
So I read you the part I like okay

[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:51.960]
Another program that's being produced this year seeks to speed frequent flyers through security lines in exchange for volunteering personal information for the government

[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:56.880]
So like when I go through they'll say well are you a fag and I'll say and then they'll say oh okay

[01:57:57.660 --> 01:57:58.020]
Yeah

[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:03.080]
No seriously they've been talking about doing that then they won't have to waste the time with all of us you know

[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:05.900]
Right and you get your head tattooed forehead tattooed

[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:06.660]
No problem

[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:12.160]
The government will compel airlines in there will compel the spirit of Christ will compel you

[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:14.060]
And if that don't do it we have a

[01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:20.160]
The government will compel our lines and airline reservation companies to hand over all passenger records for scrutiny by US officials

[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:26.500]
After failing to win cooperation in the tent programs testing phase the order could be issued as soon as next month under the system

[01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:30.260]
All travelers passing through a US airport ought to be scored with a number

[01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:35.380]
Like you said a tattoo and a color that ranks their perceived threat to the aircraft

[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:41.640]
The tuna when a ship is vlogment a system introduced last week to fingerprint and photograph millions of foreign visitors on arrival in the US

[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:49.080]
Privacy and consumer advocates worry that both programs could be discriminatory because they subject airline passengers to different levels of scrutiny

[01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:54.580]
Certain travelers such as non-US citizens could face additional questioning other than other than the program known as CAPS2

[01:58:54.580 --> 01:59:00.760]
CAPS2 or the second version of the computer assisted passenger pre-screening program some organizations say

[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:07.500]
Business travelers who typically pay high price for their seats will likely get an easier pass to security in the registered traveler program

[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:14.380]
The two now listen to this is if we're not confused enough with the color code with everything else orange light yellow light

[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:22.920]
The two step process will result in a numerical and color score for each passenger a red rating means a passenger will be prohibited from boarding

[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:31.180]
Yellow indicates the passenger will receive additional scrutiny at the checkpoint a green rating paved way for standard trip to security and a pink rating means you'll be traveling in the rear

[01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:39.800]
Also fact in the one scroll be intelligence about certain routes and airports where there might be higher rated risk to security

[01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:53.100]
Although it's unclear how many passengers within in each category the TSA said its best estimation is that 5% of the traveling public will be flagged yellow or red compared with an estimated 15% who are flagged on the current version of CAPS1

[01:59:53.940 --> 02:00:01.880]
The registered traveler program also known as the trusted traveler that's me has been a favor to the airline industry since the terrorist attack well when are they going to start it already

[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:12.600]
The first leader of the TSA to kind of pursue the idea saying he worried that terrorists and sleepers cells could establish themselves as trusted residents over period years and later export their status to hijacked planes yet a good point

[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:13.220]
Yeah

[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:19.660]
Because they stay for those sleepers cells for a long time right they'll stay long enough and then the fly and then they'll give you a big smile

[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:33.720]
Hey everything's wonderful you're a good to go right ahead sir go ahead and by the way don't drop don't forget to bomb yeah well he's a trusted frequent traveler friend is a good guy carry on bomber you know he's safe he's a Saudi Arabian

[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:46.400]
Oh 5 6 7 0 5 60 pile let's get these phones go on baby let's get some action here man I want to see a little bit action and this otherwise got for second dead as town man how about those panthers or I forgot to mention that

[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:53.800]
Panthers send another whole bunch of free tickets just because they're so excited that they're doing so well another tie they blew two nothing lead in the third period in Vancouver last night

[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:59.400]
Two to tie they were there to two so here's a bunch more free tickets for the Montreal game on February 10th

[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:08.400]
And that pathetic getting a letter about all their more exciting now and Rick Dudley is doing this and Steve let's see if he's doing that to whatever's name is

[02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:10.380]
What's his name?

[02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:26.320]
I don't know what's his name 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T Steve Rimmer that's the guy WQAM hello Neil yes sir my name is Doug I'm calling from Boca yes Doug what up what up listen my problem with this administration is when bush gets on them TV and says

[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.200]
Oh yeah palies WQAM hello

[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:40.440]
I have a question for Neil speaking oh my we're doing screenless all this year sir I'm sorry I just wanted to remind you I don't know if you're calling that but the senior bush

[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:46.480]
You don't actually invaded Panama for no good right that's right what you're wondering you wanted to get in the rig and change the

[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:54.380]
Compression of the country do you remember what is a huge west for doing that no I don't well you know he had told the generals under no

[02:01:54.380 --> 02:02:02.360]
Diego that if you captured no yaga will come and take him off your hands right so they did that and somehow rather it did happen and those guys that took

[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:07.420]
No yaga were some early execute by now let me ask you this question how's Aris De doing down here in Haiti is he got all

[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:13.120]
In Liberty is going on I don't know anything about Haiti oh good don't go there trying on your laugh and I'm telling you don't go there it's

[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:18.460]
I have no intention even worse right now than it has been they may he makes baby doc and pop a doc look like good Samarins

[02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:27.620]
Well to finish what I was that telling you bush was so embarrassed by what happened yeah that he was waiting for an excuse in one night

[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:33.900]
Four GI's were returning from having dinner in Panama. I may inadvertently took a road that took him right in front of the National Guard headquarters

[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:39.640]

[02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:48.720]
Again. That's what I'm saying. Cause that's we they've been talking about that. That's the new tactic. Cause every time he opened his mouth there for a couple of weeks, since they're all out to get him. They're ganging up on him like gangbusters.

[02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:54.200]

Who will call simply

[02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.790]
Herbie.

[02:57:59.310 --> 02:58:02.110]
Remember the working conditions at C&C Music Factory.

Every two fucking seconds

[02:58:04.030 --> 02:58:06.850]

Son of a f-ck ladder.

[02:58:14.330 --> 02:58:16.070]
Workers at C&C Music Factory

[02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:18.890]
were expected to pump out 120 beats per minute.

[02:58:19.250 --> 02:58:20.250]
11 hours a day

[02:58:20.250 --> 02:58:23.250]

Which strove them on.

[02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:29.550]
A little bastard!

[02:58:30.310 --> 02:58:31.530]

[02:58:38.850 --> 02:58:39.530]
A little bastard!

[02:58:39.670 --> 02:58:40.270]
Oh now!

[02:58:42.310 --> 02:58:43.790]
But the aptly titled,

[02:58:44.150 --> 02:58:45.390]
Gonna Make You Sweat

[02:58:45.390 --> 02:58:48.730]
Was not the only hit that C&C Music Factory produced.

[02:58:50.750 --> 02:58:52.510]
That makes you go clean.

[02:58:52.970 --> 02:58:54.510]
That makes you go clean.

[02:58:54.510 --> 02:58:56.070]
Oh, that piece of s-

[02:58:56.070 --> 02:58:59.470]
My best friend had to die to make that crappy song.

[02:58:59.670 --> 02:59:00.710]
Herbie recalls the day

[02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:03.470]
Things that make you go, hmm, was produced.

[02:59:03.910 --> 02:59:04.870]
Poor little Sammy.

[02:59:05.450 --> 02:59:08.830]
He got caught in a sampling loop on the synthesizer belt and he-

[02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:10.110]
Oh, it was blood everywhere.

[02:59:10.590 --> 02:59:11.750]
He was a simple man.

[02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:14.810]
He just wanted to buy food and clothing for his wife

[02:59:14.810 --> 02:59:16.950]
And for their 14 disabled children

[02:59:16.950 --> 02:59:18.170]
Oh, God!

[02:59:18.350 --> 02:59:20.050]
I hope you're happy out there.

[02:59:20.410 --> 02:59:22.190]
Knowing a good man died

[02:59:22.190 --> 02:59:23.810]
So you could listen to a f-

[02:59:23.810 --> 02:59:24.770]
Damn song!

[02:59:25.250 --> 02:59:26.690]
You bastard!

[02:59:28.650 --> 02:59:30.750]
The C&C Music Factory

[02:59:30.750 --> 02:59:32.970]
People getting paid next to nothing

[02:59:32.970 --> 02:59:35.410]
Did turn out a useless piece of crap.

[02:59:35.850 --> 02:59:38.590]
Not that different from your job really is it?

[02:59:38.870 --> 02:59:40.310]
It's a big, juicy,

[02:59:40.510 --> 02:59:41.730]
Sopping wet look at your business.

[02:59:42.010 --> 02:59:43.590]
Tonight, uninsigned to behind.

[02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:47.190]
132 at 560 WQM, happy Monday 2, a mad dog standing by.

[02:59:47.330 --> 02:59:47.930]
He'll be here at 2.

[02:59:48.510 --> 02:59:50.990]
Oh, and now remember that story we had about the, um,

[02:59:51.390 --> 02:59:55.130]
The Burger King thing when we were like doing the cutting in on the intercoms?

[02:59:55.150 --> 02:59:55.550]
Right.

[02:59:56.490 --> 02:59:59.810]
Police said they expected the Federal Communications Commission to try to identify

[02:59:59.810 --> 03:00:03.990]
Whoever broadcasts on the same frequency is the wireless intercom at a Burger King in Tromachigan.

[03:00:04.110 --> 03:00:06.530]
The FCC, they got nothing better to worry about than that.

[03:00:06.650 --> 03:00:09.170]
About four letter words and about Burger King intercoms.

[03:00:09.170 --> 03:00:09.290]
Hey!

[03:00:09.510 --> 03:00:10.230]
Better than us.

[03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:12.030]
Right. Whatever that means.

[03:00:12.030 --> 03:00:13.850]
Well, you know what they say.

[03:00:14.970 --> 03:00:15.850]
What do they say?

[03:00:16.490 --> 03:00:19.570]
The person broke into the trail restaurants driving order system several times.

[03:00:19.650 --> 03:00:23.750]
I speak most recently on Thursday when he told customers they were too fat to eat a wapper.

[03:00:24.670 --> 03:00:29.450]
Other patrons were subjected to obscenities and bizarre remarks and the manager was ordered back inside.

[03:00:29.830 --> 03:00:31.470]
While trying to look into the source of the mischief.

[03:00:31.750 --> 03:00:32.690]
It has stopped.

[03:00:32.890 --> 03:00:35.850]
Stores supervisor Jennifer or whatever her name is told of Detroit Free Press.

[03:00:36.350 --> 03:00:38.110]
I believe the FCC is taking over the case.

[03:00:38.350 --> 03:00:40.090]
Police Sergeant William Avery said yesterday.

[03:00:40.090 --> 03:00:42.490]
I imagine they have a better way to investigate it.

[03:00:43.070 --> 03:00:47.770]
The FCC has radio direction finding equipment for detecting illicit transmitters.

[03:00:48.030 --> 03:00:50.410]
Federal law also carries more severe penalties than state law.

[03:00:50.550 --> 03:00:55.910]
With stiff fines and prison time for those convicted of willful or malicious interference with radio communicators.

[03:00:56.070 --> 03:00:56.730]
How do you like that?

[03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:58.430]
The government in action, man.

[03:00:58.770 --> 03:01:00.810]
That's Michael Powell for you.

[03:01:01.430 --> 03:01:02.130]
What's the asshole?

[03:01:03.070 --> 03:01:05.130]
You can't mess with our people at Burger King.

[03:01:05.970 --> 03:01:06.990]
Can you believe that?

[03:01:06.990 --> 03:01:08.810]
I want to do it. I wish I thought of it.

[03:01:08.910 --> 03:01:10.990]
Yeah. In fact, I probably do them people a favor.

[03:01:11.090 --> 03:01:12.350]
You too fat to eat them, awkward.

[03:01:12.470 --> 03:01:13.550]
Get out of here. Drive on.

[03:01:14.530 --> 03:01:15.430]
Move on out.

[03:01:17.050 --> 03:01:19.110]
Court next is appeal over 9-11 detentions.

[03:01:20.470 --> 03:01:28.170]
The Supreme Court refused today to consider whether the government properly withheld names and other details about hundreds of foreigners detained in the weeks and months after 9-11.

[03:01:28.650 --> 03:01:32.270]
The High Court turned down a request to review the secrecy surrounding detainees.

[03:01:32.270 --> 03:01:37.230]
Nearly all of them are Arabs or Muslims who were picked up in the US following the attacks on the World Trade Center in the Pentagon.

[03:01:37.230 --> 03:01:41.370]
More than, most of the more than 700 detainees had issued an case since been deported.

[03:01:42.190 --> 03:01:45.750]
Some picked up after 9-11 were charged with crimes. Others were held as material witnesses.

[03:01:46.170 --> 03:01:56.350]
Only Zacharias, whose name changes every five seconds of the way they pronounce it, is a courier, Zacharias Masawi, who was detained before 9-11 attacks, is being prosecuted and connected with 9-11 attacks and they're blowing that pretty good too.

[03:01:57.370 --> 03:01:58.330]
Let's first hold them, Zach.

[03:01:59.950 --> 03:02:00.910]
Watch your back, Zach.

[03:02:01.610 --> 03:02:04.550]
Much more important than that. And maybe Mokin can his ass too.

[03:02:04.770 --> 03:02:08.730]
Absolutely. I think he's a braw between former professional hockey player, Tony Twist.

[03:02:09.150 --> 03:02:10.570]
Oh yeah, St. Louis Blues, I remember him.

[03:02:11.410 --> 03:02:12.490]
And a goon.

[03:02:13.170 --> 03:02:16.210]
And a comic strip creator who named a violent mafia character after him.

[03:02:17.030 --> 03:02:21.430]
Twist claims the character in the spore, SBAWR, spore.

[03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:22.950]
Okay.

[03:02:23.310 --> 03:02:25.990]
Comic series. Heard his image. He caused him endorsement. Oh, spawn.

[03:02:26.490 --> 03:02:29.070]
There's a thing for this. You know, spawn?

[03:02:29.070 --> 03:02:30.910]
Yes. They made a movie.

[03:02:31.430 --> 03:02:36.730]
Custom endorsements. The high court rejected without comment and appeal from a spawn creator, Todd McFarlane, a argue that his work was free speech.

[03:02:37.130 --> 03:02:41.950]
McFarlane had a team of Hollywood backers, including Michael Critton, creator of the TV series ER, Clayton.

[03:02:42.950 --> 03:02:43.830]
Larry Davide.

[03:02:46.210 --> 03:02:47.610]
Co-creator, a Seinfeld.

[03:02:48.010 --> 03:02:51.650]
Novela Scott Tiro and Jeremiah Healy, no kind of Glenn Healy of the Amapolifs.

[03:02:52.110 --> 03:02:54.650]
And actor comedian, Harry Sheerer from The Simpsons.

[03:02:55.710 --> 03:02:56.670]
Harry Sheerer.

[03:02:57.250 --> 03:03:03.270]
They urged the court to use the case to clarify free speech protections for artists who routinely use the names of famous figures in their works.

[03:03:03.610 --> 03:03:09.430]
The character Antonio Tony Twist Twistelli was used not only in the comic strip, but also his feature in HBO Spinoff Show.

[03:03:09.850 --> 03:03:12.270]
And on some hockey merchandise twist told the injustices.

[03:03:13.310 --> 03:03:20.290]
The real Tony Twist, the former NHL enforcer known more for his fighting than his skating, was awarded more than $24.5 million by Missouri jury.

[03:03:22.030 --> 03:03:25.130]
The award was overturned on appeal, but a court ordered a second trial.

[03:03:25.270 --> 03:03:27.550]
The case is something rather still going on.

[03:03:28.610 --> 03:03:30.530]
Let's see, the court today also did these things.

[03:03:31.330 --> 03:03:35.710]
Well, let's see, is there anything important left undisturbed or ruling that upheld a ban on so-called junk faxes.

[03:03:36.410 --> 03:03:41.670]
An appeals court had ruled that the government had a substantial interest in protecting the public from unwanted fax ads.

[03:03:41.970 --> 03:03:48.050]
The decision upheld the telephone consumer protection act of 91, which regulates telemarketing calls, contains prohibitions against junk faxes.

[03:03:48.050 --> 03:03:52.410]
Oh, do you hear that little squirrely asshole out there about your junk faxes? You're going to jail.

[03:03:53.710 --> 03:03:59.350]
They declined a review and appeal from a man found guilty of voting fraud in 1999 for voting at what address while living at another.

[03:04:00.130 --> 03:04:09.310]
John Kennedy O'Hara, a lawyer, claims he was single out for prosecution. He was brought to trial three times by the Brooklyn D.A.'s office, the cases of O'Hara versus New York.

[03:04:10.970 --> 03:04:16.350]
And they passed a chance to consider a constitutional challenge to Florida's tax on pay-per-view boxing matches.

[03:04:16.730 --> 03:04:20.770]
A boxing promoter argued that similar taxes in California, Georgia, and Oregon have been invalidated.

[03:04:21.090 --> 03:04:26.190]
The cases top rank versus the Florida State Boxing Commission, they said, El Paso is what they said. Well, pass.

[03:04:26.970 --> 03:04:28.130]
Well, that's good news.

[03:04:28.230 --> 03:04:32.270]
In that good news? Well, they were too busy worrying about the, you know, getting in touch with the FCC.

[03:04:33.010 --> 03:04:33.690]
I don't want to be more than you.

[03:04:33.690 --> 03:04:36.530]
To make sure they see who's dicking with the intercoms at Burger King.

[03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:41.530]
Because boy, I'll tell you, they know their whoppers at the Supreme Court believe you may.

[03:04:41.910 --> 03:04:45.290]
Just like back in 2000, the greatest whopper of all time.

[03:04:46.650 --> 03:04:53.650]
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T Inforizon line. We're doing screenless. I don't see much action on there. And we got 23 minutes to kill.

[03:04:54.910 --> 03:04:55.630]
WQA, I'm hello.

[03:04:56.250 --> 03:04:57.610]
Neil, how you doing? Pretty good, sir.

[03:04:58.370 --> 03:05:01.510]
Hey, you know how fast is this Republican ticket?

[03:05:01.510 --> 03:05:02.810]
No, you're chronic. I don't want your boring.

[03:05:03.870 --> 03:05:09.630]
He's boring. I want to hear. I mean, he agrees and that's great. But you're boring and you're chronic and over and over and over and you're voice.

[03:05:09.810 --> 03:05:13.850]
It puts everybody into a coma and it would deep sleep. Okay. Call the Randy Roadshow, please.

[03:05:14.710 --> 03:05:18.410]
Call upon to those that we're going to change the world shows. I'm just here to pass along some information.

[03:05:18.650 --> 03:05:24.630]
I will play the 60 minutes thing again in a liter and a week. Good. I got it. Good to think it. I mean, it's great.

[03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:27.410]
See, maybe call me crazy. You're crazy. Okay.

[03:05:27.410 --> 03:05:32.610]
But it seems to me that this Paulo Neil thing. This is a bombshell. Yeah, the book will be released tomorrow.

[03:05:32.730 --> 03:05:35.110]
By the way, it's called the price of loyalty.

[03:05:36.090 --> 03:05:40.970]
And the author is what's his name? Donald Trump's felt. No, seriously. What's his name?

[03:05:41.210 --> 03:05:48.350]
O'Connor. No. He's on the piece. Suspined. Yeah. Anyway. Run. Suspined.

[03:05:48.510 --> 03:05:52.610]
Yeah, right now. Ronald Suspined. And it'll be on the bookstores tomorrow.

[03:05:53.170 --> 03:05:56.690]
Should be the story of the century. This is somebody he released. Not and he interviewed.

[03:05:56.750 --> 03:06:00.710]
Also, he said many other cabinet members. It wasn't just Paulo Neil and the other ones want to of course be anonymous.

[03:06:01.050 --> 03:06:04.930]
He's the only one that came public and pubic. Yeah, but don't you think he'd be traded the president?

[03:06:06.450 --> 03:06:12.690]
He a trader. So there it is. It relates it right out there for you. Man, a blind man in a room full of deaf people.

[03:06:13.090 --> 03:06:18.710]
Dick Cheney, Karl Rove. They're calling all the shots. The P-neck stuff. The attack on Iraq was planned law.

[03:06:18.710 --> 03:06:23.250]
And I've been telling the people that for two years now that they were getting ready to do something.

[03:06:23.330 --> 03:06:26.470]
And certainly since March, we've been telling that this was already preordained.

[03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:34.850]
Oh no, we had to do this because he was a dangerous man and look at those daines found that French is mustard in there.

[03:06:35.650 --> 03:06:40.050]
And a little great poop on on the side. Yeah. Yeah, they're pooping on the side. All right.

[03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:48.670]
God, tragic. Just a tragedy. The fact that they that there's that again, not in my blame in them. I'm blame the Democrats. Those are the people I blame.

[03:06:49.650 --> 03:06:57.370]
You have to head to Kenny star all those right wing lunatics man. They didn't waste any time. They got their ducks in order. They had the balls to do it. It was a disgrace.

[03:06:57.450 --> 03:06:59.570]
It was a waste of money in time, but they did it.

[03:07:01.210 --> 03:07:07.830]
Democrats are sitting back. Well, you're not as much for dark folks in the fixes. I am. Well, I'm, you know, all of a sudden they're crap.

[03:07:07.830 --> 03:07:14.410]
All he in fighting instead of putting the attack where it belongs and seeing who's doing the best job of that and articulating it the best.

[03:07:15.650 --> 03:07:24.710]
Should be one of the big stories of the of the year, maybe in the last 10 years. It's right there. The Iraq attack and the worst part of it is.

[03:07:24.810 --> 03:07:35.070]
Well, I got to that wrote it down. Bush saying go find me a way to do this. Yeah. Go find some way to make this happen to get rid of Saddam Hussein to throw him out over.

[03:07:35.070 --> 03:07:41.750]
Throw the thing and of course get all our ducks in a row for the oil over there. Go find me a way to do this and make it palatable.

[03:07:41.930 --> 03:07:51.570]
So the public will go along with it. Those are those O'Neill liberal lies. Yeah, right. Good old Republican, Paul O'Neill and Kevin Phillips and Papu Cannon and the list goes on.

[03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:58.430]
So it's all right. Therefore it's like they're putting up billboards all over America. Just take a look at it. Okay. There's the few can truth.

[03:07:59.250 --> 03:08:03.650]
Just take a look at it and absorb it. Suck it in and hold it.

[03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:09.250]
20 till two of the Mad Dogs coming along to talk about more important stuff like ball games had a lot of good ones over the weekend.

[03:08:09.370 --> 03:08:16.410]
Man, it was just gut wrenching. It was incredible. Just one after another. Patriot game just took about five years off my life. Wow.

[03:08:16.970 --> 03:08:22.430]
And I was pulling for Kansas City yesterday because I figured at least that way Trent Green and Tommy Brady.

[03:08:22.430 --> 03:08:25.810]
At least that way if it's Kansas City and the Patriots and the Super Bowl, I can't do that.

[03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:32.870]
Or like an EFC championship, I mean, at least then you got two great looking quarterbacks. Isn't that what it's all about?

[03:08:33.650 --> 03:08:40.570]
And Joe Named says 19 till two at QM. Hey, listen, you might be doing that too after either the animal coach.

[03:08:40.730 --> 03:08:46.250]
They have a few belt because you'll be so full, man, but you'll be happy because you can't beat the animal coast with a stick.

[03:08:46.570 --> 03:08:49.630]
They can accommodate all kinds of groups for it to take the whole gang from the office.

[03:08:50.290 --> 03:08:57.310]
Start your mouthwatering experience at the animal coast with six different soups. Then sampled dozens of delicious amazing entrees like New York strip made of order.

[03:08:57.530 --> 03:09:04.850]
Their sizzling Asian grill along with that great seafood saying Jacques named of course after the great late gold tender Jacques plot first go to wear a mask.

[03:09:05.270 --> 03:09:11.490]
Enjoy oysters on a half shell every night and there's lots more like the Laskin stone crab, middle neck clams, dumbos shrimp scampi.

[03:09:11.690 --> 03:09:15.030]
And now for the first time ever main lobster on a weekends at the animal coast.

[03:09:15.450 --> 03:09:23.430]
Shoveled in a little that hard hand car primer and their new tie specialties to and you'll never walk out of there like I always tell you with a pounding headache from MSG because they don't use any.

[03:09:23.710 --> 03:09:28.730]
No MSG, no cornstarch, no crap, they cook all their fine cuisine only with cholesterol free oils.

[03:09:29.170 --> 03:09:36.010]
There's a full salad bar, new sushi bar fresh for your shrimp cocktail. And if by some miracle or maybe you're just a big fat tub, you have room at the end of the meal.

[03:09:36.010 --> 03:09:42.510]
There's a full dessert station too with bells and waffles pies cakes pastries ice cream with all your favorite toppings, even fresh fruit.

[03:09:42.510 --> 03:09:50.110]
Three locations for you at the animal coast are in sunrise, pineapple to 44th Street. They're on Collins Avenue just next to a North of 163rd North Miami Beach.

[03:09:50.410 --> 03:09:57.730]
Also at the intersection of flamingo and Pembroke roads and Pembroke pines. So take the gods and mishpulls even if you don't know what that means or the whole office is for your next business luncheon.

[03:09:57.950 --> 03:10:05.490]
For the animal coast and let our friends over there do the cooking for you. Take out and deliver you always available to call 954-572-3822.

[03:10:08.530 --> 03:10:13.870]
A lot of other Chinese but phased pop it up. They're not even in the same league. Would the animal coast be the bestest anywhere?

[03:10:14.230 --> 03:10:18.710]
5 in the local office is 5 cities. The radio's all yours.

[03:10:19.970 --> 03:10:20.850]
Q&A

[03:10:23.050 --> 03:10:25.070]
Ladies, this is television that it's best.

[03:10:25.210 --> 03:10:31.570]
What is the message there? The message is that there are known knowns. There are things we know that we know.

[03:10:32.090 --> 03:10:38.030]
There are known unknowns. That is to say there are things that we now know we don't know.

[03:10:38.170 --> 03:10:45.510]
Strong, bewildering words. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know. We don't know.

[03:10:46.390 --> 03:10:52.990]
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? I'm just talking. This is blah, blah, just words.

[03:10:53.310 --> 03:11:00.370]
This has been a presentation of ABC News. You talking to me? Yeah. Oh, 145. Well said this.

[03:11:01.050 --> 03:11:06.570]
145 at 560 WQM. The mad dog was just in and he said, oh, right. Yeah, he's all whipped up with these ball games. No pressure.

[03:11:07.050 --> 03:11:11.470]
No pressure because that often the season is over. Let's find out if we can fire a day of Wants the two later.

[03:11:12.030 --> 03:11:16.370]
Yeah, today that they are supposed to be naming the GM to bring in somebody. I think it's a war in Camarri.

[03:11:16.570 --> 03:11:19.770]
Yeah, they figured out he knew nothing about baseball. Let's see if he knows anything about football.

[03:11:20.290 --> 03:11:27.250]
How? Give me the ball. Give me the ball. And give me that powder. It's time to take a powder. Cashmere bouquet is what it is.

[03:11:27.250 --> 03:11:34.170]
And what were you just saying? The transcript of that 60 minutes, uh, minics pieces on the website and a year ago,

[03:11:34.370 --> 03:11:41.910]
Paul O'Neill was fired from his job as George Bush's Treasury Secretary. You mean that one? And working on getting the audio link going.

[03:11:42.110 --> 03:11:48.930]
Nice going on here. The best baby. I'm talking. He is so good. I don't know what you said or did him. Nothing. Oh, get out of here.

[03:11:49.650 --> 03:11:57.510]
I think when Boerbore was here, that created like a rift. Not to mention, of course, the two years before Boerbore came in and when he didn't do anything.

[03:11:57.670 --> 03:12:04.550]
I mean, sorry. Well, no, he's making up for lost time. Although he did. We did have a little because I faxed him that poll and I thought you forgot to fax him Friday.

[03:12:05.230 --> 03:12:11.770]
So I called him to alert him to it. And he said, you know, those 85 bedtime stories could you maybe cut it down a little bit. I was getting a little carried away.

[03:12:11.770 --> 03:12:21.910]
No, seriously, because I had the 30 days in a row and he said it took him like a couple hours. And he'd like to get you know on the treadmill or exercise bike. And I thought, well, I'm, I'm certainly not going to take time away from that.

[03:12:22.670 --> 03:12:31.710]
Do you really believe he's on the treadmill or exercise? No, no. He didn't see in the second time he came down. You'll hear ever saw him. Well, he lost him. Really fat time. He lost like 60 pounds between the two.

[03:12:31.830 --> 03:12:38.910]
How do you know what he looks like now? Once a last time, I don't know. We know what for it. And it's like the beast. So in other words, he could weigh anywhere between like 180 and 480.

[03:12:39.290 --> 03:12:49.030]
It's a floating weight. Yeah, like the beast. Oh, if this crowd. It's seriously. It looks like a human beach ball with legs. Human beach ball with little tiny legs.

[03:12:49.250 --> 03:12:55.610]
Like a shoe. He is a schmoo. Forget about your polluca. If you want to see the real schmoo see the beast. Check him out.

[03:12:57.030 --> 03:13:05.090]
663 votes. Any too bad. Considering this requires like an IQ larger than your thumbnail, I would assume that you put a option on there for them. Oh, yeah.

[03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:14.670]
Regardless of which candidate you support, which contender is best articulating your views. That's a little bit artsy, fancy that we usually, usually we have like a bunch of crap on there.

[03:13:14.910 --> 03:13:20.130]
But we're trying to like appeal the way much higher intellect. Are we? No, no, we're not. No, we're not. And we like the.

[03:13:37.850 --> 03:13:50.110]
We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We

[03:13:50.110 --> 03:13:54.010]
we control the war, that's great. But it wasn't a It wasn't a one shot deal. But it wasn't a one shot deal. But it was not like, well, he

[03:13:54.010 --> 03:13:55.450]
wasn't a one shot deal. They'll like, well, he got in a good line one shot deal. But it wasn't a one shot deal. He got in a good line one time. He'll like, well, he got in a good line one time.

[03:13:55.610 --> 03:14:00.550]
He'll like, well, he got in a good line one time. He'll like, well, he got in a good line one time. He'll like, well, he got in a good line one time. He'll like, well. Well, he's got a great sensing. Well, he's got a great sensing. humor. Sure.

[03:14:01.150 --> 03:14:01.630]
Well, if you look like that.

[03:14:01.630 --> 03:14:01.970]
Well, if you look like that.

[03:14:02.410 --> 03:14:11.790]
Well, if you look like that.

[03:14:12.410 --> 03:14:13.210]
Thank God.

[03:14:13.430 --> 03:14:15.230]
Sharpton 38, Edwards 28,

[03:14:16.370 --> 03:14:18.590]
Carrie 16, Lieberman 10,

[03:14:19.450 --> 03:14:20.570]
for the old Jew Lieberman,

[03:14:21.090 --> 03:14:23.010]
mostly brawn 8, and Dick Abhardt,

[03:14:23.010 --> 03:14:25.130]
he's been pulled up behind end all day long.

[03:14:25.530 --> 03:14:27.130]
Old Dick, seven.

[03:14:28.590 --> 03:14:29.530]
He's been sucking.

[03:14:29.850 --> 03:14:31.210]
He's been sucking wind all day.

[03:14:31.810 --> 03:14:35.370]
Dick, it's 11 before 2 at 5.60 WQAM,

[03:14:36.070 --> 03:14:38.570]
that mad dog man, he is too much, you know what I'm saying?

[03:14:38.670 --> 03:14:39.810]
I'll be along at 2 o'clock,

[03:14:39.810 --> 03:14:41.830]
he's in fine form, make no mistake about it,

[03:14:42.110 --> 03:14:44.270]
and I'm sure he gave my Patriots a lot of credit,

[03:14:44.590 --> 03:14:46.030]
unlike somebody else that we all know.

[03:14:46.170 --> 03:14:46.970]
I want to get him.

[03:14:49.270 --> 03:14:51.250]
Yeah, always, there's still, I still say,

[03:14:51.330 --> 03:14:52.830]
there's a lot of luck in all the right bounces.

[03:14:53.090 --> 03:14:55.750]
Yeah, you only wish to tombrate these balls with bounce

[03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:56.730]
and hit you in a chin mode.

[03:14:56.790 --> 03:14:57.390]
That's what you want.

[03:14:57.530 --> 03:14:58.630]
How the guilty turned you down.

[03:15:00.390 --> 03:15:00.710]
WQAM.

[03:15:03.430 --> 03:15:03.970]
Hello, you?

[03:15:04.090 --> 03:15:04.470]
Yes, sir.

[03:15:04.950 --> 03:15:05.750]
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

[03:15:05.890 --> 03:15:07.670]
I think I was talking about that.

[03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:10.570]
I gave, I've approved a place for Colorado,

[03:15:11.130 --> 03:15:14.170]
Lockheed, that was the hot question he was talking about.

[03:15:14.390 --> 03:15:14.910]
Reverend Jones.

[03:15:16.590 --> 03:15:17.210]
WQAM, hello.

[03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:17.910]
Uncle Neil.

[03:15:18.030 --> 03:15:18.350]
Yes, sir.

[03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:21.350]
If you, I don't know, I'm sure you've done this already,

[03:15:21.530 --> 03:15:23.750]
but if you go on to the Pnex website,

[03:15:23.930 --> 03:15:25.350]
you can do a Google search and go on them.

[03:15:25.490 --> 03:15:29.370]
They got this map of the world where you can click on the window

[03:15:29.370 --> 03:15:32.350]
to see all their writings and projects over the last,

[03:15:33.090 --> 03:15:34.330]
all the way back to like 97.

[03:15:34.710 --> 03:15:34.830]
Right.

[03:15:34.830 --> 03:15:38.150]
Well, if you go to around September 11, 2001,

[03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:40.870]
there's a lot of chatter if you know what I mean.

[03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:42.110]
Yeah.

[03:15:42.430 --> 03:15:43.690]
Yeah, I know you don't like Bill Mar,

[03:15:43.730 --> 03:15:45.250]
but he had a great comment.

[03:15:45.470 --> 03:15:47.810]
I'm not only going to like this light, Bill Mar.

[03:15:47.910 --> 03:15:49.650]
I can't stand by despise him.

[03:15:49.770 --> 03:15:51.770]
Well, he had a funny comment about Joe Lieberman.

[03:15:51.870 --> 03:15:51.950]
Yeah.

[03:15:52.610 --> 03:15:55.430]
Joe Lieberman seems to think that President Bush

[03:15:55.430 --> 03:15:57.210]
would make a great president if he was only Jewish.

[03:15:58.510 --> 03:15:59.190]
That's not bad.

[03:15:59.430 --> 03:16:00.090]
That wasn't bad.

[03:16:00.210 --> 03:16:02.690]
It was on the Dead Man in the morning show.

[03:16:02.850 --> 03:16:04.050]
I was catching a snippet of him.

[03:16:04.050 --> 03:16:04.690]
Oh, my God.

[03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:05.750]
You're the one that's watching that.

[03:16:05.890 --> 03:16:07.190]
Don't make a habit of it, man.

[03:16:07.490 --> 03:16:07.690]
All right.

[03:16:07.750 --> 03:16:08.610]
Well, it's because you're off.

[03:16:08.730 --> 03:16:09.350]
It's your off.

[03:16:09.630 --> 03:16:11.130]
We wish we could get you back on.

[03:16:11.290 --> 03:16:11.750]
No thanks.

[03:16:12.150 --> 03:16:12.710]
See you.

[03:16:13.230 --> 03:16:14.230]
Out loud, man.

[03:16:14.450 --> 03:16:14.810]
Out loud.

[03:16:14.930 --> 03:16:15.590]
That's where we want to be.

[03:16:15.810 --> 03:16:17.350]
Are they still speaking English on whammy?

[03:16:17.390 --> 03:16:17.510]
No.

[03:16:17.630 --> 03:16:19.110]
For some one they weren't either.

[03:16:19.850 --> 03:16:20.550]
Out loud Bill.

[03:16:21.850 --> 03:16:22.210]
Tash.

[03:16:22.570 --> 03:16:23.750]
It's not Tash.

[03:16:24.190 --> 03:16:24.290]
Tech.

[03:16:25.250 --> 03:16:25.810]
That's right.

[03:16:26.210 --> 03:16:27.290]
Easy around with Drek.

[03:16:28.130 --> 03:16:28.490]
Right.

[03:16:28.650 --> 03:16:30.150]
Ever see Bill tech and Todd Drek?

[03:16:30.310 --> 03:16:30.430]
No.

[03:16:30.550 --> 03:16:30.870]
Same place.

[03:16:31.030 --> 03:16:31.130]
No.

[03:16:31.130 --> 03:16:32.650]
Same guy by the way.

[03:16:32.890 --> 03:16:33.130]
Very.

[03:16:33.890 --> 03:16:36.410]
Only one of them can hear sports radio.

[03:16:36.410 --> 03:16:37.010]
That's my ass.

[03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:38.750]
UAF.

[03:16:40.090 --> 03:16:42.310]
Suck it in and hold it.

[03:16:46.530 --> 03:16:50.290]
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded.

[03:16:50.710 --> 03:16:54.690]
To Domet people killed with the gas that we sold him.

[03:16:55.010 --> 03:16:58.590]
First time aggressor nation and the only one that's going.

[03:16:58.590 --> 03:17:02.970]
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing.

[03:17:03.430 --> 03:17:06.790]
Forget about Korea and the nooks there.

[03:17:06.950 --> 03:17:07.790]
No shimamba.

[03:17:08.310 --> 03:17:14.490]
Right wing is drilling it over and over into our hips.

[03:17:15.550 --> 03:17:20.750]
That irack has some mappings of mass destruction.

[03:17:31.950 --> 03:17:33.990]
3000 people killed.

[03:17:34.410 --> 03:17:37.590]
I now forgotten let's exploit them instead.

[03:17:38.090 --> 03:17:42.310]
Hey there's oil to be caught in going after sent down to.

[03:17:42.810 --> 03:17:44.050]
Plankato Sama.

[03:17:44.650 --> 03:17:48.030]
There's no longer mention of the name in law.

[03:17:48.170 --> 03:17:50.670]
But no one seemed concerned all.

[03:17:51.110 --> 03:17:52.710]
I'll be in complacence.

[03:17:52.990 --> 03:17:57.130]
Believe in every word of this cartel administration that

[03:17:57.130 --> 03:18:03.390]
controls us by fear for media manipulation and the right wing is

[03:18:03.390 --> 03:18:07.950]
drilling it over and over into our hips.

[03:18:08.150 --> 03:18:14.130]
That irack has some mappings of mass destruction.

[03:18:24.170 --> 03:18:29.010]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying.

[03:18:29.370 --> 03:18:31.030]
We're all suspects now.

[03:18:31.250 --> 03:18:33.010]
Not the ass-brop is saying.

[03:18:33.430 --> 03:18:34.930]
I have nothing to hide.

[03:18:35.370 --> 03:18:37.210]
Table talkers all are saying.

[03:18:37.830 --> 03:18:41.190]
Plinopedian cattle don't have any reservations.

[03:18:41.190 --> 03:18:45.630]
Out of roboque battle and world annihilation.

[03:18:45.950 --> 03:18:51.550]
Old regime must fall in haliburgeon and stoke with no objection at all.

[03:18:51.950 --> 03:19:01.850]
And the craft don't have the ball and the right wing is drilling it over and over into our brain wash pants.

[03:19:01.850 --> 03:19:06.890]
I rack has some women the master's truck.

[03:19:07.110 --> 03:19:07.510]
John.

[03:19:07.990 --> 03:19:09.090]
There's no movie unlucky.

[03:19:09.610 --> 03:19:14.930]
Only I rack has some women the master's truck.

[03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:15.950]
Eat your heart out, Mom.

[03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.990]
I got my own bus grab.

[03:19:16.990 --> 03:19:17.970]
Baby, it's a beauty.

[03:19:18.110 --> 03:19:18.350]
Oh.

[03:19:20.670 --> 03:19:21.690]
Don't you think that's me?

[03:19:21.970 --> 03:19:23.050]
I mean, I don't know if I have it on right.

[03:19:23.170 --> 03:19:25.410]
But he's got, you know, I think you might have to be fitted.

[03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:26.450]
Oh, yeah.

[03:19:27.850 --> 03:19:29.810]
It sure feels nice and comfy up there.

[03:19:29.810 --> 03:19:30.010]
Yeah.

[03:19:30.610 --> 03:19:33.090]
I might just get my head shaved and just wear the old muskrat.

[03:19:33.530 --> 03:19:34.690]
Do the muskrat ramble.

[03:19:34.810 --> 03:19:36.930]
I'll bring you a coonskin cat from Carolina.

[03:19:37.330 --> 03:19:37.810]
Oh, really?

[03:19:38.030 --> 03:19:38.130]
Sure.

[03:19:38.490 --> 03:19:39.570]
From a corn?

[03:19:40.250 --> 03:19:41.510]
The real with the head still on it.

[03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:42.130]
I'll be there.

[03:19:42.430 --> 03:19:44.010]
80 bucks for a real one.

[03:19:44.450 --> 03:19:45.670]
I hear they like those in Mississippi.

[03:19:47.090 --> 03:19:47.650]
5.67.

[03:19:47.830 --> 03:19:48.570]
05.60.

[03:19:50.590 --> 03:19:54.110]
05.60 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[03:19:54.230 --> 03:19:55.430]
Well, you know what Rick weaver used to say.

[03:19:55.530 --> 03:19:56.430]
It's a treat to beat your feet.

[03:19:56.850 --> 03:19:57.650]
Something like that.

[03:19:59.050 --> 03:19:59.530]
WDQA.M.

[03:19:59.650 --> 03:19:59.750]
Hello.

[03:20:00.450 --> 03:20:01.070]
Yeah, Neil.

[03:20:01.270 --> 03:20:01.690]
Yes, sir.

[03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:03.390]
Hey, Cousinich.

[03:20:04.030 --> 03:20:04.270]
Yes.

[03:20:04.410 --> 03:20:05.590]
Did you hear what he did last week?

[03:20:06.170 --> 03:20:06.530]
What's that?

[03:20:07.110 --> 03:20:14.650]
He was on national public radio and he held up a pie chart and the moderators said, sir,

[03:20:14.830 --> 03:20:15.450]
we're on radio.

[03:20:15.850 --> 03:20:16.030]
Right.

[03:20:16.590 --> 03:20:17.210]
Not good.

[03:20:18.550 --> 03:20:20.590]
I mean, that's his one blunder.

[03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:21.770]
He said, we do that all the time.

[03:20:22.310 --> 03:20:22.850]
Look at this.

[03:20:23.390 --> 03:20:25.010]
So anyway, but to have a good day.

[03:20:25.010 --> 03:20:28.530]
Well, I mean, as soon as this was at least a pucky pie, see you.

[03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:30.270]
5.61.

[03:20:30.610 --> 03:20:31.550]
Did I say he was perfect?

[03:20:31.790 --> 03:20:31.950]
No.

[03:20:32.050 --> 03:20:32.150]
No.

[03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:36.270]
Maybe he was trying to deflect attention from the hair piece from the panel.

[03:20:36.370 --> 03:20:37.130]
You think that might have been it?

[03:20:37.130 --> 03:20:38.170]
That could be it.

[03:20:38.170 --> 03:20:41.170]
Because we see like I'm sitting here with his muskete on my head, right?

[03:20:41.550 --> 03:20:44.190]
And you're afraid that everybody's going to be looking at it, you know?

[03:20:44.590 --> 03:20:46.910]
So maybe he held up the chart so they would like kind of look away.

[03:20:47.410 --> 03:20:48.910]
I hear he moond him too as a matter of fact.

[03:20:48.990 --> 03:20:51.570]
Just anything to get the attention off the top of his head.

[03:20:52.970 --> 03:20:56.770]
5.670560, 0560 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[03:20:57.390 --> 03:20:57.990]
WQAM, hello.

[03:20:58.430 --> 03:20:58.750]
Nail.

[03:20:58.990 --> 03:20:59.470]
Yes, sir.

[03:20:59.750 --> 03:21:00.510]
I agree with you, man.

[03:21:00.670 --> 03:21:02.110]
Our dean got slammed yesterday.

[03:21:02.470 --> 03:21:03.810]
Yeah, he's fallen bad.

[03:21:04.330 --> 03:21:04.950]
Can you say this though?

[03:21:05.030 --> 03:21:05.830]
He's got great ideas.

[03:21:06.050 --> 03:21:08.430]
He speaks well, but man, I had never seen him before.

[03:21:08.550 --> 03:21:10.370]
Yes, I do as they cut him on the camera.

[03:21:10.410 --> 03:21:11.570]
I thought it was starting to lie.

[03:21:11.770 --> 03:21:13.310]
Well, okay, is there a person hitting somebody?

[03:21:14.170 --> 03:21:14.650]
What can I say?

[03:21:14.730 --> 03:21:16.410]
And by the way, I'm holding up some pie right now.

[03:21:16.510 --> 03:21:17.050]
Can you see it?

[03:21:17.190 --> 03:21:17.730]
I see it.

[03:21:17.970 --> 03:21:19.450]
It's still a bit like hair pie to me.

[03:21:20.390 --> 03:21:21.030]
5.1.

[03:21:21.910 --> 03:21:24.350]
6.95, oh, we can get to 500 before we finish.

[03:21:25.190 --> 03:21:26.610]
I mean, 700, whatever it is.

[03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:27.490]
Yeah, we can get to 300.

[03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:29.710]
We can get to 700 votes before we get done.

[03:21:29.830 --> 03:21:31.430]
You think I should like redo it?

[03:21:32.050 --> 03:21:32.690]
Oh, whatever.

[03:21:33.570 --> 03:21:33.710]
Huh?

[03:21:35.970 --> 03:21:36.670]
Let me do it.

[03:21:37.010 --> 03:21:38.190]
Oh, we got a few seconds here.

[03:21:39.210 --> 03:21:40.370]
We could steal a couple of seconds.

[03:21:40.530 --> 03:21:42.110]
In fact, the mad dog, he, uh, he don't mind.

[03:21:42.810 --> 03:21:45.830]
Do you know that he's actually counted the number of shows that he does a year?

[03:21:45.910 --> 03:21:47.270]
He's, even, he puts me to shame.

[03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:49.830]
He is unbelievable.

[03:21:50.330 --> 03:21:52.450]
He told me he has 200 and 12 shows here.

[03:21:52.510 --> 03:21:53.530]
I said you just making that up.

[03:21:53.530 --> 03:21:54.530]
You know, he's got it done.

[03:21:54.630 --> 03:21:57.230]
He's got it in his, uh, yeah, but his shows are really long.

[03:21:57.230 --> 03:22:00.530]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[03:22:00.730 --> 03:22:01.630]
Man, oh man.

[03:22:01.730 --> 03:22:03.650]
Can you imagine how much he's getting paid by the minute?

[03:22:03.770 --> 03:22:04.750]
About 30 minutes.

[03:22:04.810 --> 03:22:05.690]
Oh, 701.

[03:22:05.790 --> 03:22:06.190]
Piece of cake.

[03:22:06.270 --> 03:22:06.710]
No problem.

[03:22:06.810 --> 03:22:08.230]
Okay, mad dog is next to Humper.

[03:22:08.410 --> 03:22:09.870]
The load for this afternoon.

[03:22:10.010 --> 03:22:10.870]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:14.450]
Can you rest your show on Fising Evil, UQA app?

[03:22:14.710 --> 03:22:15.650]
Plainly for LARGAR.

[03:22:16.110 --> 03:22:16.750]
Hooray!

[03:22:19.910 --> 03:22:20.550]
Absolutely.
