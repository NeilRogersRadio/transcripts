[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.280]
You talk as long as that was Chad Cheats, man.

[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.720]
Let go.

[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.580]
Next go then.

[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.140]
Wow.

[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.820]
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey.

[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.240]
Q-A-M, Miami Ford Lutter Taylor.

[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:29.260]
How dare they drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein torture prison.

[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.680]
You go boy, I just get goosebumps every time I play there.

[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.200]
I might just play it the whole four hours today.

[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.760]
What do you say?

[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.160]
Oh!

[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.060]
Huh?

[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.640]
Okay.

[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.960]
But go over and over again.

[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.260]
Get everybody whipped up like a pep rally.

[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.580]
Anyway, just calm down.

[00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.240]
Uh, first time I was going to be a little bit more like a little bit more like a little bit more.

[00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.240]

[00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.240]

[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.260]
Just a little news from Iraq.

[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.920]
Just a little bit.

[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.820]
We don't want to get too Newsy that New York illiterate guy from off the streets of the Bronx.

[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.700]
He'll be calling in again.

[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.300]
How come you're so Newsy?

[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.500]
Well, because we feel like it.

[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.760]
Okay?

[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.220]
Because, you know, we do whatever we want, generally speaking.

[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.860]
Gunmen opened fire on a US Army vehicle today in Najef's twin city, wounding two American soldiers and raising fears over the agreement struck today before.

[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.100]
In other words, the roadbaps are a little bumpy already.

[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.300]
Uh, to end the bloody standoff around this Shiite holy city.

[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.920]
In fact, they're saying, aw, Shiite here we go again elsewhere.

[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.220]
US troops escorting a convoy of inmates released from the Abu Gharram prison.

[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.020]
Briefly, if James Firewood assailants today was the third major release from the facility since the scandal broke over the abuse of the Teenies last month.

[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.680]
And we fought out at 90% and probably were there for nothing because they just happened to be hanging around.

[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.600]
Yeah, Iraqis, they're terrorists.

[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.560]
They're suspicious, right?

[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.480]
But I thought we were freeing the suspicious Iraqis.

[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.540]
Anyway, we had 1,660 votes on the podium.

[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.980]
See, you know, at first it was the weapons of mass destruction.

[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.880]
We didn't have any of those.

[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.580]
Then it was, well, Sodom must have been in bed with Osama Yomama.

[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.860]
Well, we found out that definitely was not true.

[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.660]
And so we had to come up with something.

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.680]
So it's this glorious Operation Iraqi Freedom.

[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.320]
Anybody buying that? Only the dumbest of the dumb.

[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.180]
Speaking of dumbest of the dumb, wait till we get to that story about the so-called terror ruler.

[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.120]
Oh, brother.

[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.820]
No, no, seriously, this is just, I mean, you talk about playing politics with fear.

[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.320]
This is just enough to scare the crap out anybody.

[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.940]
You know, hey, there's a danger.

[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.720]
Every time the pool numbers, what have I all said consistently right along?

[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.980]
Every time the pool's command gets worse and worse for the Bush crowd for this group of Nazis.

[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.940]
All of a sudden, all of a sudden, oh, some miraculous thing comes along.

[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.440]
Oh, we just found Sodom.

[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.300]
Or, oh, we just had them to the big terror ruler.

[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.880]
You better crawl into the bed and get real scared.

[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.560]
Yeah.

[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.600]
The only thing we have to fear as Roosevelt would say is this bunch.

[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.440]
Anyway, what big TV hit show the past five years?

[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.880]
You think was the biggest piece of Schmidt?

[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.020]
That's what we asked yesterday.

[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.640]
And over 1,660 votes to be exact.

[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.400]
And in a cool show, wind's hands down.

[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.020]
Now you people had facts didn't said she's gonna pass all the others like her standing still.

[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.560]
You folks were absolutely correct.

[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.820]
Yeah.

[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.820]
210 for a big fat disgusting and in a cool.

[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.640]
Who ate quite as big and fat as before, but still as disgusting.

[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.720]
American Idol 295 for those of us who have not the least but interested.

[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.740]
See, this is the bandwagon effect.

[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.500]
Oh, you've got to be on American Idol.

[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.280]
We're gonna have the winner.

[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.280]
We don't care.

[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.400]
So we refused to care about crap that we didn't care about it before.

[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.000]
So why should we?

[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.400]
It's like mash, you know.

[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.320]
Oh, 80 trillion people watched the last episode of mash.

[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.140]
Now if you like mash, I can understand that.

[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.420]
But if you didn't like it at all, like Seinfeld.

[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.860]
Remember the big sinister thing made about that.

[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.420]
Oh, it's the last episode of Seinfeld.

[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.420]
You only see it in syndication 8 trillion times.

[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.540]
Now if you didn't like the Seinfeld show, then you probably didn't care about the first episode,

[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.400]
the last episode, the way the ones in between.

[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.920]
Oh, you're just an anti-Send-Lite.

[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.660]
There you go.

[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.980]
I learned it from you.

[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.080]
American Idol 295, Survivor 161, Jerry Springer 143, the Simple Life 105.

[00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.320]
What about the Spooners?

[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.780]
The Honey Spooners.

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.580]
Yeah.

[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.580]
The Silver Spooners.

[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.320]
Anyway, Joe Millionaire 104.

[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.040]
Ricky Lake 74.

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.900]
She's disgusting.

[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.440]
She is nauseated.

[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.440]

[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.800]
Friends 72.

[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.660]
The Osborne's 55.

[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.600]
The Wickedest, I can't believe that.

[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.360]
This audience, 55 people like the Osborne's is the biggest piece of crap.

[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.680]
Shame on you, Sharon.

[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.920]
I just hate the kids.

[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.060]
And Sharon.

[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.700]
The Wickedest Link 48.

[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.160]
Fear factor 47.

[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.080]
With the old turn of the Wicked Worm.

[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.580]
I hear that muffled like that one.

[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.320]
Millionaire 44.

[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.540]
The Bachelor 39.

[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.740]
Big Brother 36.

[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.120]
The Bachelor at 32.

[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.700]
Meet my parents 25.

[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.180]
No thanks.

[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.840]
The real world of 19.

[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.920]
The real world had 19.

[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.180]
I didn't even know we put it on there.

[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.560]
Yeah.

[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.640]
It was wrong with that show.

[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.900]
It's stupid, but nevertheless it's got naked teenagers.

[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.320]
Oh, man.

[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.760]
You people better get your priorities straight now to maybe something else too while we're at it.

[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.660]
Back in the day we could tell you what we're thinking about.

[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.300]
The real world war.

[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.340]
A Becker 14, Samprano's 14, which I know you're not too pleased with that.

[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.740]
I would have.

[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.240]
Fray, well that was near the bottom.

[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.460]
Frayser 11 and the Wayans Brothers said 11.

[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.800]
Before the big fight, let's watch the Wayans.

[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.460]
What do you say?

[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.740]

[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.580]
For my part, now it was Damon Wayans that was in Requiem.

[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.040]
Correct.

[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.900]
There you go.

[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.900]
Well, I have trouble getting my Wayans.

[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.920]
Yeah, they all at the same deal.

[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.300]
I separated.

[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.140]
They all seem the same.

[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.200]
Anyway, on our beaded curtain today we have something extra special.

[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.900]
Memorial Holiday Weekend bonus.

[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.720]
No extra charge.

[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.400]
Two for the price.

[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.840]
We got four for the price of one.

[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.980]
I mean, two pictures.

[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.480]
Right.

[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.720]
And four boobies.

[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.200]
Huh?

[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.020]
Impact, you might call it a booby trap.

[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.620]
And they're a full frontal assault.

[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.580]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.060]
Now you were kind of apologizing for this before the show,

[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.320]
but I think we struck Peter.

[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.180]
We got a very patriotic thing.

[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.100]
We struck something.

[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.900]
Yeah.

[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.900]
Right.

[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.800]
I bet you would.

[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.300]
Anyway, speaking of Nell McCandor and people may be wondering,

[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.020]
who the hell is that?

[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.160]
You don't really care who it is.

[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.100]
You just want to see the pictures.

[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.960]
But I'll tell you anyway.

[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.380]
On November 6, 1973, a star was born in Leeds, England,

[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.360]
to work in class family.

[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.620]
What?

[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.800]
Miguel's standing at attention in saluting.

[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.860]
Now, Betty is, huh?

[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.400]
Yeah.

[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.180]
And why not?

[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.000]
And he rudded the stick like him.

[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.480]
Tracy, of course, he probably this weekend

[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.140]
be drilling some glory holes over it highly.

[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.680]
Here, they plugged up the old ones.

[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.620]
Oh, damn it.

[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.580]
See, Duff got confused.

[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.780]
He thought that here, they plugged the toilets were plugged up

[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.440]
at the at the at the room,

[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.440]
but it turned out that the glory holes got plugged up.

[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.920]
So Miguel's got his pneumatic portable drill.

[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.660]
Anyway, Tracy McCandor was ever the athletic one

[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.880]
and throughout childhood dreamed of becoming a police woman.

[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.480]
Wow.

[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.380]
Who wouldn't want to be frisked by her?

[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.520]
What red-blooded American headerow

[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.120]
wouldn't want to be working in a bank after she finished school

[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.020]
in McCandor realized that she had a higher calling

[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.120]
and it was modeling not law enforcement that lay in her future.

[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.420]
Moving to London, McCandor aggressively shocked her look around.

[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.400]
It was the daily star newspaper that first latched onto this

[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.640]
babe and put around its front cover.

[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.880]
Not much time passed before other publications were asking about this new face.

[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.740]
And after entertaining a few other offers,

[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.500]
McCandor took on her first big job as the real life representation

[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.920]
of the video game character Lara Croft.

[00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.760]
Have you heard that?

[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.420]
Yeah, Tomb Raider.

[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.920]
Huh?

[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.200]
Lara Croft?

[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.620]
Tomb Raider.

[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.500]
No.

[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.540]
To fit the parts, she allegedly went from a B cup to a D cup

[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.960]
thanks to the wonders of modern medicine.

[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.320]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.480]
That's unfortunate.

[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.940]
Whatever.

[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.380]
Following the footsteps of such established models as Rona Mietra,

[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.800]
McCandor toured the Tomb Raider heroine for over a,

[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.480]
she toured as the Tomb Raider heroine for over a,

[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.220]
attracting attention and conventions and imprint.

[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.860]
This experience was regarded by McCandor as invadible,

[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.580]
though a sour note was left to being, after being denied the opportunity,

[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.620]
to appear at the British movie premiere of Tomb Raider,

[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.720]
starring Angelina Jolie.

[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.960]
After all, McCandor was partly responsible for making Lara Croft

[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.560]
the cult figure that she be.

[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.780]
In 99, she served as co-host of the entertaining British game show.

[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:39.920]
It's a knockout.

[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.340]
The hosting job lasted two seasons while ratings remained high.

[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.480]
At the same time, she served as a VJ on VH1's spice,

[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.280]
continuing to beat down the stigma that Lara Croft models careers go downhill once the gig is up.

[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.360]
And it goes on, every active woman McCandor flattered fellow celebrities,

[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.400]
she became an entertainment reporter for the Big Breakfast, another Brit show.

[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.920]
During this time, she graced the covers of Loaded and Front as well,

[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.780]
or they could have put them just together at Loaded Front.

[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.540]
Rounding off a busy couple of years since the start of the Millennium,

[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.580]
McCandor got involved in the celebrity survivor show called,

[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.080]
Amma Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2002.

[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.880]
And it goes on and on.

[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.500]
There you go.

[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.200]
She's there.

[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.940]
Two strictures for the price of none.

[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.260]
As a little holiday bonus to lift your spirits and lift whatever else she's got there,

[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.140]
which is a lot.

[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.560]
Let me do the break, because once we get this ass cropped stuff,

[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.340]
we got a little contract on going on there.

[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.380]
Now, after 9-11, we supposed to have learned those lessons.

[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.920]
Remember that about the FBI and the CIA and our...

[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.820]
The agencies weren't communicating well,

[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.420]
and they were like protective of their own fife-dums and all this other crap.

[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.640]
We didn't just learn lessons.

[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.480]
Yeah, they did.

[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.180]
And now we come to find out that Tom Ridge and the people at the Department of So-called

[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.080]
Homeland Security are foaming at the mouth because they weren't invited.

[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.060]
They didn't know nothing.

[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.180]
And then the mayors had told us they didn't know not neither.

[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.440]
And then come to find out that of those seven people,

[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.660]
at least two of them are in jail and maybe some of them are dead.

[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.900]
Remember the pictures he was whipping out the other day?

[00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.120]

[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:00.140]
Yeah.

[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.260]
Maybe Casey Kason was a bugger.

[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.820]
And were the pictures he was supposed to see.

[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.300]
And there was ass cropped with a picture.

[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.320]
So once again, the political...

[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.920]
It's just desperation is what it's called.

[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.100]
Desperation.

[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.880]
And we do have that zombie thing today about how curious Electoral College kick and ass.

[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.560]
So we get a lot of fish to fry today.

[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.500]
Plus a few of your stellar phone calls, which they're just ain't no better in the history of mankind than on the MediaRoger Show.

[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.060]
Trust me.

[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.780]
Ew, God.

[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.360]
And I'll tell you.

[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.340]
There ain't nothing quite like our callers.

[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.100]
Thank God.

[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.060]
It's a 12-minute past 10 at 5.60.

[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.100]
Oh, and by the way, join the Mad Dog at two days.

Stop by for an autograph signing with Marlon's picture Brad Penny.

[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.820]
In fact, Mad Dog said tastes like a penny to me.

[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:47.000]
Enjoyed specials on Heineken when some prizes that's Mad Dog and Brad Penny at Hooters and Pembroke Pines to the foe this afternoon.

In terms of live and country, scale board, requirements and overdrive, local or NBCO.

[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.680]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.720]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.580]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.260]
And Buckwood's turn overdrive and back up singer Larry King.

I'd say to you tonight and hear me well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

I'll go grab a 1018 at 560 WFU. I'm happy Friday.

[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.200]
Happy Memorial Day holiday weekend.

[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.520]
Boy, we can find out today.

[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.600]
Well, first of all, here's the really good news.

[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.560]
Now all you people are like picking on poor little George and sometimes is overly so, but nevertheless.

[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.660]
I take a look at his schedule we got on Monday.

[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.000]
Now of course it's a big shot like me working on Memorial Day.

[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.420]
You bet you're sweet ass I'm not.

[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.120]
But at any rate, almost nobody is.

[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.980]
The only semblance we have of like a real regular person on the schedule.

[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.880]
Well, if you count the big, you try it on.

[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.380]
And by the way, get them all back.

[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.340]
But I never thought I'd be Jonesing here most voice.

[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.660]
Wow.

[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.620]
Well, I think that's the strategy of our programming department.

[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.460]
I'm marking it down.

[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.300]
Is to put a lot of the big, so we Jones for a mole.

[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:01.780]
Absolutely.

[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.120]
Boy, that big O. He is just, I don't want to keep going into it.

[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:06.760]
Well, yes, I do.

[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.700]
Anyway, Monday, Curtis, Beast and Land because it's a holiday.

[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.380]
We're going to be on air.

[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.960]
And that should be a real something to sleep through.

[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.820]
Okay, six to 10 four hours of that.

[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.460]
Wow.

[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.580]
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.600]
I was about to say, how do you like to follow that?

[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.700]
The Georgia is going to follow that from 10 to 2.

[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.360]
And that's the only semblance we've got to like anybody that's like on every day.

[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.740]
Yeah, but ain't going to be talking much.

[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:31.620]
Why not?

[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.600]
No, no, no, say that.

[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.240]
I bet you get a ton of great calls.

[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.160]
I'm going to be taken.

[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.300]
You'll get more and more than we got right now.

[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.180]
Although I noticed we had a whole bunch of them before.

[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.780]
And if they think I'm going to waste my time, I'll get a few calls in today.

[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.200]
Maybe a third of me.

[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.200]
I'm going to be more like five.

[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.640]
We'll get a bunch of them in there because it's a very important holiday weekend.

[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.500]
I can't imagine anybody with an IQ larger than their small fingernail being in town now.

[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.080]
Now the kids are off from school today, right?

[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:55.860]
Yes.

[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.580]
And so you got out anyway.

[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.660]
I don't know about that.

[00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.240]
In.

[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.440]
So you got basically a four day holiday weekend.

[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.980]
There are at least a three day for everybody.

[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.100]
And why would anybody hang around when they can go to like a drive right up the old highway to Savannah?

[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.120]
Or like you'll see watch.

[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.060]
WQA and hello.

[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.220]
Yes.

[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:13.400]
And please.

[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:13.880]
Robert.

[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.220]
QAM.

[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.120]
And Neil.

[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.000]
Yes sir.

[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.440]
Happy Memorial Day.

[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.220]
And back to you.

[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.380]
It sounds to me like you're pumping out of your gas station.

[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.660]
I'm pumping it.

[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:22.940]
Hi.

[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:24.380]
Okay.

[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.500]
Let's see.

[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.560]
Then George on the then worn chromati from two to three thirty.

[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.700]
Oh my god.

[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.000]
That is unbelievable.

[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.800]
Like I've said before, there are people on death row for lesser crimes than that.

[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.940]
Right in the middle of the daytime no less.

[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.620]
I got your crow bondage right here home boy.

[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.100]
And to be broadcasting from the ballpark at gay G as in God awful.

[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.920]
So do you like the crow mo or the Omo?

[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.280]
No the homo.

[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:47.940]
I like that one.

[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.160]
Yeah.

[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.580]
I'm a homo.

[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.320]
Marlon's on deck three thirty and a reds and a round then we got the big seven.

[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.580]
So I guess we'll just as a gesture of a decency to the big O.

[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.120]
He's on too much.

[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.160]
I mean regular.

[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.940]
So George would be the closest thing you want to like kiss George right through the speaker your radio on Monday.

[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.080]
Say oh thank God we got like at least a familiar voice.

[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.280]
Maybe one we don't like but at least a familiar voice.

[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.820]
I'll just be spin of the hits.

[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.000]
He'll be spinning it.

[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.160]
Now line nine of it is excited about it Q.A. and hello line nine.

[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.480]
Yeah what's the poll today?

[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.540]
How big your pardon?

[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.320]
I didn't hear the poll.

[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.200]
Well then just get lost.

[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.500]
Okay he didn't hear the poll yet.

[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.480]
In fact we're going to have you climb up it out of your like that and maybe monkey around a little bit there at the top.

[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.560]
Here's the days poll.

[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.400]
I'm glad he asked.

[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.260]
I almost forgot about it.

[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.440]
I was so excited about that ash cropped and tomorradged stuff.

[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.320]
And about these seven the desparados.

[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:38.700]
Here's the poll.

[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.660]
What movie not x rated is the hottest you've ever seen.

[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.820]
And you've claimed we've done this from before.

[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.540]
I don't remember it.

[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.020]
Yes we did.

[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.180]
Does Josh remember it?

[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:46.820]
He's not here.

[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.360]
Who's there Miguel?

[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.120]
Oh look.

[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:49.540]
Well what?

[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.480]
Where the hell is Josh?

[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:51.560]
Oh yeah.

[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.360]
Oh bea-na-boys here today.

[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.360]
No, sirthly who has Josh got another bus mentality to do what's that all about?

[00:15:59.460 --> 00:15:59.760]
The board.

[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.060]
He's in court again.

[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.220]
Like I said we got bea-na-boy today.

[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.500]
Well we seem to have a run on board ops in there of all spent all their time in court.

[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:10.980]
Anyway.

[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.080]
What movie not x rated is the hottest you've ever seen.

[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:21.060]
Now I put three choices on there and I think that no matter what your persuasion is especially friendly persuasion is Pat Old Boone in the box would say.

[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.220]
You'd have to agree that these are three of some of them.

[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.220]
Wouldn't you?

[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.400]
They're the smoke and all right.

[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.180]
I added one though.

[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.020]
Blue Lagoon.

[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.520]
These were the three arc came to my mind.

[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.160]
Blue Lagoon.

[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.420]
Return to the blue lagoon or paradise.

[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.040]
I bet you're trying to who like paradise.

[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:35.640]
Absolutely.

[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:35.980]
Right.

[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.400]
With willy-ins and TV kates.

[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.600]
A lot of naked young people running around in all three.

[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:41.940]
Yes.

[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:42.560]
And what's the other one?

[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.140]
Body heat.

[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.340]
Oh body heat.

[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:44.660]
Sure.

[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.800]
Body heat.

[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.380]
What movie not x rate is the hottest you've ever seen.

[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.880]
In fact maybe like watch some TV and set real real close to the screen.

[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.840]
Now see here's line nine again.

[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.620]
I bet he's calling back.

[00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.360]
Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.020]
Foxy Brown.

[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.100]
What is it?

[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:01.780]
Foxy Brown.

[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.780]
Oh man.

[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.820]
Stop and ponder that for a few seconds.

[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.620]
Ashcroft is sailed on terror warning.

[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.220]
Some allies of the Department of Homeland Security within the Bush administration and members

[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.180]
of Congress criticized it's pretty general job.

[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.100]
Ashcroft is the day for issuing terrorist warnings at a news conference on Wednesday.

[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.100]
Contending he failed to coordinate the information with the White House and with Homeland Security.

[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.480]
With the White House even.

[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.320]
How do you like that?

[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.380]
How do you like that?

[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.300]
The guy is falling.

[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.620]
And with the Department of Homeland Security which has the job of releasing threat warnings.

[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:45.780]
But he just took upon himself in between covering up all the naked statues to like get everybody whipped up and were frenzy.

[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.460]
I guess he saw those like this pull numbers.

[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.020]
He's trying to help his buddy Georgie out.

[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:53.460]
With FBI director Robert S. Mueller the turd by his side.

[00:17:53.460 --> 00:18:01.740]
Ashcroft said at a news conference two days ago that credible intelligence from multiple sources indicates that Al-Qaeda plans an attempt and attack on the US in the next few months.

[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.780]
This disturbing intelligence indicates Al-Qaeda's specific intention is hit the US hard.

[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.360]
The added that the information has been corroborated on a variety of levels.

[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.300]
The guy is falling.

[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:19.040]
Under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and Bush administration rules only the Department of Homeland Security can publicly issue threat warnings.

[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.140]
And they must be approved in a complex interagency process involving the White House.

[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:31.500]
Administration official sympathetic to Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ritz said he wasn't informed that Ashcroft was going to characterize the threat in that way.

[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.560]
And assertion that justice officials deny.

[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.600]
So once again while our lives are hanging in the balance your government can't get the right together.

[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.300]
No you did it. No we did it. They did it.

[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.580]
Yes the dog done it.

[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.380]
Just like what's his name said.

[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.820]
What's adjacent Williams the dog dog was a suicide.

[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.060]
Early yesterday while we already know about that.

[00:18:52.160 --> 00:19:02.280]
Yesterday representative Christopher Cox Republican of California chairman of the House Select Committee on Homeland Security and a Guardian of Bridges Turf within the administration released a statement criticizing Ashcroft.

[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.400]
He said you're an asked croft.

[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:12.040]
The dissemination by our government of sensitive terrorism warnings must be closely coordinated across our intelligence and law enforcement communities.

[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.940]
Cox said in the Homeland Security Act DHS was the sound of a central coordinating world in this process.

[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:23.840]
The absence of Secretary Ritz from yesterday's news conference held by the Attorney General and the director of the FBI and the conflicting public messages.

[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.780]
There's separate public appearances delivered to the nation.

[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.120]
Suggest that the broad and close interagency consultation we expect in which the law requires did not take place in this case.

[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.140]
Oh my god.

[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:38.700]
American public state and local law enforcement governors and mayors and private sector officials with responsibility for critical infrastructure.

[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:47.380]
All deserve crystal clarity when it comes to terrorism threat advisories Cox be saying while publicly professing only collegiality and cooperation.

[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.440]
Region Ashcroft have occasionally struggled for the past two years.

[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.700]
They've argued for months over whether home land security and the agents investigate terrorism financing.

[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.800]
And last year, rigid read they could do it only out of the FBI's lead.

[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:11.720]
Some administration officials also complained yesterday that Justice Department FBI officials in private conversations with reporters may have suggested that the latest evidence of a terrorist attack is new when it's about six weeks old official said it's old news.

[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:17.060]
And administration official sympathetic to Ritz said there's a concern that this wasn't coordinated by the system.

[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:28.540]
The H.S. has in place to communicate this kind of sensitive information and let me do the break and there are actually some of these at least two of the people are in jail or on that list with the seven pictures that he put up there.

[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.400]
And the mayors of most of the city say we didn't know none about it nobody told us none.

[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:40.500]
So it's great to see it's a comforting thing to see that your government is really doing a great job of protecting us right.

[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.240]
That's why we have played such great trust and at least on the job of fighting terrorism he'd be doing that.

[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.220]
That's the one area we still trust the Bushmeister.

[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.740]
You know fat boys a cold that ever tell you that you're a loser fat boy.

[00:20:51.840 --> 00:21:04.500]

And here's an extra special reason why I did your car shop in there.

Armstrong Toyota Homestead offers you free tires free batteries and replacement parts for life of your vehicle.

So forget about the big mega dealers who are full of crap and scream and hollering carry on and then let you down.

5 and a local of this is 560.

[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.640]
The radio is all yours now.

[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.480]
Q&A

[00:22:30.480 --> 00:23:00.460]
Q&A

[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:29.920]
Q&A

[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:59.900]
Q&A

[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:29.900]
Q&A

[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:57.520]
Q&A

[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.920]
Q&A

[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:38.160]
At least two of the terrorists identified by John Ascroft as part of an al-Qaeda sale that's waiting to attack America this summer are already in jail.

[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.260]
Oh my God.

[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:44.340]
A respected website that holds databases on terrorist suspects lists.

[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.700]
Amir Al-Mathi is incarcerated.

[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:53.680]
Likewise, Afias Sedickey, a female former MIT student was arrested in Pakistan over a year ago, a coin to NBC.

[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.800]
And the cell that these individuals are sent to belong to doesn't even exist.

[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:08.440]
The Abu-Hafz al-Masri group was described by the Boston Globe as a phantom organization kind of like the Florida Panthers, a phantom organization.

[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.280]
The researchers could find no evidence that the group was real or Israel.

[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:20.020]
Each time a new terrorist threat is announced or a terrorist suspect is captured, we discover they've either already been arrested or they've been dead for a year or more.

[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:26.600]
Furthermore, and here's the part that really makes you scratch your head and wonder and be pretty damn positive when you come right down to it.

[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.600]
You don't have to wonder too much.

[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:41.120]
Furthermore, New York City and Los Angeles officials told Reuters that they hadn't been informed by the government of any terrorist threat, despite the fact that people like Ascroft and Ridger all over the media, fear-mongering about the inevitability of an attack before the election.

[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.080]
Oh, brother.

[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:48.200]
You think you knew something about the fear factor? This is the real fear factor.

[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.360]
Okay, forget about stupid TV shows. Forget about eating the wicked worm.

[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.000]
Okay, it's the fear factor parts one through a hundred with the bush crowd with a knife you claim.

[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.200]
Yeah, better believe it.

[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.300]
Abu Gharram.

[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:00.580]
Right.

[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:08.760]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty pound, five, sixty on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. WQA Am hello.

[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.060]
And now, yes, sir, yeah, why don't we put body heat up on there too?

[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.900]
Body heat. Did we just put that on there? Yeah, I put it on there.

[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.040]
Effectively, it's got 16 votes. Thank you. Thanks.

[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.360]
See, it's my fault. I should have told how it's going so far. Body heat's got 16.

[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.100]
Return of the blue lagoon's got three. The original blue lagoon three, which I guess depends on who you like.

[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.380]
Now, let's say I know nobody's going to know the names of return of the blue lagoon because they're like European kids.

[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.620]
What do you mean?

[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:39.160]
Blue lagoon was Chris Atkins and don't tell birthsheels, right?

[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.840]
Return of the blue lagoon was Millagevovic who we've had on the Beated Purtin before.

[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.100]
Right.

[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.340]
And does some guy, some Czechoslovakian guy, whatever.

[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.920]
Somehow the European guy body heat 17.

[00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:01.400]

[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.240]
It's going to describe George Bush and all his followers and cronies. They're the bush bags.

[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:25.200]
Oh, I like that. Don't be a bush bag. There you go. And so far as of right now, we can still say it.

[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.760]
That's right. Okay. Thanks, pal.

[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.980]
I have a great holiday weekend. Boy, here's a nice echo on it. Call it on me.

[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:36.480]
It was good. Let me give Fatboy an echo. Okay. You're an idiot, Fatboy. You're a liar.

[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.580]
You're a do-nothing. You're just full of crap. And don't ever darken our door again.

[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.440]
I don't want nothing to do with him. Him and Todd direct the two-kinda lope. Go to Provinc. Go to P-town over the weekend.

[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.300]
Or just go to Town in P. WQA and hello.

[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.460]
Yes. Hi. How are you? Pretty good.

[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:55.420]
I have a film. I can't remember the name of it, but it has Susan Sarandon and Katherine De Nuev.

[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.380]
And they have a very central. The hunger. The hunger. Yeah. The hunger.

[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.360]
Okay. And sounds like aptly named. You bet.

[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.500]
Okay. Thanks, pal. Have a great weekend. The hunger. Really? I've never seen that. Oh, yeah.

[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.640]
It's a good watch. David Bowie's in it as well. Oh, well, nothing's perfect. Nothing for you.

[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.740]
I see. That sounds like a line from Godfather 3.

[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.180]
When Andy Garcia was waltzing around handing out the envelopes with all the big cash in there.

[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.540]
And there's Joey Zaza. Nothing for you. Remember that. Sure.

[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.800]
Joey. Zaza. That was that was about the only good thing. And Andy Garcia didn't hold movies when he shoved Joey Zaza.

[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.840]
That was very well on the horse. On the horse. No, I said Joey. Zaza. That was good.

[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:53.640]

Yeah, Nicole Kidman. Okay. Well, whatever you like. Okay. Thanks. He liked it.

[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.880]
It must be. It wasn't so much erotic as it was really long and boring. Boring aggravating. Hey, listen.

[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:13.620]
Everybody needs to make a buck in this guy. He liked it. Okay. In fact, he's probably watching it right now real close. He's probably got his DVD and his hand in his DVD.

[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:22.620]
I would say that 5 6 7 0 5 6. He Father Gagan, by the way, only put his hands in one little boy shorts and scratches his squeezes cheeks a little bit. That one.

[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:32.540]
And I'm thinking I said to George before the show today. I'm thinking it might be a really good idea to find a guy that off Father Gagan on the inside and a slamer. Right.

[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:38.220]
So that when Michael Jackson goes to the big house, if that should happen and it looks increasing like they're peeing in a pants that it just might.

[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:45.780]
Uh, the same guy can be in it with Michael Michael motorcycle. He's a real American hero. See one thing that they really don't like inside the slamer.

[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:56.060]
They don't like Peter files. They have this thing about that. They like. And as a result, when they put him in the big house, they tend not to like a Jeffrey Dahmer. Remember Jeffrey Dahmer?

[00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:00.500]
Sure. Who could forget? Didn't the stick around too long? Didn't take up too many of the taxpayer dollars.

[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.880]
Thank the Lord. Oh God. 20 before 11 at 5.60 Q. I. M.

[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.240]
No one wants to be a baby.

[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.660]
Another guy.

[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.480]
She's a heart.

[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.100]
We just can't wait for this.

[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.100]

I'm a real.

[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:18.580]

[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:18.580]

[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:18.580]

[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:18.580]

[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:18.580]

[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.460]

I'm a real.

[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:40.380]

[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.200]
I'm a real.

[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:12.200]

[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:12.240]
I'm a real.

[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.060]
I'm a real.

[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:13.940]
I'm a real.

[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:21.900]
I'm a real.

[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:22.720]
He's not a real.

[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:22.720]

[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:22.720]

[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:22.720]

[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:22.720]

[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.380]
They don't want to write a tick and they want to write about 50,000.

[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.300]
If that's 50,000, maybe 30,000.

[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.960]
That's the new quota.

[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:31.500]
Get out of our face.

[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:41.620]
Get out of our face with your damn radar guns.

[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:42.120]
You idiots.

[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.340]
it's you, you clowns, you silly people, you.

[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.820]
Body heat, well let's make see what we got on here

[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.240]
because I just rebooted this whole thing.

[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.160]
What movie, not X-rated, is the hottest you've ever seen.

[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.940]
Body heat 25, nine and a half weeks, 19.

[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.060]
The old blue lagoon has got nine.

[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.560]
Showgirl's eight, return to the blue lagoon four.

[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:02.180]
Paradise has got a pair.

[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.800]
Eyes wide, shut, has got one.

[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.360]
Hunger has got one and none yet for basic instinct.

[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.360]
Two moon junction, cockamoon junction.

[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.780]
Summer lover or monster's balls out of the first 69.

[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:15.580]
Can I say that?

[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:15.880]
No.

[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:17.720]
WQA, I'm hello.

[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:19.880]
QA, I'm hello.

[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.760]
Can we make it over three?

[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:24.780]
WQA, I'm hello.

[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.000]
Yeah, I have a movie, a hot movie,

[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:29.860]
Unfateful.

[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:31.540]
Unfateful?

[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:32.720]
Unfateful.

[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.720]
That's why I thought you just said, okay, thank you.

[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.760]
It's your unfaithful, you got it?

[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.920]
We got it.

[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.500]
Is very unpatable in it?

[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:40.800]
Nope.

[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:41.520]
Nope.

[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.280]
Oh, there might just be pretty good.

[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.320]
Spam are sentenced to seven years in prison.

[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.040]
You seen this story?

[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.940]
No, I had not heard of it.

[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.420]
I heard of it.

[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:50.980]
I heard of it.

[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:55.340]
Big schwarzer with a big heavy puppet, Howard Carmack.

[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.140]
They caught him on the tarmac.

[00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.340]
Buffalo, New York, boy, we know all the stuff

[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.600]
that goes on in Buffalo, man.

[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.300]
And none of it's good.

[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.700]
There ain't nothing good having in Buffalo.

[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.780]
Except maybe for the people that got out.

[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.720]
Nothing good happened in Tanawanda

[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.440]
in Cheek-Tawaga, Lackawana, Hamburg,

[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.940]
Fredonia, the Pew, Eerie.

[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.660]
What's the other one?

[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.800]
It's a Lee Roy.

[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.420]
A man who sent 850 million junk emails

[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.160]
through a council open with stolen identities

[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.080]
was sentenced up to seven years in prison yesterday.

[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.180]
He sent 850 million junk emails

[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.040]
through a council open with stolen identities.

[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.180]
Atlanta-based Earthlink Inc said it hoped the sentence

[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.340]
in an earlier 16.4 million dollar civil judgment

[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.060]
against Howard Carmack will deter other spammers.

[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:41.960]
I hate spam.

[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.320]
And you of course should know better than anybody.

[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.480]
Spam is for Graham.

[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:46.900]
Right.

[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.620]
They called spammers and one more spam email.

[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:49.980]
What?

[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.500]
At Hawaiians, they love it.

[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.340]
Do they really?

[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:52.660]
Yeah.

[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.900]
Maybe that's why they got those big fat puppets like that.

[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.620]
By by the case.

[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.080]
Before spammer said it more and more spam email

[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.960]
with we should let them remember what happened

[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.460]
to Howard Carmack and happened to them.

[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.120]
Said Karen Casey on, Earthlink's assistant general council,

[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.420]
jurors sentenced Carmack to seven years

[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.760]
for convictions in March of forgery identity theft

[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.380]
and falsifying business records.

[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.160]
He must have a minimum three and a half years.

[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.820]
Earthlink said Carmack ran 343 illegal email accounts

[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.120]
under phony names from 2002 until his arrest last May

[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.800]
using the missing unsolicited email ads

[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.440]
for things like get rich quick schemes

[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.260]
and sexual enhancers.

[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.740]
Now we know where all that crap came from.

[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.320]
And by the way, Howard, they didn't work.

[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.520]

[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.420]
Perrito's attorney Brian Tannenbaum

[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.780]

I bet you guys are familiar with that.

[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.100]

Yeah.

[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.780]
The idea that somebody can be so cruel is to be willing to

[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.320]
profit by weakening life saving drugs to cause the suffering

[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.920]

examination of bank records and it goes on and on.

[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.400]
Bad stuff and it goes in great detail.

[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.360]

[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:01.580]

[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.720]

The lights of West Bokeh, you'll still find them on the

[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.120]
northeast corner of Glades in 441 right next to Boston

[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.640]
Market where you can give them a call at 1-877 low carb

[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:46.220]
L-O-W-C-A-R-V or on the web at slowcarb.com.

[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.200]
Don't forget to light the West Bokeh truly is your

[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.280]
official Atkins retail center.

[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.580]
Oh my god, look!

[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.720]
This is 420 LICity Q-A-M.

[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.640]
Why the, you bastard!

[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.100]
Oh, what's the problem officer?

[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.320]
Deploy from the vehicle.

[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.860]
What's the problem officer?

[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.340]
It's the law.

[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.040]
We like saying that.

[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:55.620]
The law.

[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.160]
The law.

[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.020]
The law.

[00:45:59.240 --> 00:45:59.760]
The law.

[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.140]
The law.

[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.580]
Lick it and stick it.

[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.500]
Yeah, I'm going to play it again and this time I'm going

[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.020]
to be able to do it.

[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.200]
See, I forgot that was in there.

[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.320]
How about you did too?

[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:07.860]
What?

[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.280]
What they didn't hear.

[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.140]
Oh, I didn't hear it either.

[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.100]
Anyway, I dumped it.

[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:15.800]
Okay.

[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:17.940]
What do you give me?

[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:18.320]
Okay.

[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.760]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:21.480]
I didn't hear anything.

[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.480]
Oh, what's the problem officer?

[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.660]
Deploy from the vehicle.

[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.080]
What's the problem officer?

[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:37.320]
If you're caught driving without a seatbelt, you will be removed from your car and shot.

[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:42.780]
The police now have the authority to enforce seatbelt safety under the new Patriot Act 2.

[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.700]
The new law is in effect now.

[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.820]
So click it or be shot.

[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.100]
Officers don't like doing this.

[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.880]
They are only following orders.

[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.920]
It's for your own protection in the never ending fight against terrorism.

[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.280]
Terrorist acts such as mouth noise.

[00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.060]
Courving.

[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.280]
You're knowing two others.

[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.440]
So under Patriot Act 2, eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants.

[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:11.300]
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot.

[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.700]
It's the law.

[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.240]
We like saying that.

[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.280]
The law.

[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.340]
The law.

[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:25.840]
So I guess there's why I can live my spare time straight now when I saw.

[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.100]
You know, it doesn't set off any alarms.

[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.460]
What do you mean by that?

[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.360]
It's so innocuous.

[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.580]
Like a lifetime to get used to certain sounds all over again.

[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.780]
Well, you better set off in the line, Mr.

[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.840]
If you know what's good for us, head out right now, that farting sound in there.

[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:40.860]
Yeah.

[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.060]
You better set off all kinds of bells and things.

[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.580]
Okay, here's a bunch of fangs on our pool today.

[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.720]
What movie not X rated as the hottest you've ever seen?

[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.900]
No mercy, Richard Gere and Kim Basinger says somebody.

[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:52.800]
No mercy.

[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:58.000]
Okay, Paul and Miami, unfortunately, I think has made a mistake, although it could be my bad.

[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:58.460]
We'll see.

[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:04.880]
He says swept away the original only and he says last angle in Paris, which I do believe was about the X rating.

[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:05.420]
Didn't it?

[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.140]
You know, I think initially it did.

[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:09.780]
You could be right.

[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.040]
I better look it up.

[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:11.920]
I think you're right.

[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:20.160]
Well, no, I mean, there were movies like a Caligula and last angle in Paris that were X rated.

[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.820]
And we're saying specifically that X rated now.

[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.000]
But we're saying that X rated.

[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.000]
We're talking about porn movies, but nevertheless what's that cowboy picture midnight cowboy?

[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:33.380]
Oh, well, there was nothing sexy in that including some boy, but I heard it was X rated.

[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.620]
Yeah, well, he was a hustler, you know, no, I don't.

[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:38.660]
He and rats over.

[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.020]
You never saw midnight cowboy.

[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.280]
No, I didn't.

[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:47.480]
I saw something you probably heard from one of the one of my gay acquaintances put cruising on once.

[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:48.940]
I think that'll be oh, geez.

[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.880]
I cured me of any other kind of movie like that.

[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:56.480]
Well, that was not what midnight, midnight cowboy was.

[00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:01.420]
What am I looking up while you're talking about cramp last, the temptation of Christ?

[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:01.940]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.160]
Last tango in Paris.

[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.280]
I want you to cut your fingernails off.

[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:05.580]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:12.680]
And then it's Quentin Marlin, brand to win here with words that we obviously can't use on here, especially after we nearly had that fart sound on here.

[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.700]
The monumental, I don't know.

[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.240]
Does it say what's rated here?

[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:17.860]
I don't know.

[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:19.200]
Let me go to IMDB.

[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.020]
It doesn't even say that.

[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:22.580]
Better be better.

[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.640]
I'm sure that the last tango in Paris got next to anybody.

[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.380]
You look it up and if not, we'll put it on her.

[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:30.560]
In fact, maybe we'll put it on her anyway because it wasn't like a porn movie.

[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.500]
The story of I didn't know they made a movie about him.

[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.160]
How do you like that?

[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:35.560]
The story of you.

[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:35.740]
Oh.

[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.480]
Do you know what that movie is?

[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:41.640]
I know about the book.

[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.180]
It's a SNM kind of thing.

[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.300]
They kidnapped this chick and make her be a slave.

[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.140]
Oh, and then they sent her off to...

[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.260]
Abu Gharram...

[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:48.440]
Right.

[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.420]
Okay, so we'll check on some of these.

[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.520]
Okay, because now it's getting into like more like work, which we're not too happy about.

[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.440]
How does movie, the Grasshoppers, says somebody.

[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.220]
I think Dennis Hopper was in that one.

[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.000]
Never heard of it.

[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:00.180]
Grasshoppers.

[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:02.220]
Well, put it on there anyway just to satisfy them.

[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:07.980]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.560]
Actually, we got a battle there.

[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.820]
I guess we figured that already.

[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.220]
Not gonna have weeks in body heat.

[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.160]
It's rated NC17 now.

[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.360]
What is?

[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:18.200]
Why is it taking a load?

[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:19.220]
But it was originally X.

[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.680]
Well, we don't care about that.

[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:21.380]
What it was originally.

[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.080]
If it's NC17, if it's good enough, which means...

[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:24.600]
What does that mean?

[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.280]
That is X.

[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:27.760]
No, not really.

[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.060]
It's not R.

[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.480]
It's the next step up between R and X.

[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:31.960]
Lacks.

[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:32.600]
I'm sorry.

[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.540]
Put it on there anyway.

[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.080]
All right.

[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.820]
Because I'm sure to get some votes.

[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:38.380]
WQA, I'm hello.

[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.080]
Thank you, old drop.

[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:41.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.160]
That's funny about that bit about the law.

[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.820]
I got to stop my app off the other day.

[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:48.420]
Yeah.

[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.400]
And she goes, you know, I'm stopping her.

[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.180]
I said, no.

[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.600]
And she goes, I think you weren't wearing your feet on her wall.

[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:58.360]
And I said, no, I'm very much aware of the law.

[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.480]
And I said, what's your cloud chicken and biscuits?

[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.260]
And she goes, click it and tick it.

[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.680]
I said, click it and flick it.

[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.900]
You can do that in your card.

[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.340]
You can do that in your card.

[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:16.980]
It's still legal.

[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.920]
You can click it and stick it and pick it and flick it.

[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:20.760]
That's what Muff said.

[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.020]
Right.

[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:27.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.160]
But we sure got a lot.

[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:29.740]
I don't think I'm going to get the most of this stuff here.

[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.040]
I don't think they really care, though, today.

[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.580]
I'm just frying.

[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:34.400]
It's frying.

[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.420]
I've got a whole pile of stuff.

[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.660]
No, it's not the year stuff.

[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.980]
Oh, the Army assured 300 million bullets.

[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.720]
We'll get to that story a little later.

[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.820]
They better ain't that.

[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:42.180]
Time remaining.

[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.400]
WDQA and hello.

[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.160]
Hello.

[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:48.440]
I'd like to speak to Neil.

[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.260]
Speaking.

[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:50.980]
Neil?

[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:51.900]
Yes.

[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.100]
Is this really Neil?

[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.140]
No, it's just a mistake.

[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.120]
See, I don't have time to deal with the dollars.

[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.120]
I have no love.

[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:01.640]
Oh, brother.

[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:03.840]
Is this Neil?

[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.560]
Is this really Neil?

[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.040]
I mean, the real, real, real.

[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.440]
No, wrong.

[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.220]
I'm on your yellow pages.

[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.620]
Yeah, it's a wrong number.

[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.340]
WDQA and hello.

[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.120]
Yeah, Uncle Neil, God almighty.

[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:17.280]
Yes, sir, speaking.

[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:18.620]
How are you doing, sir?

[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.180]
Happy, you're in the royal day.

[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:21.200]
I can't.

[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.140]
Well, while we're looking, it's kind of like a remake

[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.280]
a nine and a half week.

[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:28.260]
I don't know who's in the winter, but I'm not sure.

[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.300]
And I haven't touched them all the time.

[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:29.760]
I'll give you this.

[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:30.720]
You'll give me two more seconds.

[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.000]
Carrie, who was it doing?

[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:32.720]
The one where we're...

[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:33.720]
Wait a minute.

[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:34.780]
Yes, sir.

[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:35.400]
Why?

[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.200]
Orchid.

[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.180]
George is answering the question if you'll listen.

[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:38.940]
If you just come down.

[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.320]
I'm sorry, sir.

[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.100]
Carrie Otis, who we've had behind us.

[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.180]
Carrie Otis, yes.

[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.560]
Yeah, the elevator lady.

[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.760]
Yeah, she's very, very hot, but it's totally fine.

[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:47.080]

[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:47.160]
It's fine.

[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:47.760]
But it's fine.

[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.940]
My Godfather's question is this.

[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.060]
When Tom Hagen goes to talk to the picture director,

[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.380]
doesn't he say, well, because we've taken something,

[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.020]
my friend.

[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:01.440]
He says what?

[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.220]
He says, well, instead of well, especially well with a Z,

[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.280]
what does he say?

[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.260]
I'd like to take a little bit of your time.

[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.440]
And does he say, well, is listening?

[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:10.980]
Is that...

[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:14.420]
Yeah, he actually does say that, but how do you know what's supposed to be with a Z?

[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.480]
How do you know his name wasn't well?

[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.200]
Z because when he climbed up into the thing, it says well,

[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.980]
so if you all have a picture, excuse me, he's Z pictures.

[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:23.760]
Yeah, maybe he was...

[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.220]
Maybe he still had some lunch in his mouth or something.

[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.460]
No, he does say that.

[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:28.200]
He was...

[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:28.620]
He was...

[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.520]
He was all over Tom Hagen at the dinner table.

[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:31.180]
I know that one.

[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.200]
Yeah, maybe that's the problem.

[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:32.820]
Maybe he's just a...

[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:33.280]
A spitter.

[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.780]
He's got a little bit of a marshmallow problem.

[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.660]
Have a great day, Paul.

[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:36.420]
Have a great day, Paul.

[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:40.560]
See, that's a very perspicacious, because I thought I was the only one

[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:41.240]
that ever noticed it.

[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:42.380]
He says, waltz to his listening.

[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.800]
He doesn't say waltz is listening.

[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:45.580]
Yeah, here I...

[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:46.180]
And then he says...

[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:47.540]
Let me tell you something, my friend.

[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:48.200]
Nick Friends.

[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:49.840]
Yeah.

[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:51.860]
Oh, boy.

[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:52.880]
So good.

[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.260]
And the fact that there actually are people alive out there who haven't seen any of the Godfather.

[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.960]
I mean, that just makes you want to sit down on a curb somewhere and cry for hours.

[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:00.740]
Ah, who needs them?

[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.520]
So you do it?

[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:02.160]
No.

[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.400]
WDQA and hello.

[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.260]
Neil, how about the real-world cancun?

[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.140]
They actually made a movie.

[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.080]
Real-world cancun?

[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.500]
Yeah, I came out like a year ago, I think.

[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:17.800]
How come I missed it?

[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:21.400]
Well, there's this part where you can see Mark's web feet.

[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.060]
And then you can see he had a...

[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:24.560]
Okay, great.

[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:26.760]
56670560.

[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.200]
Oh, God.

[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:31.980]
Wake up, George.

[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.100]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.400]
Mom, what's George's problem now?

[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.220]
Oh, no, I'm fine.

[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:41.420]
Did I miss something?

[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.000]
No, it's just Miguel trying to get me in trouble.

[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:44.340]
Why?

[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:46.200]
Because these calls are putting you into a coma.

[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.140]
Is that what you're trying to say?

[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:47.960]
No, it's just that one.

[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:48.740]
Oh.

[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:51.220]
56670560.

[00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.300]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:54:59.300 --> 00:54:59.300]

[00:54:59.300 --> 00:54:59.300]

[00:54:59.300 --> 00:54:59.300]

[00:54:59.300 --> 00:54:59.300]

[00:54:59.300 --> 00:54:59.300]

[00:54:59.300 --> 00:54:59.320]
I'm sorry.

[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.180]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.280]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.060]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:02.120]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:03.100]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:03.120]
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:11.000]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:11.400]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:11.900]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:13.100]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:13.480]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:30.520]

[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:30.520]

[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:30.600]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:30.800]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.160]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:06.720]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:07.580]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:08.060]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:08.600]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:08.820]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:09.660]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:10.940]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:12.060]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:13.160]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:13.920]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:16.460]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:20.280]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:31.680]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:32.460]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:32.460]

[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:32.460]

[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:32.460]

[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:32.480]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:32.480]

[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:32.820]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:33.240]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:33.440]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.040]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:35.640]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:35.640]

[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:35.640]

[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:35.640]

[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:35.980]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:36.260]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.020]
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:44.580]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:44.940]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:45.680]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.260]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:53.620]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:53.620]

[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:53.800]
I'm sorry.

[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:54.180]
I'm sorry.

Coach, coach, coach, coach, coach, I'm a coach.

[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:05.180]
Nah, I'm not gonna talk about that.

[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.260]
Take that, Mo.

[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:10.200]
Yeah, old cock-a-doodle-doodle-doodle.

[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:14.180]
I'm this time now with my old Tucson, and I was a spy.

[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.500]
You're a monster.

[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.060]
Now you're a dumb.

[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.220]
You can't hit me no more.

[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.220]
I'm not gonna hit me no more.

[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:22.780]
I'm not gonna hit you no more.

[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.280]
You're on the radio, you're more on.

[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.800]
Oh, I'm a...

[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.500]
Hey, look, maybe I was a little out of line.

[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:32.340]
The things I said, like that.

[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:35.100]
Yeah, they were, and I'm not gay.

[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.560]
You're right now, they're not in an all-fearness.

[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:41.440]
That big fat old guy they stuck me with kisses me like they used to do,

[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.040]
but he's not you.

[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:44.980]
Ah, that's so sweet.

[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.540]
You make me almost want to come back with you.

[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:48.360]
You're guilty.

[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:54.000]
Yes, but they, my life, was filled with joy.

[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:54.580]
Ow!

[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:56.120]
You're guilty.

[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.780]
And now I'm stuck when I go out of love and enjoy.

[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.660]
You're my best sidekick and foil.

[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.420]
I miss how you talk like a girl.

[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:10.880]
You're guilty.

[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.600]
Yes, forhold you.

[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.760]
I miss you.

[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.240]
No.

[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.500]
Fat or mo.

[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.900]
That chair's out the fat.

[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.320]
You're my team.

[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:25.640]
Mo.

[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.400]
I ain't waiting for a snack on the show that's staying.

[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.860]
Fat does and we can have a good time.

[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:39.360]
While you're waiting on the unemployment line.

[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.700]
Well, you little man, call me Papa.

[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.160]
I'll tell you what's up, Papa.

[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.600]
Why you what's up?

[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.040]
You think I'm a bad guy?

[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:46.980]
Ow!

[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.360]
Twenty after eleven at five sixty, WQM Happy Friday,

[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.340]
Happy Memorial Day.

[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.260]
Let's see, fatal attraction.

[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.640]
Somebody says which they're entitled.

[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.700]
They're entitled.

[01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:01.880]
They're opinion I wouldn't agree with that because I'm trying to think of what Michael Douglas is in it.

[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:02.360]
Is he hot?

[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:02.640]
No.

[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.260]
Glenn Close is in it too.

[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.120]
Not even like close.

[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.240]
Even close to a lukewarm.

[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.860]
And Archery's not bad, but she don't do anything in there.

[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:10.500]
No, correct.

[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.020]
I mean, I've seen that movie how many times?

[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:13.920]
About 30 minutes.

[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.100]
The movie which they made with two separate endings by the way,

[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.100]
which I take great exception to that.

[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.160]
You know the rabbit was hot.

[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:22.760]
For a little while, yeah, in the pot, hot in the pot.

[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:25.760]
Like Duff, he said he's hot on the pot.

[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.000]
Correct.

[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:26.820]
That's what I'm hearing.

[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.400]
But anyway, that's what the doctor told him on Tuesday morning.

[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.220]
And anyway, filmmaker Michael Morse says he has footage of Berg interview.

[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.040]
Really?

[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.620]
You know, I'm glad we didn't put that on our website.

[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.500]
I had very mixed emotions about that.

[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.080]
And I thought about it for about five seconds.

[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.540]
And I thought, right, we're not running an SNM website.

[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:47.860]
We do like putting booby pictures on there because the audience appreciates that greatly.

[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.640]
But we're not running an SNM thing on it.

[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.960]
That's good, clean, fun.

[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:53.860]
The boobies.

[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.040]
Good, clean boobies.

[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.360]
So we don't put filthy boobies on there under any circumstances.

[01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:59.260]
We don't want to watch them in the misery.

[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:00.000]
Right.

[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.280]
Use it to our own ends.

[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.820]
Only really sick, twisted people have the need to put that kind of crap on their website.

[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:10.560]
Anyway, filmmaker Michael Morse who's incendiary new documentary lamb based president pushes handling of the war.

[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:11.080]
All right.

[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.500]
Said yesterday he has footage unused in the film of Nicholas Berg, the American civilian leader beheaded in Iraq.

[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.880]
The footage of an interview with Berg is approximately 20 minutes long.

[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.220]
We're not releasing it to the media more, said the statement.

[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.960]
It's not in the film we're dealing privately with a family.

[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:32.380]
Neither Morne or his representatives would describe the nature or contents of the interview with Berg who held staunch pro-war views.

[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:36.100]
No one answered the phone Thursday at home of Berg's parents in Westchester PA.

[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.680]
Fierran height 9, 11, which recently won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.

[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.740]
Accuses the bush camp of stealing the 2000 election.

[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:43.480]
Absolutely.

[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.560]
Overlooking terrorism warnings before 9, 11.

[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.060]
Absolutely.

[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.540]
And fanning fears of more attacks to secure American support for the Iraq war.

[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.980]
Absolutely correct.

[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.900]
Which is kind of interesting because here we go again with that bogus press conference on Wednesday.

[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.440]
Well, we got more than we got these seven people and it's said of ensue.

[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.320]
It's really, I think the Democrats have anything else they should all be doing like Al Gore.

[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.060]
They should all be screaming and hollering in Karanra crazy.

[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:15.120]
How dare you be doing this and playing with emotions in the public and using these scare tactics just because your numbers are dropping like a rocket a pole.

[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:26.820]
Al Dharaza, drag the good name of the inherited states of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein's torture prison.

[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.660]
We need a lot more like that.

[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.400]
You go out.

[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:33.640]
He found it a little bit too late, but for him anyway, but that's where it goes.

[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:34.600]
I like this story.

[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.400]
Medium matters for America president and CEO David Brock.

[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.100]
He's a macro judge who's out of the closet with some balls.

[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:43.440]
He saw the light.

[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.160]
It's not too late, Matt.

[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.520]
Come out wherever you are, sweetheart.

[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.120]
Come out.

[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.300]
Give her that silly hat.

[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.240]
Medium matters for American president CEO David Brock Wednesday.

[01:03:52.240 --> 01:04:02.660]
They sent later to defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld requesting that Rumsfeld consider removing radio host Rush Limbaugh from the American Forces radio and television service known as Armed Forces radio formerly.

[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:18.500]
In his letter, Brock said that Limbaugh, whose program is broadcast for one hour per day the US troops overseas, has spent the past four weeks condoning and trivializing the abuse torture rape and possible murder of Iraqi prisoners by US guards at the Abu Gharr rape prison.

[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:23.720]
Rumsfeld has repeatedly described the treatment of these Iraqi prisoners as fundamentally un-American.

[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:31.580]
It is abhorrent that the American taxpayer is paying the broadcast, what is in effect pro-torture propaganda to American troops, Brock wrote to Rumsfeld.

[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:37.560]
I ask you to consider removing Mr. Lombagh from the radio network to protect our troops from these reckless and dangerous messages.

[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:45.540]
Brock added that Limbaugh's comments which contradict orders issued by the commander of US forces in Iraq, borrowing many previously available coercive techniques,

[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:51.920]
undermining the military's chained command and may also inflame anti-American sentiment abroad putting our servicemen at risk.

[01:04:52.720 --> 01:05:01.560]
The controversy surrounding Limbaugh's comments begin when he said on May 4th, this is no different than what happens at the Scull and Bones initiation, I'm talking about people having a good time.

[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:09.400]
These people, you ever heard of emotional release, you ever heard of needing to blow off some steam, yadi yadi yadi, and a partridge in a pear tree.

[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:10.320]
How do you like that?

[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.920]
Bill Poppin Nazi and he's still on the air and he's still spewing the same kind of crap.

[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.060]
Probably he's still popping a few things.

[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.880]
He surprised me though, he just found something to be placed.

[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:22.240]

[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:22.920]
Huh?

[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.320]
In fact, we will be putting...

[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.560]
Will is number on our website this weekend for the holidays, okay?

[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.720]
For anybody that needs a supply?

[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.940]
56670560, pound 560.

[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.980]
In fact, that's an idea. We can have nude pictures in the drug dealers on our website.

[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.300]
How's that? I'd rather do that than have snuff films on there.

[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.460]
Nude pictures of drug dealers.

[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.180]
Right.

[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.520]
WDQM1.9, not there.

[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.940]
See, that goes to show you when you least expect it.

[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.160]
I'm going to reach over there and punch one.

[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.020]
And then...

[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:56.260]
Ow!

[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.320]
Absentee ballot law is a joke that isn't funny.

[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:05.260]
And remember we're talking the other day about the herald and somebody said Jim DeFeedy

[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.800]
wants to do a great while right something that makes sense?

[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:07.980]
He actually did it.

[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.500]
Once in a while.

[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:10.940]
And here it is.

[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.000]
Airby Votue count.

[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.120]
It's got quotes on it.

[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.400]
That's what the Jeb Bush said upon signing a law and to measure doing away with witness

[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.640]
ignitions for absentee ballots.

[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:19.740]
Airby Votue count.

[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.140]
Our governor, what a kidder Jim DeFeedy writes.

[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:29.460]
If we counted every vote in Florida, Jeb's brother would be spending all of his time and not so some of his time falling off his bicycle on his Texas ranch.

[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:35.720]
The only thing the Bill Jebside Tuesday guarantees is that Florida elections will continue to be a joke by taking away the witness requirement

[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:43.520]
the governor and legislature not only made it easier for corruption to take place within itself as a fairly amazing feat, but they've also made it much more difficult to catch.

[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:51.460]
The folks in Tallahassee at the urging of election supervisors across the state claim the witness requirement was to burdensome on some people and that

[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:56.500]
2000 absentee ballots had to be discarded this year during the presidential primary because they didn't have the required signature.

[01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:59.780]
You don't change the rules just because a few people can't follow them.

[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.440]
You work on making the rules better understood.

[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:04.160]
After all, how hard is it to get somebody to witness a ballot?

[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:04.940]
Anyone can do it.

[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.680]
A family member, a friend, a neighbor, the mailman, your dog, anyone.

[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.020]
And it's a good article, Jim DeFeedy.

[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.460]
You've got it's about time and have another...

[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:12.840]
Donut.

[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.960]
26 past 11 at 5, 60.

[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:16.660]
Speak at a Vitten.

[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.300]
This is your final week and that's where we don't have no, uh...

[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.060]
We don't have no judge today, so I better get ready.

[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:21.600]
See you.

[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.080]
Final weekend, I would enjoy all you can eat main lobster at the Enlopster at the Enlopster.

[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:25.640]
That is right.

[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:29.080]
You can eat all of the main lobster thermidor style only at the Enlopster.

[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.060]
You can shove down your posts.

[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:35.320]
In addition to this popular crustacean, Enlopster offers a spectacular line of mouthwatering delights.

[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.380]
Start off with the Choices six soups, a 30 item salad bar.

[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.280]
About third man!

[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.140]
Oysters on a half shell sushi, roasted duck, whoonan fish, just the name of you.

[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.580]
If you still have room, try the hand carb prime rib.

[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.680]
They're new Thai specialties.

[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.320]
And of course, the main lobster thermidor.

[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:53.300]
Armocoast broates only healthy living because they don't use any of their crap in their cooking.

[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.680]
They cook only with canola oil, a cholesterol free oil, and they don't use any MSG or cornstarch, no crap.

[01:07:59.060 --> 01:07:59.860]
And how about those desserts?

[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.500]
It doesn't say anything in here about...

[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:01.780]
See them?

[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.020]
Huh?

[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:03.620]
How about those desserts?

[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:05.220]
Armocoast has gotten out of the world.

[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.960]
The desserts is a selection featuring such favorites.

[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:12.860]
It's chocolate covered strawberries, cream caramel, hot bells and waffles, and an ice cream bar with all your favorite toppings.

[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.520]
A perfect ending to a gigantic feast fit for a beast.

[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.500]
Armocoast, three locations for you.

[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.700]
They're in sunrise, sunny Osbeach, and Pemberpies.

[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.580]
And believe me, they do have delicious, Tee-Em, no matter what this font says.

[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.500]
Armocoast recently voted the number one Asian gourmet restaurant by Reeds to the Sun Central,

[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:31.320]
WSBN Channel 7NZegat Restaurant Review for the past three years as a matter of fact.

[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:39.620]
For reservations called 9-5-4-5-7-2-38-22, take the whole gang for an unmatchable feast at the world famous Armocoast Chinese buffet.

[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.460]
My life and love!

[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:45.840]
This is Portrayal 560, UAM!

[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.060]
Why are you busting?

[01:08:50.600 --> 01:09:00.600]
Hi, I'm Sally Struthers, and every day millions of children in this country don't have access to the food they so desperately want to eat.

[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.340]
Many will go to bed hungry tonight.

[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:06.920]
Hungry for that fourth toaster strutal?

[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.080]
Want you please help feed the fat children?

[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:17.520]
Yes, for only $1.89 a day, roughly the price of a box of whole host.

[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:22.980]
You can sponsor an obese child through the Feed the Fat Children Foundation.

[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:32.260]
In return, you'll get a wide-angle photo of that special child plus handwritten notes written on Krispy Kreme Nacken.

[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:37.500]
Want you help feed a fat child? A child like Timmy here?

[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.160]
Say hi, Timmy.

[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.720]
Hi, I'm Timmy. Help me! I'm sorry!

[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:47.620]
You'll swell with pride as you watch your child swell with pown.

[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:54.140]
So please, supersize your heart and call now and help feed the fat children.

[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:58.080]
This is Sally's mother's thing. Thank you.

[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.480]
Timmy, can I have a bite of your ring?

[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.760]
No, it's mine! Give it to me, a little tub of large!

[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.380]
You can't! Give it!

[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:05.780]
No!

[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.640]
She's a giant in the industry. Make no mistake about it. Poor Sally.

[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:16.700]
1133, $27.00. We got the mad dog doing a show at Hooters on Pines and University of 2.

[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.220]
Here's Sean, who says, can I recommend X-Caliber?

[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:23.040]
And I can't read the rest of it, Sean, because obviously back in the day I could have,

[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.520]
but not no more. You'll understand.

[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.580]
You got it? We got it. X-Caliber.

[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.160]
He was talking about that scene in X-Caliber.

[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.440]
Yeah, or the... or Uther.

[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:35.480]
In full armor.

[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.300]
In full armor, yeah.

[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.040]
Right. Wasn't that in full metal jacket?

[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:44.300]
Anyway, making love with Harry Hamlin and Michael Ankeen.

[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.380]
I can't believe our good friend Alan and Key West misspelled.

[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.340]
Michael Ankeen put a T on me, but at any rate, I don't...

[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:57.340]
I guess it was a good movie. Kate Jackson was in it.

[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:00.180]
Harry Hamlin was... I don't think I'd act too much.

[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.900]
He's married. He was married to whom again from...

[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.480]
from Nots Landing, Nicolette Sheridan.

[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.560]
Right. Very good.

[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.560]
In fact, he was probably a kind of Sheridan on passions, but anyway.

[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.980]
Harry Hamlin, I was... well, of course I...

[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.280]
When I say he was married to somebody, aren't they all married to somebody?

[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.980]
Isn't Rob Lowell married to somebody? It has all bunch of kids?

[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.800]
Wasn't David Cassidy married to somebody?

[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.540]
He had a whole bunch of kids. Isn't Tom Cruise been married a couple of times?

[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.080]
Well, maybe adopted some kids.

[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.180]
Right? Right.

[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.440]
Everybody's married. Rob Hudson was married for Christ's sakes.

[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.480]
So Harry Hamlin and me, he just seems awfully swishing.

[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:38.300]
I don't know. I mean, I don't really care one way of doing anything for me,

[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.920]
but he just seems awfully, awfully, awfully.

[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.940]
Does anybody else in here, is that just my...

[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:44.120]
I hadn't noticed.

[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.040]
Oh. Harry Hamlin, yes you did.

[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.340]
And they are mechalunking. He did that.

[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.180]
You know, clash of the Titans and he was Greek.

[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.000]
He was in a Greek movie?

[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:53.600]
Yes, that's right.

[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.040]
That's that.

[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.960]
Oh, let's see. Steve from Davies says,

[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.240]
don't know if anyone's mentioned this movie.

[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.480]
I know they have in sirens, it says, was a pretty...

[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.880]
A movie. Sirens got it.

[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:03.560]
Yeah, we got it.

[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.440]
I can hear him right now, all of them sirens.

[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:09.440]
What movie, not x-rated, is the hottest you have ever seen.

[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.260]
That's our pull question.

[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.100]
And I think they like to pull, although I think they like the naked pictures today,

[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.340]
of Nell McCandrew better.

[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.580]
Because we're getting a phenomenal response in his nobody in town.

[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:21.740]
That's the amazing part of it.

[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:22.740]
You can tell by the votes.

[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:26.620]
But boy, oh boy, are we getting a tremendous look in the view there

[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:28.280]
on our two-for-one holiday pictures?

[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.340]
It's like a little bonus for you, just for the holidays.

[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:31.440]
Keep out of trouble.

[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:32.220]
Keep you off the streets.

[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.180]
What movie, not x-rated, is the hottest you've ever seen.

[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:35.840]
I didn't have weeks.

[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.520]
I'm sure we did do this now, but it's a long time ago.

[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.320]
Yeah, that's a good, good one.

[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.160]
A couple of years anyway.

[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.820]
And I didn't have weeks one, then.

[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.860]
47, body heat 46.

[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.220]
We got a battle going on.

[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:50.320]
Blue Lagoon 19, Showgirl's 19, Wild Things 18.

[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:56.260]
Basic instinct, 13, Monsters Balls 12, Eyes Wide Shut 10,

[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.240]
Two Moon Junction 7, The Hunger 6.

[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.300]
They're hungry for it.

[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:03.920]
Unfateful 5, Summer Lovers 5.

[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:07.300]
Return to the Blue Lagoon 4, the story of...

[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:07.820]
OOOH!

[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.560]
Three, Fatal Attraction 3, Embrace to the Vampire 3,

[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.540]
Wild Orchids got a pair, Paradise had a pair,

[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.400]
Secretary 2, No Mercy 1, and No Votes yet for Serenza Personal Best,

[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.840]
which went on their only moments of O-227 votes.

[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:21.420]
See what I mean?

[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.480]
Or nearly by this time we'd have like about 300 votes at least.

[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:27.000]
But, well, maybe they're movie didn't go up there yet.

[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.140]
That could be a two, see.

[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:28.780]
Bossable.

[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.300]
Or maybe just if I would take some more calls and shut up,

[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.560]
maybe we could lot more movies on there.

[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:36.740]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:37.640]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:38.860]
Hey, Neil Hilaria.

[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:39.540]
Pretty good, sir?

[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.680]
Alright, two things.

[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:43.540]
First of all, for the movies, I wanted to go with the AT&T.

[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.340]
AT&T?

[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.580]
Yeah, I think that's what it's called.

[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:47.720]
Is it the AT&T?

[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:48.620]
Yeah.

[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:49.940]
The AT&T, okay?

[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.060]
Yeah, we got Ghost Rape.

[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.220]
Yeah, that was something.

[01:13:53.800 --> 01:14:02.020]
And second, as far as our US soldiers abusing the Iraq prisoners and all that, you know,

[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.700]
the dog tower and stripping them down and all that.

[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.840]
Abu-Garraib.

[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:06.300]
Yeah.

[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:10.860]
Yeah, basically that's just a Saturday night of the traffic use for me and my wife.

[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.760]
So I really don't see the problem.

[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.440]
No, okay, well, have a good time.

[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:16.340]
Watch out for the BS.

[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:16.660]
Oh!

[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.380]
By the way.

[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:23.160]
Is there anything to say at this point?

[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.200]
No.

[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.260]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.160]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:30.340]
Neil.

[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.220]
Yes, sir?

[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.440]
Got one for you, Paul.

[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:33.020]
Alright.

[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:34.440]
Slipper.

[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:36.180]
Slipper?

[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.480]
That's what he said.

[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.780]
That's a sliver.

[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.500]
I'm just trying to imagine where they had the sliver.

[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.200]
I just, you know, I'm trying to picture that in my mind.

[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:50.740]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.000]
Hey, I think I have the winner for your ball.

[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.100]
Okay, this is the winner.

[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:56.860]
The graduate.

[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:57.860]
It's an older one.

[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:03.520]
But when the Mrs. Robinson kick her leg up in the air, it makes me go, la, la, la, la, la, la.

[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:14.060]
I'll tell you one thing, you know, and Bancroft was almost as sexy and acting as the

[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:15.500]
moment where she said, you wake the only.

[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:19.360]
Yeah, almost Mrs. the graduate, okay?

[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.980]
I don't see anything at all sexual about that movie because it was all like, you know,

[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.720]
there was a scene in the strip club with an airplane act.

[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:26.860]
Oh, I see.

[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.800]
Oh, speaking of strip club, what was that movie that Chris Atkins was in, which again,

[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.040]
you wouldn't be interested in, but what was that movie?

[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:32.840]
A night in heaven.

[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:33.820]
A night in heaven.

[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:34.920]
Well, I can't believe you know that.

[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:35.960]
What about Boogie Nights?

[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:36.960]
That was about its moments.

[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.800]
They got with it in all those movies that you're naming there.

[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.820]
What about Boogie Nights?

[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:40.480]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.320]
Heather Graham naked.

[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.880]
What's not to like an air?

[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.460]
And since we're talking about people, we like a lot like Jennifer Conley.

[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.440]
Boy, I'll tell you she really is great.

[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.020]
She's good.

[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:49.720]
He's beautiful.

[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:52.600]
I'm not just talking about how beautiful she, I'm talking about, she's a good actor.

[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:53.200]
Yes, she is.

[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:55.960]
Because I saw the end of a beautiful mind again.

[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.700]
The other night was on, it was on somewhere and I watched the last 20 or 30 minutes.

[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:03.500]
And I still don't like Russell Crowe, but it's a great, he's a good actor and she's a great.

[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:07.000]
But anyway, what's wrong with our favorite?

[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:08.460]
Requiem for a dream.

[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:09.540]
For a erotic?

[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.440]
She's done more erotic.

[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.680]
I understand, but what's wrong with the Ask to Ask?

[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:15.720]
Can we still say that?

[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:15.920]
No.

[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:16.760]
Let me ask somebody.

[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:21.920]
Let me ask our program director because As is his middle name is what the doctor said.

[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:22.580]
No, no, seriously.

[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.760]
The situation surrounding that scene made it not erotic for some of us.

[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:28.920]
Why is that?

[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:30.360]
There's more tragic than anything.

[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.520]
Well, you were always tragic.

[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:32.200]
You were always tragic.

[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:32.720]
Come on.

[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.180]
Well, you're, you're misreading a lot of people out there, a lot of Esperanto, whatever.

[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.820]
Yeah, for them, I understand, but it's a lot of people.

[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:42.220]
Well, I'm just telling you right now, what, what, what, what we, what we improve dream needs to be on there.

[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.880]
Make no mistake about it.

[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:50.860]
I guarantee I didn't know, uh, sliver, but it's, uh, it'll get a voter to 20 till noon at 560 WDQ.

[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:51.320]
I am.

[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:51.900]
Oh, there we go.

[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.440]
No, you have to cut it down.

[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.860]
In fact, I got to hear myself.

[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.580]
I'm surprised you actually got that.

[01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:01.540]
Now it's, uh, we've had it around since your DCS is so bearing of any good stuff.

[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:06.540]
That's another, another reason I can't stand being in South Florida is because every time I come out at a studio,

[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.820]
it's like, uh, I'm operating with a handy crab.

[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:18.720]
Speaking of a handy cap, I don't forget a week from the bar, the Belmont, and, uh, smiley, smarty-ass, uh, Jones, will win the triple crown.

[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.180]
I was thinking this morning, you know, while I was shaving, and don't ask me why.

[01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:28.520]
I was thinking in 70, uh, in the 70s boy, if you're a horseman, or even if you weren't, what a great time was.

[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:36.200]
73 Secretary of one in triple crown, 77 Seattle slew, and the Frenchman didn't fall off Jean-Cruix, and in 78, a firm in Aladar,

[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.220]
it was great battles, a firm wins a triple crown, with a little Stevie Copp and a mort.

[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.100]
So you have three in like seven years.

[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.440]
And I think spectacular bid was 79 also.

[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:50.040]
So you could add 48 years if, uh, somebody would have pulled Ronnie Franklin, it wasn't a six-for-long race.

[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.100]
You follow all of that?

[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.360]
Good, because Dave Johnson's going to be asking you questions when he calls his next Friday.

[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.600]
You know, some time in South Florida, you're in T's three things, heat humidity and hurricanes.

[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:12.820]
You can't control the weather, unfortunately, but you can control how you protect your home during hurricane season, which is already upon us by the way.

[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:15.800]
You may through like November, they call it, and this is supposed to be a bad one.

[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:22.140]
So here's the deal. Florida new coat hurricane shutters installed shutters in over 3000 homes in South Florida over the past decade.

[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:29.940]

[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:45.200]
Florida new code now offers a new steel panel system designed to be installed from the inside on your second floor windows.

[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:47.140]

I'm going to change my mood from a makeup defense.

Welcome.

[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:46.980]
Welcome.

[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.660]
He's going to be a busy child on the inside.

[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.140]
I'm hearing Dan Pia there right now.

[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.420]
747-560-WQAM.

[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.320]
Here's the fact that he says, how about it ain't personal best of the pool.

[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:13.640]
It's a movie starring Miriel.

[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.580]
I mean, ways to track athlete with some really hot scenes that George would appreciate.

[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:17.360]
Like I don't know.

[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.020]
Yeah, like we don't know.

[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:20.720]
It's all that in the theaters.

[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.420]
Oh my god.

[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.980]
Anyway, it's also if you like to file off the Lindy and Pat Boone-Fuller.

[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.880]
Did you see this? Did you look at this? Let's get it.

[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:31.480]
Okay. We can have a nice crisp clean.

[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:32.620]
I'm sure it's well done.

[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:37.020]
And we can stick right on there since we got so many goodies on our website these days.

[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.820]
It's just almost scary when you come right down to it.

[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.400]
So we'll put personal best on there and thank you so much.

[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:46.320]
566-705-60, pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.560]
What movie not x rated?

[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.180]
In other words, not a porn movie.

[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.660]
Maybe I should have said that, right?

[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.180]
Right. Although we haven't really had that many come up there.

[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:57.200]
We're like Midnight Cowboy. Midnight Cowboy wasn't the least bit sexy in any way, shape or form.

[01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:59.080]
Unless we're really a despot ol' fag.

[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.980]
Well, of course, back in that day, you know.

[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:06.140]
What movie not x rated is the hottest you've ever seen?

[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.340]
Nine and a half weeks, 54, body heat 52.

[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.900]
And then it's way down. It's strictly a two-hoss race.

[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:20.940]
Wild things 24, showgirls 23, the Blue Lagoon 22, basic instinct 15, monsters balls, 14,

[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:28.280]
eyes wide chart 11, two-month junction 10, unfaithful 7-1-1-1-1-6, the summer lovers 5, story of, oh!

[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.880]
Four. Return to the Blue Lagoon 4.

[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:36.380]
Let's see. Fade-up Trashon's got some too, which I can't believe. Fade-up Trashon's got three.

[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.840]
Embrace the Vampire of K. Secretary 3, paradise 2, Requiem for Dream 2.

[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:44.420]
See, too already for Requiem for Dream, you little fade.

[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:47.180]
We love General for Conley. We like her best-ass to ask.

[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.120]
No more C1 X caliber 1, silver 1, silver sliver.

[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.300]
The entity don't have any yet. Sirens, the graduate personal best.

[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.520]
And, well, well, and person best.

[01:22:58.840 --> 01:22:59.140]
My bad.

[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.880]
Now, see, you can't get rid of that, can you?

[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.800]
Eric's gonna have to, he's gonna have to bat your ass out of there.

[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.900]
You got to bail Miguel's out of there, Eric.

[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:10.860]
He's got personal best and person best.

[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.300]
Speaking of best person, I got to say one thing.

[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:18.980]
I know we have no hockey fans in this audience, but Dan Boyle, a former Panther defenseman,

[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.680]
who's got a home and four lottery else still, by the way,

[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:24.300]
who wasn't good enough for the Panthers, but has played great for Tampa Bay.

[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.440]
And after the loss on Tuesday night, Dan Boyle, Dave Andrewchuck in the locker room,

[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.720]
tells him after the game that his house had burned not completely down,

[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:35.380]
but his house in Tampa, $300,000 worth of damage.

[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.320]
A electrical cord or something.

[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:39.620]
So there was an electrical fired massive damage.

[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:46.280]
And so he's got this, you know, it's got to take four months to get back into the house

[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.840]
and rebuild into all this other stuff. And God willing, there was how much

[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:54.260]
the insurance he had. So Dan Boyle last night, who got knocked around pretty bad in that game Tuesday also,

[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:59.420]
just played fantastic. He was scored a goal and just played sensational all night long.

[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:03.400]
For the lightning kick Calgary as so the series is even a good game last night.

[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.800]
Too bad nobody watched it in South Florida. Too bad we got no hockey fans.

[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.820]
Not just in South Florida, but in the USA.

[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:14.440]
In fact, in the US and game one on Tuesday night, did a 1.1 share.

[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:18.900]
The hockey. 1.1, which means how many people watched it in the US?

[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:19.940]
About 30 men.

[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:24.020]
Over 3 million people watched it on the CBC Tuesday night's game here in Canada,

[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.380]
because we got some real hockey fans. But, you know, got a lot of pinnacle tournaments.

[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:31.140]
Shuffle board stuff, a lot of stuff going on in Florida.

[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:34.020]
That Marjoram tournament is like a real winter in Hellendale.

[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8. I didn't hear anything about Dan Boyle.

[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.540]
You got nothing to say about that. The kid's house burns down.

[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.560]
And he goes out there and plays a great game and scores a goal. The fence didn't know less.

[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:48.920]
Not good enough for the Panthers, but good enough for the soon to be champion Tampa Bay Lightning.

[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:51.580]
WQAM, hello.

[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.160]
QAM.

[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.140]
Not there.

[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:57.900]
WQAM, hello.

[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.820]
Can we go for two, three, four? Huh?

[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:04.420]
Hello.

[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.320]
Too late. WQAM, hello.

[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:07.680]
Hello, Neil. How are you?

[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:08.500]
Okay, sir.

[01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:13.080]
Just letting you listen. I know that the highway's the troll between,

[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.320]
not a turnpike, southbound.

[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:17.940]
152 to 184.

[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.500]
I think this is what the plane is.

[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.980]
Just to check to see if you have your seat on.

[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.140]
Oh, they're clicking it and looking at, huh?

[01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:27.520]
They're checking from the plane.

[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:29.040]
Thanks for the bad news, pal.

[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.640]
Hey, sir. Have a great weekend, you guys.

[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:30.980]
You too.

[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.500]
How do you like that? They're trying to destroy your holiday weekend.

[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.460]
Okay, they're out there.

[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.100]
Oh, yeah, we're trying to save lives. Right.

[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:38.140]
That's got a lot to do with it.

[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.100]
If you're going like three miles over the speed limit on how you just rode there and powered,

[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.400]
oh, we're trying to save your life.

[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.840]
No, you're not. You're trying to ride business.

[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.320]
Okay, that's what you're trying to do.

[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:48.640]
You're trying to write more business. You're not fooling me.

[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.580]
Well, that plantation chief, talk about a guy who needs a lobotomy.

[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:54.620]
But anyway, WQAM, hello.

[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.700]
Yeah, I've got last thing going Paris.

[01:25:57.220 --> 01:25:59.000]
Didn't we put that on or not?

[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:00.240]
I thought we did.

[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:03.680]
I thought I did, but I'm glad you mentioned that again, because I think we forgot about it,

[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.840]
because we thought it was originally ex-rated, but then it was not.

[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.940]
So thank you so much for reminding us, see?

[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.000]
We argued about it.

[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:10.520]
We had a big cemist about it.

[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.640]
We even ate some carrot cemist in honor of it.

[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.120]
Last thing one pair should be on there. It's not on there.

[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:15.620]
All right.

[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:17.280]
That was our bad.

[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.560]
And let's see. Did Eric Bill, look at that.

[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.740]
What a nice job, Eric.

[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.300]
He is right on top of it in between Salami sandwiches.

[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:26.180]
He just bailed Miguel's ass right out.

[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:29.880]
Took off that person best, which I would replace with last thing one, Paddy,

[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.960]
with a slightly less enormous Marlon Brando.

[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:34.860]
Slightly.

[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:42.560]
Just a pound or two, just a couple hundred pounds less than what we're going to be carrying around right now.

[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:44.520]
Just two hundred and fifty or three hundred pounds less.

[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:48.600]
Man, he is just a gigantic in the industry.

[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:50.660]
Marlon Brando.

[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:52.680]
There's one of the most bizarre people.

[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:55.460]
He really is something else.

[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:56.220]
Smurderly.

[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.780]
I think your brand is going to be so.

[01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:00.320]
W.D.C.Y.M. Hello.

[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:01.540]
Hey, male.

[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.200]
I got one from the poll.

[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:04.600]
Hello.

[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.480]
Yes? I'm here, I'm here.

[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.380]
Oh, the great Texas dynamite chase.

[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.880]
That was with Marsha Brady.

[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.520]
So hot.

[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.660]
I just want to cry, you know what?

[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:31.720]
See, I think what we need to do is just forget about all the bedtime stories.

[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:34.360]
Let's just put naked pictures on a website every day.

[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:34.800]
What are you saying?

[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:35.840]
Just dozens of them, huh?

[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:36.400]
Okay.

[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:37.480]
We'll put something for everybody.

[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:41.280]
We'll put male, female, animal, vegetable, mineral, you know, field, then.

[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:42.580]
Wow.

[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:43.760]
It is really something.

[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.020]
W.D.C.Y.M. Hello.

[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:48.380]
Nice talking to you.

[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:49.300]
W.D.C.Y.M. Hello.

[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:50.820]
Hello, how you doing?

[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:51.540]
Pretty good.

[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:53.880]
How'd you guys forget about shoot keys?

[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:55.860]
It was easy.

[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:57.720]
Okay, well, we got it now.

[01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:58.680]
The knee more.

[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.940]
And also I think George and Grobys should start the morning show now.

[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:03.140]
All right.

[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.240]
George and Gellie together again.

[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:06.060]
How do you like that?

[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:06.360]
Ow!

[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.340]
See, you guys don't have any issues yet.

[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.680]
What would we talk about?

[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:13.620]
Hockey?

[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:15.280]
Something you know a lot about?

[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:15.700]
Hey.

[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:20.640]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, about Dan Boyle, number 22.

[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.660]
They're 10th of eight defensemen.

[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:22.540]
Not good enough for the Panthers.

[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.140]
I'll say it again.

[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.640]
Red Warren are not good enough for the Panthers.

[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:29.560]
But the organization, now we got the coach that we wanted, the general manager that we didn't want,

[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:31.980]
but that the coach wanted, and, et cetera, and so on.

[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:32.740]
A lot of BS again.

[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.400]
I'll spin all of BS all the time.

[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:37.200]
When some games, baby, South Florida wants a winner.

[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:37.960]
They love a winner.

[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.620]
Anything short of that, all they want to do is bitch about it.

[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:42.200]
They don't have any interest.

[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.580]
Just give them a winner.

[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:44.120]
That's it.

[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:46.400]
Stop the BS, Alan Cohn.

[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.180]
You're not kidding us.

[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:48.380]
WDQA, hello.

[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:49.420]
Hey, Neil.

[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:50.400]
How you doing?

[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.740]
Does the name Collegula be good, that poor?

[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:55.660]
Yeah, Collegula would be good.

[01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:58.340]
It was definitely x-rated, but like I said, it wasn't a poor number.

[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.020]
We'll put it on and we're going to record it all.

[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:00.820]
The great, great, great, all.

[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.180]
Collegula, what do you say?

[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:03.080]
Yep, definitely.

[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:03.420]

[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.020]
I should have said, it's my bad.

[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:09.920]
I should have said, not pornographic, but I mean, yeah, well,

[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.120]
not triple x-rated, that would be even better, right?

[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.440]
Because triple x is like a, you know, a porn movie,

[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.980]
or as x-rated just meant it was like a regular pedestrian movie,

[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.820]
like clockwork orange.

[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:19.220]
Right?

[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.460]
But there was nothing pornographic, and there was a lot of violence,

[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:24.020]
and then of course there was that scene well.

[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.920]
With that rocking, the rocking ceramic penis,

[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:29.340]
but nevertheless, that was a comedy scene.

[01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:30.140]
No, I'm right.

[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.660]
And then of course there was that snake, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.480]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T, and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:40.420]
Who's the QAIM? Hello.

[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.760]
Okay, I should have a small town, too, bag.

[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.080]
Oh, how sad.

[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:51.340]
And line 9 is always a winner, too. It's always something really good.

[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.100]
Give us me an opportunity to mention again.

[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.600]
Join the Mad Dog 2 to 4 this afternoon as he broadcasts live

[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.500]
from Hooters on Pondeson University, and be sure to stop

[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:02.060]
by for an autograph signing with Marlon's picture, Brad Penny.

[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.120]
Enjoy specials on Heineken.

[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.700]
Did I tell you Freddie Heineken died? I told you that, didn't I?

[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:07.100]
Who?

[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:08.680]
Freddie Heineken.

[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:11.580]
That would be...

[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:15.060]
Okay, yeah, you did. He's the founder of Heineken Beer, you clown.

[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:18.620]
And when some prizes, that's with Mad Dog and Brad Penny,

[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.840]
Hooters and Pepperpods. Now, George's tomorrow is making the appearance.

[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.120]
He won't have any Heineken because he's not getting Heineken.

[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:23.660]
He'll be right.

[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.220]
That's George's tomorrow, noon to 2 at Intel Wireless,

[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:30.000]
at 150.95, Northwest 57th Avenue, and Miami,

[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.500]
stop by to spend the Vio for prizes.

[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:34.620]
That's Intel Wireless, and authorized Verizon Wireless Agent,

[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:36.020]
noon to 2 tomorrow, with little George.

[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:37.340]
You don't know his Heineken from his can.

[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.840]
1156 at 560, WQM speaking to that,

[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.560]
if you're not really sure what's going on in your can,

[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.920]
or the rest of your body, Duff.

[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.640]
Nobody wants to think about cancer, heart disease,

[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.140]
and these horrible diseases that the Lord has forced it upon us,

[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:55.660]
but it's a proven fact that disease responds best to treatment

[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:56.660]
if detected early.

[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.540]
That's why I went there a few weeks ago,

[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.800]
just to find out if I'm all still there,

[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.140]
you know, inside, outside and between,

[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:03.920]
and came out with some good test results, too.

[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:05.600]
They said, look at that, the man even got a heart.

[01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.120]
Hollywood Diagnostic Center is proud to announce

[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:12.000]
their virtual colonoscopy, a lot less intrusive than the traditional method, by the way.

[01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:14.680]
Coronary heart scoring and full body screening exams,

[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.000]
that can detect cancer and other life-threatening diseases in the early stages,

[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.920]
while it's still in time to do something about it.

[01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:21.180]
Doctors before it does not need it.

[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:22.640]
For our year imaging exams,

[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.560]
Either give you a heads-up on some of the problem that's developing,

[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:32.680]
you can do something about or,

[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:34.380]
number two, if there's nothing wrong with it,

[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.160]

and much more.

[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:45.140]

5.6.6, 5.6.6, the radio's on your side.

[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.320]
Q&A!

[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.240]
This is Kenge.

[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:12.820]
I like to relax by having Mary Magdalene recite my balls

[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:15.040]
while listening to the Neil Rogers 12-hour movie.

[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:15.780]
Hey!

[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:17.620]
I will tell you nothing!

[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.260]
I speak on your interrogation page!

[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:22.280]
All right, you'll leave me no choice.

[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.060]
Call the special agent!

[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.480]
What kind of agent are you?

[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.140]
Insurance agent, actually?

[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.280]
Hi, I'm Brad.

[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:29.820]
Oh, no.

[01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.840]
If you can spare me just six hours of your time,

[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:35.300]
I'd love to discuss our new executive whole life policy!

[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:36.840]
What is this whole life, huh?

[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:37.380]
Are you kidding?

[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:40.200]
It's an exciting alternative to term life insurance.

[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:40.800]
It's exciting!

[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:44.020]
With some terrific text of her benefits for all of your loved ones.

[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:45.740]
By the way, are you a smokeer?

[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.900]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:47.100]
Great!

[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:50.620]
Now, if you combine the whole life with this wonderful new-ity policy,

[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:53.460]
you can get the best of both worlds, full protection,

[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.380]
and a steady retirement income!

[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:57.360]
Oh, God, please, no, no, no!

[01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:57.900]
Stop it!

[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:02.560]
But first, let me back up and talk about the many differences between term life and whole life.

[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.160]
Now, term life may seem attractive at first because of the lower premium,

[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:09.300]
but what if you become uninsurable by the end of the term?

[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:12.160]
Once you become older and really need the insurance,

[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:14.800]
wouldn't you rest these years knowing that coverage is guaranteed?

[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:16.120]
No!

[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:18.220]
Of course you would!

[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:21.420]
I've taken the liberty of putting together this pie chart.

[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.360]
If I can just write it down.

[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:24.740]
How dare they!

[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:32.280]
Drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein,

[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:33.980]
Horser President!

[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.880]
I tell you one thing, either he had got a little something I'd before,

[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:40.400]
or he was popping a lot of vagras before he got up there and made that speech.

[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:42.940]
He just, he's wound up like a man, a maniac.

[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:48.300]
That was the good algorithm we never saw heard even existed before that.

[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:52.240]
Man, I've had to carry you just stay in a background,

[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:55.280]
walking around like Herman Munster, and just let him make all the speeches.

[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.660]
Don't you think?

[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.400]
Good plan, but it won't happen.

[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:02.060]
And once in a while, when owls like everyone on a steam a little bit,

[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:04.660]
yeah, dread a little Howard out for a good time.

[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.120]
Absolutely.

[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:05.780]
Not that Howard.

[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:09.200]
Man, bomb threat towards American Airlines flight.

[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:10.660]
You see this?

[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:11.220]
Nope.

[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.900]
I mean, not that people are touchy or nervous.

[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:17.540]
An American Airlines jet flying from Dallas for worth of Boston was ever to the yesterday.

[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:20.860]
After a flight attendant found a note saying there was a bomb in the cargo hold.

[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.860]
Investigators examined a suspicious package taken from the plane that turned out to be a bag similar to a computer case

[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:31.240]
at Kelly Watson, spokesman for National International Airport.

[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:33.780]
Content where nothing harmful or hazardous it was cleared.

[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.460]
Watson declined to identify the bag's contents.

[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:39.420]
Probably in a computer case guess what they probably found?

[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:41.480]
A computer?

[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:41.900]
Oh.

[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.040]
The flight attendant found that note in one of the plane's lavatories,

[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:46.960]
the 129 passengers were taken off.

[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.700]
The plane was being re-screened by the TSA and the FBI.

[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:54.460]
Flight 306 left Dallas for worth of 146 pm.

[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:56.920]
Lended Nashville shortly after 330.

[01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:59.840]
It was a full flight carrying two pilots and three flight attendants.

[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:04.280]
It was just a coincidence that Homeland Security spokesman Dennis Murphy,

[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:08.800]
that in Nashville the MD80 was parked near the Tennessee National Guard Airfield

[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.000]
where Air Force 1 awaited President Bush's arrival after a speech and fundraiser in Nashville.

[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:14.740]
How do you like that?

[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:18.280]
L. President, they departed Nashville and Air Force 1 about 750 pm.

[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:22.900]
White House spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, said this is not effect Bush's travel plan.

[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:26.620]
He's going to Italy and always going to meet with the Pope, L. Papa.

[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:30.520]
He's going to tell him all about his speech-emated Bob Jones University,

[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:33.960]
how they said the Catholics were a bunch of devil worshipers and so on.

[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:34.660]
You think?

[01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:35.840]
I know it.

[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:41.320]
And speaking of politics, which I know most of the punks out there don't give a flying crap about,

[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.200]
but you better start thinking about it while I'm before they send your...

[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:50.020]
You mean first of all, they send your ass marching off the North Korea or Iran or Syria or some God forbid in place like that?

[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:50.620]
Syria?

[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:52.160]
I'm Syria.

[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:52.920]
Okay.

[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:57.300]
Carrie surges ahead in 12 crucial swing states as Bush pull ratings plummet.

[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:57.780]
All right.

[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:02.260]
George Bush has had a warning shot from the crucial battleground states

[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:06.660]
likely to decide the outcome of the presidential election, where his rival John Carey is surging ahead.

[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:07.340]
All right.

[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:12.760]
Less than six months from Election Day, polls suggest that Mr. Carey is doing the right thing,

[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.360]
just like how he would have kept his wife in a closet,

[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:20.740]
as long as Carey stays out of our view too much and people don't realize how much he looks an axe like Herman Munster,

[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:22.620]
where he's lopped her off.

[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.200]
Less than six months from Election Day, polls suggest that Mr. Carey is leading a president.

[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.680]
They in 12 of the 16 so-called swing states, he's swinging it.

[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.660]
In some states, they'll lead his slide, but in places such as New Hampshire,

[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:38.620]
which Mr. Bush won in 2000, Mr. Carey's got lead of almost 10%.

[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:39.460]
How do you like that?

[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.520]
Oh my God.

[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.700]
Though polls offer only a snack shot in time,

[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:45.420]
polls to John Zagbi, who made the latest survey said,

[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:48.040]
if present leads no 16 states hold true,

[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.520]
remember I talked about this yesterday,

[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:50.580]
I couldn't find the numbers right.

[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:54.700]
And Democrats and Republicans hold onto the states each party one easily in 2000.

[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.400]
Mr. Carey will win with a margin of 102 electrical college votes.

[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:02.500]
I've made a career of taking bungee jumps in my election calls,

[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:04.200]
Mr. Zagbi wrote an op-ed article,

[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.120]
here's my jump for 2004,

[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.160]
John Carey will win the election,

[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:10.920]
where unlikely to see any big bumps for either candidate,

[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.360]
because opinion is so polarized,

[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.060]
and I believe frozen in place,

[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.360]
there were still six months to go anything could happen.

[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.220]
But as of today, the racist John Carey's to lose.

[01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:26.500]
The battleground states, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota.

[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.560]
We're going to have to have a lot of absentee ballots with no witnesses, Jeb.

[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:34.380]
Thousands and thousands, maybe about ten, maybe thousand of those, just in case.

[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.520]
Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota,

[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.460]
Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon,

[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:44.300]
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:48.060]
I'd like to improve crucial on deciding who Carey's today on November 2.

[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.220]
Republican Democratic strategist knows at least 30 states,

[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.380]
along with the District of Columbia,

[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.220]
the outcome of the vote is a foregone conclusion,

[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.760]
but in the battleground states,

[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.980]
which were won in 2000 by six percentage points,

[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:01.300]
or less, everything is up for grabs.

[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.840]
Not surprisingly, this is where both sides are focusing much of their effort.

[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.300]
A poll in these 16 states will have shaken present strategists.

[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:12.300]
As they've watched his approval rating sink to between 41 and 47%,

[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:14.960]
the lowest of his presidency is AIDS say,

[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:17.520]
then in battleground states, the president has the advantage,

[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:20.500]
but the new poll suggests this is not the case, how do you like that?

[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.220]
He spent too much time talking about...

[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:23.300]
Abougarraib.

[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.780]
If these numbers are correct, the Republicans are probably disappointed

[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:28.260]
said Kim Goldstein, he's probably a kind of guilty,

[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:31.020]
Professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.480]
Some analysts attribute Mr. Carey's surge to biographical ads in those 16 states

[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.760]
of the cost of 25 million bucks,

[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:40.400]
experts say they appear to have helped him recover from negative ads

[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.460]
paid for by the Republicans, which criticized his voting record in Congress,

[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:45.740]
and questioned his national security credibility.

[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:49.080]
Adam Climer, the political director of the National Annabelle Election Survey

[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:52.800]
told USA Today, Carey's been doing a better job lately in the battleground states,

[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:56.100]
and my guess is his ads are very important in that, et cetera, and so on.

[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:57.740]
So there you go for what it's worth, okay?

[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.540]
And for what it's worth, somebody who knows about winning elections,

[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.120]
especially against right-wing fanatics.

[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.200]
Former President Clinton said there is day that Democratic presidential candidate,

[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:10.300]
John Carey, is smart not to come and daily,

[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:13.160]
I'd every development in Iraq because he recognized he's not the president.

[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.140]
Clinton also said in his memoirs,

[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.360]
do out weeks before the Summer's Democratic National Convention,

[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:20.940]
will not steal Carey's spotlight, will only help the party.

[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:25.380]
Speaking at his office in Harlem, Clinton said he didn't think Carey was running too safe at campaign,

[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:28.200]
some political strategists have suggested Carey's failing to exploit,

[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.860]
increasing skepticism about President Bush's handling of the war,

[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:34.520]
as violence in Iraq escalates, and more details emerge about the abusive Iraqi prisoners.

[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:35.700]
Abu Gharraib.

[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:39.340]
He's the candidate for president, he's not somebody who's supposed to give day by day commentary and events,

[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:42.720]
Clinton said he's made quite clear what he believes about the major issues and news today,

[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:44.460]
and I think he's shown a certain reticence.

[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:48.440]
The former president said that given the seriousness of the problems we face in the world today,

[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:49.880]
I think it's been quite appropriate.

[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.040]
Clinton talking to reporters that Carey should be focused on letting the American people get to know him,

[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:57.420]
who he is, what he's told, what he wants to do, and then clarifying his terms,

[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.380]
the differences between himself and the president.

[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:02.500]
In fact, that would be the best thing I think he could say is, I'm not George Bush.

[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:05.260]
Just keep saying that, right? I'm not George Bush, and people will be going,

[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:05.760]
Oh, yeah!

[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:06.360]
Thank God!

[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.520]
Just put out like that.

[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:10.040]
And then once they're all asleep enough.

[01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:11.520]
Abu Gharraib, like that.

[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:16.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Line,

[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:21.080]
what movie, not x-rated, is the hottest you've ever seen, that's our poll question today.

[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.460]
Who's QAM? Hello?

[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:24.740]
Not there.

[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:26.900]
QAM, hello.

[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:32.560]
Okay.

[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:36.380]
No, I'm going to clear this throat, fully before we speak to this car.

[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:37.240]
QAM, hello.

[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:39.020]
Hello, Neil.

[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:39.860]
Yes, sir?

[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.300]
Yes, I'd like to add one to your poll, and it's a great movie.

[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:46.400]
It'll keep you up for two hours. It's called Kayaudiy Agui.

[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.140]
Kayaudiy Agui?

[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:51.120]
Yes, sir George, he knows.

[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:52.520]
Do you know George?

[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.400]
Yeah, I know George. He's a good guy.

[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:55.160]
Oh, okay.

[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:57.680]
Kayaudiy Agui, do you have any idea what that is?

[01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:59.560]
The joke calling, it's a joke movie.

[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:02.300]
So what does that mean?

[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:04.680]
Nothing sexy about it. Nobody got naked.

[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:07.660]
All the women in there are indeed Kayaudiy Agui, even though they're not supposed to be.

[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:08.580]
I see.

[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:09.120]
Oh.

[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:10.800]
QAM, hello.

[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:12.200]
How old is Mod?

[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:16.060]
WQM, hello.

[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.580]
How are you doing? Is this George?

[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:18.800]
Yeah, this is George.

[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.740]
This is Paul. Oh, this is Neil.

[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:21.500]
Oh, hi, Paul.

[01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:24.420]
Hi, Neil. I was going to throw in Barbara Ella.

[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.640]
Barbara Ella, but Jane Fonda.

[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.020]
Yes.

[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:28.100]
Now we're talking.

[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:31.680]
And I have one other thing to a little way back.

[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:35.360]
It was sleepers in New York, the car on the way at the time.

[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:42.180]
John Warton, he condemned the movie because the priest had lied on the movie.

[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:42.880]
And the priest had lied on the stand.

[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:48.420]
Not when one went on in the Spotted Home for the youngsters.

[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:50.300]
In case you guys want to wear that.

[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:57.980]
And the idea of the Catholic Church comes out with their version and how they limit the movie.

[01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:00.820]
It's caught in the tablet newspaper.

[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:02.620]
Okay. Thanks a lot, Paul.

[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:04.540]
What have you just said? Do you have any idea what he said at all?

[01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:05.160]
No, I'm sorry.

[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.700]
Something about Covenant House and Father John Ritter, who was a notorious pedophile.

[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:09.780]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:17.120]
You know, this idea gets so outraged every time I see another one of those stories or somebody faxes it and unwarned things

[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:19.300]
and that biography of a father gig into the night.

[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:22.600]
And those people are still, even at this point, still defending the this day.

[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.400]
Oh, he never saw a freight train.

[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:25.920]
And, yeah, oh, please.

[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:26.920]
Please, please.

[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.680]
The most corrupt institution on the face of the globe.

[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:33.220]
There's nothing that's even a close second is the Catholic Church.

[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.780]
Spreading misery and suffering and stupidity, ignorance and crap everywhere that they go.

[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:40.160]
Tragedy.

[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:44.520]
All these, all the countries in Latin America, for example, all the overpopulation,

[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.920]
making babies like they're coming out and like rabbits.

[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:52.200]
And they're pouring across the border and the public says, oh, gee, we all these illegal aliens.

[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.640]
Well, I can't imagine why.

[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:56.840]
I just can't even begin to imagine why.

[01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:58.720]
Yeah, I think the fundamentalists were right about them.

[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:03.480]
Well, maybe that's what Bush is going to tell a pope when it goes over there.

[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:06.380]
Double just going to give a little talk and do the, hey, by the way, nice dress.

[01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:10.920]
12 minutes past noon at 5.60 WQA.

[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.220]
I'm happy you're still nervous about buying a mattress.

[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:15.220]
I mean, you know, it's a major investment over the telephone.

[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:20.060]

Why would you waste any of your time?

Schlepping from showroom to showroom.

[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:30.180]
Friday, you bastards.

[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:33.400]
History comes to life on the History Channel.

[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.180]
The year is 1968.

[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:39.080]
Young men across America are ordered to serve their country in Vietnam.

[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:45.580]
Starting tonight, the History Channel takes a historical and historical look back as they reported to the Draft Board.

[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:49.800]
All right, listen up. When I call your name, step forward to be sworn in.

[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:52.320]
Richard Chaining.

[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:55.780]
Are you ready to serve your country son?

[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:58.000]
Sorry pal, I got better things to do.

[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.180]
Except his check that's open to my gratitude.

[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:02.280]
Okay, who's next?

[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:03.540]
Rush.

[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:04.840]
This is real name.

[01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:05.800]
Limba.

[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:13.060]
Rush is the name, but you might know me as Jeff Christie on KUDL.

[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.360]
Kudal has noodles of hits.

[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.240]
Here's a white boy with a questionable name.

[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:18.720]
Beanchain Thomas.

[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:22.080]
Are you ready to serve your country boy?

[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:23.340]
Let me tell you this, my friend.

[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:29.020]
I'm one tough talking college drop out that cherishes my god, given right and offended with my mouth.

[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:31.260]
Now if you'll excuse me.

[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:33.280]
You're coming out of here.

[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:37.700]
No, no, no, I don't understand.

[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:39.620]
It's my poor little man.

[01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:41.440]
It's so big.

[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:43.200]
I even think it's here.

[01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:45.200]
It's in the skirts.

[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.880]
Oh, I hate it.

[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:50.180]
I have a kid in season.

[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:52.780]
I'm in front of the cinnamon links right now.

[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:55.620]
No, no.

[01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:56.600]
Where are you?

[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:57.560]
Where are you?

[01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:03.500]
From 18, somebody says Tan Bauderick and the Dudley Moore who's still dead.

[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:05.480]
Tan, how could we forgotten about that?

[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:09.380]
Because back in the day, that was considered to be the cat's meow for you to still say it was.

[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:10.200]
It was okay.

[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.060]
No, I liked it then.

[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:12.380]
Well, what's not to like?

[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:14.760]
That way are you picking on Baud again?

[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:15.760]
No, I would never.

[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.780]
Because you'll get her worked up about Joe Castell again if you do.

[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:21.720]
Oh, speaking of that,

[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:25.020]
suit over Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction has been tossed out.

[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:25.820]
Remember the guy you were with?

[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:26.800]
Yeah, the other day.

[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:31.520]
A split second peek at Janet Jackson's breath is not worth $5,000.

[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:35.080]
Judge Gerald Jensen, in Salt Lake City, is rejected.

[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:39.680]
Utah lawyers claim that CBS owner Viacom should pay him $5,000

[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:43.080]
for having to see Jackson's bear breast during the Super Bowl halftime show.

[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.000]
I think he should have paid them five grand.

[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:46.520]
Right, at least two bucks.

[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:51.200]
Stevenson, suit, and small claims court claiming as the father of three small children,

[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:54.060]
it was led to believe the halftime show would be family-oriented.

[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.620]
He accused Viacom of false advertising.

[01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:00.800]
Viacom lawyer, Jeff Hunts, says Stevenson should have instead filed a federal lawsuit

[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.880]
to complain to the FCC.

[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:06.180]
Stevenson says the real loser is the consumer because now advertisers have to

[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:09.540]
have a license to lie and get away with it.

[01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:11.420]
He's decided not to set a pillow pillow case.

[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:12.220]
Oh, man.

[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.200]
Yeah, alive.

[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:13.860]
I have no life.

[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:15.360]
Yeah, with it.

[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.540]
His three little kids saw a naked booby for a second and a half.

[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:20.220]
Man, I don't think they'll ever be able to function.

[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:22.880]
Of course, when he turns on the nightly news every night,

[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:27.080]
they see all these body parts and decapitations and every kind of crap that ever came down.

[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:27.740]
And that's okay.

[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:32.740]
He had to win them because that's real life, you see,

[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:33.820]
as opposed to like a breast.

[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:36.060]
I mean, there's nothing real about that person in her case.

[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.380]
Violence never hurt anybody.

[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:39.580]
As violence has peaked in Iraq,

[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:43.900]
it's not amazing how we just fall into this crap,

[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:45.580]
just like falling into a bucket of slop.

[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.300]
As violence has peaked in Iraq,

[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:50.740]
the army has doubled its training requirements for marksmanship,

[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:53.880]
and consequently, these 300 to 500 million more bullets

[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.080]
than it normally buys an army official city yesterday.

[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:57.860]
They're 300 million bullets short.

[01:47:58.160 --> 01:47:58.460]
Damn it.

[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:04.060]
In December, it signed contracts with two companies for 140 million,

[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:07.180]
140 million, 5.56 millimeter bullets for the M16

[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:09.660]
and in four personal rifles issued everyone in the army.

[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.240]
The contracts are worth a combined 16.2 million

[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:15.000]
of the Winchester Division of the Olin Corps

[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.980]
and is really military industries.

[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:21.360]
We have one ammunition plant that's approaching its maximum capacity

[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.240]
of 1.2 billion rounds per year,

[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:25.560]
said Major Gary Talman, an army spokesman.

[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:28.420]
That facility, the Lake City Army ammunition plant in Lake City,

[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.480]
I was run by Alliant Tech Systems.

[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:33.800]
The December contract only addresses ammunition for the rifles.

[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:37.340]
The army also needs 50 caliber and 7.62 millimeter bullets

[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:38.200]
for the heavy machine gun,

[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:40.200]
and light machine gun respectively Talman said,

[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.280]
a solicitation for these bullets is already out

[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.240]
and rewards expected to be made this summer.

[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:46.060]
Well, if they're going to wait till the summer to make an award,

[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:47.760]
they better start making them pretty damn fast, right?

[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:48.880]
Yeah.

[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:52.360]
5.670560.

[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:54.400]
You know that guy that was clearing his throat and came up with it?

[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.980]
Every time we do one of these pulls, he does the same thing.

[01:48:58.020 --> 01:48:58.780]
Just an Indian.

[01:48:59.140 --> 01:48:59.940]
Just a, yeah.

[01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:00.660]
I have no life.

[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:01.180]
I'm all wrong.

[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.420]
Just a sad old turd.

[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.600]
And there's nothing worse than a sad old turd.

[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:08.320]
Somebody QAM, hello?

[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.760]
Hey, Dale, how about looking for Mr. Goodbar?

[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:12.340]
What's sexy?

[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:16.180]
That was, was, I think, either Mary or Margo anyway.

[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.340]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:25.380]
Can I leave now?

[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.160]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:33.560]
I think with EDM, she was selling those murials.

[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.820]
Oh, and I missed that the other night biography head I saw the last ten minutes or any co-backs.

[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:38.740]
You don't know who that is.

[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:39.640]
Yeah, I heard of it.

[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:41.340]
Some old fart talked about him the other day.

[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:41.960]
He was great.

[01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:44.100]
What do you mean some old fart talked about him?

[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:44.780]
Me, of course.

[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.480]
No, certainly, Ernie co-backs was great.

[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:49.320]
He was one of the great pioneers, innovators of television.

[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.460]
He was actually a funny guy, which is very unusual.

[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:54.860]
And after he died in the car crash, he was driving too fast.

[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:56.940]
Slippery road went into a pool he died.

[01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:59.560]
Long ago, back in the 50s.

[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.400]
And anybody, ED Adams was his wife.

[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:03.680]
And of course, she was a marginal like nightclub entertainer.

[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:05.760]
And she did the white owl spots.

[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:07.620]
You know, why don't you come up and see me something?

[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:08.400]
Yeah, I know something like that.

[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.500]
You had to be there to enjoy it.

[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:11.420]
But I missed most of it and it just frosted my ass.

[01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:14.220]
So anyway, how about that Margot Henningway?

[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:16.500]
W.A.M. Hello.

[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:18.000]
Hello.

[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:18.940]
Yes, sir.

[01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:20.660]
W.Q.A.M.?

[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:22.380]
W.Q.A.M.

[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:22.840]
Yes, speaking.

[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:26.060]
Yes, I'd like to put the head something to the pole.

[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:26.880]
Go right ahead.

[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.620]
How about that movie Black Orchid?

[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.080]
I think we got it on her, don't we?

[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:35.240]
We got Wild Orchid.

[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:37.700]
We got, well, what the hell is Black Orchid?

[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.440]
That's what he's talking about, Wild Orchid.

[01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:41.620]
It's got to be what he's talking about, right?

[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:42.160]
It's got to be.

[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:43.500]
Yeah, get with it.

[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:44.320]
You don't know it.

[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:46.560]
You better get your Black and your White Straight Now, Mr. OK?

[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:49.140]
He's starting to get like, what's his name?

[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:49.840]
He's Sammy Davis.

[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:53.880]
What movie, not X-rated, is the hottest movie you've ever seen?

[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:56.140]
I don't have week 71, Body Heat 65.

[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:57.400]
We got to race this time.

[01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:01.780]

Last Hango in Paris 5, Secretary 5.

[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:28.840]
Return to the Blue Lagoon, Stolen Got 4.

[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:30.000]
It's had 4 to hold a show.

[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:31.240]
They didn't go nowhere.

[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:32.280]
Nobody saw that.

[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:35.960]
Fatal Attraction 4, Requiem 4, Dream Still Got 3,

[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:39.040]

No Mercy's Got 1, Personal Best's Got 1,

[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:49.120]
Wasn't that the Miriam Hemingway?

[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:50.560]
Right, and Dianne Keaton.

[01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:52.060]
Right, and Buster Keaton?

[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:53.900]
And Buster Crab.

[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.660]
And Buster, or I can't say that, just keep on going.

[01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:59.500]
The Sliver 1, Barbarale 1, 10 is Got 1,

[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.240]
The Endy in the Sirens Don't Have Any Out of the First Amherent 77 vote.

[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:05.500]
That's what we got so far.

[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:08.160]
WQA Am Hello.

[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:09.300]
Here I Go!

[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:11.960]
WQA Am Hello.

[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:13.800]
Found an Angel Heart.

[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:16.200]
Angel Heart and What?

[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:17.040]
Found.

[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:17.820]
Found.

[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:18.800]
Okay, I found it.

[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:21.800]
That's 1, 2, 3.

[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:23.760]
Got him.

[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:24.840]
Good Story.

[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.220]
There was no course of criticism.

[01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:28.800]
Quite to the contrary,

[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:32.680]
Cosby's remarks were embraced by several of the leading black columnists in the country,

[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:34.540]
The Wayne Wickham, Clarence Page,

[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:37.700]
Colbert King, Leonard Pitt's Jr., and Thomas Soall.

[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:40.900]
Quisey, Mufumi, I thought Wisey was on the Jefferson.

[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:41.600]
Hey, Downy.

[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:43.920]
Wisey Mufumi, the end of the LAC president,

[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:45.140]
who was on stage with Cosby,

[01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:47.200]
said later that not only did he agree with Cosby,

[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:49.440]
not only did he make similar points in his own speeches,

[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:52.860]
but they did just heard the same points made by philosophers in his Barbar shop.

[01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:56.920]
If you would listen to talk radio or read newspapers stories about the flat,

[01:52:57.060 --> 01:52:58.860]
you'd think Cosby was hiding from a raging mob,

[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:02.000]
but there was no mob, there was a straw mob, a phony flap.

[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:05.360]
I combed the internet to wires in the transcripts for attacks on Cosby,

[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:06.260]
and came up empty.

[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:09.720]
I did discover that the head of the NWACP Legal Defense Fund,

[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:12.940]
Theodore Shaw, spoke after Cosby at the commemoration and pointed out

[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:15.360]
that many problems black's face are not self-inflicted,

[01:53:15.620 --> 01:53:17.360]
and that most of the people on welfare aren't black.

[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:19.360]
That's hardly a searing condemnation.

[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:23.120]
The New York Times managed to find a scholar named Michael Eric Dyson,

[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:24.240]
who said Cosby's comment,

[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:26.640]
be-treat classicist, elitist viewpoints,

[01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:29.360]
that are rooted in generational warfare, whatever that means.

[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:33.520]
I also managed to find some rather mild rebuffs of Cosby from three black columnists

[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.320]
in St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Pittsburgh,

[01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:37.860]
Eugene came to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Road,

[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:40.800]
sometimes beating up on defenseless people as just being a bully.

[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:43.600]
Cosby called came up and came wrote a second column,

[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:46.160]
further qualifying his already qualified jibes.

[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:49.040]
So yes, Cosby fielded a couple of tough grounders

[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:51.200]
and did issue a press release defending himself,

[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:53.160]
but overall his remarks were well received,

[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:54.880]
and his courage was widely praised.

[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:58.460]
I'm taking your time with this to make a couple of points, right, Stigmeyer.

[01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:02.360]
There's too much political correctness, and the perpetrator's rarely admitted,

[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:06.200]
and nowhere is this more destructive than in talking about the emotional subject of race,

[01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:08.800]
a subject too often avoided for fear of offending.

[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:12.440]
That said, the power of the PC police is grossly overestimated.

[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:14.760]
Conservative talk-mysers and curmudgeons

[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:18.500]
make good livings exaggerating the omnipotence and silliness of the virtue crats,

[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:19.660]
as this case study shows.

[01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:23.300]
Worse, the mainstream media, politicians, and water cooler philosophers

[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:26.040]
have an enormously exaggerated fear of the PC police.

[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:30.720]
In researching the Cosby flat, for example, I didn't find a column by a white writer.

[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.520]
I'm sure there were some that I missed, but I'm also sure that plenty of white writers or editors

[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:38.720]
simply avoid waiting in this altogether because it's perceived too risky,

[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:40.980]
too easy to be accused of prejudice or meddling.

[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:44.260]
I'll get plenty of nasty mail, I'll be called upon of liberal bias,

[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:48.800]
as a capitalist tool, and a blinkered white man with no business budding in, so what?

[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:53.960]
The exaggerated, security-cat fear of the PC police on the left and the conservative cops on the right

[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:57.380]
is one of the dynamics that helps remove race and problems of blacks in America

[01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:59.160]
from the front burner of public debate.

[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.860]
Candidates don't like to talk about it, newspapers don't like to investigate it,

[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:06.440]
columnists don't like to write about it, network newscast don't like to cover it,

[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:10.140]
think tanks don't like to issue reports about it, and celebrities don't like to speak out on it.

[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:15.140]
So the issues become even more buried, Pimp rap goes on criticized, schools stay bad.

[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:19.540]
I hope the phony flat gave wider coverage to Cosby's remarks than they would have had otherwise,

[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:23.320]
and I hope more people with pulpits realize that the boogie man of political correctness

[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:26.340]
and racial censorship is not so scary after all,

[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:28.780]
both Dick Myron, CBS News on their website, not bad, huh?

[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:29.460]
Let's go Dick.

[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:31.500]
You go, Dick, and you go Bill.

[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.920]
I mean, you go, and you go Bill, I can't say.

[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.780]
Can't say that no more, okay?

[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:40.200]
Or you'll be in big and deep doodoo.

[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:41.000]
Okay, got that.

[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:41.640]
Right.

[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:44.600]
21 till 1 at 5.62 a.m.

[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:46.220]
Line in logo.

[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:50.240]
Here's sports radio 5.60, she's UAM.

[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:53.520]
Absolutely.

[01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:57.520]
Welcome.

[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:02.600]
Got an inside ball street tip.

[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:08.040]
Now she's gonna pay for it.

[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:09.980]
Cherry says she lied.

[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.100]
They found her guilty.

[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.220]
Facing lots of time.

[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:20.100]
I must say it feels me to see her take it out of the cup.

[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:20.540]
Ow!

[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:24.480]
20 years won't be enough.

[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:29.640]
Dress her up and strife, send her to sing sing.

[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:35.080]
Put her in for life, that would be a good thing, oh Martha.

[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.420]
Well, they catch her for insider training.

[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:40.180]
Yeah.

[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:43.780]
And they'll send you away, oh Martha.

[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:47.960]
Well, we're laughing so hard and we're shaking.

[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:52.400]
Once you stop with today, oh Martha.

[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.000]
With you had everything, with you squandering.

[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:00.940]
Yeah, send you away, oh Martha.

[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:05.740]
You'll be sharing her stain, they're still doing this.

[01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:08.300]
With you, Selma.

[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:16.020]
Now the reason I played that, which I do like it a lot though, is the new inquired June 7th issue,

[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:17.100]
which you'll get in a couple of weeks.

[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.820]
Martha was framed as the cover story.

[01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:21.540]
Why are the governments obligator?

[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:26.180]
And also I just noticed on the front cover, a lot of things that you ordinarily don't even look at.

[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:33.100]
America's deadliest internet killer found victims online and the guy's got a picture of this guy.

[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:36.400]
Yeah, he looks exactly like Tom Jicke.

[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:37.720]
He's funny stupid.

[01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:41.720]
Yeah, Tom must have an identical twin whose America's deadliest internet killer.

[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:43.000]
Do you know that?

[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:43.860]
I had no idea.

[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:44.680]
You didn't know.

[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:50.400]
And then it's got stars with the best and worst beach bodies, the good, the bad and the really ugly.

[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.680]
If you could see Toby McGuire, Spider-Man.

[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:53.340]
No, thank you.

[01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:54.140]
He's, huh?

[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:55.300]
I said no, thank you.

[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:56.620]
Okay, here's Uma Thurman.

[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:57.700]
She's looking pretty good.

[01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:58.160]
Yeah.

[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:02.200]
But here is, in fact, let me find that section.

[01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:02.680]
Oh my god.

[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:04.740]
But don't let me forget the Martha stuff.

[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:05.300]
Okay.

[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:06.400]
I'm not going to read the whole article.

[01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:07.340]
It's long.

[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:09.720]
There's nothing else to miss anyway.

[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:10.980]
Nothing else to read.

[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:11.620]
Bad inquire.

[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:12.820]
Save your money.

[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.800]
Where the hell is the beach people?

[01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:15.680]
Oh, man.

[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:16.220]
Oh, here you go.

[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:16.680]
Oh.

[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:19.840]
Rick Akisek.

[01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:21.640]
Rick O'Kasey.

[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:24.100]
Rick O'Kasey.

[01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:25.120]
Yes, he's okay.

[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:26.820]
Rick O'Kasey.

[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:27.460]
Is that his name?

[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:28.020]
I never heard of him.

[01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:28.820]
I know who he is.

[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:30.140]
I mean, I see him and I recognize him.

[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:31.000]
I know his last name.

[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:33.500]
Anyway, he's formerly the Iraq group, the carist.

[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.240]
Rick Akisek.

[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:38.340]
Okay, so he's a...

[01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:38.340]

[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:40.980]
Man, oh man.

[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:44.520]
He looks like he's spent at least three months in Dakao.

[01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:45.920]
Yeah, he is in Banshee.

[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:46.440]
He always has been.

[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:48.160]
Here's Justin Tinkerbell.

[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:49.920]
Oh, jeez.

[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:51.120]
Man, what a...

[01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:54.180]
Camera Diaz.

[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:55.740]
Looking terrible.

[01:58:56.220 --> 01:58:56.420]
Okay.

[01:58:57.460 --> 01:58:58.120]
I'm just telling you.

[01:58:59.000 --> 01:58:59.740]
Oh, yeah, whatever.

[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:03.840]
It says in you thought she looked bad and shrek.

[01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:07.760]
I mean, she don't look too good there to me.

[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:08.940]
Chelsea Clinton.

[01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:10.260]
Oh, brother.

[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:17.040]
Bruce Willis was quite frankly for you.

[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:18.860]
Chopped his head off, he wouldn't look all that bad.

[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:22.360]
Told me McGuire, who's like, what else was he?

[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:24.060]
And Spider-Man wasn't in that the...

[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:25.520]
The seabiscuit, right?

[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:26.320]
Right.

[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:27.420]
He played the jockey.

[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:30.740]
Oh, he's got an overhang.

[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:32.260]
It's just that you wouldn't believe it.

[01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:33.360]
Holy Christ.

[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:36.340]
Paris Hilton and they got an ass-end look at her.

[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:37.900]
Yeah, voting.

[01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:41.260]
It says we're all focusing on her butt and so is gravity.

[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:45.500]
Yeah, her ass is down where her knees are supposed to be.

[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:46.220]
That's amazing.

[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:49.220]
Charlie's there on, impeccable looking and just fine.

[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:50.480]
You go, girl.

[01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:52.060]
Yeah, she's looking good.

[01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:53.440]
I thought there was...

[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:53.800]
Oh, yeah, here.

[01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:56.720]
Oh, oh, she's Sarah Ferguson, man.

[01:59:56.820 --> 01:59:58.460]
She better get back to the old Weight Watchers.

[01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:01.700]
She's got cottage cheese thighs, legs were which even the people

[02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:02.740]
had boarded and never saw.

[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:03.680]
That's what he hears here.

[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:04.500]
Why?

[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:05.780]
She's British and 80.

[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:07.220]
Oh, I see.

[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:09.200]
Well, what's the name of the videos excuse?

[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.280]
She's American in 90.

[02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:10.760]
Right.

[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:12.860]
Talk about a beach ball.

[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:15.180]
He'd have been good in the other prisoner.

[02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:16.440]
He could have played that what the rover.

[02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:17.700]
Wow.

[02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:20.820]
Here's Johnny Depp who isn't really looking all that good in this picture.

[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:21.860]
I hate to say he's...

[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:23.760]
We're compared to these people who are expecting...

[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:26.180]
Star Jones who's got an ass-like afraid train.

[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:27.540]
Wow.

[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:28.380]
The rest of her tip.

[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:29.360]
It says it's official.

[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:30.680]
Her fiance is not gay.

[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:31.380]
He's blind.

[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:33.860]
Oh.

[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:36.160]
Here's another one of the...

[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:38.920]
They have these judges that they invited to make comments.

[02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:40.360]
It says, what can I say?

[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:41.820]
I expected Al Roker to be thinner.

[02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:42.420]
Isn't that Al?

[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:45.840]
Here's Beyonce and Oles.

[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:47.400]
Nothing wrong to say about that.

[02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:53.100]
Here's Jack Nicholson who's got breasts and bigger than Beyonce by a long shot.

[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:54.060]
Oh, brother.

[02:00:54.620 --> 02:00:55.180]
Uma Thurman.

[02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:56.900]
Did we already have Uma Thurman?

[02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:58.080]
Yes, I had her.

[02:00:58.640 --> 02:00:59.000]
Oh.

[02:00:59.100 --> 02:00:59.480]
I wish.

[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:00.500]
Looking good.

[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:02.400]
Heather Graham.

[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.080]
Looking just fine.

[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:04.340]
Good.

[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:06.380]
Jack Osborne.

[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:08.720]
Covering up his boobies in the man.

[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:09.100]
Oh man.

[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:09.960]
What a perfect...

[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:10.620]
Ted Kennedy.

[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:11.860]
Who's got...

[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:12.920]
He's just all booby.

[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:14.780]
Wow.

[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.580]
He is just a mess.

[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:19.380]
He's also like 80 years old.

[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:21.700]
It says, if only they made slim fast with vodka.

[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:24.260]
Too much talent.

[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:25.700]
Wow.

[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:26.280]
Anyway.

[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:27.040]
So there's...

[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:28.440]
That's worth the going on in Biden for.

[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:30.660]
Now, getting back to a poor Martha.

[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:35.020]
Martha Stewart was framed by the government, which is not to get her at any cost or she'd say,

[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:36.820]
this is in the enquirer, so it might be right.

[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:43.120]
A key prosecution witness has been arrested for lying under oath and the top attorneys tell the enquirer,

[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:47.360]
this shocking development gives the domestic diva powerful new ammunition to overturn her conviction.

[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:53.640]
The government wants Martha behind bars so they can make an example of a rich powerful woman sources told the enquirer,

[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:55.400]
but this fights about to get even rougher.

[02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:02.180]
Martha's tool, French, is considering a $1 billion lawsuit against the government for practically destroying the empire.

[02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:11.180]
She took decades to build enquirers learned exclusively and are behind the scenes investigation found that the prospect of a new trial has brought the 62 year old domestic diva back from the darkest,

[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:14.200]
fattest corners of the sphere and renewed her fighting spirit.

[02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:20.380]
I told you I was framed Martha told a friend upon discovering false statements allegedly been made on the witness stand by Larry F. Stewart,

[02:02:20.380 --> 02:02:28.100]
a secret service forensics live director, and the friend told the enquirer the government was out to get Martha because she's one of the America's richest, most powerful women.

[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:30.660]
They wanted to make an example of her and that's exactly what they did.

[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:32.740]
Like Eric Hyl says nobody likes to bridge bitch.

[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.140]
And so they aren't to nail her ass.

[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:39.000]
Meanwhile OG is walking around on a loose.

[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:41.220]
Kenny Lay, he's walking around on a loose.

[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:43.640]
All these other corporate crooks, they're walking around loose.

[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:47.320]
And poor Martha, they want to put her in there to cook and kick for the inmates.

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.720]
I like that.

[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:49.540]
Those bastards.

[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:50.880]
Damn it.

[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:55.340]
Anyway, here's how to pull is coming, which movie not x rated is the hottest you've ever seen.

[02:02:55.720 --> 02:03:04.100]
And so far we have a modest total of 440 votes, but then again, who now cares so far you got 9.5 weeks 82 pulling away.

[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:17.920]
Body heat 70 while things 42 show girls 37 the blue lagoon 29 basic instincts 26 monsters ball 21 eyes wide shut 17 to moon junction 14.

[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:28.400]
Unfaithful 13 the story of 10 embrace of the vampire 8 hunger seven summer lovers 7 wild orchard 7 and it's a small potatoes after that.

[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:34.820]
Fade of traction 6 colligula 5 last thing one pairs 5 secretary 5 and the down from there.

[02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:39.060]
Returned a blue lagoon still got 4. It's had 4 since we sat down here, you know, right?

[02:03:39.060 --> 02:03:47.080]
That's doing real well. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon were of us line WQA and hello.

[02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:55.100]
Yes, I was just calling to comment on the thing that Neil was talking about the second ago, Rico casick.

[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:55.820]
Right.

[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:04.240]
If you can mention it that Rico casick is married to the model Paulina Periscova.

[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:06.040]
Oh my God.

[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:06.500]
Wow.

[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.780]
Is she also blind?

[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:10.040]
I think so.

[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:10.760]
Evidently.

[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:11.800]
Okay. Thanks for the bad news.

[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:12.300]
Thanks.

[02:04:12.980 --> 02:04:13.880]
Oh, brother Rico.

[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:15.460]
Okay, so he must have the big box, huh?

[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:16.840]
Or maybe he's just got a lot of nice cars.

[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:18.020]
Well, he's got big feet.

[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:23.940]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 just keep walking away from that line.

[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:26.080]
I'm telling you right now, just dance away from it.

[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:29.480]
That's right. Walk away real fast as fast as you can.

[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:31.100]
That's my best advice.

[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:33.400]
WQA and hello.

[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:34.520]
Hi, Neil.

[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:35.480]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:36.080]
Uh, yes.

[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:40.380]
You read a story about the military is running out ammunition.

[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.100]
Correct.

[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:48.620]
And I was just wondering why doesn't the government issue some of those massive bullets like the one that Oswald used to kill Kennedy?

[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:49.320]
Right.

[02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:50.060]
Man, that's right.

[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:51.640]
Then we can get two or three of the price of one.

[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:52.660]
That's a good excellent point.

[02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:53.380]
Save all that money.

[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:53.860]
Right.

[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:54.460]
Thank you.

[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:55.120]
Excellent.

[02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:55.700]
Thank you.

[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:56.280]
You're hired.

[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:59.680]
She's replacing Condoleez and actual security advisories next week.

[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:01.940]
Some of the magic bullets.

[02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:07.260]
We're going to call Arlen Specter right now in Pennsylvania and see if he can't start working on it and the bullets too.

[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:09.880]
You're right.

[02:05:09.980 --> 02:05:10.680]
It's just like magic.

[02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:12.920]
You know, it went off in this direction and then it came.

[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:22.540]
Went up in mid-air and then went down through to John Conley's arm and his hand and his wrist and but I hope you turn it off against the sidewalk and up in the air and all these other things.

[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:24.660]
They're all kinds of magic tricks.

[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:28.140]
And then landed right on that stretcher in almost pristine condition.

[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:29.820]
I just out of nowhere.

[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:32.780]
There was a bullet on the stretcher that didn't have a dang thing on it either.

[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:36.280]
It was a clean machine.

[02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:42.540]
5.670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:44.780]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:46.040]
Hello, here.

[02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:46.860]
Yes, sir.

[02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:47.800]
How's it going?

[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:48.460]
Great.

[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:50.420]
I got something for the fool.

[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:51.240]
Yes.

[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:52.520]
Scorned.

[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:53.720]
Scorned.

[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:56.780]
It's about a kid.

[02:05:56.940 --> 02:05:57.600]
He's in high school.

[02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:58.860]
His dad gets him a hot tutor.

[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:05.260]
Well, you know, she takes care of him and then she takes care of dad and there's a huge fight between dad and son for her.

[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:08.560]
Sounds like her kind of movie, man.

[02:06:08.620 --> 02:06:09.480]
Well, rush right out and get it.

[02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:10.120]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:14.140]
I'll speak into that kind of a movie, you two.

[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.560]
Speaking of that, what about my tutor?

[02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:17.380]
Yeah.

[02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:19.780]
Now, who is she that played in that movie?

[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.000]
Oh, I forget her name.

[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:21.920]
Oh, time.

[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:23.500]
We know Matt LaPanzi played in it.

[02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:24.320]
Karen's something, rather.

[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:25.640]
I'll find it.

[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:26.940]
No, I'll get it.

[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:31.460]
I got it right here in my big 4,000 pound book.

[02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:33.180]
I might as well make use of this thing.

[02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:35.380]
It cost me about $400 million to buy this.

[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:36.880]
Let's see.

[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:44.560]
Murphy's Law, Murphy's Romance, my family, my favorite blonde, my life with a bush bag, my tutor, Karen K.

[02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:45.740]
Oh.

[02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:49.800]
Matt LaPanzi, Kevin McCarthy, who played his daddy.

[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:51.740]
Clark Brandon, I forgot about him.

[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:53.240]
I used to like Clark Brandon a lot.

[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:59.580]
Bruce Bough, for obvious reasons, Bruce Bougher, Arlene Galanica, and Crispin Glover.

[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:01.680]
You know what?

[02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:02.860]
I thought we were really funny in that movie.

[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:06.320]
The house, the gardener, and the maid, right.

[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:06.860]

[02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:08.540]
We kept pretending that he'll speak English.

[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:10.320]
That was sensational.

[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:12.060]
It was a good movie.

[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:13.660]
Not wrong with it at all, for any.

[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:14.580]
I thought it was very hot.

[02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:16.780]
I thought she was just fine.

[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:18.680]
I was her name and Karen K.

[02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:20.960]
Her amazing talent, both of them.

[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:21.540]
Right.

[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:26.440]
And the lovely Matt LaPanzi, who certainly was a lot prettier than she was, I thought, but never left.

[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:29.660]
He was very do-alive. He's Newton Johns, once upon a time.

[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:30.140]
It was really.

[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:32.640]
And then all of a sudden, he got hit by that ugly stick.

[02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:33.640]
And wow, wow, wow.

[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:35.420]
And of course, she got hit by that bull-dike stick.

[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:37.500]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:37.920]
Look at that.

[02:07:37.940 --> 02:07:39.560]
Michael Jackson trial, they said, four.

[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:40.380]
Oh, what did that say?

[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:41.240]
What did that say?

[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:42.940]
I didn't see it.

[02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:43.560]
I was scared.

[02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:45.940]
Oh, but did it say March 13th?

[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:46.500]
I missed it.

[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:46.880]
Sorry.

[02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:47.780]
It was on.

[02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:50.140]
They put it on her so dang fast just in.

[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:56.780]
Be a vice presidential candidate with John Kerry, formed kind of a bipartisan juggernaut.

[02:07:57.380 --> 02:07:58.880]
Any truth to that at all?

[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:05.520]
I spent several years in the North Vietnamese prison camp in the dark, bed with scraps.

[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.680]
Do you think I want to do that all over again?

[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:08.400]
Is vice president?

[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:12.120]
There's a can.

[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:13.680]
Yuckin' it up with Conan.

[02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:14.740]
Who wrote that line?

[02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:17.140]
Yeah, that's a moderately amusing.

[02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:18.600]
Now they're keeping this crap on there forever.

[02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:19.600]
We had the day of the mile.

[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:20.580]
We'll get it for you.

[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:23.360]
Because I know everybody is sitting on the edge of their pantaloons right now waiting.

[02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:25.380]
WQA, hello.

[02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:26.920]
5, 60.

[02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:28.460]
What is it?

[02:08:28.540 --> 02:08:29.140]
5, 60.

[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:30.460]
WQA, you got it.

[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:31.120]
Hello?

[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:31.980]
Yes, sir.

[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:34.420]
Uncle Neil, I got a speech rep for you.

[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:35.180]
Okay.

[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.960]
The stretch of 836 between the palmetal and the term bike, there's like 12 speakers.

[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:42.400]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:42.700]
I'm going to be peaking.

[02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:46.360]
There are both people over mad, so I just wanted to learn all our listeners.

[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:47.920]
Thanks for the bad news, pal.

[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.620]
Are you wearing a, well, shins, or what else, please?

[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:50.380]
Yes.

[02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:52.040]
A little eye-fner action.

[02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:53.620]
Okay, you got it.

[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:54.500]
Have a great weekend, Mike.

[02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:55.120]
See you, too.

[02:08:56.100 --> 02:08:57.160]
They're out there everywhere, man.

[02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:58.360]
They're out there, Antonio.

[02:08:59.040 --> 02:08:59.600]
Slow down.

[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:00.780]
Or else you're going to be just like Josh.

[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:01.880]
Your ass is going to be in court.

[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:04.140]
They're going to say court cost in about 150 bucks.

[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:06.920]
And your first born child and all of these to all of that crap.

[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:08.680]
Right?

[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:09.360]
Right.

[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:10.400]
Is that what it was?

[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:10.880]
Is that love shirts?

[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:12.660]
Now, when I was just here, what were you doing?

[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:14.740]
Like about 75 in the school zone, something like that?

[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:15.220]
Yeah.

[02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:17.680]
Oh, that's not too bad.

[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:20.480]
Probably the one right up the street there.

[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:22.380]
They could wrote him a book of tickets.

[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:23.480]
I see.

[02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:25.400]
Yeah, they hooked me with the whole seat belt and...

[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:28.060]
Well, didn't you do the ticket defense team thing?

[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:28.600]
I did.

[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:30.240]
And court cost.

[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:30.800]
Court cost.

[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:31.820]
That's it.

[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:35.360]
Like I said, you're the best Randy Maltars ticket defense team, baby.

[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:36.000]
Hi.

[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:37.480]
And look out.

[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.500]
This is 420 by 16.

[02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:41.760]
You're way, way, way, yeah.

[02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:45.840]
Boy, it's the one to two hour.

[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:49.200]
Sorry, I told you.

[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:50.780]
Don't bother me while I'm in here.

[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:51.340]
I, sir.

[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:52.680]
Hello?

[02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:54.140]
It's Mickey Mouse.

[02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:56.580]
Oh, Mr. Mouse, good morning.

[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:57.340]
How are you?

[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.200]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:01.980]
Nothing, sir.

[02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:03.620]
You're freaking killing me.

[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:04.420]
No, I'm not.

[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:07.020]
I got David Kelly calling me every three minutes.

[02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:09.440]
Why did we move the practice?

[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:11.420]
Sir, you told me to move the practice.

[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:12.640]
I didn't tell you anything.

[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:14.080]
You must have misunderstood me.

[02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:15.140]
No, sir.

[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:17.240]
You said move the practice to Monday.

[02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:19.060]
Hey, hey, listen, butt wipe.

[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:20.180]
I'm the boss.

[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.500]
I make the decisions.

[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:22.740]
You take the heat.

[02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:23.120]
Right.

[02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:24.840]
You move the practice.

[02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:25.580]
Okay.

[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:27.220]
How are we going with it anyway?

[02:10:27.420 --> 02:10:28.760]
Oh, you man.

[02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:29.640]
Hold on.

[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:30.380]
What are you doing?

[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:32.180]
Reminds me.

[02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:32.660]
Yeah, boss.

[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:35.000]
Shut the hell up.

[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.800]
I'm on the phone, Remus.

[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:37.580]
Hi, sir.

[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.420]
Yes, sir. What was your question?

[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:40.620]
I'm killing you.

[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:43.860]
I'm going crazy over here between David Kelly

[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:46.780]
and now Michael Jackson calling me every three minutes.

[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:48.940]
I'm going to go out of my freaking mind.

[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:50.840]
Hold on.

[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:52.040]
Remus!

[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:53.860]
Get in here, you boss.

[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:55.140]
Stop it, Remus!

[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:57.000]
I'm going to stop.

[02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:58.120]
Stop, stop.

[02:10:58.340 --> 02:10:59.240]
Stop the floor, Remus.

[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:00.820]
Remus!

[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:03.320]
It's like this in my hand, Remus.

[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:04.860]
That's your penis, boss.

[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:06.540]
My other hand, Remus.

[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:08.600]
That's the phone, boss.

[02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:08.980]
Right.

[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.280]
I can't hear anything, Remus.

[02:11:11.580 --> 02:11:12.740]
Stop slowing the floor.

[02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:13.360]
Sorry.

[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:14.580]
I think, sir.

[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:17.080]
The moves are working out very well.

[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:19.820]
The practice is fourth and it's time swat and...

[02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:19.840]
What?

[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:21.160]
You think it's time swat?

[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:23.420]
Please, are we even beating the WB?

[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:24.280]
Fairly.

[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:25.780]
Oh, my God.

[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:28.040]
Michael Jackson thing was a rating success.

[02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:30.760]
But hold on a second.

[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:32.520]
Remus!

[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:33.600]
That's the book.

[02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:38.200]
What's a hell you're doing with a harmonica?

[02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:40.800]
Remus, don't play it, Remus.

[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.640]
I'll jam that thing down your throat.

[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:45.160]
Get the food burn away from me.

[02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:46.620]
Oh, come on, Blue Moon.

[02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:48.300]
I'm allergic.

[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:49.620]
I, sir.

[02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:52.500]
Sir, over 25 million people saw...

[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:53.260]
Shut up, I, sir.

[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:54.160]
Listen.

[02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:55.580]
You see me?

[02:11:55.740 --> 02:11:56.400]
What I'm doing here?

[02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:58.300]
Sir, you're on the phone.

[02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:00.420]
I know I'm on the phone.

[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:01.560]
Do you see what I'm doing?

[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.520]
You're an imagination for crying out loud.

[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:06.820]
I'm moving my hands up and down.

[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:07.200]
I'm fine.

[02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:08.580]
I'm the puppet master.

[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:10.020]
I say it.

[02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:10.920]
You do it.

[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:15.220]
Now Fox is going to air all the stuff that you cut out of a Michael Jackson interview.

[02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:19.660]
But, sir, you told me to edit out all that stuff to make him laugh at me.

[02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:22.580]
Puppet master, me.

[02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:24.140]
Idiot!

[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:25.440]
Oh.

[02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:30.680]
Riever!

[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:31.940]
Yes, you're right.

[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:33.820]
What's our hell are you doing now?

[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:35.300]
Listen to the flow, boss.

[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:37.200]
It's nothing wrong with the floor, Remus.

[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:38.360]
What's this in my ear?

[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:39.980]
That's your penis, boss.

[02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:41.640]
My other ear, Remus.

[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:43.540]
That's the phone, boss.

[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:44.740]
That's the phone, Remus.

[02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:45.240]
Get out.

[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:46.440]
Get out of the way.

[02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:47.140]
Get out.

[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:48.300]
I, sir.

[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:48.900]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:49.440]
Kill me.

[02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:50.980]
Kill me.

[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:52.100]
I'm sorry, sir.

[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:53.040]
Kill me.

[02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:53.940]
Sorry.

[02:12:54.260 --> 02:12:54.760]
Kill me.

[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:55.100]
I'm sorry.

[02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:56.640]
Kill me.

[02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:57.040]
Kill me.

[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:57.040]

[02:12:57.960 --> 02:12:59.160]
104 at 560.

[02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:01.000]
It's our man with ads again and one and two.

[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:03.360]
I don't forget George will be working on Monday, even on a holiday.

[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:05.120]
Hardest work in show on radio.

[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:07.000]
Even harder than Tom Joyner.

[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:08.680]
He, wait.

[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:09.120]
The night shock.

[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:11.400]
Well, my, oh, he's terrible.

[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:12.580]
Remember the day that he came in?

[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:13.480]
You probably don't remember it.

[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:13.900]
I would do.

[02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:17.660]
And I was in a production studio and he came in with his entourage, dear.

[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:20.480]
And I was just wrapping up whatever I was recording in there.

[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:23.360]
And the man they acted like, what are you doing in here?

[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:23.780]
Why boy?

[02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:24.880]
Just get out of here real fast.

[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:25.540]
That kind of crap.

[02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:26.820]
I just, I flew out of there.

[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:27.560]
Yeah.

[02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:28.720]
I thought he would fly.

[02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:29.060]
Yeah.

[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:30.720]
I did fly.

[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:33.700]
Anyway, in fact, there are a lot of us in the business who can fly.

[02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:36.960]
And the federal officials speaking of that, what another great segway you won't believe

[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:37.500]
this story.

[02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:41.080]
The headline, terror threat boost US airport security.

[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:43.520]
Man, we must, I must have a horseshoe slipped into me somewhere.

[02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:46.020]
I know, Duff said he's got, he's got one himself.

[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:46.500]
Correct him.

[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:47.340]
Attention, man.

[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:52.080]
The federal official in charge of the nation's airports in today's security has been stepped

[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:57.220]
up a notch in the face of renewed terror warnings this holiday weekend and said authorities

[02:13:57.220 --> 02:13:58.800]
are asking the public to be vigilant.

[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:04.060]
If they see anything unusual reported and unattended package, something that just doesn't

[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:08.740]
look right, even odd behavior in the terminal around the aircraft, FAA administrator Miriam

[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:11.440]
Blakey said on the, today show this morning on NBNC.

[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:16.740]
She said photographs of seven suspected terrorist released Wednesday by the FBI are everywhere,

[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:19.180]
even though two of them are dead and some may be in prison.

[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:21.820]
And that, no, it's the other way around.

[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:25.880]
And that screeners have been redeployed to some of the busiest airports in anticipation of heavy

[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:26.960]
memorial day holiday travel.

[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:30.460]
Let me just say one good thing about my international airport, okay?

[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:32.280]
Yeah.

[02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:33.700]
They're doing a good job.

[02:14:34.060 --> 02:14:34.600]
They really are.

[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:35.260]
Oh, okay.

[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:35.560]
Wow.

[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:38.640]
Well, I see you didn't think I was going to ever say something like that.

[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:42.960]
I mean, no, they've been rated as being one of the very best over these past couple of years since

[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:44.620]
all the horrendous crap has been going on.

[02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:45.520]
And they really are.

[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:46.440]
They're doing a damn good job.

[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:47.180]
They're very thorough.

[02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:51.580]
They're more thorough than, you know, I got, I was in the airport in Copenhagen in Amsterdam,

[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:55.040]
which they're very lax in where else was in Rome.

[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:59.640]
Although they do stand around in a very menacing way still with their Uzi's under shoulders in Rome.

[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:00.940]
That's always been like that.

[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:02.380]
Just a whole bunch of them.

[02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:06.320]
And Toronto here, which comes to come, see, come saw.

[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:08.400]
But boy, in Miami, they are really very thorough.

[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:11.500]
And they make the thing with the shoes off and the whole deal, you know?

[02:15:13.060 --> 02:15:13.800]
I'm serious.

[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:15.280]
They really are doing a good job.

[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:17.900]
See, far be it for me to always be Mr. Negative.

[02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:20.980]
I know you like that a lot better, especially those people most picking, which is the airport.

[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:26.000]
But anyway, with 200 million people expected to fly over to some months, 200 million.

[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:30.240]
They said a number of things that travelers can do to make their trips easier and quicker.

[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:35.220]
One of the first things I do is go to my PDA or telephone because now we have a brand new service,

[02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:39.500]
www.fa.gov slash wireless.

[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:41.380]
Oh, everybody will remember that.

[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:44.520]
And you can go on there and actually pick up what the story is.

[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:45.580]
It's a rare port before you go.

[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:46.380]
She said on NBC.

[02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:47.800]
Are you running in any ground?

[02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:48.220]
The Lays?

[02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:49.380]
Is there whether to be aware of?

[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:52.560]
In fact, you can go on your specific airline and see what the story is on the flight.

[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:53.300]
What's the story?

[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:55.600]
It lets you schedule your room or in control.

[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:59.160]
And it really does give you a way of understanding the situation rather than just getting there and saying,

[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:00.200]
what's going on?

[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:02.500]
Is that what you always say when you go to the airport?

[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:03.420]
That's what I always say.

[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:04.400]
I walk in and...

[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:05.120]
What's going on?

[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:07.800]
And they all look at me like, oh, he must be one of the terrorists.

[02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:13.060]
The same information is available on the regular FAA Internet site for people not using wireless devices,

[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:15.740]
such as a personal digital assistant or cell phone, etc.

[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.700]
PDA, Yadi, Yadi, all of these things.

[02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:20.740]
I don't know if I'm going to take any calls this hour because I got a lot of important stuff.

[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:26.120]
I realized that there were a few people that care, not too many.

[02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:26.920]
Not too many.

[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:28.040]
I just... I got let's see.

[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:29.180]
One, I got some stuff here.

[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:29.560]
I want to read.

[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:31.040]
Okay, and I don't really care if anybody likes it.

[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:32.000]
I'm going to do it for myself.

[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:32.540]
All right.

[02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:36.820]
No, you know, Eric Altherman who wrote the liberal media, huh?

[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:37.800]
Not personally, no.

[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:40.160]
Oh, well anyway, Eric sends his best.

[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:42.940]
Hawks eating crow.

[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:45.740]
I think all of these are on a website, so if you don't...

[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:48.360]
If you want to go somewhere else, be my guest, but I'm going to read them anyway.

[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:50.000]
Hawks eating crow.

[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:50.900]
I like that one.

[02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:54.000]
The Bush administration has not made it easy on its supporters.

[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:57.400]
David Brooks now admits that he was gripped with a childish fantasy about Iraq.

[02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:00.160]
Tucker Carlson is ashamed and enraged at himself.

[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:03.940]
Tom Friedman admitting to being a little slow as finally off the reservation.

[02:17:03.940 --> 02:17:08.920]
Diehard Republican publicist Bill Crystal admits of Bush he did drive us into a ditch.

[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:14.180]
The Neocon fanthicist and sometimes Republican speech writer Mark Helper in complaints on

[02:17:14.180 --> 02:17:18.120]
the Wall Street Journal editorial page, the movement's probda, of the inescapable fact

[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:22.020]
that the war has been run incompetently with an apparently deliberate content for history,

[02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:25.940]
strategy and thought, and with too little regard for the American soldier whose mouth

[02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:29.800]
and casualties seem to have no effect on the boastfulness of the civilian leadership.

[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:35.380]
Most of the regretful Hawks blame the administration for its failure to execute what they consider a noble endeavor.

[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:41.120]
But it is a noble endeavor only in the way that would be noble to give all your money to one of those deposed Ethiopian princesses

[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:44.700]
who'll figure inbox would please descend them on your money for a guarantee of future riches.

[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:48.620]
In other words, yes, while it might have been nice to liberate Iraq from Sodom clutches,

[02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:53.480]
it was a lot more likely that under Bush-Chainy Rumsfeld company, we would end up arresting innocent people,

[02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:58.180]
holding them without trial and systematically torturing and sexually humiliating them all the while saying,

[02:17:58.180 --> 02:18:03.820]
as the Daily Shaw shows Rob Cordray put it so brilliantly, remember it's not important that we did torture those people,

[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.840]
what's important is that we're not the kind of people who would torture those people.

[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:16.620]
As the Daily Shows Rob Cordray so brilliantly put it, remember it's not important that we did torture these people,

[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:19.720]
what's important is that we are not the kind of people who would torture these people.

[02:18:20.300 --> 02:18:24.540]
Right, take a look at the sequence of events leading to the revelations about the

[02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:27.300]
Abu Gharrab scandal in the New Yorker.

[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:31.760]
It began to see more Hersch notes with Rumsfeld's desire to extract information from informants

[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:34.760]
about the location of certain high-value targets in Afghanistan,

[02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:38.600]
along with his unwillingness to apply the terms of the Geneva conventions to prisoners,

[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:40.160]
captured in the war on terrorism.

[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:44.460]
Next came the Baton Switch application in Iraq of tactics drawn from the war on terrorism,

[02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:48.120]
upon which Bush and his administration had based their entire case for offensive war.

[02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:53.100]
Add to this to be fusual to provide the military with sufficient manpower resources

[02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:56.920]
to carry out the necessary task of the occupation and through an unwillingness to use

[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:01.380]
what one former official quoted by Hersch terms recycled hillbillies, untrained,

[02:19:01.620 --> 02:19:05.960]
inexperienced, and overworked in a military prison located inside a hostile fire zone with

[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:08.980]
rogue interrogators and virtually no nighttime supervision.

[02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:10.400]
Abu Gharrab, right.

[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:13.640]
All of this made something like what eventually took place at the...

[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:14.120]
Abu Gharrab.

[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:18.100]
All but inevitable, this is the administration's version of accountability dictated the

[02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:19.460]
attempted cover-up that followed.

[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:24.540]
The abuse was called to the attention of the Occupation Authority as early as May 2003,

[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:28.960]
and in November, a scathing report of the International Committee of the Red Cross was reviewed

[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:34.220]
by senior U.S. military officials in Iraq, a full two months before the Army launched its investigation.

[02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:38.940]
Amnesty International had complained last summer of Iraqi detainees being subjected to crude

[02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:43.160]
and human or degrading treatment, AIDS, Decolon, Powell, and Paul Burmer insist that they, too,

[02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:46.700]
raise concerns within administration circles but were ignored as well.

[02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:51.220]
Nothing was done to put an end to the officially sanctioned sadism, which also turned out to be

[02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:55.140]
a propaganda gift to any American terrorist that were lover until mid-January of this year

[02:19:55.140 --> 02:20:00.620]
when the whistleblower specialist Joseph Derby turned over photos to the Army's criminal investigation division.

[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:04.460]
The existence of an internal army report on the...

[02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:05.160]
Abu Gharrab.

[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:09.880]
...abuses, according to time, was slightly denied to the Intelligence Committee Democrats when they asked

[02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:11.160]
the Pentagon about it in January.

[02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:17.720]
In February, when Major General Antonio Taguba's report confirmed the earlier charges and provided the photographic evidence,

[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:20.700]
the story was still kept secret from Congress and the American people.

[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:25.160]
Finally, it was apparently leaked by one of the defendant's lawyers to Hershens 60 Minutes, too,

[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:30.720]
but even then, Secretary Rumsfeld enjoyed Chiefs Chairman Richard Myers' profess to be almost perfectly clueless.

[02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:35.940]
Briefing the Senate and Tudzens Committee hours before the photos were to be broadcast on CBS,

[02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:40.860]
already delayed two weeks' admirers' request, Rumsfeld mentioned nothing about the approaching firestorm,

[02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:43.500]
neither got around or reading the report until days later.

[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:48.740]
What was Bush's public response to the man responsible for what Senator Ted Kennedy aptly terms,

[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:52.120]
America's steepest and deepest fall from grace in the history of our country?

[02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:58.900]
It was to congratulate him for doing a superb job, and Congress the word came from Dick Cheney's office to get off Rumsfeld's case.

[02:21:00.100 --> 02:21:04.060]
These are the men, not just the neocons, but self-described progressives and human rights advocates,

[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:09.160]
believe capable of carrying out the delicate and difficult mission of bringing democracy and modernism to the Arab world,

[02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:11.840]
while safeguarding the security and good name of the United States.

[02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:15.040]
Excuse me, but just what was so hard to understand about this bunch.

[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:20.140]
We knew they were dishonest, we knew they were fanatical, we knew they were purposely ignorant and bragged about not reading newspapers,

[02:21:20.620 --> 02:21:23.900]
we knew they were vindictive, we knew they were lawless, we knew they were obsessively secretive,

[02:21:24.660 --> 02:21:27.160]
we knew they had no time or patience for those who raised difficult questions,

[02:21:27.160 --> 02:21:31.980]
we knew they were driven by fantasies of religious warfare, personal vengeance, and ideological triumph.

[02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:37.660]
We knew they had no respect for civil liberties, and we knew they took no responsibility for the consequences of their incompetence.

[02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:46.700]
Just what is surprising about the manner which they've conducted the war, and how pathetic it is that the only cable network really grappling with the media's failure is Comedy Central.

[02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:50.280]
Let's give the last word to the Daily Shows in Comparable Stephen Colbert.

[02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:57.640]
The journalist I know love America, but now all anybody wants to talk about is the bad journalist, the journalist I heard America,

[02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:02.640]
who did not cover the flaws in our pre-war intelligence, who gave a free pass on the Sodomal Codic connection,

[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:06.620]
who dropped Afghanistan from the headlines at the first whip of this Iraqi snipe-on.

[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:08.760]
The United States press corps, that's who.

[02:22:10.060 --> 02:22:14.480]

[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:56.160]
It's time to dispense with the jokes and listen seriously to what the man is saying.

[02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:08.080]
How dare they drag the good things of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein's torture prison?

[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:14.200]
Gourk called the President incompetent and said the war in Iraq has made America less safe.

[02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:20.840]
Donald Rumsfeld ought to resign immediately as the chief architect of this plan.

[02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:30.360]
Paul Wilford with Douglas Steve, the intelligence chief Stephen Campbell, all ought to resign immediately.

[02:26:31.120 --> 02:26:37.340]
Our nation is at risk every single day Rumsfeld remains as Secretary of Defense.

[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:43.500]
If Mr. Gourk is right, the nation is faced with the crisis of leadership that is perilously close to an emergency.

[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:48.320]
If he's wrong that all the folks who've made the easy jokes that his expense can consider themselves vindicated.

[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.560]
The war in Iraq said Mr. Gourk in an interview on Wednesday is the worst strategic fiasco in the history of the U.S.

[02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:56.320]
It's an unfolding catastrophe without any comparison.

[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:07.040]
In an echo of the growing course of criticism here and around the world, he said the war not only damaged their strategic interest and isolated the U.S. from its allies, it's also made the country more not less vulnerable to terror.

[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:17.920]
In a widely covered speech earlier in the day, Mr. Gourk said that Iraq had not become as president Bush had asserted the central front of the war on terror, but he said it has become unfortunately the central recruiting office for terrorists.

[02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:23.820]
The speech was extraordinary, blunt, colorful, and delivered with a kind of past new seldom seen politics anymore.

[02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:29.500]
The former vice president described Mr. Bush as incompetent, untrustworthy, and said his policies had endangered the nation.

[02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:33.460]
The president said Mr. Gourk had planted the seeds of war in harvest at a whirlwind.

[02:27:34.180 --> 02:27:39.200]
In the view of Mr. Gourk and many others, the essential problems have been the triumph and the Bush crowd of ideology over reality.

[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:47.380]
The true believers knew everything better than everybody else, and the arrogance born of that certainly led step by, tragic step, to the war with no exit doors that were locked into day.

[02:27:47.960 --> 02:28:07.020]
That arrogance gave rise to the Bush doctrine of preemptive war, the contempt for international agreements, like the Geneva Conventions, to dismissal of concerns by some of the highest ranking military professionals about the way a wariner actually be fought, and the willingness of top administration figures to blow smoke in the eyes of ordinary Americans who were traumatized by 9-11, and worried about the possibility of further terrorist attacks.

[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:24.240]
The same preference for ideology over reality is turned trillion dollar surpluses into multi-trillion dollar deficits, said Mr. Gourk, and that same approach is lied to the locking up, has led rather the locking up of American citizens without recourse to lawyers or access to courts, or even a right of their families to know that they're being held in secret.

[02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:36.920]
These and other matters are transforming the US into a country that is more warlike, more brutal, less free, less just, less admirable, and much less appealing than the nation that existed when Mr. Bush stepped into the presidency in January 2001.

[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:46.360]
Those who disagree with Mr. Gourk should challenge him on his facts, those who agree must look for ways to defend the honor of perhaps the very identity of the United States as we've known it.

[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:54.420]
The least serious part of Mr. Gourk's speech was the part that got the most attention, his call for top officials of the Bush administration to resign, as an attention getter had worked.

[02:28:55.280 --> 02:29:04.460]
But this was a speech in which the former Vice President said, what makes the United States special in the history of pronations is our commitment to the rule of law and our carefully constructed system of checks and balances.

[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:16.020]
Our natural distrust of concentrated power and our devotion to openness and democracy would have led us as a people to consistently choose good over evil in our collective aspirations more than the people of any other nation.

[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:22.940]
This is a time to remember the principle that made this a great nation and to reaffirming them. I don't know what will happen in election time in November.

[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:29.720]
What I do know is that the nation is facing a crisis now. The Bush administration needs to step back from the abyss its ideology has dragged us into.

[02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:37.700]
It may be that the President never understood what the US made the US great. In that case he'd be among those who could benefit most from reading a Mr. Gourk's speech.

[02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:44.080]
If he followed that up with a look at the Bill of Rights it would only take a few minutes. He'd have a better understanding of what this country at its best is all about.

[02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:53.200]
Bob Herbert today's New York Times. Pretty good Bob. Boy you go you go and do it. How's that pool coming? I mean people still want to know about that pool, don't they? Oh that pool.

[02:32:31.010 --> 02:32:36.030]

I'm a star now with my own two-star and I was a spy. You are my step. Now you're the bum. You can't hit me no bow.

[02:33:12.710 --> 02:33:23.490]
You can't hit me no bow. You're on the radio. Maybe I was a little out of line. The things I said.

[02:33:25.010 --> 02:33:36.550]
Like that. You are and I'm not gay. You are right now. It is an all fairness. That big fat old guy they stuck me with kisses me like they used to do but he's not you.

[02:33:41.370 --> 02:33:55.310]
You guilty. Yes, today my life was filled with joy. You guilty. And now I'm stuck when I go out of love and joy.

[02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:08.350]

[02:35:20.810 --> 02:35:26.510]
98 for nine and a half weeks. 76 for body heat. Wild things. 53 showgirls. 45 and base against things.

[02:35:26.670 --> 02:35:31.890]
God. Somebody else is away in the behind. Okay, to tell the truth Paul Krogman writes today in the New York Times.

[02:35:32.210 --> 02:35:36.790]
A lot of good stuff in the times today. Now that they admitted they got the who they got the bushwacked on Iraq.

[02:35:37.490 --> 02:35:42.050]
And they got laid down the garden path. I that's just bothers me a lot. Vogue's me.

[02:35:42.170 --> 02:35:48.050]
There columnists many of them are really great, but the editorial board of the New York Times I think needs some new pills.

[02:35:48.810 --> 02:35:57.350]
Come on, well, my even half mouth. Paul Krogman writes some news organizations including the New York Times are currently engaged in self criticism over the run up to the Iraq war.

[02:35:57.730 --> 02:36:00.830]
They're asking as they should why poorly documented claims of a dare threat.

[02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:05.230]
We see prominent on critical coverage. Lot contrary evidence was either ignored or played down.

[02:36:06.050 --> 02:36:12.870]
But it's not just Iraq. It's not just the Times. Many journalists seem to be having regrets about the broader context in which Iraq coverage was embedded.

[02:36:13.290 --> 02:36:16.690]
A climate which the press wasn't willing to report negative information about George Bush.

[02:36:17.650 --> 02:36:24.070]
People who get the news by skimming the front page or by watching TV must be feeling confused by the sudden change in Mr. Bush's character.

[02:36:24.530 --> 02:36:28.610]
For more than two years after 9.11 he was a straight shooter. All more clarity and righteousness.

[02:36:29.210 --> 02:36:39.410]
But now those people hear about a president who won't illustrate story about why he took us to war in Iraq or how that war is going, who can't admit to and learn from mistakes, and who won't hold him suffer anyone else accountable. What happened?

[02:36:40.570 --> 02:36:47.610]
The answer of course is that the straight shooter never existed. He was a fictitious character that the press for various reasons presented as reality.

[02:36:48.330 --> 02:36:53.610]
The truth is that the character flaws that currently have even conservative pundits, fuming have been visible all along.

[02:36:54.230 --> 02:37:02.410]
Mr. Bush's problems with the truth have long been apparent to anyone willing to check his budget arithmetic. His inability to admit mistakes has also been obvious for a long time.

[02:37:02.770 --> 02:37:07.330]
I first wrote about Mr. Bush's infallibility complex more than two years ago and I wasn't being original.

[02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:13.850]
So why did the press quit a Mr. Bush with virtues that reporters knew he didn't possess? One answer is misplaced patriotism.

[02:37:14.450 --> 02:37:22.250]
After 9.11 much of the press seemed to reach a collective decision that it was necessary in the interest of national unity to suppress criticism of the commander-in-chief.

[02:37:22.850 --> 02:37:30.790]
Another answer is the tyranny of even-handedness. Moderate and liberal journalists, both reporters and commentators, often been over backward to say nice things about conservatives.

[02:37:31.330 --> 02:37:42.530]
Not long ago many commentators who are now caustic Bush critics, seemed desperate to differentiate themselves from irrational bushators who were neither haters nor irrational and whose critiques looked pretty mild in light of recent revelations.

[02:37:43.490 --> 02:37:49.390]
And some journalists couldn't bring themselves to believe that the president of the United States was being dishonest about such grave matters.

[02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:58.810]
Finally, let's not overlook the role of intimidation. After 9.11 if you were thinking of saying anything negative about the president, you had to be prepared for an avalanche of hate mail.

[02:37:59.230 --> 02:38:08.870]
You had to expect right-wing punishments and publications to do all they could to ruin your reputation and you had to worry about being denied access to the sort of insider information that's the basis of many journalistic careers.

[02:38:09.530 --> 02:38:14.370]
The Bush administration, knowing all of this, played the press like a fiddle, but has that ever come to an end?

[02:38:14.990 --> 02:38:24.330]
A new Pew survey finds 55% of journalists in the national media believe that the press has not been critical enough of Mr. Bush compared with only 8% who believe that it's been too critical.

[02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:27.170]
More important journalists seem to be acting on that belief.

[02:38:28.090 --> 02:38:36.630]
Amazing things have been happening lately. The usual suspects have tried to silence reporting about prison abuses by accusing critics of undermining the troops, but the reports keep coming.

[02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:41.370]
The attorney general is called yet another terror alert, but the press raised questions about why.

[02:38:41.870 --> 02:38:52.370]
At a White House morning briefing, Terry Miranda, VBC News actually said what many thought during other conveniently timed alerts, there's a disturbing possibility that you're either manipulating the American public in order to get a message out.

[02:38:53.230 --> 02:39:04.910]
It may not last in July 2002, according to Dana Milbank of the Washington Post, who's tried a great risk to his career to offer a realistic picture of the Bush presidency, the White House press corps showed its teeth for the first time since 9.11.

[02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:09.610]
It didn't last. The administration beat the drums of war and most of the press relapsed into the docility.

[02:39:10.310 --> 02:39:17.330]
But this time may be different. And if it is Mr. Bush, who is always dependent on that docility, may be in even more trouble than the latest poll suggests.

[02:39:17.610 --> 02:39:19.550]
Wouldn't that be wonderful? That would be great.

[02:39:22.730 --> 02:39:27.090]
Now, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. We can add a few more. I've got a couple of more some important things.

[02:39:27.610 --> 02:39:32.910]
Are they important? No. Well, to me they are. Yeah. Maybe I'm just doing this last hour for me today. How do you like that?

[02:39:32.910 --> 02:39:42.830]
No, I like it. But you like it. You always like it. I don't know why you like it. Josh likes it because he just sitting there on his ass, not typing any more pain in the ass movie titles on here. He likes it.

[02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:50.750]
He's sitting there thinking about how lucky he is to get his ass off with the just paying court cause going 95 and a 50 mile an hour school zone.

[02:39:51.130 --> 02:39:56.010]
You know it. Yeah. And those three little kids that he just even killed him. But I mean, he just, you know, kind of like science.

[02:39:56.350 --> 02:40:04.310]
Right. If it's good enough for Rick Sanchez. And by the way, the guy that Rick Sanchez in front of the stadium is he still dead. Okay.

[02:40:05.510 --> 02:40:10.870]
I just mentioned that in passing since everybody like cast or nobody. I see cast or no of my good close personal friend.

[02:40:11.130 --> 02:40:16.730]
Well, I'm sure it's less than right now. Even though he doesn't listen to the show. I see he's going to be on the sports jam. He's going to jam it Monday nights.

[02:40:17.770 --> 02:40:25.470]
You see that? Yeah. You all you mentioned it. I'm channel 10. So all of our good buddies on here like Hank in the mad dog and all the other whoever's on there.

[02:40:25.470 --> 02:40:31.550]
Be sure and give our best regards to cast and over. Believe you me. He could he needs some serious help.

[02:40:33.550 --> 02:40:37.790]
Mama Mia here. This is important stuff. Italy issues pizza making guidelines.

[02:40:39.650 --> 02:40:46.250]
Pizza makers be where Italy in role. Physician strict guidelines to protect the real neopolitan pizza from bogus copies.

[02:40:47.010 --> 02:40:54.990]
See, this is important stuff. Right. The regulations touch on everything from size to ingredients to the type of oven and rule abiding restaurants.

[02:40:54.990 --> 02:41:04.990]
We'll receive a special label of testing that real pizza can be there. The rules issued by the I know one place. It's called S S. Oh man. They got the best pizza in the world. SS.

[02:41:05.930 --> 02:41:14.570]
EST ST. Oh. The rules issued by the agriculture ministry are part of Italy's efforts to protect its cuisine across the European Union.

[02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:19.330]
Although it was not immediately clear what steps have been taken for enforcement. I think that might be it.

[02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:35.550]
Bogus pizza. But I think about a boom. The guidelines printed to the new countries official gazette say real neopolitan pizza must be round no more than 14 inches in diameter. No more than a 10th one 10th inch in the middle, which is across about 8 tenths of an inch thick.

[02:41:37.130 --> 02:41:53.070]
The texture must be soft elastic, easily foldable. The guidelines say the norms also specify what kind of flower yeast tomatoes and oil must be used. They recognize only three types of real neopolitan pizza, marinara with garlic and oregano, margarita with basil and mozzarella cheese from the southern.

[02:41:53.810 --> 02:42:02.150]
And extra margarita with fresh tomatoes basil and buffalo mozzarella from Campania. The region includes pizza's hometown of napoli, naples and we're not talking about Florida.

[02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:10.250]
The dough must be rolled out manually and baked in wood burning ovens that can be required temperature of 905 degrees, in which case your pizza is done in about two minutes.

[02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:19.850]
The regulations were approved after surveying pizza makers and naples and surrounding areas. Restaurants that abide by the rules. We can label saying their pizzas are guaranteed traditional specialty.

[02:42:20.550 --> 02:42:27.210]
And when you walk in Eli Wallach, we'll be sitting there going, get by me. Oh, you can just go his brains out.

[02:42:49.850 --> 02:43:19.830]
The dough must be rolled out manually and baked in wood burning ovens that can be used for baking.

[02:43:27.650 --> 02:43:49.830]
The dough must be rolled out manually and baked in wood burning ovens that can be used for baking.

[02:43:50.450 --> 02:43:56.630]
Careful what you wish for, cause trust us. You'll wish you were renowned by a great humbuzz.

[02:43:58.850 --> 02:44:07.610]
You were a Nat. Do I look fat? Call it your name. This is great. Goodbye, single-fours.

[02:44:08.350 --> 02:44:12.670]
Help, family, course. Now you stop by with us.

[02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:19.910]
146 and 560 W. Here, Michael Angelo, Senior really writes, since the end of marriage as we know it and most people feel fine.

[02:44:21.570 --> 02:44:29.090]
Parring a miracle, the family, as it has been known for more than five millennia, will crumble, worn the evangelist and psychologist Dr. James Dopson.

[02:44:30.210 --> 02:44:40.030]
Regarding Massachusetts and pending First Aid Sanctions, same-sex marriages, promises, promises. May 17th came and went. And last time I checked, the family was still standing, this functional is ever.

[02:44:40.490 --> 02:44:46.310]
The world is still spinning on its axis. The American economy keeps sputtering along and Iraq continues to spiral out of control.

[02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:56.110]
The end of civilization has proven to be the biggest, most over-hack disappointment since the Y2K bug. No rapture, no floods, no earthquakes, no locusts.

[02:44:56.670 --> 02:45:02.430]
The first born of every family did not die nor did God strike Massachusetts off the map with an almost almighty thunderbolt.

[02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:11.530]
The weather from what I could gather seemed unseasonably pleasant all the way to Provincetown as thousands of gay must-been couples went across the Bay State last week. That's Bay with a B.

[02:45:12.890 --> 02:45:21.550]
Evangelical leaders were hoping the pictures on television of gay couples getting hitched would sicken an outraged the masses driving millions of Americans to the barricades to take on the enemy within.

[02:45:22.470 --> 02:45:37.670]
The attacks on Pearl Harbor, New York and Washington awakened the nation to peril and called citizens to action said our Albert Moulord Jr., President of the Southern Baptist Theology Seminary, comparing those attacks to the Massachusetts decision. He even called May 17 a day that will live in moral infamy.

[02:45:38.610 --> 02:45:48.690]
Judging from most people's reactions it's a day that's already been forgotten. So the new tack by the goofy God Squad is to claim that people are in a state of shock, experienced aid, experiencing a delayed response.

[02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:59.690]
The fact is enough people have it awakened said the Reverend Lou Sheldon found of the traditional values coalition that's way till the Washington Post. It's a sleeping giant out there and when people wake up I feel bad for the homosexuals he said.

[02:46:00.530 --> 02:46:08.790]
Actually people have woken up and they're quite revolted but the same gender photo pairings that got them sick of their stomachs were coming out of Massachusetts. They were the photos of

[02:46:10.270 --> 02:46:20.230]
depicting humiliating simulated sex acts that American soldiers and civilian contractors using homosexual sex and agro testically homophobic manner forced male Iraqi detainees to engage in.

[02:46:20.230 --> 02:46:31.870]
In that respected timing of the Massachusetts marriages could have been better for the same sex marriage movement the president abuse scandal they continuing violence in Iraq and the administration's handling of the war put same sex marriage in perspective for most people.

[02:46:32.210 --> 02:46:46.570]
George W. Bush's approval ratings have plummeted as Americans realize that it's not gay marriage that's destroyed the country but rather the president Donald Rumsfeld, Candeliza Rice and the rest of the gang in a White House. They're the ones who've taken us to war based on lies and if irreparably damage the nation's integrity.

[02:46:47.230 --> 02:46:56.850]
In Congress the federal marriage amendment seems dead in the water perhaps it wasn't a coincidence that the Senate canceled the hearing on the amendment last week in which the homo obsessed government around the Massachusetts was to appear.

[02:46:57.450 --> 02:47:06.010]
How would it look in the middle of all the turmoil in the Middle East if reports came out of Washington depicting our senators focused on an issue that ranks at the bottom of voters list of priorities in every pool.

[02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:15.930]
Several months back I wrote that the FMA could turn out to be more of a problem for Boston John Kerry who doesn't support same sex marriage either as most voters no matter how they feel about gay unions.

[02:47:16.570 --> 02:47:25.990]
The more passionate will mend the constitution or even the waste much time for debating the issue. That has turned out to be true but I didn't force the other factors that are further complicated the FMA from Bush's perspective.

[02:47:26.530 --> 02:47:34.350]
Several recent reports have noted that the proposed gay marriage ban while a major talking point for evangelical leaders is failing to assert the evangelical rank and file.

[02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:44.890]
Even if their adamant be opposed to same sex marriage many are ambivalent about getting the federal government involved. It's not a black and white issue for them like abortion nor is it one that gets them to empty their pockets and run to the pools.

[02:47:46.570 --> 02:47:58.130]
After an alliance a conservative Christians was threatening a church goal revolt unless President Bush championed an amendment banning same sex marriage members say they've been surprised and disappointed but what they call a tapet response from the Puse the New York Times reported.

[02:47:58.870 --> 02:48:15.370]
If the FMA doesn't energize the GOP's religious base and if the abortion issue doesn't fulfill that function either this year Bush is chipping away abortion rights make might make some conservative Christians complacent in 2004. Bush might get the same turnout among evangelicals that he got in 2000 which was a disappointment to Carl Robe.

[02:48:16.570 --> 02:48:27.190]
Bush will have alienated some moderate Republicans and Democrats who previously supported him but perhaps more important it will have energized many liberal Democrats and gay rights advocates who are organizing fiercely might have been supportive of the FMA.

[02:48:29.010 --> 02:48:36.910]
Gay groups on college campuses and community centers across the country are briskly registering new voters painting Bush's a tyrannous turning gaze into second class citizens.

[02:48:36.910 --> 02:48:52.910]
The Human Rights Campaign the largest gay group in Washington last week launched an ant campaign excoriating Bush which will appear more than 85 times in gay lesbian by sexual transgender community publications even the law camp in Republicans launch TV spots critical of Bush for supporting the amendment.

[02:48:53.610 --> 02:49:03.390]
Most of those in the religious right who feel passionately about the FMA are voting for Bush anyway it's quite possible that Bush has continued vocal support of the FMA will get more Democrats than Republicans out to vote.

[02:49:03.390 --> 02:49:15.450]
It's certainly energizing loyal democratic constituencies like gays and lesbians. Meanwhile the majority of voters including swing voters will only continue to note that Bush is trying to change the subject and focus on an issue that's not a priority for them.

[02:49:15.970 --> 02:49:29.930]
It's not that they support same sex marriage necessarily though the most recent news we pull showed a slim majority supporting some form of support for a sanction for gay unions but same Bush pandering that they religion right while there's so many other issues affecting the country is not going to play well.

[02:49:29.930 --> 02:49:38.150]
As an issue this election year same sex marriage may turn out to be a trap that Carl Rolf said for Kerry but which hapless W walked into all by himself.

[02:49:39.350 --> 02:49:46.350]
Like that like you've been saying along who cares what's it to yeah what's it to you and don't we have bigger fish to fry.

[02:49:47.850 --> 02:49:52.870]
I know this is more 20 or by 60 way yeah.

[02:49:53.230 --> 02:49:59.090]
That's so good that it's frightening you know what I just want to play that all day. Maybe you can play that all day on Monday all right over it over again.

[02:49:59.190 --> 02:50:07.290]
Don't forget George will be here on Monday while everybody else is goofing off or like at least trying to put in you know put our best one foot forward and one foot backward.

[02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:15.590]
And then the rest of the schedule on Monday I guess they just don't want to know about we got the mad dog coming up next to the hooters along with the Brad Penney's hanging out.

[02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:25.810]
Here's the result of that poll so far what will be not x rated as the hottest you've ever seen 9 1 1 1 1 body heat 82 wild fangs 57
