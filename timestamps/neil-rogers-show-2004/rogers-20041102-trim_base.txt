[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180]
Get push!

[00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.280]
Back to the moon!

[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.760]
Billy Bob Gordon brings back his most beloved character for another film about America's

[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.720]
most beloved story, Fighting Night Carl.

[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.240]
I reckon on fourth down you won't depart.

[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.100]
It's Billy Bob Gordon, as Carl from Slingblade, coaching high school football.

[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.600]
I call it a tailback, so folks call it a halfback, I call it a tailback.

[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.840]
Fighting Night Carl will make a quarterback sneak into your heart.

[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.800]
I read the rulebook, I study known it quite a bit, and says a man ought not to block another man from behind on a key call for term.

[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.120]
And don't miss Coach Garl's inspirational half-time pep talk.

[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.520]
Even you boys with his careful ball game, we're all gonna go off for business and mustard.

[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.220]
I like business and mustard.

[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.600]
Fighting Night Carl, rated PG-13.

[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.360]
I reckon no young and under the age of 13, he does movie without their mummy or daddy.

[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.720]
1045 at 560 WQM, Happy Election Day.

[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.500]
The Secretary of State from Iowa's under CNN, who looks very enthusiastic, he's a Democrat, so he's very excited.

[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.440]
70 to 75% turnout in Iowa they're predicting today, unprecedented.

[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.180]
Huh, unspeakable.

[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.740]
State after state, breaking all-time records, in fact he said they'd registered an additional 20,000 people right at the very ASN there in Iowa.

[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.760]
And that they've got even registration, 600,000 Democrats, 600,000 Republicans registered.

[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.200]
And like 70 to 75% turnout expected.

[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.380]
And they're just coming out and droves all over the country.

[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.820]
This must be because they're happy.

[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.200]
They like the way things are.

[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.540]
I don't think so.

[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.940]
You want to keep things going, they're so happy.

[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.600]
Right, they're happy with the status quo, as Zerams would.

[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.860]
No.

[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.060]
No. We'll see.

[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.500]
Line 9, WQAM, hello.

[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.400]
Hey.

[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.520]
Yes sir.

[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.440]
Neil?

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.560]
Yes it is.

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.860]
Oh, what's up?

[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.000]
Well, I was just calling because I'm on the internet and I was trying to get you online and I can't hear you.

[00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.820]
We're not streaming yet.

[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.000]
We are as of right now.

[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.020]
As of right now we are.

[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.560]
Check it now.

[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.280]
Oh, cool.

[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.120]
It's one of them.

[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.020]
When did they check it out?

[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.360]
Okay, get back to your thing and look at a few of them.

[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.660]
Oh, we got the Amber Smith.

[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.420]
I can mention that.

[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.260]
I was not going to answer.

[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.340]
I looked the cat out of the bag, so to speak.

[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.200]
Amber Smith behind the meeting curtain today while you're listening to the audio.

[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.660]
And we are streaming as of right now.

[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.560]
Okay, so just relax.

[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.440]
A little bit slow there in the other room and that's because it took a while to get the operations manager off of Robert.

[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.440]
But once we did, Robert's not here today.

[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.440]
Well, maybe off who was in there?

[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.820]
A new guy.

[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.260]
Oh, like I said.

[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.300]
What's up?

[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.120]
WQAM, hello.

[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.940]
Hi.

[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.260]
Hey, Neil.

[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.060]
Yes sir.

[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.400]
Oh, how you doing?

[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.240]
Pretty good.

[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.100]
Go carry.

[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.380]
I'm listening.

[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.020]
You said yesterday you were surprised by Jimmy Buffett campaigning for carrying.

[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.580]
Yeah, I always thought he was a Republican, Jimmy Buffett.

[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.520]
No, not that.

[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.160]
No fan and no one casually.

[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.760]
He's always been a liberal Democrat.

[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.360]
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.620]
We're not getting that from him.

[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.460]
I don't know.

[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.440]
We used to trash.

[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.080]
I need to buy it in the songs and stuff.

[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.640]
Yeah.

[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.080]
And you know, that's because that's how to quit war back.

[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.480]
You didn't want to piss off his constituents and the keys, you know.

[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.400]
He is.

[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.920]
That could be.

[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.380]
Yeah.

[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.220]
He was just sucking up, so to speak.

[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.940]
Now he's always been a liberal Democrat.

[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.580]
Well, good for him.

[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.240]
Now I like him.

[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.000]
I'm going to need a couple of cheeseburgers and paradise right after the show.

[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.980]
There you go.

[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.760]
Thanks for a good Thursday, palies.

[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.540]
All right, bye.

[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.280]
And have a right there.

[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.980]
I didn't know that.

[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.460]
I thought he was for whatever reason.

[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.880]
I don't know.

[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.300]
Because he's the red necky thing.

[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.720]
Key West, Montana, you think.

[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.600]
Yeah, red necky thing.

[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.420]
That red necky thing.

[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.820]
Ain't too many Democrat, red necky thing.

[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.780]
They might be, but they like keeping the closet a lot.

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.700]
Other things too.

[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.240]
WDQA and hello.

[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.780]
Yeah.

[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.820]
One sets of puts.

[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.800]
Why were they doing that?

[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.380]
I loved it though.

[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.320]
41 to 14.

[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.820]
It might as well have been 81 to zip.

[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.860]
That's the kind of contest you had.

[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.080]
And Jay Feedler, he may be a very nice guy, but he really blows.

[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.640]
You know, he is pathetic.

[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.440]
How many interceptions did he throw again last night?

[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.340]
About third, man.

[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.860]
Jesus.

[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.600]
What?

[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.700]
He's pathetic.

[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.840]
He's awful.

[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.640]
Damn.

[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.720]
He's grotesque.

[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.280]
And let me ask you, Josh, how come they left him in there the whole game?

[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.620]
I mean, at halftime, we're still competitive.

[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.280]
What was it?

[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.660]
Only 14, seven or something like that?

[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.700]
Half time, 17, seven?

[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.380]
Yeah, but it was probably a dignity thing.

[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.620]
A dignity thing?

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.460]
I didn't know he went to that church.

[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.580]
Once that was afraid to be called anti-Semitic if he pulled him out.

[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.920]
No, if you go to the dignity church, you're called...

[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.140]
BAAAMING!

[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.660]
WQA and hello.

[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.640]
Yeah.

[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.480]
New.

[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.300]
Happy last day.

[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.180]
I voted last week and I tried to get you.

[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.180]
Yeah.

[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.100]
When I touched the screen for Kerry, I had to touch it three times.

[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.060]
But it had to drop in Kerry's box.

[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.920]
Yeah, and if you touched it four times, John Ascroft will have to Gestapo with your door, check it out with your touchin.

[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.240]
Yeah, trust me.

[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.620]
You're laughing, but you better not answer the door for a week.

[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.920]
Oh, okay, I just wanted to...

[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.900]
I'm gonna get you on that.

[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.000]
Make sure it counts.

[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.000]
That's the bottom line.

[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.840]
Make sure it counts.

[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.760]
Bang it, slap it, smack it.

[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.480]
Okay, man.

[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.880]
Have a good day.

[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.320]
Thanks, Pally.

[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.980]
All right, you two.

[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.880]
Yeah, see these people, it's good that this is why we do this on Election Day especially.

[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.020]
Because then we get the Illuminati, I mean the electoral crowd out there.

[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.760]
Yeah.

[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.360]
Well, they finally decided that Tony Nolts is a Democrat.

[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.960]
They've been showing the wrong parties on their own.

[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.460]
And every time they show the Alaska Senate race, and they've got Murkowski as a Democrat, which of course, he's not.

[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.060]
She's the daughter of the very unpopular governor.

[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.120]
And she's a Republican, and she might get her ass kicked up there in Alaska.

[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.980]
Don't forget Petticaster, by the way.

[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.980]
I know she's not the all-at-the-popular, and probably not all that bright either when you come right.

[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.520]
That's bad.

[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.140]
We love Petticaster, right?

[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.440]
Yes.

[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.460]
She's great.

[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.580]
She's not bad.

[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.180]
What is it?

[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.980]
Whatever's name is?

[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.060]
Mel Martinez.

[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.380]
Mel.

[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.800]
Keep in mind, okay?

[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.120]
Mel rhymes with bad smell as you can smell your aroma coming from that spot on the ballot.

[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.860]
Don't get sucked into that crack just because the name ends in a Z in a Z.

[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.960]
Don't do it.

[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.400]
WDQA M, hello.

[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.280]
Hello.

[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.860]
Election Central.

[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.660]
Washington Central.

[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.460]
Yeah, Washington Central.

[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.040]
I got a wrong number.

[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.140]
Okay, sorry.

[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.720]
Thank God that the intellectuals all over the country are voting today.

[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.540]
You don't have to be smart.

[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.460]
Just barely breathing.

[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.140]
We'll let you vote.

[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.200]
See, I'm tempted to get into some of these other things, but we got seven minutes.

[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.760]
We can handle it.

[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.600]
Plus the three-minute break.

[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.520]
We only got four minutes and then we can give it to the real show.

[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.040]
Because I'm tempted to mention about that damn Supreme Court and how they keep sticking their finger-wittened again.

[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.780]
Although, Rankquist looks like his really on the way out.

[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.960]
They're finally admitting that he's got like a very, very rare and very serious form of thyroid cancer.

[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.400]
Okay.

[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.780]
And when down poor Billy Rankquist looks like he might be on the way out.

[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.840]
That's what we're thinking.

[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.160]
I think God's punishing him.

[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.780]
The whole Supreme Court.

[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.280]
Did you see that like four of them got cancer already, including Santa Gai-O Connor?

[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.720]
Oh, good.

[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.660]
Speaking of that, I wonder how the Chinese bull-like daughters hold them up on election day.

[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.080]
You know, Mary, that bull-like daughter of the Dick and Lynn Cheney.

[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.660]
That's the same Lynn Cheney that was right in them steamy bull-like novels back in the 80s.

[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.420]
Maybe there was something relevant to it.

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.320]
You see the way that they call that?

[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.340]
Not nice to call that.

[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.220]
She's gay, pure gay.

[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.540]
Yeah, but they like to be called the daughters of Lesbos.

[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.720]
W-Q-A-M-H-L-O.

[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.000]
W-Q-A-M-H-L-O.

[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.080]
W-Q-A-M-H-L-O.

[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.400]
Neil.

[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.920]
Hey, a while back I was on that fundraise.org that you were talking about.

[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.200]
You have to put Jimmy Buffett.

[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.200]
And he gave $2,000 to Bob Graham.

[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.800]
See what I tell you.

[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.080]
What's so did you manage?

[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:37.980]
And then I looked up by address and they must have the same attorney because Barbara Streisand,

[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.780]
a whole bunch of other musicians, all gave from the same address.

[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.540]
Right.

[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.780]
I don't know.

[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.480]
I don't know.

[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.260]
I just want to let you know that.

[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.140]
And well, when you thought of Barbara Streisand, you think it's going to be Buffett, don't you?

[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.100]
Oh, yeah.

[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.060]
Neither one of them can sing a lick.

[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.100]
That's all I have.

[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:53.960]
The same attorney though.

[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.160]
Well, that's good news.

[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.840]
They'll need it.

[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.280]
Thank you.

[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.980]
567-0560, pound 560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Lines.

[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.500]
11 o'clock will start to show formal.

[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.420]
If anybody's not in tune with the way we do this every day, because Stearn ends whenever he feels like it.

[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.420]
Aren't you kind of surprised at the end of the early day?

[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.060]
Yeah, I am really.

[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.540]
Why?

[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.200]
Why do you think?

[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.240]
Well, I don't know.

[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.120]
Maybe he had to go out there and vote several times as what he said he was going to do.

[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.020]
I don't get that.

[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.440]
Even the grumpy old Don I'm as the I'm an voted for Kerry.

[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.060]
Very enthusiastic.

[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.980]
Well, he's never enthusiastic about anything.

[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.280]
Right.

[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.020]
Well, I'm relatively speaking.

[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.840]
He was like a bullet about it.

[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.120]
WQAM, hello.

[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.500]
Hello, Neil.

[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.020]
Election headquarters.

[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.500]
How you doing, man?

[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:36.960]
All right.

[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:44.120]
Listen, one of my parents worked at the Kerry campaign helping volunteer at one of the polls.

[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:44.700]
Right.

[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.580]
And they already had shut down one of the Bush people because they were in there trying to intimidate people while they were voting.

[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.220]
Good.

[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.120]
I hope they dragged them out of there and the Karen Feather they're asked on the way out of town.

[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.820]
They got the lawyers over there and then someone from the campaign headquarters came over in the elections and they told them to get out.

[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.780]
Good. Excellent.

[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.840]
Excellent news.

[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.520]
People got to get out and vote, man.

[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.800]
Thanks for the good news, Pally.

[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.540]
All right.

[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.240]
Yeah, when did they take those challenges?

[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.900]
Those Republicans that are trying to suppress the vote and kick their ass out in spite of that Supreme Court ruling in Ohio to hell with it.

[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:24.560]
In addition to which, let me say it again, I know that this is really an embarrassment to the U.S. of A, since Americans generally think they're so superior to the rest of the world, including mostly Americans who've never been out of their two blocks away from their home town.

[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.800]
But the fact of the matter is we got international observers for the first time in the history of America.

[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.720]
We have international observers monitoring this election.

[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:40.160]
I keep in them because when it comes to elections in America, man, don't trust it.

[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:48.140]
Question it, smell it, sniff it, examine it, put the stuffist go right up into the.

[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.520]
Welcome of the whole situation.

[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.480]
That's right. I'm serious.

[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.220]
Where's Dick daily when we need him?

[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.300]
In fact, as they say, Pomp and a Park, where's Dan daily when you?

[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:02.720]
The court has mentioned the EU Rogers exclusively on 5.60.

[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.140]
UAM.

[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.920]
People are as dumb and they want that as dumb as a blooper.

[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:11.960]
Absolutely.

[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:53.440]

[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:53.440]

He's scared of bushes.

[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.020]

[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.020]

[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.020]

[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.020]

[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.020]

[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.900]

He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.100]

[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.100]

[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.120]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:23.340]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:23.460]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:23.940]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.120]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.120]

[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.660]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:25.960]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.240]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:26.880]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.040]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.420]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.100]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.260]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:28.640]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:28.820]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.060]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.100]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.600]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.340]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.860]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:34.860]

[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:34.880]
He's scared of bushes.

[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:34.880]

[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:41.160]
And that's why bushes made synonymous this business about the war in Iraq and the war on terror, which have absolutely nothing to do with each other.

[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.000]
At least they didn't when they went in there with the Iraq attack, but of course now they do because there's terrorism all over Iraq.

[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.100]
Thanks to the Bushmeister.

[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.020]
I'm going to, before the show is over, don't let me forget.

[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:56.980]
I know it's ponderous and we've got a lot of people who want to call in and we'll probably get some good information like the woman reminding people to be sure and check the screen.

[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.520]
Make sure that the vote's been tabulated before you walk away.

[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.620]
It's that Rust Baker article in 1999 candidate Bush spoke of wanting to invade Iraq.

[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:09.180]
He collected that of all the things of all the ponderous crap that I've read on the year last couple of months.

[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.040]
This one is the jackpot.

[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.660]
This one tells you exactly what it is.

[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.300]
You know, pick a place that you think would be like about a two-day war.

[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:22.060]
You can go in there, you can cherry pick it and just go in there with, and this is why he told Pat Robertson, oh don't worry about casualties.

[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.080]
There won't be any casualties.

[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.260]
He really believed this.

[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.960]
This was going to be another Grenada, another a fuck line of islands for the Brits.

[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.360]
Just a cakewalk without listening to the generals, without listening to anybody.

[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.320]
And that's why I'll get to it. I'll read it.

[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.120]
It's pretty scary stuff and it's right on target.

[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.280]
And your mainstream media they're not going to touch that with a 10-foot-to-you-know-what.

[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.180]
Gary in Weston says, could this be the day we finally get rid of the Crawford creep?

[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.460]
We can only pray, Gary.

[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.280]
I read where Osama plans on bleeding our country into bankruptcy.

[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.400]
That's what he's saying now.

[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.980]
Sounds like he's positioning himself for a spot in W's cabinet.

[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.840]
And he could be the new secretary of the Treasury.

[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.760]
What's with all this pundit path where they claim they got the exit pulling results wrong last time around

[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.740]
that is such a falsehood.

[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:08.760]
We all know the reason that all the exit pulling pointed to a Gourwin in Florida was because, guess what, he actually did win Florida based on the exit pulling.

[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.480]
We know that, Gary.

[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.760]
All the old Jews in Palm Beach left the pulling place thinking they voted for Gour when surveyed probably responded,

[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.600]
yeah, we voted for Gourdin and all of a sudden...

[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.060]
Oh, we voted for Cassie Cannon!

[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.320]
Well, don't make the mistake again.

[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.700]
Okay, ain't out of ballot this time.

[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.240]
Now, here are the first pull results.

[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.620]
These, this always cracks me up, you know?

[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.860]
The nation's first election day votes were cast and counted just after midnight last night to pair Mountain Hamlets in the New Hampshire.

[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.380]
They do it every four years.

[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.800]
35 votes for Bush and carries 21, later received one vote.

[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.680]
Now, if you saw if you were watching the Monday Night Football, the end of the game last night, they showed...

[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.440]
Did you see that, Josh?

[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.280]
No, I stopped watching the third.

[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.280]
They showed... You stopped watching that great game?

[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.860]
Oh, I don't want to miss a minute of that.

[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.460]
It was sensational.

[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.440]
I loved, I was squeezing myself from that game.

[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.060]
But they showed these Yahoo's, man, up there in... in Hampshire.

[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.340]
The first two days votes came from North and North and North, in the community of Hartz Location.

[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.840]
16 for Bush, 14 for Kerry, and one for David.

[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.180]
That's pretty close to them, Mugwamps.

[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.700]
Minutes later, the 26 registered voters in Dixville, notch, 50 miles from North Split, 19 for Bush, 7 for Kerry.

[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:17.260]
Now, in 2000, it was Bush over Gour in Hartz Location, 17 to 13.

[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.840]
And here it was Bush over Kerry.

[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.820]
What was it again?

[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.160]
16 to 14.

[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.660]
See the difference there?

[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.200]
It's a two votes swing.

[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:36.880]
In Dixville, notch in 2000, Bush had 21 Gour, the five in Nator 1, and now in Dixville, notch, it's 19 for Bush, two less, seven for Kerry, two more.

[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.340]
And then for Nator.

[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.480]
So already he's got a net gain of about four or five votes there.

[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.640]
I see it.

[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.500]
Let's start counting.

[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.400]
We're going to count the votes one at a time.

[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.820]
Just like we get listeners here on QA, we're going to start tabulating the votes one at a time here on your official list.

[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:55.040]
I'll go call Google I and this business about Jeff Bush has got a 70% approval rating in Florida.

[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.920]
Every time I hear that, based on what?

[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.140]
Based on the fact that he lies a lot, that he's a crook, that he never worked on on his day in his life.

[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.160]
Is that what it's all about?

[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.080]
He's thinking about his devious plans to subvert the ability of the electorate.

[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.840]
Is that why they like him?

[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.060]
God, what is wrong with you people, man?

[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.260]
That fat ass governor crookier's.

[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.820]
And let me remind you again, okay?

[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:17.180]
He and Catherine Harris and Theresa Lepore, these are people who stole the election right and brought daylight in 2000.

[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.700]
Are you going to let him do it again?

[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.680]
That's for getting about any other issue.

[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.700]
If that's the only thing that you're concentrating on today when you go to cast your vote,

[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.420]
are you going to sit by you people in Florida and let them steal another one?

[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.740]
There was a guy on MSNBC last night they were in a rocket.

[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.920]
What do they call that freedom square, whatever it is?

[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.640]
Field class, whatever it is.

[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.640]
And he had a huge sign and he kept getting right in front of the camera the whole attendee were on for hours and hours.

[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.420]
God help us, Bush is trying to steal another election.

[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.600]
And you know what, sir, you are correct.

[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.080]
I mean, it could happen to stand.

[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.780]
There's that simple idiot that simple,

[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:58.960]
closet, faggot with his vote type, mother Tucker Carlson on CNN with Paul Vagalla.

[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:03.300]
And Tucker already admitted that Terry's going to win no matter what he says on there now.

[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.260]
He already admitted that on with the Chris Matthews.

[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.620]
27 after 11 at 560 WQM if your hair is fall out and clumps like Paul Vagallis,

[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.360]
if you got a big ugly bald spot like Boca Brian.

[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:19.600]
Well Charles Alfie Erie's the guy I want to be going to because he's been helping the famous the in between and the infamous for over 30 years now.

[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.540]
You wouldn't even recognize Charlie's work when you see it because guess what?

[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.520]
It looks like real hair.

[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:28.500]
Charlie knows and you walk to two that the most critical area of any hair system is the hairline.

[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.820]
And Charlie's new skin like hair system is 100% undetectable.

[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.860]
They hear looks like it's grown right out of your scale.

[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.720]
Charlie's work is guaranteed to he got nothing to lose but that ugly bald spot that makes you look old and grotesque.

[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.960]
You try Charlie's system for a month for about 30 days.

[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:47.520]
After a month of you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells you just take it back and say here here's your hair back.

[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.780]
Give me my money back no problem.

[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:50.000]

[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.520]
Are they amazing?

[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.700]
Natural hairline system called toll free 1-800-321-2413.

[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.740]
Don't forget the secret to a really great hair system is make sure nobody can tell you wearing one

[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.500]
because it doesn't look like a dead muskrat.

[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.600]
And Charlie's new skin like hair system is as natural as you can get.

[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:19.700]
Here's that toll free number again 1-800-321-2413-183-212413 run the web CharlesAlphieri.com.

[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.020]
Your listening to me or Roger's.

[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.640]
This is the rest of the world on my 60th YouTube.

[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.780]
You A.M.

[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.380]
Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico.

[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.780]
We're going to California and Texas and New York.

[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.820]
We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan.

[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.840]
And then we're going to Washington DC to take back the White House.

[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:42.900]
Yeah!

[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:41.460]
I'm going to take a look at the white House.

[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:42.760]
I'm going to take a look at the white House.

[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:42.780]
I'm going to take a look at the white House.

[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:42.780]

[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:42.780]

[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:47.740]
You say 9 or 11 is what they got you to do.

[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:55.440]
You can't get it in government or own party government.

[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:06.780]
You believe what they say like they're falling in love with you.

[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.340]
You have a relationship.

[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.000]
The state is dating with you.

[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.700]
You got a...

[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.860]
You got a...

[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.960]
You got a...

[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.260]
27-095-60-WQ-A-M.

[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.420]
Get out there and do your civic duty and vote for John Kerry.

[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:31.860]
269 votes on the pool.

[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.100]
Which state do you think will be the most crucial in this election?

[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.980]
Florida, what did I tell you? 151.

[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:36.640]
It's probably right.

[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.160]
Don't forget you won't be getting no Florida results till 8 o'clock because...

[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.160]
See a lot of people think Florida is in the Eastern time zone.

[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.440]
Well guess what?

[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.220]
Well most of it is.

[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.900]
Right. But not the panic.

[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.820]
Hawaii for Wisconsin appear.

[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.560]
Michigan won. One for Iowa and nobody says Jersey.

[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.040]
Nobody except the course for Bob Sheefer on the fly.

[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.260]
The baby for the election, the candidates know.

[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:00.300]
Right.

[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.120]
Because they have their own internal pool.

[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.200]
They don't know for sure who's going to show up.

[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.400]
But especially now that we have all the early voting going on.

[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.040]
And we have this massive turnout.

[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:12.580]
And truth back into the decisions of this nation.

[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.120]
There you go. Nice going John. You go boy.

[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.000]
Howardine would be 20 points ahead.

[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.600]
Anyway, we're less than 12 hours before the pools open.

[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.660]
Republicans laid the groundwork for a possible legal challenge to the presidential election.

[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.960]
Within 11th hour law they had.

[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.720]
That's why they condition the American public with these 85,000 terror alerts.

[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.860]
With Tom Ridge and his yellow light and red light and pink light.

[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:34.600]
Bull crap.

[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.520]
Oh and I got do I have a thing on here now?

[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.500]
We better I'm going to try to get this to Eric.

[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:41.700]
Okay.

[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.160]
During the break.

[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.880]
From mother Jones.

[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.700]
Was it bush wired? Sure looks like it.

[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.740]
Wait till you see this picture.

[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:53.240]
All right. I'm telling you the and like I said yesterday I want to repeat it again.

[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:59.700]
Anybody who has to be coached through a debate with a candidate when he's running for the highest office in the world.

[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.220]
This man clearly is not only a doofus.

[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.860]
He doesn't deserve anybody's vote.

[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:10.740]
Someone that needs to be coached and also when he is having discussions with leaders of other countries.

[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.140]
They say they see the same ball on his back.

[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.800]
Yeah, I didn't believe it in the beginning but then.

[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.880]
When you see this picture man.

[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.580]
Read this article which I'm going to look at over to Erica during the break.

[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.660]
Probably doctored by you.

[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:26.040]
A massive photo experts analysis makes it clear bushes lying.

[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.280]
He wore some kind of device in each of the three debates.

[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.960]
So why won't the media go near this story?

[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.400]
A leading NASA scientist who normally spends his days analyzing and enhancing photo images

[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:42.680]
set across the depth of space by the Cassini and other space probes has turned his expertise to images of the president and the three debates.

[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.900]
His conclusion George Bush is obviously wearing something.

[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.220]
Probably a receiver of some kind under his jacket for each debate.

[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:55.140]
Robert M. Nelson who's worked for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology for some three decades.

[00:39:55.140 --> 00:40:01.580]
Provided a dramatic photo of the balls under the jacket at the first debate to salon.com which posted on October 29.

[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:06.420]
Now working at home and using his own computers he's done the same analysis from other Jones.com.

[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.260]
On images of bushes back taken during the second two debates.

[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:15.880]
Nelson the top ranked senior research scientist at JPL and past chair of the division for planetary sciences of the American Astronomical Society.

[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:22.060]
Says that by enhancing the contrast and the edge definition and the digital photographs taken a video broadcast of the three debates.

[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.040]
The object of the jacket can be clearly delineated.

[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.080]
And we'll put this on our website.

[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:36.020]
Nelson told MotherJones.com in the first debate the ball just create the impression of a letter T with a small feature which appears similar to a wire under the jacket running upwards from the right.

[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:43.660]
In the second and third debates the jacket has a generally padded shape across the large part of the entire back which tapers inward toward the spine in a downward direction.

[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:49.560]
This is consistent with the hypothesis that a pad was inserted to conceal the T-shaped device seen in the first debate.

[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.360]
How do you like that?

[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.660]
When in doubt I'm going to link it out right now.

[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:02.420]
Also a hundred and no 13,000 ballots left from voting site must be recounted. This was in Valuja County.

[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:15.280]
A glitzing of voting machine at an early polling place in Valuja County is forcing election officials to recount about 13,000 ballots that were removed from the city island library in Daytona Beach and transported away secure vault in the land after an optical scan machine failed.

[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.200]
You know those are those great new machines they got.

[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.780]
Right. We don't want to have no paper ballots or paper trail. I mean that's that's whole fashion.

[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:27.560]
A computer error was said to be blamed for the failure of the memory card which records the voting data.

[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.260]
Thousands of ballots have to be resubmitted through the voting machines today.

[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:37.380]
The problem includes every ballot cast during the last several weeks of the library when the error was discovered yesterday represented from both parties were notified.

[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.520]
Members of each political party in the canvassing board must witness the recon process today in Daytona Beach.

[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:49.060]
If you're listening to me, you need these little Neil Rogers exclusively on 560-2-8-M.

[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:59.020]
This is the Neil Rogers show. This is your brain. Any questions?

[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.960]
Do you love Blue Collar TV who wants to give them? Then you absolutely hate white collar TV.

[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.220]
Excuse me. Any of you chops game for getting hurt done?

[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.700]
It's the sketched county show about the blue bloods that put the blue collars in their place.

[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.420]
Excuse me, sir. There's a Larry the cable guy awaiting you with the front gates.

[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.580]
Very well. Release the house.

[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:24.640]
Larry!

[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:32.400]
If you spend winners in Astrid and summers in the heavens, you'll want to spend your evenings watching white collar TV.

[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:40.300]
Suddenly I have a good one for you. If I pay you minimum wage to detail my Bentley, you might be written.

[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.600]
White collar TV.

[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.120]
Can I ask a question, is Steven Baldwin certifiably crazy or what?

[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.260]
Not much about him, personally.

[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:50.380]
He's a crazy person.

[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:50.660]
Okay.

[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:56.460]
He was on last night at MSNBC debating somebody, Ojo Trippi, and he's a religious nut.

[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:57.280]
I said.

[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.640]
Crazy person.

[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.400]
Steven Baldwin. He's part of that fight earth crowd.

[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.480]
You know, the Bush right wing.

[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:01.860]
I see.

[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.120]
I see.

[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:02.260]
I see.

[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:02.400]
I see.

[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:02.400]

[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:02.480]
I see.

[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:02.500]
I see.

[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:02.540]
I see.

[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:02.580]
I see.

[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:03.700]
I see.

[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:04.960]
I see.

[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:05.280]

[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:05.280]

[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:05.380]

[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:05.380]

[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.060]
I see.

[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:07.520]
I see.

[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:09.700]
I see.

[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.160]
I see.

[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:12.020]

[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:12.280]
I see.

[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.300]
I see.

[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:15.280]
charity.

[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:30.040]
The sort of things that Go contrarily was conducive in this series to police?

[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:30.760]
I've never had that, so I've never seen anyone, and it's so pretty this entire day.

[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:39.960]
All God knows is me, and I shouldn't have shown the idiots me.

[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.140]
I've never seen anyone and not insult my ridiculous attitude against everyone.

[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.420]
Great.

[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:47.640]
And they are now today proud to say voting for change.

[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.800]
They don't necessarily love Kerry, but because they're better informed, they've made a better

[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:57.040]
choice and they know that we need a change in government.

[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.820]
And I hold you responsible for that and I'm calling you today to thank you.

[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.280]
Well, thank you and great job.

[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:02.880]
Thanks a lot.

[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:03.220]
Bye-bye.

[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.580]
How do you like that?

[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:05.660]
That's wonderful.

[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:09.380]
This is feel like we're accomplishing a little bit of something as opposed to the heavy

[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.860]
breeders that we hear from most days.

[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:17.120]
Now, seriously, last week or so, the traffic on our website has been phenomenal.

[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:17.960]
I mean, just unbelievable.

[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:18.940]
Through the roof.

[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.860]
I just emailed that the story with a picture of Bush and the jacket and the listening device.

[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.880]
Now, I mean, anybody who wants to be even a little bit subjective, who's got an IQ

[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.360]
larger than six, knows that we're dealing with a man who's got a limited vocabulary and

[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.800]
a limited inlet.

[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:35.240]
Okay.

[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.360]
I'm trying to be kind.

[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:36.900]
All right.

[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:42.260]
But the idea that someone who aspires to be an already has stolen a presidency once

[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:46.200]
and aspires to be present for another four years, the idea that he needs to be coached

[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.020]
in order to he's not smart.

[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.160]
The people around him are.

[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:49.840]
Yeah, right.

[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.660]
Like Dick Cheney.

[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:50.860]
Right.

[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.240]
Here's a call from P. Ryan.

[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:54.560]
Hello.

[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:56.440]
Hello.

[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:57.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.420]
For me.

[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.320]
That's why I just said P. Ryan.

[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:03.360]
Oh, P. Ryan.

[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:03.960]
Okay.

[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.280]
I just want to let you know a little vote report down in P. Ryan.

[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.960]
All four of my family got him all the vote for Carrie.

[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:10.800]
All right.

[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:16.360]
And we all sent Catherine Rundle packing, even though you had to vote for a Republican to

[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:16.720]
do it.

[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:24.620]
And we're standing in line in the two Ryan voting area and over here some old Spanish people

[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.880]
talking and saying, oh, vote for Carrie is a vote for communist.

[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:28.480]
A communist.

[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.220]
A human.

[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.140]
A human communist.

[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:31.720]
Yeah.

[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:32.320]
What a shit.

[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.480]
Hey, George, can't you do something about your people or what?

[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.380]
Yeah, sure.

[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:36.360]
Okay.

[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.060]
As long as you said, you're going to do something I'm fine with that.

[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:39.900]
Good luck, pal.

[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.020]
Hey, you take it.

[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:41.720]
Okay.

[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.160]
And you too.

[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:42.860]
I did something.

[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:43.760]
I moved to Broward.

[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:44.520]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.000]
Just like I did years ago.

[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.240]
Got that a lot of kindle man.

[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.160]
No speaking in English.

[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:49.580]
I keep.

[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.600]
So I just got that one of their minutes.

[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.980]
So one of those things and yeah, you know, eventually people will die.

[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.680]
No, I was going to, I'm not going to say anything else like anything stupid.

[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.100]
Like they're going to like fit in and let start, you know, no, they just died.

[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.560]
They only hope you they are another 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.

[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:13.020]
All those old exilios, man, when at the one dimensional at bull crap and like I said,

[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:16.900]
the other day they get fed reinforcements from QBA and all those other, I know, speaking

[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:20.300]
of lay stations with their lies and their slander and their crap 24, 7.

[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.920]
The FCC doesn't care about it.

[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.440]
Nobody else cares about it because they're speaking another language.

[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.760]
The FCC can't be bothered hiring Spanish language people understand.

[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.100]
So they just go on and lie and swear into whatever they want.

[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:33.420]
Tonight.

[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:38.220]
There's a dig chainy with a woman with a bull-dike daughter that they're so embarrassed.

[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.260]
See, when you stop and think about that really, what a slam that is.

[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.900]
It's kind of like the Chinese went back into their homophobic past of just a year or two

[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.080]
ago and his whole career.

[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.200]
I mean, the idea that anybody would mention that their daughter who's a gay activist

[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.940]
no less for a very homophobic course company, the idea that mentioning that is somehow a

[00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:01.500]
shot or a slam, when they're the ones that mentioned in the first place in the interview,

[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.500]
she's out.

[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:07.260]
So the idea that somebody behind it and find his gay is just telling you that they don't

[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.340]
want to offend the homophobic flight earth crowd, which is about 90% of their vote.

[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.220]
Here's Hialia.

[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:14.600]
Hello.

[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:15.380]
Neil.

[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.280]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:16.940]
How are you doing?

[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.020]
Sensational.

[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:24.140]
I went to vote in Miami Springs and I got in line like at 8.30 in the morning and

[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.580]
I was out the line.

[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.560]
I was got finished voting at 1020.

[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.200]
Wow.

[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.480]
So it was really impressive how many people showed up.

[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:32.720]
Yeah, but that's not a goal.

[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.900]
What was it, Miami Springs?

[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.920]
Miami Springs in precinct for what is it?

[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:37.880]
Three, 46.

[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.320]
Well, what kind of people were there?

[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:40.140]
Were there young people there?

[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.300]
Well, Miami Springs is a lot of Americans.

[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.060]
Right.

[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:50.820]
Well, there were some always some middle, you know, not.

[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.880]
I was hoping maybe some Japanese would be there to vote.

[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:53.240]
Right.

[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.000]
But it was impressive.

[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:58.600]
Well, good job.

[00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.340]
All right, Neil.

[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.120]
Thanks, Pali.

[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:00.480]
Back.

[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.760]
Go over again this afternoon just to make sure it counts.

[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:08.520]
This business about the idea that Democrats are going to try to find dead people to vote.

[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.200]
What's wrong with that?

[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.840]
It's always been good enough in Dave County, right?

[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.060]
Why do you think we're called Dave County?

[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.400]
All they did was rearrange the letters.

[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.780]
All they wanted to do was suppress your vote.

[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.780]
I'm going to say it again.

[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.740]
All you dark folks out there, I'm talking about real dark black is the ace of spades.

[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.160]
You ought to like round up about 10 of your close friends.

[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.400]
Jam them in the back of your pickup truck and get on over to your nearest polling place

[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.340]
and demand a vote.

[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:30.660]
Okay.

[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:31.980]
Give them the old what for?

[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:36.220]
And also demand like some free chicken to while you're waiting those long lines, right?

[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:37.060]
Right.

[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.080]
I'm tired of this crap.

[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:44.980]
The idea that 16 or 18% of black America is going to vote for Bush while his surrogates

[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:48.460]
are doing everything in their power to keep black people to suppress the black vote,

[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.600]
to use their exact terms.

[00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.420]
If we're going to win Michigan, we've got to suppress the black vote in Detroit.

[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.700]
We've got to do everything in our power to suppress the black vote.

[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.940]
What kind of honesty is that?

[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.380]
What kind of compassionate conservative?

[00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.520]
What kind of bull crap?

[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.960]
Just like Kerry said that Dave that they thought they caught him off, you know, they had

[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.460]
that, and see, this is the one thing that Kerry did bothers me.

[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.200]
If it would have been Howard Dean, he would have said, yeah, that's what I said in

[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:08.620]
I meant it.

[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:12.080]
These are the most crooked, the most rotten, the most miserable bastards on the face of

[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:12.180]
there.

[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.120]
And he would have stood up to it.

[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.340]
That's correct.

[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.440]
But, you know, just like the fact when they asked me, I said, I'm not sure if I'm going

[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.120]
to be able to do this during the debate.

[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.520]
See, Kerry's got himself between a rock and a hard place.

[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.820]
The next hour points out very clearly, this crowd of neocons thought this would be a push

[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:26.100]
over.

[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:26.940]
I'm walking apart.

[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:28.380]
That's right.

[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:28.860]
Right.

[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:34.600]
But instead what they did is sacrifice so far over 100 American men and women who didn't

[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.220]
have a chance to live a life and you people sit back out there with blood.

[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.400]
Do you bush people, man?

[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:40.420]
I know we've got some listening.

[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.520]
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:42.920]
How do you look yourself in a mirror?

[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:43.680]
It's worth it.

[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:44.320]
It's worth it.

[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.480]
Yeah, is that what it is?

[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.480]
They're going to make us safer and more.

[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:52.100]
They have made the world so much more dangerous now than it was before 9-11.

[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:55.000]
There's no way to even estimate it to calculate it.

[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:55.780]
He was dangerous, man.

[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:56.680]
Yeah, right.

[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.440]
No, there's a dangerous man.

[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.780]
I'll write and he's the one that's going to get his ass tossed out in the election

[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.800]
today unless they find another way to steal it.

[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.320]
Soperkin.

[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.060]
And believe you, me, they're working as I speak.

[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.920]
They're working favoritiously in state after state.

[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:12.680]
Every state that's within 100,000 votes to do whatever the hell they can to steal it

[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:12.960]
again.

[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.280]
Because that was the only way they could get in in 2000.

[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.380]
And that's the only way they'll be able to do it again.

[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.220]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:20.460]
Hello.

[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:21.940]
Hello, Nea.

[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:22.280]
Hi.

[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.240]
Pretty good, pal.

[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.340]
You are the best.

[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:24.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.200]
And I'm the head of the Democratic National Committee.

[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.240]
I want to thank you.

[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:36.360]
And I mean, you gave up some of your ratings, obviously, in this last August run to keep

[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.660]
talking, but people don't want to hear.

[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:41.640]
And I'm not rating.

[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:42.280]
I'm not.

[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.380]
I'm not.

[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:49.360]
And you, you march in the late 60s and early 70s.

[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.100]
No, I get the 18 year olds to write the vote.

[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.180]
This is their time.

[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.480]
Well, they're going to be out there, man.

[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.540]
18 to 29 year olds.

[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:57.100]
That's right.

[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:57.900]
That's right.

[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.280]
That's one of your demographics.

[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:04.520]
And they have to assert themselves, stay in line for three hours.

[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.320]
Whatever it takes, stay there.

[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:08.120]
That's right.

[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.200]
And if they get bored, George is coming by with a free.

[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.100]
He's got a little bag.

[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.100]
Mm-hmm.

[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:12.680]
Right?

[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.520]
He's got some good crap that he got at the barbershop over there in Little Jamaica.

[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.500]
Full of free chicken.

[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:17.780]
I got a, that's what we got.

[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:18.280]
No, I need chickens.

[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.220]
No, no.

[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:19.800]
Cool chicken.

[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.140]
You got like a, a glad bag, little Ziploc.

[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.500]
I'm glad I have a bag.

[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:26.380]
Yeah.

[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:27.680]
Well, maybe you can get rid of it.

[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.220]
Anyway, in the next down, I'm going to read this.

[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.400]
And I know it's long and ponderous.

[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.840]
I want to get a lot of calls on here today.

[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:38.020]
But let me just say to you right now that this story by this article by Russ Baker tells

[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:41.960]
you all you need to know about the wise and aware force, what this was all about.

[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.420]
And I'm going to read right now for those who are already churning off because they want

[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.160]
to hear Russ and his right wing propaganda.

[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:52.960]
That last sentence quoting this, a herscu-witz that was hired by the Bushmeister himself to

[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.640]
write the biography.

[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.200]
And then of course they didn't like what he was writing.

[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.320]
It wasn't sucky enough so they, they carried somebody else.

[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:04.020]
He says the best material was left on the cutting room floor, including Bush's true feelings.

[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:08.580]
He told me that as a leader, you can never admit to a mistake, herscu-witz said that was

[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:09.840]
one of the keys to being a leader.

[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:15.660]
And so this is why both in that one press conference they keep showing us in the Democratic

[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:19.220]
ad where he's having a high, well, I really can't think of one right now.

[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.880]
And that one, and then of course during the debate when I woman asked him and then he tried

[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.620]
to turn it around.

[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.480]
Well, I know what you're really talking about is Iraq.

[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.360]
And when somebody says that, then we, no, that's not what he was asking.

[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:31.580]
He was asking him to show a little humility and admit that he had made mistakes.

[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:37.120]
But being a strong leader and using this baloney about, well, he's strong, he's a cowboy,

[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.240]
he's tough on terrorism, he's going to go out there and smoke him out of their holes.

[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.880]
You can't admit no mistakes.

[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.000]
Press great leaders don't make mistakes.

[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.800]
You are listening to me.

[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:48.560]
You're listening to me.

[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.940]
Excuse me, on 560.

[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:52.640]
Su-A-R.

[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:58.920]
This mark, Morgan, is the 12 to 1 hour on Q-A-M.

[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:04.220]
In video stores now, the explosive Fahrenheit 7-E-Leaven.

[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.040]
Holy moly!

[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.180]
What are you doing here?

[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.980]
I want peanut butter and jelly.

[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:11.560]
Yes, yes.

[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:16.220]
And they're organic, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're,

[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.400]
I'm sorry, I do not speak English.

[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.880]
But I am shut-cup.

[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.560]
I am shut-cup.

[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:22.660]

[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.500]
Is in this nature's interesting.

[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.320]
I'm shut-cup.

[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.940]
Oh, I, who give it, huh?

[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.300]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, you bastard.

[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.640]
Fahrenheit 7-E-Leaven.

[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.820]
I want jackdangles.

[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:33.480]
Shut-cup.

[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.280]
We did see for convenience.

[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.460]
Probably one at 560 W. Q.M. we got the mad dog Jim Madditch who's going to be really

[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:42.000]
moaning and groaning after that last, perfor-letten performance last night.

[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:43.580]
That was pathetic.

[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:49.460]
And when what did I tell you, Josh, that, that was an aberration of Rams that had played on a

[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.080]
Monday night game.

[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.460]
They didn't practice for two days.

[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:55.200]
They got in and down real late the night before it again.

[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.340]
They didn't, they missed a bus.

[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.740]
And that's why the dolphins looked so sensational last week.

[00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.260]
Am I right?

[00:53:59.440 --> 00:53:59.660]
You are.

[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.960]
And then they go up there to the metallands last night, play a real team.

[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.200]
And by the way, the jets are a good team.

[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:04.760]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:05.420]
Play a real team.

[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.260]
And they get their ass just destroyed.

[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:08.740]
41 to 14.

[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.940]
My ass, it could have been 141 to zip.

[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.180]
If they really wanted to put the pedal to the metal, anyway,

[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.740]
Russ Baker, right now what we're going to do this hour, we'll do just three breaks.

[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:19.080]
Okay.

[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:19.640]
Can you handle that?

[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:20.740]
Yeah.

[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.100]
Because we got no business today because it's election day.

[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.300]
And you know, it's the second of the month in the sales department.

[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.480]
So off their feet or whatever the excuse is this, whatever the deal is.

[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.400]
So we'll just do three.

[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.380]
So you can take a couple of from the last breaking like spread them around.

[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:37.660]
In 1999, candidate Bush spoke of wanting to invade a racket elected this by Russ Baker.

[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:40.460]
Very famous comments rights for the times, lot of other good publications.

[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:56.040]
Houston, two years before the September 11th attacks, presidential candidate George W. Bush was already talking privately about the political benefits of attacking Iraq according to his former ghost writer who held many conversations with the then Texas governor Bush in preparation for a planned autobiography.

[00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:00.880]
He was thinking about invading Iraq in 1999 said author and journalist Mickey Huskowitz.

[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.000]
It was on his mind.

[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.440]
He said to me, one of the keys is being seen as a great leader is to be seen as a commander in chief.

[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:11.820]
And he said, my father had all this political capital built up when he drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait and he wasted it.

[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.020]
He said, if I have a chance to invade, if I had that much capital, I'm not going to waste it.

[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:20.180]
If I'm going to get everything passed that I want to get passed, I'm going to have a successful presidency.

[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:25.900]
Huskowitz said that Bush expressed frustration at a lifetime as an underachiever in the shadow of an accomplished father.

[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:30.240]
In aggressive military action, he saw the opportunity to emerge from his father's shadow.

[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:37.640]
The moment Huskowitz said came in the wake of the 9-11 attacks, suddenly he's at 91 percent of the polls need barely crawled out of the bunker.

[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:52.280]
That president Bush and his advisors had a rack on their minds long before the weapons inspectors had finished their work and long before alleged Iraqi ties with terrorists became a central rationale for war has been raised elsewhere, including a book based on recollections of former tertiary secretary Paulo Neal.

[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.000]
However, Huskowitz was in a unique position to hear Bush's unguarded numfids.

[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.080]
The publisher was William Moral.

[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:03.980]
Huskowitz was given unimpeded access to Bush in two met approximately twenty times, so Bush could hear his thoughts.

[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:13.160]
Huskowitz began working on the book in May 1999 and says that within two months he'd completed and submitted some ten chapters, with a remaining four to six chapters still in his computer.

[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:21.860]
Huskowitz was replaced as Bush's ghost writer after Bush's handles concluded that the candidate's views and life experiences were not being cast in a sufficiently positive light.

[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:39.520]
According to Huskowitz, who's authored more than thirty books, many of them jointly written autobiographies of famous Americans in politics, sports, and the media, including that of Reagan, advisor Michael Dever, Bushness advisors were sold on the idea that it was difficult for president to accomplish an electoral agenda without the record high of proof of numbers that a company successful if modest wars.

[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:57.460]
The revelations on Bush's attitude toward Iraq emerged recently during two taped interviews of Huskowitz, which included discussion of a variety of matters, including his continued closeness with the Bush family, indicated by a subsequent selection dependent authorised biography of Bush's grandfather, written and published last year with the assistance and blushing of the Bush family.

[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:11.660]
Huskowitz also revealed the following. In 2003, Bush's father indicated to him that he disagreed with his son's invasion of Iraq. Bush admitted that he failed to fulfill his Vietnam-era domestic National Guard service obligation, but claimed that he had been excused.

[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:18.920]
Bush revealed that after he left his Texas National Guard unit in 1972 under murky circumstances, he never piloted a plane again.

[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:29.840]
That cast is doubt on the carefully choreographed moment of Bush emerging in pilot's guard from a jet on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in 2003 to celebrate mission accomplished in Iraq.

[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:39.200]
The image instantly telegraphed around the globe and subsequent hazy what-how statements about his capacity in the cockpit created the impression that a heroic Bush had played a role in landing the craft.

[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:45.880]
Bush described his own business ventures as floundering before campaign officials insisted on recasting them in a positive light.

[00:57:47.100 --> 00:58:00.920]
Throughout the interviews for this article in subsequent conversations, Huskowitz indicated he was conflicted over revealing information provided by a family with which he's long-time connections and by how his candor would comport with the undefined operating principles of the as told to genre.

[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:15.440]
Well, after the interviews in which he expressed consternation at Bush's true views, experience and basic essence had eluded the American people, Huskowitz communicated growing concerned about the consequences for himself of the publication of his remarks and said he'd been under the impression he would not be quoted by name.

[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:23.560]
However, when conversations began, it was made clear to him that the material was intended for publication and attribution. A tape recorder was present and visible at all times.

[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:35.860]
Several people who know Huskowitz well addressed his character in the veracity of his recollections, I don't know anybody that's ever said a bad word about Mickey said very silverman well known Houston executive and civic figure who worked with him on another book project.

[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:43.140]
An informal survey of Texas journalist turned up uniform confidence that Huskowitz's account as contained in this article could be considered accurate.

[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:53.280]
One noted Texas journalist who spoke with Huskowitz about the book in 1999 because how the author mentioned him at the time that Bush had revealed things the campaign found embarrassing and didn't want in print.

[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:57.800]
He requested an inimity because of the political climate in the state, I can't go near this he said.

[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:09.120]
According to Huskowitz, George W. Bush's beliefs on Iraq were based in part on a notion dating back to the Reagan White House, ascribed in part to now vice president Dick Cheney, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee under Reagan.

[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:14.580]
Start a small war, pick a country where there's justification you can jump on, go ahead and invade.

[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:33.500]
Bush's circle of pre-election advisors had a fixation on the political capital that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher collected from the Falcans War, said Huskowitz that were just absolutely blown away just enthralled by the scenes of the troops coming back of the boats, people throwing flowers at Thatcher and are getting these standing ovation in Parliament and making these magnificent speeches.

[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:40.620]
Republicans, Huskowitz, said felt that Jimmy Carter's political downfall could be attributed largely to his failure to wage a war.

[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:51.280]
He noted that President Reagan and President Bush's father himself had, besides the nearly focused Gulf War I, successfully wage limited wars against tiny opponents, Grinay Dan Panema and gained politically.

[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:58.880]
But there were successful, these were successful, small wars, and then there were Cragmires and apparently George Herbert Walker Bush and his son didn't see eye to eye.

[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:07.760]
I know Bush's senior would not admit to this now, but he was opposed to it. I asked him if he had talked to W about invading Iraq, he said, no I haven't and I won't, but Brent Scowcroft has.

[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.080]
Brent would not have talked to him without the old man's okaying it.

[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:19.660]
Scowcroft, National Security Advisor and the Elder Bush's Administration, penned a highly publicized warning George W. Bush about the perils of an invasion of Iraq.

[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:36.740]
Huskowitz's revelations are not the sole indicator of Bush's pre-election thinking in Iraq. In December 1999, some six months after his talks with Huskowitz, Bush surprised veteran political chroniclers, including the Boston Globes David Nyhan, with his blunt pronouncements about Sodom at a six-way New Hampshire primary event that got a little notice.

[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.120]
It was a gaffery evening for the rookie frontrunner, until he was asked about Sodom's weapon-stash wrote Nyhan,

[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:51.660]
I take him out Bush grin, carefully, take out the weapons of mass destruction, I'm surprised he's still there, said Bush of the despot remains in power after losing Gulf War to Bush Jr's father.

[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:58.360]
It remains to be seen if that offhand declaration of war was just Texas talk, sort of locker room braggadocio, or whether it was Bush's first big clinker.

[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:10.180]
The notion that President Bush held unrealistic rnive views about the consequences of war was further advanced recently by a Bush supporter, the evangelist Pat Robertson, who revealed that Bush had told him the Iraq invasion would yield no casualties.

[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:17.940]
In addition in recent days, high ranking US military officials have complained that the White House did not provide them with adequate resources for the task at hand.

[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:23.440]
Huskowitz considers himself a friend of the Bush family and has been a guest at the Family Vacation Home in Canne-Bunkport.

[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:34.980]
In the late 1960s, Huskowitz, a long time Houston Chronicle sports columnist, designated President Bush's father, then Congressman George H. W. Bush, to replace him as a guest columnist, and the two remained close since then.

[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:43.220]
Huskowitz was suspended briefly in April without pay for refusing material for reusing material from one of his own columns about legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden.

[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:52.740]
In 1999, when Huskowitz turned in his chapters for charge to keep, Bush's staff expressed his pleasure, often over Huskowitz's use of language provided by Bush himself.

[01:01:53.300 --> 01:02:00.940]
In a chapter on the oil business, Huskowitz included Bush's own words to describe the Texans, unprofitable business ventures writing, the companies were floundering.

[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.920]
I got a call from one of the campaign lawyers who said he was kind of angry, you've got some wrong information.

[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:11.480]
I didn't bother to say what you know where it came from. The lawyer said we don't consider the governor struggled or floundered in the oil business.

[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.960]
We consider him a successful oilman who started up at least two new businesses.

[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:21.160]
In the end, campaign officials decided not to go with Huskowitz's account and moreover demanded everything back.

[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.380]
The lawyer called me and said, delete it, shred it, just do it.

[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:29.020]
They took it and the communications director Karen Hughes rewrote it, he said.

[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:34.000]
A campaign official arrived at his home at seven o'clock in the morning on a Monday morning, took his notes in computer files.

[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:40.880]
However, Huskowitz, who's known for his memory of anecdotes from his long history and journalism and book publishing, says he's very confident about his recollections.

[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:47.280]
According to Huskowitz, Bush was reluctant to discuss his airtime in the Texas Air National Guard and inconsistently did so.

[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:54.980]
Bush said provided conflicting explanations about how he came to bypass a waiting list and obtained a coveted guard slot as a domestic alternative to being sent to Vietnam.

[01:02:55.500 --> 01:03:08.080]
Huskowitz also said that Bush told him that after transferring from his Texas Guard unit two thirds through a six-year military obligation to work on an Alabama political campaign, he did not attend any Alabama National Guard rules at all because he was excused.

[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:13.520]
This directly contradicts his public statement that he participated in a obligatory training with the Alabama National Guard.

[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:27.940]
Bush has claimed to have fulfilled his military duty has been subject to intense scrutiny. He's insisted in the past that he did show up for monthly drills in Alabama, though commanding officers say they never saw him, and no guardsmen have come forward to accept substantial rewards for anyone who can claim to have seen Bush on the base.

[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:37.980]
Huskowitz said he asked Bush if he ever flew a plane again after leaving the Texas Air National Guard in 1972, which was two years prior to his contractual obligation to fly jets was due to a spire.

[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:50.420]
He said Bush told him he never flew any planes, military or civilian again. That would contradict published accounts in which Bush talked about his days in 1973 working with inner city children when he claimed to have taken some of the children up in a plane.

[01:03:51.720 --> 01:04:03.040]
In 2002, three years after he had been pulled off the George W. Bush biography, Huskowitz was asked by Bush's father to write a book about the current president's grandfather, Prescott Bush, after getting a message that the senior Bush wanted to see him.

[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:15.320]
Former president Bush just handed it to me. We were sitting there one day and I was visiting him there in his office. He said, I wish somebody would do a book about my dad. He said to me, I know this has been a disappointing time for you, but it's amazing how many times something good will come out of it.

[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:21.420]
I passed it on to my agent. He jumped all over to ask Bush senior would you support it and would you give me answers to the rest of the family? He said yes.

[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:34.020]
That book, duty honor country, the life and legacy of Prescott Bush was published in 2003 by Rutledge. If anything the book's office considered the ultimate as told to author, lending credibility was the account of what George W. Bush told him.

[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:46.140]
Huskowitz's other books run the gamut of public figures including the memoirs of Reagan A. Diver, former Texas governor and Nixon Treasury secretary John Conley, newsman Dan Radder, astronaut Walter Cunningham, and baseball greats Mickey Madeline Nolan Ryan.

[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:56.800]
After Huskowitz was pulled from the Bush book project, the blogger for learn that a scenario was being prepared to explain his departure. I got a phone call from someone in the Bush campaign, confidentially saying, watch your back.

[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:07.300]
Reporters covering Bush say that when the inquiries to why Huskowitz was no longer on the project, Karen Hughes intimated that Huskowitz had personal habits that interfered with his writing, claim Huskowitz said is totally unfounded.

[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:17.960]
Later the campaign put out the word that Huskowitz had been removed from missing a deadline. He was subsequently finished the book herself and received largely critical views for its self-serving qualities and lack of a spontaneity or introspection.

[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:29.420]
So said Huskowitz the best material was left on the cutting room floor including Bush's true feelings. He told me that as a leader you can never admit to a mistake Huskowitz said that was one of the keys to being a leader.

[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:48.660]
That's it. Worth reading again I think over and over again. That tells you where to mindset is that tells you this whole Republican plan of invading Iraq. They thought it was going to be another grenade, another piece of cake. Surprise. Surprise. You can't spell Kragmire without Iraq. Got it.

Nobody that's got the kind of power that the president of the United States has got should be stupid and stubborn sealed.

[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:16.720]

[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:16.860]
You're having a lot of money.

You're having a lot of money.

[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:20.420]
And God is for this and God bubbly.

[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:21.940]
And God bubbly.

[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:21.940]

[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:21.940]

[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:21.940]

[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:21.940]

[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:21.940]

[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.680]
It was incredible.

[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.220]
He made Robert's and look like an atheist.

[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.780]
Anyway, no matter what you believe about Carburet cleaning.

[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:31.520]
I'll tell you right now.

[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:32.380]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.780]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.800]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.340]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.380]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:52.780]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:52.780]

[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:52.800]

[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.080]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.140]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:57.920]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:58.140 --> 01:15:59.140]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:59.280 --> 01:15:59.600]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:59.600 --> 01:15:59.760]
I know what I believe.

[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:04.520]
I know what I believe.

[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.320]
I know what I believe.

[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.120]
I know what I believe.

[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:17.320]
I know what I believe.

[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.580]
Indeed, Robert and Palm Beach County Column Tool Free,

[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.420]
1-800-248-5071.

[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.280]
1-800-248-5071.

[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:29.580]
On a wicked web, you can find more information about the great work they'll do for you at dryconcepts.com.

[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.260]
That's dry concepts making Carburet's clean in South Florida since 1979.

[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.860]
The Housetown, the Aronters, mornings and the days and

[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:43.480]
the world of crime, the crisis, the way out.

[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:46.960]
You're a drugspacken.

[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:46.960]

[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:47.780]
Woo-hoo!

[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.720]
Woo-hoo!

[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:52.780]

[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.480]
Woo-hoo!

[01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:59.580]
We're about 10 years too late.

[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.560]
Yeah, that's when things were great.

[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:03.160]
It went in with President.

[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.440]
Okay, it was innocent.

[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.600]
But we can still see friends.

[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.400]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.600]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.300]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:28.360]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:28.700]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:28.700]

[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:28.700]

[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:28.720]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:28.720]

[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:28.760]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:28.760]

[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:28.760]

[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.020]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.300]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.560]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.640]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:43.280]
And we can still see friends.

[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.360]
But nothing went wrong since 1991.

[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.320]
1991.

[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:59.160]
You know Mariah and Whitney.

[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.120]
They beat the pins up Whitney.

[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.320]
We still had some teasers.

[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:06.080]
But also there was Wizard and we had Sophie.

[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.180]
Be Hawkins.

[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.160]
Yes, she was good for Dawkins.

[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.820]
I wondered if she survived that.

[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:19.340]
1994 by Teddy Erick did a spectacular job with those pictures on the website.

[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.700]
Did Erick do that? I'm sure he did.

[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:21.240]
He did.

[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:22.420]
And Josh.

[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.240]
And there's it's there.

[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.520]
And that ain't no wrinkled shirt.

[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.680]
All of us who ever want a shirt, men, women or children, have had wrinkled shirts.

[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.980]
There ain't no wrinkled shirt that makes a shape like that.

[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.140]
See, I thought it was a bulletproof vest in the beginning.

[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:36.060]
Yeah.

[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.260]
Because that wouldn't be so far patched.

[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:39.740]
Yeah.

[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.560]
No, no.

[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:42.660]
Pennsylvania.

[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.340]
It shows Carrie 49, Bush 48.

[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.580]
So these humongous turnouts that we're getting and the 18 to 29 year vote.

[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.040]
And of course those cell phone people.

[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:53.720]
You are yesterday.

[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:55.500]
But I had an interesting Zogby pull.

[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:58.760]
In the last night, I don't know how come it is that I can find it on the internet.

[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:05.180]
But these people that they pay a lot of money to like a pack you can in these other goofballs they have on his talking head networks.

[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:06.820]
How come they don't see these articles?

[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:10.200]
John Zogby did the first pull of cell phone people.

[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:11.820]
The people who used these.

[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.340]
It was in congestion with the rock to vote, the rock with Motorola.

[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.360]
And it was 55 to 44 Carrie.

[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:27.440]
Yeah, which mirrors almost exactly the 18 to 29 year old pulling right now, which was 5541 for Carrie.

[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:30.940]
So we get those younger people out to vote in droves today.

[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:31.680]
Which they're predicting.

[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:35.920]
And of course, then a lot of people say, well, anytime it candidates, it's dependent on the young crowd to come on vote.

[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.780]
They never show up. They always let them down.

[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.060]
So it's up to you folks, the living and breathing crowd.

[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.720]
Devon, faxed and says, have you heard that in Philadelphia in two different precincts voting machines have been found with pre-set votes for Bush?

[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.980]
Let's see, is that a two or a set 200 and 501 place, three hundred and in the other?

[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.760]
And that's just the ones that they caught.

[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.380]
How many do you think got by? How many thousand?

[01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:58.340]
Thirty man.

[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:00.300]
How do you like that?

[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:01.560]
Well, he's got to get a head start.

[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:03.660]
Like I said, the other dance is head start program.

[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:04.280]
What help?

[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.040]
Here's the facts that says from chip.

[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.760]
My oldest daughter is wife of a Baptist minister in a church on the shores of Okachoby.

[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.260]
We've been arguing for the past months on the issues that always comes back to her religious beliefs.

[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:20.240]
And how sure she is that W is ordained by God to lead this country.

[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.560]
Oh my God.

[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.680]
Oh my God.

[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:26.900]
I emailed the link of W shooting the bird. Now she's finally disappointed, not president.

[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.620]
Show the religion something they feel is elit.

[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:32.160]
The least bit offensive and all of a sudden you have their attention.

[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:36.680]
Why not tell her about that abortion that he arranged for that girlfriend in his years ago in Texas

[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.540]
that he drove her right to the abortion clinic?

[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:41.460]
I only wish you had this on your side a week earlier.

[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:44.000]
Maybe I could have persuaded her with your help not to vote for this bastard.

[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:47.780]
Thanks anyway Neil for everything you and your webboys do when don't stop when was this video made.

[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:48.700]
I don't know.

[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:49.960]
Reese had hired her.

[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:50.700]
I don't know.

[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:52.460]
He was just fun and you know.

[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.260]
Right. He's a fun guy.

[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:55.260]
He's a fun guy.

[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.840]
Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello.

[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.200]
Are you going to need a thing to film a call?

[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.620]
Yes sir. Thanks for letting me go.

[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.700]
I voted number Hollywood. I voted number four on the poll there about an hour ago.

[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.800]
Yes, it was the button very easy.

[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:12.500]
Also I'd like to say the carry is going to win.

[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.200]
I hope so.

[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.040]
What do you think?

[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:14.980]
I hope.

[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.860]
And I'd like to say there was a fellow there doing some entertainment.

[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.600]
They called themselves the great one.

[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:20.500]
Oh yeah, really.

[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:20.960]
Uh-huh.

[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:23.920]
567.0560.

[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:24.300]
The number five.

[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.020]
He's a partner called earlier.

[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.100]
That was the Democratic whatever that guy was.

[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:29.700]
That was him.

[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.180]
But nevertheless.

[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.660]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.200]
Hi Neil. How are you?

[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:36.780]
Okay.

[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.200]
Uh-uh.

[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:45.260]
As far as the, um, which day is more and more right now I think is Ohio because I think he's going to carry floorla by over a hundred thousand votes.

[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:45.900]
Really?

[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:53.900]
I believe me because I think in the last election, um, if you looked at it, carry got, I mean, um, bush got all hundred percent.

[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.840]
Of Muslim votes in Florida.

[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:58.000]
Uh, he's not going to get that this time.

[01:21:58.140 --> 01:21:59.700]
And I think it's going to be huge difference.

[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:00.160]
There's a hundred thousand.

[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.900]
The Muslim poll is like 10 to one for carry.

[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:04.200]
10 out of every last time.

[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:04.200]

[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.060]
Um, nine out of 10 are for carry.

[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.340]
And if there was the other way around the last time.

[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:08.840]
Really?

[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.400]
That's a huge difference.

[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.040]
And if the turnout shows up the way, they're going.

[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:17.920]
And if gold last time took the county by 40,000 votes and lost by 537.

[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:23.260]
If he gets day-chowny by some estimate that's higher than 100,000, I don't think bush could cover that much.

[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:23.840]
Yeah.

[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.180]
That's a large number of carry Florida.

[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.540]
Yes, first of all, we get this again.

[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:26.980]
Turn off.

[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.780]
You do the language they use for Iraq.

[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.360]
Just replace communism with terrorism.

[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.220]
And you see the same thing they're trying to feed you.

[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:39.640]
They told you it's, if America leaves Southeast Vietnam, all that Southeast Vietnam will turn to communism.

[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.040]
The same thing they say by the right.

[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.820]
If we lose their terrorists, we'll win.

[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.200]
We cannot lose face.

[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:44.920]
The same thing.

[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:52.880]
And if you look at the colon, Powell, Doctrine, what they use in the first goal for, they use 750,000 troops.

[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.760]
Or with the world to just move somebody out.

[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:56.240]
Yeah.

[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:58.860]
They didn't have enough troops to go in the first place.

[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.800]
You look at the sample of Ireland with the British.

[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.280]
British use two soldiers or policemen for every thousand...

[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:12.060]
How come the media just kind of let it glossed on by when Paul Bremer, who was their own hand-picked head-oncho over there,

[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:16.540]
came back in just a couple of weeks ago, said, we never had enough troops over there on the ground in the first place.

[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.920]
We needed half a million troops for an occupation in the country.

[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:25.960]
The reason is because Bush, given credit, they suckered the media by embedding the media in the military.

[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:26.700]
That's right.

[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:27.920]
And they painted a Iran...

[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:28.840]
It's how they brought them off.

[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:32.000]
Yeah. And every time you say, Operation, you're actually freedom.

[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.400]
What is that marketing tool?

[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.780]
Yeah. You sure? That's exactly what it is.

[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:42.300]
You know, they suckered the media and the media, you know, mainstream media in the United States, has to take the blame for this war.

[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.780]
There are a bunch of horrors just like that made for TV, made for CNN, if that were.

[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.120]
They pulled on the statue, was sawed them, and then we find out later on that there was almost nobody there.

[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.440]
Exactly. And they handpicked those people to show up there.

[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:59.040]
I mean, you look at MSNBC, two or three months ago, every time they still had the flag of all operation, you're actually freedom.

[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:07.800]
Yeah. I mean, could you be more in bed with the administration, the job of a free media is supposed to question each leader, not just submit to it.

[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.700]
Yeah, they weren't embedded. They weren't embedded. They were in bed with...

[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:17.020]
Exactly. I mean, you look at the first president Bush during the same period of time, he had over 300 news conferences.

[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.460]
This president has only had...

[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:23.720]
Somewhere, and she's going on a buy. And this was in Florida about, I think it's a little bit too late, you know?

[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:33.300]
It's a little bit too late to turn back now. Like Cornelius Brothers and Sister Rose might have said, if anybody wanted to buy that record.

[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:35.400]
Here's a lady in Homestead. Hello.

[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.980]
Hey, look at this. We got everything on the...

[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:37.540]
Hi, Neil.

[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.480]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:46.560]
Hi, yeah. I just want you to let you know on the proud mother of a young gentleman that just came back to my wagon couple months ago.

[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:52.040]
And he has... Now he has to go back again next month, and he does not know why he's there.

[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:56.420]
I can feel for every mother that has kids over there.

[01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:01.040]
And I have an 18-year-old who he's voting for the first time this year.

[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:05.660]
And he's surprised me, but he said he was Democrat, or for carry all the way.

[01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:09.740]
I hadn't teach him, you know, no, no, yes, yes, yes, yes.

[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:20.600]
And I just want to let you know coming out from Coal Ridge that I see nice, almost two poles, and I see nothing but carry signs.

[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:22.340]
Probably down U.S. 1.

[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:23.920]
Very, carry, carry.

[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:33.220]
I had a lot of trouble with, you know, I thought that this would be the hardest state for a carry to win because of Jeb Bush.

[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:40.880]
I get a Bush getting win, nothing with Florida. Four years ago, he bought Florida. Thanks to his brother.

[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.540]
Yeah, yeah. That's for sure.

[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.540]
There's nothing about it. He actually bought Florida.

[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.600]
Cancer and Harris may be gone, but Glenda in a hood makes you look like a Sunday picnic.

[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.300]
Oh, yeah, yeah. But anyway, this is what you're going to say every odd.

[01:25:53.780 --> 01:26:00.620]
I know you like poles. And my boyfriend and I took our own poles yesterday from 130 to 6 o'clock.

[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:07.360]
We count to every Bush sign and bumper sticker and every carry sign and bumper sticker.

[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:12.680]
So he came up with 14 to carry 52.

[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.980]
That's it for me. Let's call off the election. I think you've got the number.

[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:29.120]
He's got, I have never in my life seen a band 32 year and I've never seen such a pool for one person for president and South Florida as I have for carry.

[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:35.380]
Truck's going by with big old speakers are wrapping about carry the black and Hispanic.

[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:37.760]
They all got the trucks out with their speakers.

[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:43.320]
I mean, US one is just of them, but Democrat all the way.

[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.720]
Okay, good luck, sweetheart. Thanks.

[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:53.600]
Okay. Bye. 1246 at 560 WQAM Florida 410 votes, which they do things going to be the most pivotal today and Ohio 212.

[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:58.480]
Now, of course, tomorrow morning, early in the morning, there'll be changing votes after they.

[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:01.100]
Oh, no, after my morning tonight, they'll be voting on there.

[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:07.400]
Oh, I think it's this one. You know, I kind of have to the fact, but we'll leave it on there just to make a lot of people out there feel really smart.

[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:09.060]
You know, like, Fredo, and then we'll take them out.

[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:16.200]
Right? Say a few hail Mary's. You know, see, I was thinking the deal I saw.

[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.820]
Did you see the CNN piece over the weekend about religion in America?

[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.620]
Yeah. Well, they saw about eight million times.

[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:23.260]
And they showed the baptism thing.

[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:26.660]
Right. And there is that Getsky in the water with that big white robot.

[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:31.060]
And he's taking these kids and he's putting the old door mouth and submerging them under the water.

[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:36.640]
I did that. And I was thinking to myself, see, the difference between like the born again Christians is the Catholics.

[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:40.940]
Is the Catholics have more, they have more chashkies, right?

[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:50.220]
More trappings. Yeah, they're more trappings. They got the beads and they got the caps and they got all the the miter and the wafers and the wine and the,

[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:54.920]
you know, all of these things out of the other boys don't forget incense and, you know, and peppermints.

[01:27:55.240 --> 01:28:00.380]
I guarantee you one thing. There wouldn't be any Catholic church without older boys.

[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.460]
Let's hear that right now. Or we can point you can bet the Pope's life on it. Note it exactly.

[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.220]
Here's a call from Las Vegas. It says hello.

[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.280]
Nail. Yes, sir.

[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:18.200]
I'm passing by your favorite casino right now. It's a bit Mr. Viva Las Vegas Bob Lincoln.

[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:24.440]
Oh my God. A voice for our distant past. Absolutely. How do you like that?

[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.640]
Everything. It's dead even Thai here in Las Vegas.

[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:41.500]
But the Mr. Cheney Darth Vader was in town yesterday. So they must have been worried because they had to come back.

[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:48.360]
Yeah, they're very presently early in the early voting in the pre-voting. They had a lot more Democrats who up in Republicans like thousands more.

[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:54.160]
200,000 here in Clark County voted early. So which means trouble.

[01:28:54.420 --> 01:29:00.500]
But of course, the big issue here is Yucca Mountain that unstick all the nuclear waste. Right.

[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:08.100]
70 miles from that issue that's going to give that state to carry. Oh, they did. Well, that's good because.

[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:14.660]
I said that that issue alone. That's what's going to put Kerry over the top in Nevada. Oh, yeah. Well, he spent plenty of time here.

[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:20.160]
Yeah, they were backing forth, backing forth. The back back they showed up the same day, Kerry and Bush.

[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:29.180]
And Kerry had way more people come out. But I think the telling factor was Philadelphia when Bill Clinton came out and over 100,000 people showed up.

[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:36.360]
That's got to tell you something. But anyway, I wanted to wish you a happy, uh, Kerry day on the voting day.

[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:42.020]
And I predict he will win and hope to see in Las Vegas soon. So how are you doing out there?

[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:48.900]
You're losing your ass. I mean, you have it a great time. Oh, yeah. I love it. It's it's, uh, you know, there's real living, breathing people and.

[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:53.660]
Bring back some memories on it all of the way. Five six out of a daughter.

[01:29:53.660 --> 01:30:01.760]
Oh, five 60 pound five 60 and they've arrived in the singular wireless lines almost once to make me a place in where I'm Scotty Mac Dropens. But I think I'll pass this time.

[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:11.720]
I'm hyperventilating. Okay. Good for you. Wouldn't it be it anyway. Here's a call from plantation or Palm Beach, while they both begin with the P Palm Beach. Hello.

[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:22.160]
And they're not there Palm Beach going once. Going twice. I read the dutch. Let's try Kendall. Hello.

[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:30.520]
Neil. Are you sure? All right. George. Hi. Yo, yo. Hey, I just wanted to let you know I voted for the first time. What if I carry? Yeah.

[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:49.340]
I'm proud of it. And I just want more thing. Bill, I'm online. Call me. Okay. All right. Whatever the hell that means. Here's a call from coconut Creek. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah. My name is Bob from the Creek.

[01:30:49.340 --> 01:31:01.460]
Yeah. And I just want to like to tell you that I am a 57 year old Vietnam veteran. I'm voting for the first time. I just voted for the first time in my life.

[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:16.000]
I went through. I got hit by a claim or a mine. I got a purple heart. I got Agent Orange throat cancer. I won two, three years ago. And I just got done voting for the first time, but which I am very proud of.

[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:38.120]
And I voted for Terkary. All right. I cannot see anybody in this country voting for warm hunger that kills 19 and 20 year old kids for nothing. Well said, Bob. Nice job. Yeah. I mean, you were you were in the blow them off. You see every call. I think you could have just warned.

[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:51.760]
They got me all confused. Oh, they'll do it every time. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 any Verizon and singular wireless lines. I'm a little bit nervous now looking at that yesterday. I felt really very confident. And then I look at that electoral map today. And I'm getting a little a

[01:31:54.040 --> 01:32:21.700]
little bit more than I thought. I mean, I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm just a little bit more than I thought. I'm

[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:51.680]
just a little bit more than I thought.

[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:54.040]
when asked what states he thought he was going to win.

[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.420]
He looked at them and he said,

[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:56.540]
what do you think I am?

[01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:57.380]
I'm a proud not to keep.

[01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:58.820]
Yeah, I saw that.

[01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:00.140]
It was time broke out interview.

[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:00.900]
I saw that, yeah.

[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:01.320]
Exactly.

[01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:02.740]
I couldn't find it in the dictionary.

[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.520]
It's the only way to get a president

[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:06.660]
that knew the English language.

[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:07.940]
Yeah, he's the best.

[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:10.300]
So we're off his nut of a book.

[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.520]
Thanks for helping us out.

[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.460]
No problem.

[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:13.120]
See ya.

[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:13.500]
Take care.

[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:15.180]
Yeah, Illinois, they don't need their votes

[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:17.500]
because Carrie's going to be Illinois by a Zidian Miles.

[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.300]
And of course Barack Obama is going to whip Alan Keys' ass.

[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.420]
Alan Keys, I think it's sort of viable.

[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:23.680]
I think he belongs in an institution.

[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:24.420]
He's got a cookie.

[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.520]
He's got a cookie?

[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:27.340]
Oh, he's got a cookie.

[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:28.300]
Yeah.

[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:30.700]
He's a tragic is what he is.

[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.220]
Of course he's not a carpet bagger.

[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:33.380]
You understand what I'm saying.

[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.620]
Here's a lady in Boca.

[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:35.920]
Hello.

[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:37.320]
Me, all right.

[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:38.240]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:40.120]
It's a pleasure talking to you today.

[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:40.980]
Yes, it is.

[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.860]
I just wanted to give you a voting report

[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:46.580]
from Fashist Boca Raton.

[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:47.200]
Okay.

[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:51.680]
Everybody who I was in line with, we were all for Carrie.

[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:55.380]
On the way out of the polls, talking to people,

[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.340]
I five people said they were voting Carrie one bush.

[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.580]
So if that's the way it's going in this town here

[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.260]
where the wealth is incredible,

[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:07.020]
that's a good barometer for the rest of the country.

[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:08.840]
How many young people do you see there?

[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.520]
Because Boca generally is old Jews, you know, in the world.

[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.760]
Not in the poll I was at.

[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.100]
Lot of young people.

[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:14.720]
Great.

[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:17.200]
Lot of young people and they were all vote and Carrie.

[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:19.920]
I took some time off work this week just to go out

[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.200]
and get the word out for Carrie.

[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.240]
It's an important duty that we have to vote.

[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:27.160]
And I vote in every election, not just this one.

[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:27.620]
Right.

[01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:30.120]
So, you know, that's what makes America great, right?

[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:32.840]
As long as they continue having them.

[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:35.100]
I just think they weren't all remaining old for this stock ready

[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:36.540]
for immediate delivery if not sooner.

[01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:38.900]
And all the old fives are in and ready to roll out.

[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.820]
Plus for limited time, get yourself 0% financing

[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:43.120]
on any of the following.

[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:45.800]
Explorers, escapes, focuses, toruses, and mustangs.

[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:47.180]
Certain restrictions apply.

[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.820]
Lots of Armstrong-Fort of Homestead are jammed like crazy

[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:51.480]
and with moral fives arriving every day.

[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:53.620]
They're cutting prices now and you're going to save a ton.

[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:55.980]
Armstrong-Fort offers more value to you too,

[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.720]
because when you buy your Ford there, you'll get their exclusive tires

[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:00.280]
and batteries for life program.

[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:01.000]
You heard me right.

[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.520]
Tires and batteries for life.

[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:05.900]
So, if you're looking for a new car, but I'm putting it off,

[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.800]
wait no longer because David Rich and the staff at Armstrong-Fort of Homestead

[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:11.160]
will guarantee you the best price and don't forget.

[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.700]
Because they're locally owned and operated,

[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.000]
they want to make your life long customer,

[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.140]
they'll treat you just like family.

[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:17.340]
You won't get a better deal on a Ford anywhere in town,

[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:19.400]
no bait and switch, no foe need deals or games,

[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:21.120]
just the best prices anywhere.

[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:24.400]
Armstrong-Fort of Homestead, you'll find them at 307-25,

[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:27.960]
South Dixie Highway, that's just 20 minutes south of the 836.

[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.360]
Check them on the web at ArmstrongCars.com

[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:32.740]
and then drive a little and save thousands on that new Ford

[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:35.160]
at Armstrong Ford of Homestead.

[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:40.500]
It's a real rush, it's exclusively on 516-28.

[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:26.140]
The only worse dead bodies they're scraping on every day over there.

[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.400]
And we don't want you to see that anymore,

[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:32.460]
we want you to see those draped coffins of the kids coming back,

[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:34.980]
like they didn't Vietnam and body bags.

[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:36.840]
That's not good for business.

[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.840]
Shame on the media, man, you people are a bunch of lunatics,

[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:44.840]
a bunch of crazy people, a bunch of total sellouts,

[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.100]
including you, Bob Sheeper, they're on CBS.

[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.720]
I hope they drag your ass over to New Jersey,

[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.140]
and hang your ass from a tree.

[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:53.320]
Just a whole oak tree.

[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.340]
This is ass, not the rest of them.

[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:57.400]
That's probably what he's doing right now.

[01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:58.460]
I'm dying of it here.

[01:36:58.680 --> 01:36:59.700]
He's dying to be a little bit darker.

[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:03.640]
Five, six, he was supposed to let me get all whipped up into a frenzy now.

[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:04.340]
Oh, come on, it's fun.

[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.180]
Five, six, seven.

[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.340]
See, might as well do all of this heavy-duty stuff,

[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:11.400]
because we can't play anything anymore anyway.

[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.420]
We can't do the fun and game stuff we used to do.

[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:13.600]

[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:15.540]
So might as well be screaming and hollering and pretending

[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:16.360]
we're going to make a difference.

[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:17.600]
Might as well be doing that.

[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:19.280]
We can't even play a fart sound anymore.

[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:21.520]
That's the kind of country you live in right now.

[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.620]
Can't even fart, and if you do fart,

[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:26.660]
and it's the wrong flavor, man,

[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:28.480]
they're going to come knock it on your door at three o'clock in the morning

[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.920]
and take your ass away just to make sure you don't do it again.

[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:33.240]
Oh, look at this.

[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.520]
Ditto on the internet connection,

[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:35.120]
dropping off.

[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.260]
It's been going on for over a week.

[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.480]
Well, nobody's been telling us about it,

[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.380]
and how come this is going on?

[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.580]
And you better raise holy hell about it in there or not.

[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:41.040]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.200]
Also, where's my cheap gas?

[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.340]
And I'm glad that this fact's your sent this in because

[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:48.300]
thanks again, Mr. President, for those low gas prices.

[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.060]
Okay?

[01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:52.320]
And only now, as we're approaching election day,

[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:53.680]
we're finally added here today.

[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:56.540]
Only now do we see this grow test price of oil dropping

[01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:58.420]
through a little bit under $50 a barrel.

[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.780]
It's dropping like a rock, like a rack.

[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.860]
And they keep talking about it last night.

[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.700]
You know who they had on Paulus on a Bob Graham?

[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.960]
We did a good job, even though he's kind of boring listening to.

[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:11.900]
In this town hall meeting in Kissimmee, wherever it was,

[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:12.800]
Ralph Reed.

[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.640]
You talk about a little nasty B.D.I.d evil door right wing son of a bitch.

[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:19.900]
That's Ralph Reed for you.

[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.960]
And he starts giving a song and a dance about,

[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.540]
oh, everything's going so great.

[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.720]
And the audience was like hooting and howling.

[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:27.380]
They were almost booting off the stage.

[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.680]
And then he went into this emotional thing about why we went into a rack

[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:35.260]
and how we have to spread democracy and how the people are going to get a chance to vote.

[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:38.380]
I'm thinking about how about the people in Saudi Arabia, you great robber.

[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.440]
How about your business partners there in Saudi Arabia?

[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.260]
Shut up, Kami.

[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:42.280]
Yeah, in Egypt.

[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:44.560]
And Jordan, are those people getting the vote?

[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:44.780]
No.

[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:46.180]
You bitch your sweet ass, they're not.

[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:49.560]
The whole thing with his Bush family in the Saudis,

[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:50.740]
I'm so glad that they carried people.

[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:51.580]
It wasn't really them.

[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:54.640]
It was one of those 527s that ran that campaign that was an ad.

[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:54.800]
Right.

[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.300]
About Bush and the Saudis, man, that cozy relationship.

[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.800]
That's where the Chigur in the sand pile is right there in Saudi Arabia.

[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.020]
We ought to like, I've told you a million times and I'll say it again.

[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.980]
We ought to be over there right now, I asked.

[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:09.460]
And how come George Herbert Walker Bush was meeting,

[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:12.600]
had that meeting with the Carlisle group and Bush's brother was in on a meeting

[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.060]
on the morning of September 11th.

[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:15.300]
What were they talking about, you think?

[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.700]
So when people tell you a business deal gone bad,

[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.820]
or whatever the hell was really all about,

[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:22.480]
you ain't heard nothing yet, okay?

[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:25.540]
Why do you think they were so desperately trying to avoid the 9-11 commission?

[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:26.600]
Any other investigations?

[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.140]
That's just what you're lying.

[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.480]
Because they lie and they lie.

[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:33.920]
And Colin Powell, who comes off, he comes off, man, like, uh,

[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:36.840]
squeaky clean every time, because he's got that little light tan.

[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.000]
He's, I don't even think he's black.

[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:39.140]
I think he's just got a sun tan.

[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.880]
Maybe too much time in the desert without a map.

[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:46.580]
Lie like crazy, and here's the maps and they got all the,

[01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.460]
and he's holding up that little test tube.

[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:51.060]
God only knows what was in that test tube.

[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.800]
I'm afraid even conjecture with that might have been.

[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:59.060]
Provinces after 1 at 560, WQAM.

[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.420]

[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:11.580]
Recently, they helped one of our listeners who never thought

[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:14.100]
he'd be able to qualify to build a biosome home, but guess what?

[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.100]
Not only were they able to qualify him,

[01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:18.220]
they also were able to present him three options

[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:20.120]
as to the type of mortgage he could get.

[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.440]
And they were closely with him to determine which was best,

[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:23.400]
and then they made it happen.

[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:25.520]

And exclusive paper on 560-60.

By Abby Tau,

[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:29.480]
of the movie,

[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.400]
at 560-WQAM.

Coming up tonight, on inside of behind the Chouhollywood Celebrity Music Virography Profile Story,

[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:44.480]
they were musical, and they were youths.

[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:47.320]
No wonder they were called musical youths.

[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:54.440]
Past the Duchi was a remake of a reggae hit called Past the Kuchi.

[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:58.780]
Well, Kuchi was a marijuana cigarette.

[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:03.800]
Jean Dippewa is the head of the Cultural Anthropology Department at a major university,

[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.500]
which makes it okay for him to talk about black people.

[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:08.140]
I'm talking Mary Jane.

[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:09.460]
Ha, reaper.

[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:10.380]
A Doomy.

[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:11.820]
A comical gold.

[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:12.500]
Tasty.

[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:13.460]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:14.580]
Sorry.

[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:15.900]
I carried away there.

[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:22.040]
So, musical youth changed it to Past the Duchi, which is a big iron cooking pot.

[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:27.440]
For his doctoral dissertation, Professor Dippewa went into the field to record a 1980s rustic gathering,

[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.380]
documenting the effects of both the original version of the song and the musical youth remake.

[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:33.200]
First,

[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:34.620]
Past the Kuchi.

[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.820]
And now, the same rustic gathering,

[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:45.960]
where they are passing the Duchi, a boiling hot cast iron cooking pot.

[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:48.120]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:50.140]
You're not allowed to say it on the spot.

[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.240]
Musical youth,

[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:56.080]
we only hope they were high enough to kill the pain.

[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:59.900]
It's a big juicy sobbing went-look at show business tonight,

[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:01.280]
uninside the behind.

[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.260]
One 18 and five sixty WQM.

[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:04.080]
I think we got your choice.

[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:06.800]
I think we finally figured out a word that you can't send.

[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:07.640]
At least not yet.

[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.580]
Well, this is what you asked her.

[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:09.940]
Duchi bag.

[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:12.680]
Or a Duchi bag.

[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:13.920]
No, Duchi bag.

[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:14.460]
I like that.

[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:17.160]
Anyway, 833 votes on a pool.

[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.340]
Which state do you think will be the most crucial in the election today?

[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.100]
They're turning out in record numbers from coast to coast, from pillar to post.

[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:26.460]
They're lining up like crazy, which generally don't mean they're real happy with the status quo.

[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.520]
Florida, 479.

[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:30.960]
Ohio 241.

[01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:31.640]
And that's it.

[01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:35.120]
Basically, our audience thinks it's them too, and after that it's small taters.

[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:36.820]
Pennsylvania 31,

[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:38.740]
Don't know 29, don't care 28.

[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:43.620]
Hawaii 10, New Jersey 5, Michigan 4, Wisconsin 4, and Iowa 2.

[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:46.640]
I could have probably put Colorado, New Mexico 1 or 2, but why bother, right?

[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:46.920]
Right.

[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:49.880]
Now, New Mexico, I think I can't wait to win New Mexico.

[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.920]
The last poll again shows him a little bit ahead.

[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:52.900]
About six votes.

[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:55.800]
Here's Hollywood.

[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:56.160]
Hello.

[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:58.400]
Hello?

[01:43:58.820 --> 01:43:59.180]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:00.120]
Yeah.

[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:00.720]
Neil.

[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:04.620]
I just wanted to let you know anybody that hasn't voted yet.

[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:05.960]
That's the imperial point.

[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:07.120]
You can go both there.

[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:07.860]
There's no line.

[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:08.820]
OK.

[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.700]
And I also seen the greatest campaign poster.

[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:12.400]
Yeah.

[01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:17.580]
It said both Bush, uh, Cheney, Uncle Osama wants you.

[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:20.060]
That's all I got.

[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:20.700]
OK.

[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:21.500]
Why?

[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:25.580]
Here's Harry North Miami who's speaking about chiefs of connection to the Bush family.

[01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:29.340]
His brother, Tom Sheeper, former president of the New York Rangers, is a long time business partner.

[01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:30.920]
George Bush and you were absolutely correct.

[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:32.020]
I had a story on that last week.

[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:32.720]
That is correct.

[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:43.000]
Bob Sheeper, if it's close to New Jersey or Bush, when it's going to be a long night for drunk here, that was the essence of his, uh, analization.

[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:43.420]
OK.

[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:47.060]
And I think analization is the operative term in terms of Bob Sheeper.

[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:48.260]
Who are you kidding, man?

[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:49.420]
Cha.

[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.600]
It's just amazing.

[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:54.720]
And then Tim Russett, of course, who pretends to be a journalist.

[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.960]
When I went to think him out about the, the device on Bush's back.

[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.400]
And the fact that he was being coached during the debates, he let them get away.

[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:05.740]
Mark Rassico, you know, that the BDI, uh, Nazi for Montana.

[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:06.320]
Right.

[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:06.920]
That's the one.

[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:07.840]
Pernots Rassico.

[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.700]
Whatever the hell his name is.

[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:10.700]
So he gets in.

[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:12.980]
And of course, all they always do is make a joke out of it.

[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.600]
Oh, no, he was talking to people from Mars.

[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:16.200]
Yeah, it's a big joke.

[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:17.400]
You're ain't gonna let him off the hook.

[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:18.960]
And he, you know, gets all red faced again.

[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:21.440]
Like he always does Tim Russett because he's Irish and probably like,

[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:22.600]
which is not pretty good.

[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:24.520]
Of course, if you're from Buffalo, you'd lose it up good too.

[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:27.120]
Five six, Otters, Colorado.

[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:30.980]
Now, election officials say they have never seen anything like this before.

[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:31.340]
Good.

[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:32.220]
See that was an error.

[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:32.600]
Stay.

[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:33.840]
Air me state.

[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.120]
They're turning out in droves.

[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:38.020]
And let me just tell you, I didn't say Carl Rove.

[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:41.200]
I said, Drove is in drove them out of the White House permanently.

[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.580]
And we'll never let right wing extremists back in.

[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.060]
Let me say it one last time.

[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:46.420]
Okay.

[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:52.560]
Unless you're a right wing, either millionaire or right wing Bible thumping flat earth lunatic.

[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:56.760]
You have no business whatsoever voting for W for these band of Mary Nazis.

[01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:57.240]
Okay.

[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.060]
He's better on terror.

[01:45:58.440 --> 01:45:58.740]
Yeah.

[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.580]
Terror is the word.

[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:02.680]
Every time I think of him, terror comes into my heart.

[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:03.020]
Terror.

[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:05.660]
Here's a call from, what is it, Daniel?

[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:06.000]
Hello.

[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:06.980]
Hey, Neil.

[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:07.400]
How's it going?

[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:08.140]
Okay, sir.

[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:13.360]
First off, I guess the last caller says something about no line that a poll.

[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:15.460]
You have to poll in your district, don't you today?

[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:17.260]
You can't just go to one.

[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:17.860]
You can't just go to one.

[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:19.260]
What were you supposed to vote right?

[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.720]
Yeah, you can't just go to an empty one.

[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.960]
I mean, that would cause big problems.

[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:30.360]
Another thing, did my part, we can have to go vote for Kerry and my gubaneeta wife voted today for Kerry.

[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:31.180]
All right.

[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:33.080]
So, yeah, we're making a headway.

[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:33.480]
Oh, you got it out.

[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:34.240]
Exactly.

[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:38.060]
Now, to this electoral vote site you got here?

[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:38.620]
Yeah.

[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:46.240]
You know, it also mentions, if you read below, that they used a gallop zogby yesterday in Ohio and Wisconsin today.

[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:52.700]
Today, though, they're using Fox News slash opinion dynamics in Ohio and Wisconsin.

[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:53.840]
Why are they doing that?

[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:54.080]

[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:57.520]
Well, I guess the reason they're doing that is because it's the most recent poll.

[01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:58.580]
I think that's what it is.

[01:46:58.700 --> 01:46:59.440]
It's the most recent poll.

[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:00.740]
They did the same thing in New Jersey.

[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:05.700]
New Jersey, they're using a strategic vision and there's an R in parentheses next to it.

[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:06.720]
So, you know, you know what that means.

[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:07.720]
You're public in poll.

[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:08.600]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.140]
And, you know, if you look at the New Jersey breakdown, it's 42, 42 and 1.

[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:18.220]
So, you're telling me that there's 15 percent in un-crossed.

[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:18.720]
Everything, man.

[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:19.960]
For Chris Cross.

[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:21.760]
I'm holding up across.

[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:22.180]
Hold it up.

[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:24.080]
I'm big crucifix to keep waiting in evil spirits.

[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:24.600]
Okay?

[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:26.600]
The spirit of Christ compels me.

[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:28.300]
Oh, yeah.

[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:29.280]
The religious thing, man.

[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:31.700]
That's the biggest problem with America.

[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:33.000]
And I'll say it again.

[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:34.000]
You weren't there yesterday.

[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:35.340]
I want to repeat it for your benefit.

[01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:40.200]
You know, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina that Juleyn Rednext Senator from South Carolina.

[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:40.740]
Yeah.

[01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:44.820]
He was on with one of Larry King's panels over the weekend.

[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:45.780]
Whatever the hell night it was.

[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:53.540]
And inadvertently, here's this born again, this Bible thumping little red neckie, a twerp from South Carolina.

[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.900]
Who looks a lot like Bob Neal from Cox Broadcasting.

[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:57.020]
A real redneck.

[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:01.600]
And he said, he's talking about Iraq and the whole thing with the terrorism.

[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:03.600]
He said, well, the whole thing is about religious finances.

[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:04.500]
And that's what we're fighting.

[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:06.620]
Oh, yeah.

[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:06.920]
Yeah.

[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:11.600]
And I thought, thank you, Lindsey Graham, for being the one person that's got the balls to actually say that.

[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:19.000]
Because Carrie, unfortunately, every time they bring up religion, he feels he's got to be in a peeing contest with Bush to see who can make the most of the college.

[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:19.800]
Talk about everything.

[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.480]
Everything that stems from God, all this other.

[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:25.840]
And because that's the American F and Way, man, you can't indicate you're not as devout as the other guy.

[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:27.880]
But what happened to Congress, like I said.

[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:33.780]
But there is a little rednecky Lindsey Graham, even a redneck Yahoo like him, those.

[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:40.940]
It's about religious finances, not just meaning extreme Islam, but of course religious finances of any other kind, meaning Orthodox Jews,

[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:46.700]
born again, Christians, Bible, thumb, and lunatics, they want to bring us back to the flat earth days again.

[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:53.300]
Hey, can I send a message out to Daniel Cohen, the retard who keeps faxing, faxing continuously these really childish drawings.

[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:54.320]
Stop.

[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:56.180]
Daniel Cohen?

[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:56.720]
Yeah.

[01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:00.340]
I'm going to tell you, I'm going to take away your tisses if you don't cut the crap out, Danny.

[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:07.860]
Now, Karen and Boyton says, wondering about Bob Sheeper, check out the above website link, dhengleyhowler.com.

[01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:11.740]
His brother is a busher pointed ambassador was a partner of W.M. in the Texas Rangers.

[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:13.780]
Karen says, carry in a landslide.

[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:14.840]
Hey, how are you doing Karen?

[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:20.600]
And Paul says all over the place, but I feel better after that last caller because he makes a good point.

[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:24.340]
And that is that that the electoral mapping, they use all different kinds of polls.

[01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:25.000]
Right.

[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:27.720]
Kind of like a scurrain used to.

[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:28.640]
We'll see her in a more.

[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:31.920]
Paul says, I waited two hours to vote this morning in Lauderdale Lakes.

[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:35.040]
The weight was made a little bit easier by the antics of neutral observers.

[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:38.400]
One of them was a want to be condo commando.

[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:42.220]
They were wearing white windbreakers and wearing sunglasses.

[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:46.980]
The only thing missing was the plug in the ear and you would have sworn they were from the secret service.

[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:49.940]
Oh, great.

[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:55.660]
If the if the challengers don't get you, then the condo commando's will.

[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:59.260]
Oh, I probably say I voted to carry Edwards and four amendment four vote.

[01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:00.660]
Early and often says Paul a long time.

[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:01.380]
Listen, thanks, Paul.

[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:02.320]
Love you, sweetheart.

[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:03.060]
Good job.

[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.160]
I'm feeling pretty good about it right now.

[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:06.580]
You know what?

[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:09.960]
Not, you know, not confident.

[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:10.620]
I am.

[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:14.700]
Like I said, I'm feeling very confident that somebody's going to win.

[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:22.320]
26 past one at five, 60 WQM on your shop for quality, footwear, great selection, professional service, unbeatable prices.

[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:24.340]
There's only one place people love to shop.

[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:25.780]
That's brandy shoes and pompato beach.

[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.280]
No off brands, baby.

[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:31.360]
None of those shoes that nobody ever heard of before they have the top quality names you know and love.

[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.360]
And your feet love to rock ports.

[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:38.760]
Floreshime, SAS, Spirit, Timberlin, Naturalizer, all the other top names in the shoe binnest.

[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:43.660]
Now, brandy shoes is open every day from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday and every Sunday 10 to 5.

[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.420]
And you'll find them at 12, 90 North Federal Highway and Pompato Beach.

[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:50.060]
They've been going strong at that same location for years and years.

[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:54.540]
While the other shoe folks have come and gone when they drop the other shoe, brandy's still going strong.

[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:01.300]
And right now is a great time to buy Floreshime all this week at Brandy's because all great men's styles are an extra 20% off the already.

[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:02.060]
Unbeatable prices.

[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:07.440]
So be sure to come in the store this week or visit them on that wicked web at Brandy's shoes dot com.

[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:09.840]
You're listening to me, you need to go to me, Rogers.

[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:12.260]
Exclusively unbiased again.

[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:13.620]
QAM.

[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:17.400]
Howard David's a bitch.

[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:50.780]
Ever since this presidential race began.

[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:54.640]
Live up in wondered who was going to win.

[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:59.560]
Some Palm Beach people went to do their voting show.

[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:04.520]
So count up all the ballots and find out who's gotten more.

[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:10.680]
Those old folks seem to have one thing in common.

[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:15.880]
Looks like lots of them just keep their votes to Patrick Buchanan.

[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:22.840]
So I'd like to know who won the election.

[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:27.560]
Yes, I'd like to know who won the election.

[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:34.140]
Count the vote, count the vote, baby, count the vote, or count the vote.

[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:39.320]
The final tabulation started coming in.

[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:43.320]
Then I saw a new splash on Channel 10.

[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:48.120]
Some may be people altogether in a bunch.

[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:53.100]
They said they were confused and didn't know which hold a punch.

[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:59.220]
Those old folks seem to have one thing in common.

[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:04.400]
Looks like lots of them just keep their votes to Patrick Buchanan.

[01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:06.160]
Oh my god.

[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:07.160]
Oi.

[01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:11.320]
So I'd like to know who won the election.

[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:15.680]
Said I'd like to know who won the election.

[01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:20.060]
Oh, I'd like to know who won the election.

[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:24.440]
Yes, I'd like to know who won the election.

[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:29.060]
Count the vote, count the vote, baby, count the vote.

[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:31.080]
Count the vote, all the count the vote.

[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.280]
Count the vote, baby, count the vote.

[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:36.940]
Count the vote, all the count the vote.

[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:39.800]
Count the vote, count the vote, count the vote.

[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:41.940]
Count the vote, count the vote, count the vote.

[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:42.980]
I'm there anymore.

[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.520]
Count the vote, the next step to the end.

[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:46.500]
Count the vote, the next step to the end.

[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:50.860]
In Columbus, Ohio, police said a crew flyer telling Republicans to vote Tuesday.

[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:53.840]
A Democrats to vote Wednesday was apparently distributed in some areas.

[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:55.940]
Thank you.

[01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:56.740]
Thank you.

[01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:58.280]
Wow.

[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:04.240]
Anyway, polls opened early today to long lines of voters, some of whom had camped outside overnight waiting to cast a ballot.

[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:07.140]
And one of the most tightly contested presidential elections in recent history.

[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.700]
How many votes are going to win by?

[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:09.720]
3rd, man.

[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:15.040]
The candidates, Bush and Carrie prepared to wait long, wait out the long day of voting, even longer than the night of ballot counting.

[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:19.740]
President Bush cast his vote in Crawford, Texas this morning at the Crawford Fire Department of his ranch.

[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:23.940]
He entered the polling place with the first lady, Laura Bush, and the two obnoxious drunken daughters.

[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:27.500]
Now, that is two obnoxious drunken daughters.

[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:30.840]
Strandages from both parties agree that the election will hinge out voter turnout.

[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:33.860]
Both have invested heavily during the campaign to get out the vote efforts.

[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:36.520]
New voter signups could make history it says here.

[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:37.140]
I didn't like that.

[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:41.440]
Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry, started his day with campaign events in Wisconsin.

[01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:43.260]
His scheduled to vote, he already did.

[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:47.120]
We just got through seeing it at the in Boston one o'clock afterward.

[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:51.700]
And a personal election day tradition, Carrie plans to have launched these cities union oyster house.

[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:55.780]
I wonder if that's kind of the old New England oyster house, but I was a chain. It was great.

[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:56.660]
I'm sure it's not.

[01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:59.840]
Carrie kept campaigning to his day starting his day with events in Wisconsin.

[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:02.960]
As I reported what his thoughts are now that the campaign has finished, Carrie applied.

[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:06.580]
It's not over yet. Still working till 8 p.m. tonight, he said.

[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:08.140]
You go, John.

[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:12.200]
Here's the fact that says when I heard Bob Lincoln, I got a chill.

[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:13.680]
So when are we going to Vegas again?

[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:20.340]
Oh, yeah. My answer to that is the man with the eyeball is shining the eye and getting ready for a recon in Palm Beach.

[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:22.100]
The judge with the eye with that wicked eye.

[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:23.980]
They still show in at this year over and over again.

[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:24.620]
Sure. He was great.

[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:28.280]
Carrie Bedman said the season might be canceled. Yes, yes, on that.

[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:31.040]
Bring back the brainstem. No one that and the go jets.

[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:33.860]
Did you hear? Did I hear you say man dog was a bush man?

[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:35.220]
And he still has hope for the law for the well.

[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:37.520]
What he claims to be, but I don't believe it.

[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.820]
I don't give money to Bob Graham.

[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:41.380]
And he course wanted to admit that because Bobby Graham was a Democrat.

[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:43.660]
But nevertheless, those jokes got to put up that big facade.

[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:46.180]
Oh, I'm from Bush. He's great. Our commander in chief.

[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:49.200]
I'm a Republican. I'm macho. I'm macho. Yeah. It's not what I hear.

[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:54.440]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the Verizon and singular wireless lines.

[01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:56.660]
Here's a lady in Delray Beach. Hello.

[01:55:58.040 --> 01:55:59.200]
Hello. Yes, ma'am.

[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:00.320]
I kneel.

[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.560]
I'm a first time caller.

[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:06.140]
Long time. Right. All right.

[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:07.900]
Seeing an adventure Delray.

[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:10.680]
Oi. And I wanted to say.

[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:14.820]
Oi. I have never voted in my 29 years of life.

[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:15.340]
And I've ever.

[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.600]
I'm tired of you. Good.

[01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:22.880]
And all the evil doers of the world. Excellent.

[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:27.580]
And I hope John Kerry wins because if he doesn't, we'll be seeking anibonna.

[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:31.720]
If George, if John Kerry doesn't win, I'm going to have to meet a lot of you folks at the border when you come up here.

[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:35.700]
Well, I thought I'd have to say.

[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:37.920]
And I wanted to say one last thing George Bush.

[01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:40.020]
OK, thanks.

[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:40.520]
Hi.

[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:44.340]
She said George Bush is a duty bag is what she said.

[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:44.760]
That's right.

[01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:45.700]
That's the way we have it.

[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:46.720]
Isn't that childish?

[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:47.480]
We had a dump there.

[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:48.720]
Nicely the young lady like that.

[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.720]
Hey, Joyce, we can't stand you, honey.

[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:51.800]
Okay, over there in Naples.

[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:52.500]
Joyce.

[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.640]
Joyce the word police, the Nazi police.

[01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:58.840]
Boy, you talk about what fast did this just came in?

[01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:00.500]
It says it's pretty simple, this election.

[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:05.260]
President Bush is spending billions of dollars in a rack to secure oil for his fellow warlords.

[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:08.040]
The excuse was that 2,900 people were killed in New York.

[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:09.060]
Don't get me wrong.

[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:13.840]
I'm sympathetic to all the tragic losses that came in so many manifestations of grief that they have continued to occur.

[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:18.560]
But, doesn't someone on the level of the capital understand they were pouring money into a rack by the billions

[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.900]
and that it isn't even adequate to protect their own troops?

[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:26.200]
The US troops that were once considered invincible and outviewed as ill-equipped, while in the meantime,

[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:31.080]
were forcing the young and the old of our own country and the hunger, misguided education, misguided leadership,

[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:35.540]
unemployment, despair, heartache, depression, when will the emperor destroy the empire?

[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:40.180]
I think around 1030 tonight, she'll be done.

[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:43.000]
The emperor will have no clothes.

[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:45.280]
All we might have are wires on his back.

[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:47.360]
Just keep looking at the pictures on her and her website.

[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:48.780]
We really need to take a look at it.

[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:50.260]
No, seriously, you're laughing at it.

[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:52.100]
Yeah, well, here it is.

[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:53.540]
There's another one in cell-out schwarzschers.

[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:55.460]
Oh, Vietnam and not this war against terrorism.

[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:58.000]
I just don't see any Indian inside.

[01:57:58.200 --> 01:57:59.300]
I think you could see violence.

[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:01.320]
This is pathetic. This is so sad.

[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:04.700]
The blacks and Jews for Bush, man, I'm going to tell you.

[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.740]
It's like blacks for David Duke and Jews for Hitler.

[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:07.280]
Same difference.

[01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:08.460]
There is no difference whatsoever.

[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:11.420]
A cell-out, man, and establishment cell-out.

[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:11.960]
You want to be ashamed?

[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:13.980]
What's his name? Armstrong, William, something like that?

[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:16.800]
He probably just painted on.

[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:18.480]
He probably is white as the fallen snow.

[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:21.340]
Probably did that dark face.

[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:22.520]
Here's for a lot of Dale.

[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:22.760]
Hello?

[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:25.060]
Hello?

[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:25.880]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:27.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:28.680]
I'm going for Carrie.

[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:31.760]
My name is Gary Martin for Law Day.

[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:32.740]
I'm a former Marine.

[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:35.720]
And a lot of us, that's for Carrie.

[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:42.220]
My opinion is, George Bush, he has a punk and a con man.

[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:46.340]
The punk is on a source, not even from Governor of California.

[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:49.400]
If he don't look like a faggot, he talks like one.

[01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:51.120]
He's on the poster's payroll.

[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:54.720]
You know, and then you got former mayor, Julianne.

[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:59.040]
I get more respect for leadership and everything else.

[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:03.980]
But he missed it to the way his interview was on a 60-minute sale.

[01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:05.540]
They talk just like a con man.

[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:06.480]
Very fast.

[01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:07.860]
He has answers for every...

[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:10.060]
Talk out on Governor of his mouth like the Godfather.

[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.540]
Yeah, he talks, he's a con man.

[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:18.340]
And then you had Kitty Keller, who is on Matt Laurel today's show news.

[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:22.460]
George Bush is in Camp Davis, Stort and cocaine,

[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:26.180]
while his father was president of the United States.

[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:27.860]
Right.

[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:31.460]
And he's quick-drinking, but after a paper in the Stort cocaine,

[01:59:32.060 --> 01:59:34.320]
I hope Jim Kerry wins.

[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:35.780]
I hope Jim Kerry wins.

[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:37.380]
It makes a lot of funny faces for us, too.

[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:38.760]
It'll give us a better sense of humor.

[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:42.020]
21 till 2 is a good Canadian boy, by the way.

[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:44.220]
Jim Kerry, what's wrong with Canadian from American president?

[01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:44.700]
What do you say?

[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:46.200]
How about John Cretchan?

[01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:47.120]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:49.460]
They may not John Cretchan, but at least he was one of the first ones to...

[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:51.920]
I didn't take a genius to figure that out.

[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:53.500]
Say that public big Bush was a moron.

[01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:55.840]
And remember, all what you were...

[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:58.540]
You know, don't realize it, but the crap that he took here for that.

[01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:01.120]
And then his... one of his assistants said the same thing.

[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:03.460]
And she was absolutely correct, okay?

[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.740]
Canadians are on to Bush. They understand.

[02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:07.540]
The French, the Germans, the British.

[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:10.120]
Forget about Tony Blair. I'm talking about the British people.

[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:13.980]
The Italians, the Spaniards, that voted...

[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:17.020]
The election was all swayed based on the fact that they don't want any part of this crap.

[02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:18.040]
The Spaniard.

[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:21.480]
The Spaniard, the... whatever the hell they are.

[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:23.540]
The Catalan, the...

[02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:27.800]
The Danes, the Swedes, the Norwegians, the Finns.

[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:30.800]
The Ukrainians, the Polox, all of them.

[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:31.700]
They're onto it.

[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:34.660]
How come it is that there's somebody stupid, stupid?

[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:36.880]
I'm going to tell you again, it's that good old-time religion again.

[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:40.220]
Oh, he said, by God, they're just as dumb as he is. That's what it is.

[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:41.940]
The flat earth crowd.

[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:43.700]
The hate mongers.

[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:49.420]
IRS tax problems have a way of ruining all aspects of your life.

[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:49.900]
You knew that.

[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:52.700]
They can take a toll on you financially, physically and emotionally.

[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:54.580]
You can never really forget about those IRS problems.

[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.660]

Why not avoid potential criminal prosecution?

[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:14.920]
Get all your unfiled tax returns prepared, even if you lost all your records.

[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:17.620]

[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:18.880]
pay roll taxes and penalties.

[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:22.220]

You are listening to Neil Rogers' exclusive news.

[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:07.280]
8AM

[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:11.040]
At Bush, bring the boo!

[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:27.040]
George Bush, where the place you can land so that you can...

[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:32.320]
Of course, is that at those meetings with the invasion of Iraq and the inviting of spoils

[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:36.140]
was promised at the oil cartel, PS, where it's herald stash and then Pat Paulson,

[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:39.580]
when you need them, well, we may not have them, Sean, but at least we got Lyndon LaRouche.

[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.320]
Right? Yeah, so it isn't all doom and gloom.

[02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:44.000]
And then rather.

[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.160]
And then Bob Sheeper.

[02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:52.280]
Right, who's brother's a business partner of Bush and so on, but nevertheless don't confuse people with the facts.

[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:55.640]
We know that Bob Sheeper is really very, very, a right-to-on-the-middle, right?

[02:02:55.940 --> 02:02:56.320]
Not sure.

[02:02:57.580 --> 02:03:00.720]
Hey Bob, we don't wish you any health, but if you croak tomorrow we'd have a party.

[02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:06.140]
In fact, maybe we can have like a double-adulterial use party in a celebrate-carrier victory in Bob Sheeper croaking.

[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:10.940]
Which state do you think of me the most crucial in this election is our poll question?

[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:12.340]
963 votes?

[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:15.580]
Florida 535, Ohio 284.

[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:17.620]
That's it. No, that's the way ahead of everybody else.

[02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:19.680]
I just cast my ballot.

[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:21.100]
My donors carry this vote.

[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:24.260]
It's a great gift of our democracy.

[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.860]
This campaign has been an amazing journey.

[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:30.540]
A wonderful journey.

[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:36.300]
American people have opened their homes, their hearts, us, all of us.

[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:38.180]
It brought us in, shared their struggles.

[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:43.060]
And now the campaign comes to an end of the American people are going to decide.

[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:53.280]
I'm very confident that we've made the case for change, the case for trust in new leadership, the new direction of fresh start.

[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:58.280]
But what's really important is that both of us, and I, love this country.

[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:02.700]
It's really important that people go out and vote.

[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.200]
And it's fresh, they're love for our country, no matter who they vote for.

[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:10.640]
In our content and hatred for George W. Bush and his band of neo-Nazis.

[02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:18.500]
Let me just say that whatever the outcome tonight, I know one thing that is already an outcome.

[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:26.360]
Our country will be stronger, our country will be united, and we will move forward, no matter what.

[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:30.040]
Because that's who we are as Americans, and that's what we need to do.

[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:36.620]
I don't want to thank each and every one of you for your part of this journey.

[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:40.480]
It's really been a great experience.

[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:44.140]
There you go, John Kerry. Just voted in the Massachusetts. How you like that?

[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:45.460]
A rat.

[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.980]
Yeah, pretty, you know, just what they always say, all they old trichly says.

[02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:51.020]
What he should have said is, Bush wins, it's going to be a disaster.

[02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:53.440]
You know, he's still got some time here, right?

[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:54.300]
Right.

[02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:56.820]
He's still got several hours. That's exactly what he should have said.

[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.960]
That's what Howard Dean would have said.

[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:01.900]
Howard Dean would have kicked some serious ass, he would have said, boy, if you don't vote for me, man,

[02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:07.180]
if you put that lunatic, that lying drunk, that the coke snorting drunk back in there for another four years,

[02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:08.740]
we're going to go to hell in a hand basket.

[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:13.360]
But we have to be very refined and very dignified because it's America.

[02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:16.520]
Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello.

[02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:20.300]
Yeah, hello, sir. When Luke Clinton lied, nobody died.

[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:21.580]
Did people know that?

[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:23.320]
This is a big 40.

[02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:24.300]
Yeah, okay, Woody.

[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.500]
Hey, Woody, let me just say this to you.

[02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:30.020]
Okay, if you died, you and Bob Sheeper on the same day sounds like a hell of a package deal.

[02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:31.720]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:33.100]
Uncle Neil.

[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:33.940]
Yes, sir.

[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:35.200]
Great show as always.

[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:36.080]
Yes, it is.

[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:41.420]
Let me die. I'm feeling so much better than four years ago, the afternoon of the election. How about you?

[02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:44.860]
Why do you say that? Four years ago, I think?

[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:49.420]
Well, you know, you were still thinking at this time whether Florida was going to go who knew I'd, you know,

[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:54.120]
I just carry out his act together and I wanted to say that any of the doubts that I had.

[02:05:54.480 --> 02:06:01.280]
Uh, whispering into a zero and his rear and he still winds up getting trampled in all three debates by every single count, every poll.

[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:07.380]
You went online after those debates and it was like just overwhelming until the freepers got on overnight early in the morning.

[02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:12.060]
I was making a little more respectable, but it was overwhelming that he got tracked.

[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:13.500]
That's something. What does that tell you?

[02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:16.980]
You're talking about a guy that's got an IQ larger than his thumb size.

[02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:20.080]
John Kerry against the guy that always points. He's in a minus column.

[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:22.320]
That would then saw us that a box of freaking rocks.

[02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:24.040]
This is what you can relate to.

[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:27.700]
It might have been that color we had after the 2000 was to remember. I'll never forget it.

[02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:32.780]
And he told us he voted for Bush over Gore because he just couldn't relate to those people who voted for Gore.

[02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:40.560]
Well, if you after all of this after things like Abu Gharrib, if you can relate to the people who are voting for Bush.

[02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:44.220]
Well, all I can say is exactly.

[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:50.160]
Anyway, it's 152.560 WDQM. Have you want to know more about following a low carb diet?

[02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:53.480]
If you want the best tasting, the biggest selection of low carb foods at the best price.

[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:56.080]
Here's a story you are absolutely going to fall in love with.

[02:06:56.220 --> 02:06:58.700]
The lights of Westboke have been telling you about them for a very long time.

[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:02.640]
Whether you're starting or restarting any of those low carb diets, the addkins, the sugarbusters,

[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:04.880]
Southbeats, any low carb sugar-free diet.

[02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:08.660]
This is a story you're going to love because their entire store is dedicated to you.

[02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:12.680]
Unlike your supermarket that's got like maybe part of one shelf with a few low carb items on it.

[02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:16.400]
The lights in terribly like I said is devoted to you with zillions of products.

[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:19.780]
Over 1200 products in stock, low carb goodies that you really enjoy.

[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:28.880]
The lights is open every day, seven days a week from 10 a.m. till 10 p.m.

[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:34.260]
You'll find the lights on the northeast corner of Glades in 441 right next to Boston Market or column tool free.

[02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:40.760]
At 1-877 Low Carb, that's L-O-W-C-A-R-B on the wickedwebitslowcarb.com.

[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:47.140]
Don't forget, love the stores with similar names, but there's only one delights at Westboka and it's your official Atkins Retail Center.

[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:48.920]
The L-O-W-C-A-R-B on the street.

[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:51.240]
We'll Rogers mornings in mid-dits.

[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:56.420]
And, towards a round of clock, the five-sixth day of the Chewie-A-R.

[02:07:58.380 --> 02:07:58.860]
God!

[02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:01.960]
Where did that extra spot come from?

[02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:03.160]
What a spot.

[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:04.620]
Well, I'll go a minute over to bed.

[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:05.520]
Sorry, my dog.

[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:07.820]
No. Get out there and vote. Do it, folks.

[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:17.660]
Watch for Harry, watch for Edwards, watch for Neil, watch for George, watch for Josh, and watch for yourself.

[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:22.500]
I'm not yet optimistic about the way that things are growing and I'm here.

[02:08:22.580 --> 02:08:25.420]
When ever and ever seem to be around.
