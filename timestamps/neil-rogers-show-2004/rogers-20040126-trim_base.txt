[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780]
I'll go back to the camera to you, you bastard.

[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.200]
OK.

[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.000]
And now, a word from Howard Dean's wife.

[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.460]
Hi, hello there.

[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.280]
I'm Dr. Julius Steibern,

[00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.680]
a wife of presidential candidate Howard Dean.

[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.900]
You can call me Judy.

[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.100]
Not Judge Judy.

[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.640]
That's a different knee-skite.

[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.340]
People want to know why I'm hardly ever on campaign trail with Howard.

[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.760]
Hey, did you get a good look at me in Iowa?

[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.580]
I scared a crap out of myself.

[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.320]
I make froth a biss and I look like a shane of pune.

[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.260]
Stop me if I'm bombarding you with pune a jade, ischa?

[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.540]
Anyway, how he says after I showed up his numbers dropped it.

[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.220]
No, I say that's a bunch of mischegas.

[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.060]
For those of you who don't take a piece of the Yiddish, that means crap.

[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.720]
How he's a good guy, though he's what you might call a loose cannon.

[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.640]
He's got a pretty bad temper on him.

[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.440]
I remember one time one of our kids left a cap off of the toothpaste.

[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.660]
I thought he was going to blow a gasket.

[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.760]
Zaveen's popped out in his head and that white spit strings were born in the corners of his mouth.

[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.420]
The event of Machubia, I spent 23 years with the shaggits.

[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.660]
Most of the time he's a man, but on occasion I hate him.

[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.220]
I think my husband Howie would make for a very good president.

[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.520]
One of the things I'm a little p old about is that Howie doesn't let us have a TV.

[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.000]
I want to watch sex in the city. I got to schlep down to campaign headquarters

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.800]
or to the croggers to watch on some tiny black and white set.

[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.460]
I have never seen any program in color, so I know Jackie Kennedy.

[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.000]
Hell, if you look at me, I'm no Ted Kennedy. I don't wear makeup.

[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.040]
I'm like a whisker away from being Amish.

[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.420]
Don't expect to see much more of me during the campaign.

[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.920]
The only reason I'm addressing you today is because I was able to chew through my restraints.

[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.260]
Anyway, Gazagazon, that's here this for Dr. Judy Steinberg over and out.

[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.580]
Pay for by the committee to elect John Kerry president.

[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.000]
Ten oh two is five sixty WQM happy Monday to you.

[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.940]
That is a beautiful thing. She's not, but that was.

[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.860]
I love that. So I'm gonna play the hundred times today.

[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.620]
I. Anyway, on Friday we ask it well, let me just rip Mandog a little bit.

[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.600]
Love the Mandog. Great guy. Everybody loves him.

[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.500]
But sometimes he's full of crap like all of us.

[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.100]
Sometimes you got to get out of your system.

[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.240]
And he was ripping me a little bit, not by name, but he said, you know,

[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.940]
we're in Dan LaBassard's column that I was praising and reading on Friday morning.

[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.060]
And Dan LaBassard for once in his life, he had his thumb right on it.

[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.280]
When he was talking about what a front running pony town,

[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.280]
South Florida, he was about the whole Marlon thing.

[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.100]
And there's Joe this morning talking about pictures and captures,

[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.020]
but they got to have something to talk about because the dolphins season is long over.

[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.940]
But nevertheless, nobody cares.

[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.820]
In fact, I came up with a great idea business we can go into.

[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.140]
Okay. It's called the, I had a good name for it.

[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.000]
Rent a front running rental store.

[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.700]
All right. Where you can rent like whatever team gets hot,

[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.160]
hopefully, you sound Florida team, but not necessarily.

[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.780]
And you go rent a uniform camp and a jersey and a whole outfit.

[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.640]
And you rent it for like, you know, whatever time until it's no longer politically correct.

[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.280]
And then you return it for a full refund.

[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.580]
Like like running a movie.

[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.680]
Like hurricane plywood.

[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.680]
Right. No, no, no, but you don't keep this.

[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.300]
You just rent it. Right. Well, they don't keep it either.

[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.660]
They take the plywood back.

[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.320]
She had to have a plywood back.

[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.440]
All these people get out of here.

[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.180]
Remember, every time there's a hurricane scare, there's like the next day,

[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.200]
there's the big line of the people bringing the tin and the plywood back.

[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.300]
Because the day after the World Series, I thought it was a joke,

[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.140]
but it's true. There were people trying to take their Marlon jerseys and caps back for a refund.

[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.460]
Rent, rent, or for a running outfit.

[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.680]
I think it's a great idea.

[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.060]
And mad dog, the line that he had that just almost, I was driving home, almost drove off the road.

[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.540]
He said, well, there's lots of choices.

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.060]
Lots of choices. See, that's the point.

[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.200]
It is a choice. And you choose either to support something or not.

[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.240]
That's what make a place with all that many people either, you know, major league or bush league.

[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.020]
And it's a bush league place.

[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.760]
I mean, all that phony front running craftering the parade and everybody's on the bandwagon.

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.480]
That really proves. I'm not saying that some floaters alone are a lot of places like that.

[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.440]
But that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt how bush league a place is.

[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.660]
Anyway, your full craft mad dog. It's a front running phony place.

[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.200]
It's a bush league town. Even a Humper will say to that.

[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.080]
Loose announcer to Hank, please.

[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.240]
Here's yesterday our Friday's poll.

[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.600]
Who's your all-time favorite soft Florida TV personality news entertainment, whatever?

[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.300]
Let's start at the bottom.

[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.080]
1324 vote.

[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.960]
Carmel Cafferro. Remember I thought that was a good addition?

[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.560]
Yeah.

[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.460]
No votes. Virginia Booker, I have no idea who that is.

[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.580]
Bob Halorin, sports guy, none.

[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.400]
And Carrie Miller, I don't know who that is.

[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.600]
I don't know. None.

[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.160]
Miller Rick.

[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.700]
One for Jane Chastain, Claremosure One, Terry Mirerman One.

[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.620]
She's probably kind to Jim Mirerman, Jr.

[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.280]
Katrina Daniel had a pair and they fell right off.

[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.080]
Jim Brasmer had two Todd Tungans got a pair.

[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.000]
Jilda Unruz got two.

[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.220]

[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.860]
Brad Burkey three, Wayne Ferris three, Angela Ray three, Jumping Jack O'Brien three,

[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.540]
Jumping Jack Flash didn't have any.

[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.560]
Gail Nuts, so bright head four, all of she is excited about that eating ass piece that twice repeating tonight?

[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.720]
Who isn't?

[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.360]
Camberl Martian, Wayne Ferris, oh Wayne Ferris is on.

[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.200]
He got three the first time he got four of them all.

[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.200]
Nice thought, Wayne.

[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.320]
He's got the four, Camberl Martian, Laurie Hibberd four, Wayne Chamber four, Ed O'Dell four.

[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.740]
Bill Kamal, the weather furry on channel seven, she had five.

[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.500]
Hey, Bill, put it down.

[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.560]
Put the booze down.

[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.980]
Jinsy James five, Wheeler Checkers five, Penny Daniel six.

[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.200]
Walt Kronai six, remember the bow ties?

[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.700]
No.

[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.720]
You don't?

[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.020]
He used to be the weather guy on channel ten for a long time.

[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.140]
Sorry.

[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.960]
How come nobody said the dead weather guy from channel four used to be there?

[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.020]
He used to be the booth announcer Dick Fennelcy.

[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.060]
I was wondering that a funnel?

[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.380]
No.

[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.860]
Michael Putney six, even though he's got his head way up Catherine Harris's ass and we're pretty pissed off of you Mike.

[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.620]
Banzio Billy seven.

[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.900]
I don't I don't know who that is.

[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.080]
Nope.

[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.240]
You don't need it?

[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.440]
Nope.

[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.220]
Big fat Dave Game seven.

[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.840]
Didn't he die?

[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.780]
I don't think so.

[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.420]
No.

[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.100]
Nancy O'Dell seven.

[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.960]
I'll tell you who else didn't die and that's Carl Maldon.

[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.180]
I was telling you before the show he was on a...

[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.140]
By accident I saw the golden globes about an hour for the last night and I for one some reason I always turn those things right off.

[00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.720]
Yeah.

[00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.960]
And I just couldn't turn it off.

[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.320]
I don't know what it was because I hate awards shows.

[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.980]
I hate the whole concept of sitting around sucking each others ass.

[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.160]
But there was something about it.

[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.700]
It was mildly interesting.

[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.980]
And Michael Douglas who was a little bit inebriated but not nearly as much as Susan Sarand.

[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.720]
Wow.

[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.860]
She was plastered.

[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.320]
You go girl.

[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.600]
But Michael Douglas went up and made a whole big thing about the Carl Maldon.

[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.880]
It was kind of one of those things like I know you're getting ready to croak Carl but I really want to thank you for all you taught me about acting and you're never still afraid to.

[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.760]
And Carl was sitting there with dark glasses on and he had like two big holes in his head which is never a good sign.

[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.920]
Only his nose died.

[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.700]
You're saying that I know I think it moved up his forehead.

[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.200]
Nancy O'Dell had seven.

[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.380]
I have no idea who she is.

[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.180]
Glenn Rinker eight done Cox had eight.

[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.180]
Susan Candy, audience.

[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.100]
Al Sunshine.

[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.660]
He's still waving those ham-hawks at you.

[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.320]
Nine.

[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.900]
Little Dicky winners nine.

[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.180]
Everybody like Little Dicky.

[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.600]
Sloppy Paloppie and Chuck Dottleten.

[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.200]
Tony Cigarette 11.

[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.960]
Charlie Baxter 15.

[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.280]
Connie Chinkhead 16.

[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.060]
Brian Larkross 17.

[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.120]
So he kills the other weather for his bio-mediment.

[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.760]
Is Don Noe.

[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.540]
Don Noe beat him out.

[00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.740]
Sorry Brian you lose.

[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.940]
Bob Soeper beat him out to 18.

[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.340]
It's good because Bob's a good guy.

[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.280]
Pan Jiganti who's only on on sabato.

[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.340]
Pan Sabato Gigante had 20.

[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.200]
Dave Dixon 20.

[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.360]
Don Francisco 20.

[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.420]
So you had it all ties in.

[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.720]
You're on Hamburg 20.

[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.240]
He got my vote.

[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.880]
John was great.

[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.120]
A real professional lose guy.

[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.380]
And a real bush league town.

[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.820]
Cinnamon Stofer 22.

[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.920]
What does Don?

[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.220]
No.

[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.860]
24.

[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.920]
This horror-kimer 25.

[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.860]
Now what's that all about?

[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.260]

Must have a lot of space cadets out there huh?

[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.100]
It's wrong with Jack.

[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.360]
Not wrong with Jack.

[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.520]

Even though she's been in Buffalo for a long time.

[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.760]

[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.000]
Hopper on Anzass.

We love you Kelly.

[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.400]
Please lose.

[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.060]
Please announce.

[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:56.760]
Please.

[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.160]
Wendy Big Nips Corona 53.

[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.320]
Rick Sanchez 53.

[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.020]

Nice to see that Bob.

Jacelle Fernandez.

[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.420]
Did not tell you she was good?

[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.760]
You said that.

[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.140]
Well she looked good.

[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.240]
And she was a nice person.

[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.580]
I met her one time.

[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.080]
Not exciting?

[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:15.560]
No.

[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.760]
You're not impressed?

[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.280]
No.

[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.560]

[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.120]
Okay.

[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:23.860]
It's pretty big names.

[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:24.600]
Who else do I know?

[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]
A Skipper Chucks Inc. 134.

[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.600]
And Jackie Johnson 169.

[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.420]
Now you think they did that just to piss me off?

[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.300]
I don't really care.

[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.260]
You know, she's a donkey face and a donkey bliss.

[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.260]
But what do I care?

[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:37.960]
I'll get back.

[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.120]
They like Jackie's Johnson.

[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:39.520]
Okay.

[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.340]
They think she's really hot stuff.

[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.440]
She ain't no Charlie's.

[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.460]
They're all but who knows?

[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.320]
No, nobody.

[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.020]
You should have seen that thing she had on last night.

[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.080]
I was like kind of like.

[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.800]
What do you mean?

[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.320]
I'm going to tear away.

[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:48.780]
Blows.

[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.820]
Yeah, I would tear away.

[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.180]
And look like somebody got a head start.

[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.020]
And they were tearing away at all different places.

[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.720]
And it was just about falling off her boobies.

[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.820]
She's just pristine.

[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.740]
She's a little girl from South Africa.

[00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.460]
That's what she said.

[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.880]
Yeah, my two favorite people from what I saw

[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.880]
at the Golden Loads last night was Charlize Theron

[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.280]
and Jude Law.

[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.460]
Who's a great actor and who looks kind of interesting?

[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.400]
Not wrong with Jude.

[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.080]
He's about two feet tall, but he's kind of interesting guy.

[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.480]
And Al Pacino made a total ass out of himself.

[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.880]
I just, why didn't he just go away?

[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.000]
You know, like Dick Cheney.

[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.420]
He'd never drag and dick out again.

[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.100]
And they ordered like,

[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.900]
store him away in a vault somewhere.

[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.260]
Because all they're going to do by dragging his ass out

[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260]
is remind everybody about all the bad things he was connected

[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.260]
with like, Alabama Burton.

[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.480]
Yeah, be like, dragon Catherine Harris's ass out.

[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.860]
You think they were smart enough to put her back in a freezer?

[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.360]
And they ought to do the same with Dick.

[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.260]
Put Dick in a freezer, man.

[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.260]
Oh, I'm going to be a gagging and choking.

[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.340]
I'm almost over this thing.

[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.800]
But not quite.

[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.420]
You know what I mean?

[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:45.780]
Yeah.

[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.360]
It's not all right.

[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.200]
No, I sound fine, but I'm just telling him, warning you.

[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.020]
I'm going to be, I got my halls mental looked this.

[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.980]
Got it in that room where you're sitting right now.

[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.940]
I just warn you ahead of time.

[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.440]
Here's our first poll today.

[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.280]
We got a pair for you.

[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.180]
Now, this story bothers me a lot.

[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.080]
And I don't know if you saw the footage on Thursday on the news.

[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.180]
We talked about it.

[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.120]
How about the relatives of the Seymour Shus?

[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.500]
And saying, oh, we just an accident.

[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.100]
Yeah.

[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.600]
Not condone this old man at the movie theater?

[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:13.980]
Right.

[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.500]
Was just an accident.

[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.640]
We feel real bad about it.

[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.280]
Of course, the old guy is dead.

[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.140]
Mm-hmm.

[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.200]
What the hell was the old man's name?

[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.680]
Irving Rosenberg.

[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.000]
Oi!

[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:25.540]
Irish?

[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.660]
Irish Catholic.

[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.200]
A legally blind grandfather charged with fatally punching a 74-year-old retiree outside

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.700]
a Tamarack Discount movie theater, simply was defending himself at his cancer survivor wife

[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.400]
when he leveled the blow as attorneys told the jurors on Friday.

[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.840]
Bull crap.

[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.700]
And it may not have even been 69-year-old Seymour Shus' punch that killed the older man

[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.720]
said the fence attorney Jane Weinthrow in the opening day of Shus' manslaughter trial.

[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.780]
How's that sound?

[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:55.440]
Better.

[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.080]
Good.

[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.540]
Weinthrow, I'm getting the real dark green stuff now.

[00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:58.940]
I love that.

[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.740]
That's always my favorite part of a cold when it's on a way out and you're getting the real, real dark green

[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.760]
from way down inside your...

[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.420]
Bracken, pals.

[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.680]
Where does that come from?

[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:08.560]
Lungs.

[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:09.960]
Does it really?

[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:10.360]
Yes.

[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.400]
Ooh, look at that one.

[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:12.700]
Purple.

[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:13.400]
Again.

[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.500]
Weinthrow told a Broadway circuit court jury that medical experts will testify that Irving

[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.080]
Rosenberg may have suffered a stroke or seizure the November 8th outside the Tamarack

[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.700]
Cinema 5 causing him to lapse into a coma and die 16 days later.

[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.400]
Prosecutors said though the evidence is clear the only person who needed defending that night

[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.420]
was Rosenberg who died from massive head injuries suffered when Shus' punch caused him to collapse

[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.100]
on the sidewalk.

[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.640]
This is so South Florida, man.

[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:40.920]
Right.

[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:41.900]
Parks and Faces.

[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.520]
So for Faces.

[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.900]
Spots and Lines.

[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.000]
Now Shus could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the single charge.

[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.680]
Both sides agreed the lives of Shus and Rosenberg, both the Orc natives, intersected when Rosenberg

[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.600]
gave a theater cashier two little money for the tickets for himself as wife and three other

[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:57.960]
couples.

[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.080]
The tickets were three bucks a piece but he only gave the movie theater employee 18 bucks instead

[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.740]
of 24.

[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.540]
Oh now this is a start to make sense.

[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.760]
Shus' wife who was behind Rosenberg in line then made a comment about how much money he needed.

[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.760]
The next few seconds are what's in dispute what Shus' state will likely hinge on.

[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.700]
Windtrap said Rosenberg returned to Ivan Shus and yelled shut up and loomed just inches away from her face.

[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.260]
Rosenberg terrified the woman who was out for one of the first times since breast cancer surgery,

[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.040]
Bondtrap said.

[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.300]
Seymour goes running over and the evidence will be that he went to protect his wife on Trap said

[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.480]
the evidence will be that there was no thought process other than to protect his wife.

[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.220]
When Shus went to help his wife two strangers grabbed them but because of his poor eyesight he had no idea what they were trying to do.

[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.640]
During that struggle Shus got tipped into mouth.

[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.240]
He then wrestled away from the men and when he did that's when Rosenberg got smacked.

[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:48.900]
Ready for that?

[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:49.980]
Ready.

[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.480]
So here's our first poll today.

[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.260]
What should happen to Seymour Shus?

[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.280]
The 69 year old Howard Mann who fatally punched the 74 year old man in Tamarack.

[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.160]
Look at all these choices.

[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:02.960]
Yeah, six.

[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:03.340]
Huh?

[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:04.600]
They're good.

[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.220]
Death penalty?

[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.140]
Which he won't get but I'm thinking.

[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.580]
Long jail sentence.

[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.040]
Take away a sweet and low.

[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.480]
Nothing it was an accident.

[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.160]
Make him live the rest of his life with Neil's mother.

[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.860]
Make him live the rest of his life with George's mother.

[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.260]
Or make him live the rest of his life with both mothers.

[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.800]
That is teaching.

[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.460]
That's what I voted.

[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.660]
1014 at 560 WQA.

[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.160]
It's the last mortgage you'll ever need.

[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.280]
It's the only one mortgage from financial group.

[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.640]
The benefits are incredible.

[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.100]
Zero closing costs.

[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:34.960]
Zero application.

[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:35.320]
Fee.

[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:35.860]
Zero credit.

[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.680]
Zero discounted points.

[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.340]
So get yourself that new unbeatable low interest rate of just 1.25%.

[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.400]
If you have a hundred thousand down loan your payments in only three thirty four months.

[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.080]
A two hundred thousand down loan your payments in only six is the eight a month.

[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:49.700]
And don't forget.

[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.420]
Once you be financed or give a new home mortgage from financial group you'll never ever pay closing costs again.

I don't say like those girls on a moon because that's where you are going.

[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.320]
I'm your planet.

[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.180]
How do you do that?

[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.420]
I'm Gaudi Bay here.

Oh, there you go.

[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:25.780]
Today I announced a new plan to explore space and extend a human presence across our solar system.

[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.780]
Come on, this isn't rocket science here.

[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:28.820]
Rocket science.

[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.160]
Rocket science.

[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:31.900]
Rocket science.

[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.660]
Rocket science.

[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.240]
Now what was that about taking over my planet?

[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.240]
Rocket science.

[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.900]
We may discover resources on the moon and Mars.

[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.520]
I was abducted by alien.

[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.740]
If I could light my own father's heck of flight of the moon, or at least your aim is...

[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.280]
I wonder what Starfleet command will say about that.

[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.060]
What's up?

[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.960]
So speaking of Mars, first of all, all that footage that you're seeing on CNN.

[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:06.520]
Yes.

[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.620]
It's all from New Mexico.

[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.120]
Right.

[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.620]
It's number one.

[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.900]
And number two, the Euros say that they found water on Mars.

[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.740]
Now what's that going to do to all the religious crap?

[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.320]
Nothing.

[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.920]
What do you mean by that?

[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.760]
Because we know that the Earth is only 6,000 years old.

[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.640]
And the fossils satan put the water there.

[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:23.060]
Right.

[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.260]
And nobody know that the universe is billions and billions and billions of years old.

[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.280]
How does that jive?

[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.340]
Does that jive with the jive in a Bible?

[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:30.820]
No.

[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:30.940]

[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.100]
Satanic scientists are wrong.

[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.080]
All your religions, man, now that they found...

[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:34.560]
Your...

[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.160]
Europe's Mars Orbiter has confirmed the presence of frozen water on the red planet surface

[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.520]
for the first time the European Space Agency be seen on Friday.

[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.100]
We've been tracking it on the South Pole and there we have detected water probably for

[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:52.600]
the first time agency scientist Jean-Pierre Bibering told the news conference a mission control

[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.320]
in Darmstadt.

[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.640]
If Mars once had surface water, it had the potential to support life.

[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.840]
Although Alan Moorehouse, the project manager of spacecraft operations cautioned it's

[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.280]
truly a draw, conclusions.

[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.460]
You look at the picture, you look at the fingerprint and say, this is water ice, he said, it's the

[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.740]
first time it's been detected on the ground, it's the first direct confirmation.

[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.820]
There's life on Mars, or there once was, just like there used to be in South Florida.

[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.700]
So all the illegal aliens at old Jews came in.

[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.980]
Speaking of old Jews, I read that buddy Nevin's piece in the Sun Central, of course, he's

[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.340]
anxious to begin with, and it's probably a lot of right wing propaganda.

[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.820]
But the fact is this, he says 44% of the Jews in Florida voted for Jeb Bush for

[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.680]
Reverend Bush for Governor this last time.

[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.140]
Are you ready for that?

[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.420]
No, no, no.

[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.020]
Oh, here's another good choice for the poll.

[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:39.820]
I like this one.

[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.160]
Yeah.

[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.800]
John and Columbia South Carolina, let's add this on here.

[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.980]
Come on Eric, let's get with it.

[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.680]
Make him live with Mo.

[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.360]
Absolutely.

[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.220]
I can't think of a worse punishment than that.

[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.820]
Some people might want to change that vote.

[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.240]
Now, this is a disgusting story.

[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.660]
This is so typical of the kind of crap that happens in South Florida where people blow

[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:03.440]
each other away over a parking spot and it's usually old farts and we old people miserable

[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.160]
nasty rotten sons of bitches.

[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.460]
What should happen to see more Shus, the 69 year old man who fatally punched a 74 year old

[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.760]
man in Tamarack, it is alleged.

[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.060]
41 votes.

[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.680]
14, make him live the rest of his life with both mothers, mine and your mama.

[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.520]
Hold me in.

[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.620]
Long jail sentence 12, death penalty six, take away a sweet and low five, nothing it was

[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.500]
an accident too.

[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.180]
Right.

[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.200]
Make him live the rest of his life with Neil's mother too and make him live the rest of

[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.920]
his life with your mother.

[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.760]
I don't think you've talked about your mama enough.

[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.580]
Oh, trust me.

[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.180]
I can see people.

[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:35.820]
Sure I have.

[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:36.660]
Have you?

[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.360]
Oh yeah.

[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.060]
Not enough though.

[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:38.900]
Maybe not.

[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.780]
So let's add that on there, make him live with Mo.

[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.880]
That will get some votes you think.

[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:42.220]
Absolutely.

[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:42.920]
I would think so.

[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.260]
WQA and good morning.

[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.780]
Hey Neil.

[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.480]
Yes sir.

[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.880]
I was sub-boying for Columbine over the weekend.

[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:50.600]
Right.

[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:56.360]
And I'd ask that question about why are Americans so violent versus other cultures?

[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.260]
And what's interesting was my theory on it, which I'm sure a lot of people have talked

[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.980]
about, it's just that there's an ignorance and an uneducated population.

[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.360]
The population doesn't travel, doesn't go abroad.

[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.440]
And just that breeds ignorance and hatred and fear of the unknown.

[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.600]
And it just perpetuates itself.

[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.560]
Because I thought it was going to be an anti-gun movie, but it really wasn't totally

[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.660]
anti-gun in the center.

[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.740]
Not only the part where Charlton Hasden and with the Kmart.

[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:24.760]
Right.

[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.580]
Only that part, where it really has an interesting question.

[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.680]
I mean, if you have the same amount of guns here as in Canada, for example, why are we so

[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.040]
violent?

[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.760]
I think that's part of the reason, but that's just my theory and I was wondering your thoughts

[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.100]
on it.

[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.640]
Well, I mean, it's just a lack of values.

[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.900]
I mean, if you don't have respect for human life and if it becomes part of, it's the

[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.520]
wild west, we've never outgrown it, that wild west mentality.

[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.020]
You know, it's just like this president, this cowboy president we got, same in reality.

[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:51.620]
Right.

[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.060]
Well, I would recommend that to anybody.

[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.200]
It's just a very absolutely the best.

[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.560]
And I really enjoyed it.

[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:56.820]
Take care.

[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.940]
Thank you so much, Kelly.

[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.340]
See, the thing about Michael Moore, I'm glad he mentioned that.

[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.520]
Now, I've often said I'd love to see Michael Moore be the president, but if he ran for

[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.460]
president, did he have any chance, of course not.

[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:06.740]
No.

[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.520]
And you want to know why?

[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.480]
Because he's too radical.

[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.260]
The meaty would destroy him.

[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.800]
And let me just straighten out one thing.

[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.800]
Somebody called it on Friday and I didn't watch that last New Hampshire debate.

[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.500]
Somebody called him Thursday or Friday about the comment about president, Bush being

[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.200]
a wall, etc.

[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.300]
And I know Michael Moore has said that consistently, there's nothing new in that.

[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.460]
But somebody asked Wesley Clark about that.

[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.080]
Right.

[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.460]
And he refused to completely, you know, he just had no comment on it because he was taking

[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.040]
out of context.

[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.520]
And again, over the weekend, all the talk and it shows all, but the talk, I'm a deserter

[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.640]
and Bob Novak's having a nervous breakdown.

[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.960]
First of all, Robert Novak should be in jail in the first place.

[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.240]
That's number one for all that Valerie claims stuff.

[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.040]
He ought to be in jail.

[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.420]
And number two, he's a good one to talk about the ethics, okay?

[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.120]
The fact of the matter is he was a wall, Bush.

[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:52.720]
Yes.

[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.000]
And now, you know, see, this is the way it works with the media now.

[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.980]
And then is anything anybody does?

[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.580]
If you're far, the wrong flavor, right away you're going to be able to smell it right on

[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.240]
TV in a minute.

[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:04.760]
Right.

[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.060]
And then even you, you think, I mean, this Dean thing, he's done in terms of, and I'm glad

[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:10.880]
to see one thing.

[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:11.500]
What's that?

[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.380]
All these surveys that they're taking now, and you see them interviewing people to New

[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.300]
Hampshire, where they got, how many people they got in New Hampshire?

[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.260]
About 30, man.

[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.080]
That's all they got there.

[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.380]
But, and I got all the new, eight million new polls and they're all over the place.

[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.460]
All I'll carry is still ahead.

[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.600]
They believe Kerry is electable.

[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:31.120]
And Dean is not electable, and that's what bothers me, because that Dean is not electable.

[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:31.880]
Kapiche?

[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:32.520]
Kapiche.

[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.620]
Well, that's it.

[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.180]
That's it, man.

[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.680]
This year, and anybody with a brain, including those 44% of Floridian Jews voted for

[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.880]
Jebush, you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.260]
What the hell is wrong with you, man?

[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.720]
Are you out of your mind or what?

[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:44.980]
Yeah?

[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.040]
Yeah, they are.

[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.280]
Oh, well, that's a good excuse.

[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.260]
Reverend Bush, with his, everything is Christianized this and Christianized that pretty soon.

[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.820]
Instead of they, you're going to have a big cross.

[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.940]
When you come from Wakecross, Georgia, there'll be another big cross.

[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.000]
Big cross, Florida.

[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:06.620]
Just a bunch of right winged, farbitioned, glam, as Dean's wife would say.

[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.260]
I love that bit.

[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.720]
I got a bullet for it over again.

[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:09.720]
She's fabulous.

[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.780]
I never thought I'd play any bit that had more Yiddish-in-ith than I use.

[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.840]
Marty and Miami says, if you ever drove in Miami, you know what a pain in the ass those

[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.660]
old people are?

[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.980]
The old man deserved it.

[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.320]
Let the attacker go as a matter of fact reward him since Marty and Miami.

[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.800]
Well, that's something to think about, Marty.

[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.720]
I don't know if Irving was a driver or not, but I guess he won't be no mole.

[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:32.180]
Right?

[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.560]
No point.

[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:34.140]

[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.520]
1026 is 560 WQAM.

[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.720]
Let me tell you about that.

[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.260]
Oh, you saw that McDonald's thing that documentary filmmaker.

[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:42.880]
What's the name of it?

[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.640]
Super size me?

[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.140]
No.

[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.740]
Morgan Spurlock.

[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.400]
You haven't seen that?

[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.140]
No.

[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:52.260]
He ate a McDonald's for a month, exclusively, and he gained 25 pounds.

[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.640]
And he didn't eat like all the same thing.

[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.880]
You know, he had breakfast and he ate the different things on a menu, salads.

[00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.620]
He gained 25 pounds in a month.

[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:01.960]
That McDonald's.

[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.920]
You didn't see that for real?

[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.680]
That is shocker.

[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.420]
I mean, no, it is not a shocker, but that's one of the reasons there's so many fact

[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.920]
that this but folks out there, why not try balance for life?

[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.500]
It's easy.

[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.840]
You don't have to worry about Atkins or Skeckens or South Florida Dine.

[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:13.680]
What is it called?

[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.520]
The South Beach Diet.

[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.540]
By the way, that's a scam.

[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.900]
You can go by the book if you want.

[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.420]
It's just ripped off Atkins.

[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.220]
But here's the answer for a balance for life.

[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.280]
Because they provide all the food.

[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.360]
They do all the figurine for you.

[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.080]
They count the carbs.

[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.900]
They count the glycemic value of those carbs.

[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.280]
And they make sure that you can lose weight with a delicious way in a little black sack.

[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.180]
That's right.

[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.760]
They bring in a little black sack every morning by 6 o'clock.

[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.100]
If they deliver right to your door at your work, at your home wherever you want to deliver

[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:37.380]
it to.

[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.560]
And even Dr. Atkins is changing his tune.

[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.280]
You heard him sing lately?

[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:41.940]
No.

[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:42.900]
See what I mean?

[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.460]
So anyway, here's the deal.

[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.380]
Katrina, the lovely Katrina at QAIM is lost 17 pounds.

[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.500]
She is the best and she's doing great looking great.

[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.500]
Her clothes are just hanging off her body.

[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.220]
You get the shoes between two choices for each meal.

[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.560]
They fill out the menu once so we can ask the only choice you have to make.

[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.220]
There's no shopping, no fig ring at all.

[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.400]
The food is fresh, it's delicious.

[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.120]
And you can watch that weight on the scale.

[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.300]
This pour off your fat ass.

[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.500]
So if you're sick and tired of trying all the others and you just can't stay on them,

[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.420]
do it the easy way because balance for life does the figuring for you and they prepare

[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.980]
all that great delicious food.

[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:29.700]
QAM.

[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:38.340]
Younger viewers, C-SPAN now offers a brand new reality show, Skydiving with Howard Dean.

[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.520]
Join Howard Dean.

[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:44.040]
He jets across the United States jumping out over some of his favorite states.

[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.320]
California.

[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.300]
Texas, New York.

[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.200]
South Dakota.

[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.120]
Oregon.

[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.100]
Michigan.

[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.540]
And then we're going to watch it in DC to take back the White House.

[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.980]
And coming soon to Washington DC, Cheer Animal.

[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.300]
His Skydiving with Howard Dean preparing this week on C-SPAN.

[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.720]
I'm not going to miss that.

[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.460]
10.32 at 5.60 WQAM.

[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.700]
Here's the second pull we're going to be doing because obviously they don't care that much about old man's choice.

[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:13.560]
But I do.

[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.060]
I'm disgusted by that crap.

[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.600]
By the instability.

[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.760]
That's one of the reasons to stop full to such a nasty, miserable, hateful place.

[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.440]
Most of the people I meet and I discuss that where they say you are absolutely correct.

[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.660]
I don't think it's debatable.

[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.940]
Even though Mando will come on a two o'clock and rip me for San and it's not only a bushly place but it's mean spirited.

[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:31.840]
Hateful.

[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.640]
I don't know why I say that every day because it's true.

[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.140]
Huh?

[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:34.980]
Uncivil.

[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.300]
Yeah, is right on.

[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:37.720]
Nasty.

[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:43.020]
Just like that story I told you about Walmart and I apologize to myself for having to go there and get that turl of thing.

[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.080]
Although I think it's appropriate.

[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.360]
And I didn't even tell you about my theater experience this weekend.

[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.540]
Yes, which was what?

[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.360]
I said, they take a birthday party of ten year old boys to the theater.

[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.080]
I don't need to elaborate.

[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:55.500]
Do I?

[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.240]
And what?

[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.900]
And there were many acts and halfway through the movie I turned around and said one of them, hey, S head shut the F up.

[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:05.660]
Really?

[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.720]
Yeah, it's like somebody slammed him back in the seat and they were quiet for a few minutes.

[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.160]
Here at Pooh!

[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.300]
All right.

[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.520]
I'm brave with ten year olds.

[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.100]
Watch me.

[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.100]
Some of them probably kick your ass.

[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:22.680]
most of them. Or maybe they might just teach you. Yeah, anymore. I think this tea is doing

[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:28.160]
me more harm than good, you think? What? What kind is it? It's a cinnamon herb tea. Oh,

[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:32.400]
I can't be. If it's healthy, it's poison. Is it? Yeah. Well, I'm going to keep drinking it.

[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.040]
You need industrial strength. Lips and here's the second pull we're doing now. What the,

[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.260]
I don't know, one day last week you did the thing about the best. Your favorite movie that you

[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:46.060]
would recommend pre-1980, was it? Yes, you did. Wasn't it? Something like that. I think because,

[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.840]
you know, a lot of us, we wait till it comes out on DVD or we're just lazy. What was the absolute

[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.420]
best movie in the last 10 years? 1993 to 2003. I got my book handy here on the floor somewhere.

[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.140]
Get just in case. Well, we'll have to check it out. I don't want like some 1990 movie like,

[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:07.240]
what year was Magnolia, for example? You know, like maybe three or four years ago? It was maybe.

[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.800]
Well, let's put that on it right away. How about Requiem? Okay. And Glen Gary Glen Ross.

[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.060]
Okay. Well, let's see. I'm not ready for this yet, but that's what we'll get to it to give

[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:23.240]
them a little something for their father. Church to pay $3 million in rape. Not again. Oh, Christ.

[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.680]
Sorry. The Roman Catholic Church. Now, the thing with the Mars business, and I know that not too

[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.400]
many people want to talk about that because you don't want to like ruffle them religious feathers.

[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.360]
It's bad for business. They'll even start break dancing in front of the Pope. Oh, they did that

[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:42.860]
already? Yes. I mean, how can you possibly believe all those bubble my seas that are written down by

[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:47.920]
primitive ancient people when we know that the universe is billions of years old that were like,

[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.940]
we're like, we're like, the little teeny tiny corner of the universe. We're like not even ahead

[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:59.640]
of a pin. Oh, no, we're the center of the universe. Right. Just like the sun revolves around the

[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.160]
earth. And the Pope's throne is the center of the world. And the earth, well, the Pope spends a lot

[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.220]
of time on the throne without too much success. That's why he and my mom get along well. How about

[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.780]
that break dancing? They're squeezing like crazy. Yeah, they were great dancing for the Pope. I

[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:15.600]
sure hope you saw the footage of that. How many times do we see that this morning already?

[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.440]
About third man. The Roman Catholic Church agreed Friday to pay $3 million to a woman who was

[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.820]
repeatedly raped as a young girl by a priest, setting a state record for the amount. All right,

[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.060]
let's hear it. They're setting records, man. Oh, right. It's going. You go, boys.

[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.520]
Setting a state record for the amount paid by a diocese to a single victim of clergy,

[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:37.660]
sexual abuse since the scandal broke two years ago in Boston. I think it's all appropriate that

[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.700]
it broke in Boston, you know, because the Boston, the whole city has been run by the Catholic

[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:47.140]
Church for a very long time. That's why it's such a paradox, Boston. Very, very liberal people

[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.660]
on the one hand and then a bunch of blue nose assholes mainly the church on the other hand.

[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.280]
Remember the Cardinal, Cardinal, Kushmir and Tachas? No. The settlement is among the first

[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.760]
to resolve claims against priest under a state law that allowed victims to sue the church for

[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.640]
decades old childhood sexual abuse. As many as 800 such claims, most in LA were filed against

[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.160]
the Roman Catholic Church last year, while the statute of limitations was temporarily lifted.

[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.980]
Jennifer Chapin, 31, said she was pleased to put her behind or behind her. The case against the

[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:17.520]
Roman Catholic diocese of Oakland involving accusations of 20-year-old abuse. I've run the

[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.200]
whole gamut of emotion, said the Oakdale psychiatric nurse. It's very valid aimed to be believed.

[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:28.180]
Church officials also said they were satisfied with the settlement. Is that incredible or what?

[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:34.700]
It's credible. Yeah. Does this go on with the details? Because it goes, uh, as part of her case,

[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.000]
Chapin and her attorneys made a 25-minute video which she detailed the abuse and its effect on her life.

[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.500]
The testimony was intercut with pictures from her childhood, one showed her while in a white

[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.480]
dress being congratulated by her parents and some priest on her first communion. Another was

[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:55.780]
her kissing the priest on the lips. Oh God. Do I see people going to get with it? When are you

[00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.940]
going to stop? Is it ever going to happen? No. Oh, and speaking of that, I'm so glad I didn't

[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.740]
forget about that. Thank you for faxing that story because it's ablimable. Saturday or no Friday

[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.980]
afternoon on CNN, they ran a very lengthy piece which you know how much they repeat stuff, but

[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:15.120]
we probably won't see this one again about the Europeans and what they think about America and

[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.320]
Americans and the whole religion thing and how they're shocked. They're a gasped. Yeah.

[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.160]
And every time Bush or any other politician mentions God or anything religious or Jesus,

[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.940]
they have a nervous breakdown because they can't relate to it. They find it just appalling.

[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.320]
Jesus Christ. Yeah. Maybe now you understand why Europeans are like light years ahead of Americans,

[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.060]
at least between the years anyway. Oh no, you're just saying that. Yeah, right.

[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.740]
Happens to be very, very true. It happens to be absolutely correct. And even though they're those

[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:44.220]
big churches in every city of more than 3,000 people all over Europe, they're like, uh, you know,

[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:50.780]
they're a place to visit. Well, a tourist attraction. Right. They're landmarks. That's all.

[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.620]
Almost every one of them. Like the old church in in Hamstoy, they're right in the middle of the

[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:01.320]
name red light district. Every single, you go to Italy, every city with more than two people has

[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:07.160]
got a big old cathedral and Bologna in Milano, you know, they don't go there. They don't go and pray

[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.320]
because they know it's a bunch of crap. And so the piece went on. It was very, it was several minutes

[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.160]
and I just couldn't believe that they were actually showing it on the certainly not news network.

[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:21.620]
I guess they hope nobody was watching. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T. I'm gonna start taking

[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.880]
some suggestions. May I say about 11 something? 11, not 30 man. About 11 30 will change the pole. Put

[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:33.140]
up the other one. I what should happen to see more Shus the 69 year old Howard man who fatally

[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.980]
punched the legs. They 70 year old, uh, 74 year old man in Tamrak Irving, uh, whatever his name was.

[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:45.260]
Rosenberg. Long jail sentence 27. Make him live with Moe is catching up 23. Absolutely.

[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:52.200]
By the way, Hank hates Moe more than I do. Amazing. I ran into the Humper on a way out of the

[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.300]
building on Friday. You can't even oh yeah, here's another. Make him do 12 rounds with Tyson.

[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:04.060]
Yeah, sure. Anyway, uh, Hank just despises Moe and I can't even begin to tell you how much.

[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.240]
So Moe, if you're listening, which I'm sure you are, there's somebody in the building who finds you

[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:14.140]
even even more anxious than I do. I never thought that was possible. Make him live the rest of his

[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:20.020]
life with both your mother and my mother, George 21. Death penalty 13. Nothing. It was an accident.

[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:27.920]
12. Right. Are these people joking or what? They must be. Take away a sweet and low 11. Make him

[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.300]
live the rest of his life with Neel's mother too and your mama, your mama, your son. Like I said,

[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.720]
by the next time you're on, you better do the whole show on your mama. Oh, man. Well, you have an

[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.080]
impressed this audience enough with what a bitch. I mean, with what a wonderful lady raised. He's

[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.540]
psycho. You've never seen a George's mother and Celia Cruz together. It's the same person.

[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.560]
Mom's way lighter. I see. And unfortunately, she's still alive. Unlike Celia, she's still alive.

piece on CNN about how the women are being repressed now how pissed off they aren't fired up

[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:03.760]
remember we talked about that yeah the women who had equal rights in fact they probably had more

[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.060]
equal rights with men in Iraq than they do in the US they had fully equal rights with men not

[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:11.680]
no more if there's new ruling council if the government council takes over gets their way that's

[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:16.080]
one of the first things in their agenda and you know this Iatola Ali Baba that's pulling all

[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:21.620]
the money yeah I like that does he have 40 thieves they ask the experts is it I hear you don't

[00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:26.910]
have 40 thieves he's got I'm sorry go ahead no that you know does he have the ability to to

[00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:31.530]
call them all to combat and riot and everything and the the experts say yes and he's holding that

[00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:36.630]
back if he doesn't get what he wants I see well how do you like that yeah now here's another

[00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:41.650]
up all this is the scene see I'll give you all and you know it's like pick one you like it's like

[00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.710]
when you take your blood pressure ten different times till you get one a reading that you like

[00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:51.190]
the latest CNN USA that they galapol shows this is very the very latest as of this moment

[00:44:52.050 --> 00:45:00.210]
carry 38% new Hampshire 25% for Howard Dean 12% for Jew Lieberman we gotta believe that for a minute

[00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.410]
although see keep in mind independence can vote in New Hampshire and most of those independence

[00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:09.770]
wind up voting Republican in the general election 10% for Wesley Clark and only 9% for John Edwards

[00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:16.470]
now you can use that poll I don't know I don't know where they're coming up with all that Lieberman

[00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:22.030]
number and so on and of course they're all an erratic frenzy and he's last 24 hours before

[00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:27.910]
the polls open tomorrow morning so we'll see but I do like the fact that Kerry I'm gonna say it

[00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:33.450]
again John Dean John Dean Howard Dean said a lot of things that I love I think he mobilized

[00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:37.270]
energized a lot of people he got raised all that money on the internet they said it even since

[00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:40.870]
that debacle in Iowa he still raised almost a million dollars on the internet that's great

[00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:48.750]
but the fact of the matter is he can't win he can't beat W oh well and it's got that has got

[00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:54.170]
to be the motto of anybody to the left of Hitler this year is anybody but Bush ABB somebody

[00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:59.470]
some somebody that's right beat Bush lick Bush I think even the Cubans are going along with that

[00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:06.210]
I'm a lick Bush not the ones necessarily who are hanging out with landrilla McGlory holds but some

[00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:12.130]
of the other ones might not the ones calling us fine wow certainly not five six seven oh far

[00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.290]
are we on the air today or what I thought this other poll was going to get an immediate phenomenal

[00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:19.890]
response and so far nothing doing not much that's because he told them they couldn't do a do a list

[00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:27.250]
and of course now that I got this you know at the end of the cold even though I feel pretty good

[00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:31.510]
and I got most of my voice back it would be it wouldn't take too much to play the rack you know what

[00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:37.170]
I'm gonna play a wrap back it's on the rack or send him to Iraq you know who's there last night

[00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:41.610]

[00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:07.150]
of myself who are you people kidding okay who are you Kidman and the best part of it is he didn't win

[00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:11.530]
the worst part of it is Al Pacino did win and then made that awful embarrassing he made a fool

[00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:15.370]
of himself last night I mean if Mad Dog made a fool of himself we still love him but Al Pacino

[00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:19.490]
he's losing a lot of points with me not that it makes any difference in his book but I just what's

[00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:26.030]
this problem I think I hate to say it but I think he might be an asshole without he bad my

[00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:30.670]
and he might be there are talented assholes out there I hear Robert De Niro's a real asshole that's

not carry X or NC 17 rated movies and depends on renders to return a tape in the same condition

[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:14.700]
it was given to them unfortunately there are those rare instances when someone will abuse that

[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:20.840]
privilege and damage one of our tapes he said see I think it was like a little little funny that

[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:25.220]
they pulled yeah it was fine well I think it's kind of cute and it's a four-year-old girl she

[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:29.580]
ain't got to know what it's all about she in fact she might look at it and say you call that a

[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:34.720]
penis yeah she might have said that let me read a random a coley coke in the movie here's a

[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:40.740]
fact that says I heard on public radio that David Kay has no doubt that uh didn't we just get

[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:46.560]
you talking about this yes I mean yeah president Washington's got bad title they're trying to make

[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.300]
a point there because I can't get to it but it just pisses me off when they start with something

[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:54.040]
I number one just got through talking about number two they've been on this all weekend long it's

[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:59.660]
been on our website it says what really gets me is when he added to it that he believes that

[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:05.740]
president Bush a Reese what does it say we see faulty and shoddy info from the CIA well what a

[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:11.320]
concept is this going to be Bushmeister's way out I thought David Kay was on our side it says whatever

[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:16.520]
that means I know what that means keep an eye on this the cover-up continues thanks you the best

[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.380]
this is Don and Delray oh and great hates you thanks a lot Donna I heard the same interview is

[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:26.540]
like oh I don't think the board break his break it you stuff up have a good point that David

[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:30.820]
Kay thing he says yeah yeah he's blaming it on the CIA not the president he doesn't think the

[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:35.860]
president was lying you see it doesn't make any difference it doesn't make any difference I mean

[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:39.580]
there's a shadow of difference there but the fact of the matter is that it was incompetence

[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:45.400]
and just to make a bunch of crap up and to top it all off and of course we know that they were

[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.140]
under pressure the CIA we've already heard that from George Tennant we already know that yes

[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:53.900]
that they were being pressured to put together a case because I mean see this is what wears me out

[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:58.140]
I know there's a lot of stupid people running around but we've already know that they had the

[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:03.480]
plan to attack Iraq in fact the day on an hours after 9-11 happened rum still was urging them

[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.100]
already to get the plans ready for the Iraq attack so they could so they could carry out a plan

[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:15.040]
they already had right when they got elected before they got elected 1999 I mean if we didn't have

[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:19.360]
so many god damn stupid people running around just like they got a call before we was talking about

[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:25.960]
the religion thing it's tragic so tragic people who are just so narrow who never go anywhere you

[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:30.440]
don't know what the whole world is all about and that god thing man when are you gonna give it up

[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:35.120]

[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:33.380]

[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:31.000]
the painless the easy the delicious way as opposed to a lot of other complicated maybe even dangerous

[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.600]
diet programs that don't work and why is it so easy because the people at balance for life

[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.860]
figure out the glycemic values of the carbs they prepared delicious fresh goodies nothing frozen

[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:44.400]
no additives no chemicals and it really is good for you and that's all you have to do there's

[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.320]
plenty of food in your black sack to keep you happy all day long so you won't be snacking and

[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.360]
cheating in fact there are three delicious meals and two snacks in your sack every day there's

[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.280]
nothing like having a snack in the sack and they give you that menu once a week you fill out and

[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.880]
you choose to have two choices for each meal every day that you're on a program these are the only

[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.680]
people with this kind of a program that let you choose between two for every meal and snack

[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.840]
on a program so if you're tired of being fat if you're tired of being gigantic and having no

[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:13.000]
from the India to the times of India Bush stole the presidential election says Tony Blair's wife

[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:19.560]
in a fourth right view that's likely to embarrass her husband Sherry Blair wife a prime minister

[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.280]
Tony Blair is reported to have observed that George W Bush stole the US presidential election from

[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:30.960]
Al Gore and she is absolutely correct man Sherry Blair still believe that Bush had stolen the

[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.820]
White House from Gore author Philip Stevens wrote in his book Tony Blair the making of a world

[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:40.780]
although Tony Blair was pragmatic about Bush's victory Mrs. Blair was far less sanguine about

[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:46.280]
the Supreme Court decision that gave him the keys to the White House she believed Al Gore had been robbed

[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.660]
of the presidency and was hostile to the idea of her husband co-zying up to the new president

[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:55.760]
even as they flew to Washington for their first meeting with a presidential couple Mrs. Blair was

[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.420]
no move to curry favor the book stated the book's disclosures of Mrs. Blair's fourth right

[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:04.940]
views will cause embarrassment and downing street because of Blair's good working relations with Bush

[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:08.600]
and the foreign and Commonwealth office although they will not surprise officials or ministers who

[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:14.220]
knew her well how do you like that she's a lot smarter than he is you go girl yeah I say Sherry Blair

and to this day scholars still debate when a music history is tough as questions

[01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:42.430]
what could the song have possibly been about

[01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:52.290]
well sadly I don't know if we'll ever really get to the bottom of what this song was trying

[01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:58.250]
to convey to the listener pop music historian Peta principal I mean push it this can mean a

[01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:05.530]
number of things push the door open for example yes push that door open real good push the button

[01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:35.310]
song from every possible direction then it hit me Christ almighty this song is about

[01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.630]
and

[01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:43.930]
Matthew Britney's pal this is nothing but a bitter failed writer who wants to revive this career with

these accusations of push it being about the act of sexual congress next thing you know

[01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:53.530]

Lee only three over Howard Dean on the eve of the New Hampshire primary according to a Reuters

[01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:28.910]
MSNBC Zogby poll released today in other words five minutes ago is like let's say three thirty five

posted john zogby said dean stopped the bleeding in the middle of the week

[01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:58.870]
and he slowly be

[01:16:59.410 --> 01:17:01.750]
and he slowly began some of the support he lost

[01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:07.590]
dean's favorable by well i listen i have no problem with him other than the fact i don't think he can

[01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:10.590]
win and they're good if you think they made a monkey out of him so far just wait

[01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:16.290]
i i think that they're salivating they're just lickin each other's chops during a white house

[01:17:16.290 --> 01:17:20.330]
all those nazi bastards are goose stepping around i got the full gear on full uh...

over that over the screen

[01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:25.230]
no salivating with the hope that he gets nominated

[01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:27.970]
because they screened

[01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:32.050]
because they can scare the paint not just let me say to you again which you seem to be

[01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:37.050]

margin his performance in the debates was deplorable it was pathetic

[01:17:57.150 --> 01:18:01.230]

[01:27:57.910 --> 01:28:02.990]
is in perfect English right they all accent they did mute their same songs in French and Spanish

[01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:09.470]
as well in a sponual C C but in a sandwiched outlaw he speaks with a very very heavy English

[01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:15.130]
accent he's a Brit of course give you the Schmidt and in the movies he doesn't unless he's

[01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:19.210]
opposed to of course but like I can tell that mr. Ripley there is no accent at all now how do you

screen assault here but that's okay because the rating showed how many women we got

[01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:09.510]
I decided to do this one we talked like a couple of old funny duties which we both are let's face

[01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:15.070]

no question and so now we're losing our grip we're losing all oh you do you know see a lot more

[01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:29.770]
contemporary movies because you probably get boot like copies for free oh I got a teenager I got

[01:30:29.770 --> 01:30:33.590]
to stay up to date with right see but I don't I don't see these because I'm just not inclined to go

rushing out to see the latest like what was the one cold what cold mountain cold mountain I have to

[01:30:38.670 --> 01:30:46.650]

[01:31:03.150 --> 01:31:07.090]
didn't know you're on screenless right now hey Neil I've got a good movie for you not for the pole

[01:31:07.090 --> 01:31:11.950]
but one you might be interested in things okay and I think it's called wild it has Jude Law

[01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:17.030]
is playing Oscar Wilde's lover really and it has an interesting movie very good and okay

[01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:22.430]
got him and I bet your Oscar would like that is that that Oscar Wilde movie yeah

[01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:27.630]
that's what he just said I saw that it was good yeah welcome and I think it was before

[01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:31.810]
Jude Law was famous because I can't imagine pretty graphic actually the movie but I'll be

[01:31:31.810 --> 01:31:37.930]
damn I'm gonna go out and get it today and I'm assuming you have a club where go orange on your

[01:31:37.930 --> 01:31:46.710]
ball already last ten years oh sorry didn't know it was last ten years all right okay don't go

[01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:53.910]
oh because I'm explaining you're like that you guys underline he didn't hear the whole

[01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:58.210]
pole okay you mean a whole pool that's what's grand always says give me the whole

[01:31:58.210 --> 01:32:05.330]
whole and they usually do what what was the absolute best movie of the last ten years not all time

[01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:09.170]
we already been through that or pre 80 we did that we want a little more contemporary for people

[01:32:09.170 --> 01:32:14.730]
under the age of a hundred 1993 to 2003 although I will look at it the other way more constructive

[01:32:14.730 --> 01:32:19.830]
is that when you give and I said this when we took the poll last week when you give movies pre 1980

[01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:24.990]
you think that most people under the age of like 30 say or 40 haven't seen those movies because

[01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:29.590]
they're not contemporary and for the people that haven't seen them they're really missing something

[01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:33.830]
that they don't go render by the DVD or the VHS if they're old fashioned or whatever oh by the way

[01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:39.610]
to five years it's all going out CDs not DVDs but CDs going out right you see that on our website

[01:32:39.610 --> 01:32:46.190]
mm-hmm no more CDs so what are we got so far Lord of the Rings Return to the King has got 20

[01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:52.850]
saving private Ryan 15 my cousin Vinnie 14 Glen Gary Glen Ross has got 10 I'm shocked and

[01:32:52.850 --> 01:33:01.310]
pleased with that very good God is that a great movie Kevin Spacey takes so much abuse in that movie

[01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:06.990]
it's just a beautiful thing every character every line every scene is golden but it gets his

[01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:13.150]
revenge in the end because I don't like you dad don't give it away well I didn't tell him oh yeah

[01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:20.590]
office space seven alpha spacey seven the Shawshank Redemption 4 it's about a prison break or

[01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:24.190]
something isn't about prison movie it's yeah prison I don't want to see a prison movie anywhere I

[01:33:24.190 --> 01:33:28.390]
want to see no Jew movies either or go ahead I don't want to see this that's why by the way the

[01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:33.310]
couple said he did not watch that that anti-Jewel Mel Gibson movie now they're changing their tune

[01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:37.710]
right he didn't see it the passion first they said he gave it his some of approval and he said no he took

[01:33:37.710 --> 01:33:43.990]
to pull this down out like uh Shawshank Redemption 5 Requiem for Dream 4 boiling for Columbine 3

[01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:50.110]
Magnolia's got three we got another one with some good taste usual suspects too and none yet

[01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:55.150]
for payback cold mountain or forest gump how did you sneak that on here Ross is it made me cry like a

[01:33:55.150 --> 01:34:00.010]
little girl the fact that they made money with that movie and people actually liked it it made

[01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:06.430]
me cry like a real screaming little girl life is like a box a boxy talk on it and ever since he

[01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:12.150]
made that movie I hate him like poison Tom Hanks he is just he's just lost it he's gone

[01:34:12.150 --> 01:34:17.090]
like that he he's considered like the Neil Diamond of movies now he considers himself like

[01:34:17.690 --> 01:34:22.750]
you know what I mean he's legendary it's another epic with Tom Hanks just staying in the back

[01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:25.790]
with the uh you know with the mermaid and everything come out okay

[01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.870]

Mad Dog a two with a Humper from the Super Bowl, and Houston at 4.

[01:35:36.490 --> 01:35:37.430]
Who's in that Super Bowl?

[01:35:37.530 --> 01:35:39.230]
And a Carolina against the Patriots?

[01:35:39.230 --> 01:35:39.390]
Yeah.

[01:35:40.090 --> 01:35:41.090]
Let's be talking to Josh.

[01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:43.030]
Aren't the dolphins in that Super Bowl this year?

[01:35:43.290 --> 01:35:43.530]
No.

[01:35:43.630 --> 01:35:44.050]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:46.010]
Don't want to rub it in, do I?

[01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:47.750]
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

[01:35:48.670 --> 01:35:49.950]
It's a great sports town.

[01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:51.310]
You know what you're talking about.

[01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:52.190]
Okay, whatever you say.

[01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:55.090]
Kobe Bryant, by the way, they're playing a race card.

[01:35:55.090 --> 01:35:55.830]
They're aren't you surprised?

[01:35:56.150 --> 01:35:57.350]
No, gee, never saw that.

[01:35:57.410 --> 01:36:00.470]
The defense has now played their race card in the Kobe Bryant case.

[01:36:00.730 --> 01:36:03.790]
And celebrity justice has learned that the basketball star is very first

[01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:06.650]
interview with the police may come back to Hanum, to which I would say.

[01:36:06.710 --> 01:36:07.090]
Oh, right.

[01:36:07.190 --> 01:36:07.810]
Prius ass.

[01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:12.990]
Bryant and his attorney Pamela Mackie entered the courtroom, where she entered the argument

[01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:16.750]
that the basketball star's accuser may have targeted him because he's black.

[01:36:18.810 --> 01:36:22.810]
During a bid to get the woman's medical route, and of course they've smeared her, I mean, like just unbelievably,

[01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:27.490]
which is always, that's always the technique, whether it's Bobby Blake, whether it's Michael Jackson,

[01:36:27.630 --> 01:36:28.770]
always smeared the accuser.

[01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:33.370]
During a bid to get the woman's medical records and evidence of trial, Mackie told the judge,

[01:36:33.370 --> 01:36:37.290]
there's a history of African American men being wrongly accused of rape by white women.

[01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:38.770]
What, what, how was that movie?

[01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:40.610]
Take a look at my bird.

[01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:42.470]
Gregory Schmeck.

[01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:44.090]
She asked me to come into the courtroom.

[01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:45.010]
Eagle County defensor.

[01:36:45.010 --> 01:36:45.010]

[01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:47.090]
She asked me to come in and bust up a shipper wheel.

[01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:51.610]
Eagle County defensor Craig Silverman says it was bound to happen.

[01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:55.410]
He says race is always an issue, whether you want to address it on the surface or not.

[01:36:55.770 --> 01:36:58.810]
But former Denver DA, Norm early, says he's saddened by the statement.

[01:36:59.150 --> 01:37:03.190]
He says unfortunately, he would hope this case would go from beginning to end without this rearing its

[01:37:03.190 --> 01:37:05.310]
ugly head.

[01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:08.870]
You think there was head involved in this?

[01:37:09.010 --> 01:37:09.450]
Uh-oh.

[01:37:10.170 --> 01:37:10.870]
Let's see here.

[01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:12.570]
Wait until it was the best movie, Cisarskir.

[01:37:12.710 --> 01:37:13.030]
Casino.

[01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:16.750]
Got a fax saying that Glen Gary Glen Ross is from 92.

[01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:20.850]
Oh no, and that's your fault.

[01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:21.950]
My fault, my bad.

[01:37:22.330 --> 01:37:23.170]
How could it be that old?

[01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:25.070]
You want me to verify it?

[01:37:25.670 --> 01:37:26.190]
Oh, I'm looking there.

[01:37:26.290 --> 01:37:27.850]
They printed up the, uh, from IMDB.

[01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:30.730]
Well, if that's the case, then why do I need to look it up?

[01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:33.170]
You don't, you don't.

[01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:34.370]
Still, still go and see it.

[01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.890]
It's great.

[01:37:35.970 --> 01:37:38.990]
Should I have done it like from 19th Wittemont, from 90 to 2003?

[01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:40.650]
No, I don't care.

[01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:42.050]
Well, why not?

[01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:43.250]
Then we can leave it on there.

[01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:43.630]
All right.

[01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:49.350]
Then all that all has to do is just change from, uh, 1990 to 2003.

[01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:51.750]
Just change that date, Eric, if you get over the bar.

[01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:55.570]
Yeah, 90 to, well, I mean 13 is a lucky number.

[01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:57.350]
Worst from Madson Dean.

[01:37:57.610 --> 01:37:58.030]
Danny Boy.

[01:37:58.150 --> 01:37:59.010]
How's Danny Moreno doing?

[01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.710]
Anybody seen him lately?

[01:37:59.710 --> 01:37:59.890]
No.

[01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:05.130]
Uh, Casino, it says I have got a Vegas three times and practically live at McCasunny, a

[01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:08.510]
McCasunny, uh, McCasunny, Casino, since I've seen it.

[01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:11.990]
But the best reason is it's the best because due to gambling, I've gotten divorced as Oscar.

[01:38:12.270 --> 01:38:12.770]
Nice going Oscar.

[01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.750]
Congratulations, sir.

[01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:14.090]
Congratulations.

[01:38:14.690 --> 01:38:18.850]
Can I nominate Harry Peter and the Sorcerer's boners as my complanation?

[01:38:20.410 --> 01:38:21.090]
Isn't that cute?

[01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:21.610]
Yeah.

[01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:22.870]
It's real cute.

[01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:24.670]
Good life, Mike.

[01:38:24.670 --> 01:38:29.490]
5.670560, pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:33.230]
So Glen Gary Glen Ross will just change that 1990 in 2003.

[01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:34.450]
It'll be a change momentarily.

[01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:39.170]
Now, remember, I just read you that Zogby, a poll with the writers and Zogby and a couple

[01:38:39.170 --> 01:38:41.590]
of other schmenders they found on the street with Howard Dean's wife.

[01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:42.970]
She also was participating in a poll.

[01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:47.430]
CNN and, uh, they're talking about it right now.

[01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:50.410]
This side is, uh, is that obnoxious, uh, Wolf Loot's Creek.

[01:38:50.410 --> 01:38:52.790]
Calling Boots tomorrow, but how reliable historic.

[01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:55.410]
Here's the CNN time poll, okay?

[01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:57.150]
Carrie 36.

[01:38:57.330 --> 01:38:58.810]
This is as of right this second.

[01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:00.170]
Don't even take a breath.

[01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:03.850]
Carrie 36, Dean 25.

[01:39:05.010 --> 01:39:06.650]
Clark, I forgot to write down my Clark Cat.

[01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:07.350]
I think 13.

[01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:11.830]
Uh, Lieberman 10, Edwards 10, and Prodenska Sinches got one.

[01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:13.610]
One bad hair piece.

[01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:16.290]
Well, let me forget that Michael, uh, Mayo column, okay?

[01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:17.490]
Don't forget the Michael Mayo.

[01:39:17.490 --> 01:39:20.870]
I'm actually going to read it today since I sounded a little bit more articulate today

[01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:21.750]
than last week.

[01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:27.890]
I think it's that studio makes me get like kind of stroked out.

[01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:31.350]
I should have sprayed the microphone, slur all my words and get like a choking gang

[01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:32.170]
and fag away.

[01:39:32.230 --> 01:39:32.710]
Fight club.

[01:39:33.250 --> 01:39:34.530]
Brad Pitt, the fight club.

[01:39:36.090 --> 01:39:37.630]
I didn't say I would see it.

[01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:38.490]
I didn't say I would like it.

[01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:40.050]
I've seen it in the video store a million times.

[01:39:40.290 --> 01:39:40.850]
Would I buy it?

[01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:41.730]
What I watch it?

[01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:44.050]
It's just good to it is violence which they like a lot.

[01:39:44.850 --> 01:39:46.090]
And maybe they like Brad Pitt.

[01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:48.070]
How about American beauty with Kevin Spacey?

[01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:48.530]
That's a beauty.

[01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:49.370]
I like that.

[01:39:49.570 --> 01:39:49.630]
Sure.

[01:39:49.630 --> 01:39:50.970]
That's a good choice soon to be a classic.

[01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:53.350]
Now we're starting to expand that list.

[01:39:53.530 --> 01:39:55.890]
Let's get the thousand movies on there before two o'clock.

[01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:58.290]
Otherwise, you know, otherwise they look up and down.

[01:39:58.390 --> 01:40:01.830]
Let's say, well, I don't like any of these or this isn't my favorite, right?

[01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:03.190]
WQA and hello.

[01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:06.070]
QA and?

[01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:08.110]
Speaking.

[01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:09.870]
What is he with Neil?

[01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.710]
Speaking.

[01:40:11.610 --> 01:40:12.290]
I got two movies.

[01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.810]
Oh, well, that's good.

[01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:21.070]
Oh, God.

[01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:22.650]
I think that was the what's his name.

[01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:23.630]
Oh, hey, there she is.

[01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:24.870]
That was Irving that died.

[01:40:25.090 --> 01:40:25.470]
Who's that?

[01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:25.990]
Dean's wife.

[01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:26.570]
Voting.

[01:40:26.690 --> 01:40:27.690]
Oh, there's Howard Dean's wife.

[01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:29.150]
Oh, my God.

[01:40:29.150 --> 01:40:30.130]
Look at that punter, man.

[01:40:30.250 --> 01:40:30.710]
She is great.

[01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:31.410]
Oh, no.

[01:40:31.570 --> 01:40:33.230]
A word from Howard Dean's wife.

[01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.790]
No, I have to.

[01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:34.730]
What's the term?

[01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:35.310]
What punter?

[01:40:36.850 --> 01:40:37.490]
The sky.

[01:40:38.210 --> 01:40:39.310]
Oh, I love it.

[01:40:39.330 --> 01:40:40.230]
Hey, tell them.

[01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:41.010]
They are Shayna punter.

[01:40:41.170 --> 01:40:41.610]
Shayna punter.

[01:40:41.710 --> 01:40:42.010]
That's it.

[01:40:42.010 --> 01:40:42.890]
I got to remember that.

[01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:45.930]
As in par sheen, which means grotesque.

[01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:48.150]
5, 6, 7, 8, we changed it yet.

[01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:49.290]
He's going to work on it.

[01:40:49.450 --> 01:40:50.150]
Just relax.

[01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:51.150]
And then he just changed it.

[01:40:51.250 --> 01:40:53.010]
As I spoke, that was excellent, Eric.

[01:40:53.170 --> 01:40:55.150]
It was like a simultaneous orgasm.

[01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:59.010]
Hey, you that gender specific that Shayna punter.

[01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:01.370]
I don't know.

[01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:02.430]
No, of course not.

[01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:05.250]
Like Tom Brady, he's got a Shayna punter.

[01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:06.090]
That's why Laura Bush.

[01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:08.230]
Man, I'll tell you, he sure looked good at that thing.

[01:41:08.290 --> 01:41:10.370]
I didn't watch the state of the interest for obvious reasons.

[01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:12.670]
But they showed a clip of him sitting next to Laura.

[01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:15.390]
She only wishes she could get her hands on that.

[01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:16.110]
I guarantee you.

[01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:16.470]
Wow.

[01:41:17.370 --> 01:41:18.810]
Man, he sure looked pretty.

[01:41:20.290 --> 01:41:20.810]
WQA him.

[01:41:20.850 --> 01:41:21.010]
Hello.

[01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:23.170]
Hello.

[01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.310]

[01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:24.010]
QAA, yes sir.

[01:41:24.710 --> 01:41:29.830]
Oh, I just called the telly all about blow and Johnny Deeper.

[01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:31.150]
That should be his favorite moving.

[01:41:31.690 --> 01:41:32.150]
Good choice.

[01:41:32.250 --> 01:41:33.650]
Okay, excellent combination there.

[01:41:33.670 --> 01:41:33.990]
Thank you.

[01:41:34.730 --> 01:41:38.110]
Johnny Depp, he looked pretty as skanky last night at the Golden Globe Awards.

[01:41:38.230 --> 01:41:38.550]
He was there.

[01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:41.010]
I didn't know what it was.

[01:41:41.230 --> 01:41:44.470]
I usually, if I turn on, you know, I'm channel serving and I find one of those shows

[01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:45.750]
and I just, I'm gone.

[01:41:46.230 --> 01:41:46.330]
Right.

[01:41:46.450 --> 01:41:47.930]
But there was something about that room.

[01:41:48.090 --> 01:41:50.250]
There were just a lot of people in that room that I liked.

[01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:51.990]
Like Johnny Depp, a lot of Shayna punters.

[01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:54.070]
Yeah, some and some not so good.

[01:41:54.190 --> 01:41:58.090]
And most of them are like, you know, all, you know, like Odyssey, a De Niro now.

[01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:59.570]
I'm not De Niro, a Pacino.

[01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:00.970]
Another greaser.

[01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:04.170]
Odyssey, Mal Pacino with, he's got that little ponytail now.

[01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:04.850]
You see that?

[01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:06.230]
No, I missed that somehow.

[01:42:06.230 --> 01:42:09.050]
And his performance was just stupifying.

[01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:10.690]
It was just embarrassing.

[01:42:11.010 --> 01:42:11.650]
Yeah, it was.

[01:42:12.610 --> 01:42:13.830]
And he didn't want to shut up.

[01:42:14.090 --> 01:42:18.190]
And the one Jack Nicholson now on the other hand, who looked like he was really 48

[01:42:18.190 --> 01:42:19.770]
cheats to the wind as usual.

[01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:23.450]
He got up as a presenter and he didn't say one word.

[01:42:23.650 --> 01:42:24.890]
All he did was read the list.

[01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:26.510]
He gave the, you know, it was very straight.

[01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:27.050]
Well, they were.

[01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:27.410]
Oh, it was.

[01:42:28.170 --> 01:42:30.830]
It was Sharlesa Theron.

[01:42:31.170 --> 01:42:31.570]
What about her?

[01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.930]
He gave her the award.

[01:42:33.210 --> 01:42:33.730]
Oh, very good.

[01:42:34.210 --> 01:42:36.630]
Anyway, I thought he was going to like stick his tongue out of the throat.

[01:42:36.630 --> 01:42:37.850]
He tried to give her an award.

[01:42:38.530 --> 01:42:41.250]
And it was whispering into her ear and she was like laughing because he said her,

[01:42:41.250 --> 01:42:42.850]
are you nice and relaxed to accept this?

[01:42:43.450 --> 01:42:44.250]
Something like that.

[01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:47.190]
And then he stood there and he was just like drooling and salivating.

[01:42:47.730 --> 01:42:50.850]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 8th.

[01:42:50.850 --> 01:42:53.090]
She's just a little girl from South Africa is what she says.

[01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:53.710]
So that I'll leave.

[01:42:53.770 --> 01:42:54.210]
She was there.

[01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:58.490]
And I still say that that blouse she had on looked like several guys that like try to rip

[01:42:58.490 --> 01:42:59.910]
that baby off her ass.

[01:43:00.690 --> 01:43:01.250]
Come in to QA him.

[01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.450]
Hello.

[01:43:02.250 --> 01:43:03.570]
Hey, yeah, sir.

[01:43:04.650 --> 01:43:08.870]
How about the prejuvating nuggets and epic Braveheart?

[01:43:09.710 --> 01:43:10.470]
Braveheart, OK?

[01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.770]
Haven't seen that.

[01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:13.290]
And if I'm lucky, everyone, thank you, sir.

[01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:14.310]
Braveheart, what do you say?

[01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:14.830]
Sure.

[01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:19.390]
I mean, not that we have anything to say if it's between 1990 and 2004.

[01:43:19.730 --> 01:43:20.470]
It's all the lies.

[01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:22.110]
Never the last four star movie.

[01:43:23.250 --> 01:43:23.670]
Are you important?

[01:43:24.090 --> 01:43:24.770]
Braveheart, it's excellent.

[01:43:25.130 --> 01:43:25.570]
You would like to.

[01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:29.510]
You'll melt your wisdom and combat and epic things happening.

[01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.870]
Yeah.

[01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:31.790]
I don't think I got to watch him objectively.

[01:43:32.130 --> 01:43:33.590]
He just even before passion.

[01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:35.590]
This whole paint on his face, if that helps.

[01:43:36.010 --> 01:43:37.070]
Yeah, maybe a mask.

[01:43:38.670 --> 01:43:39.750]
Why do I keep doing line four?

[01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:42.550]
Everybody also getting screwed because there's some reason my finger is stuck on a four.

[01:43:42.650 --> 01:43:43.110]
QA M.

[01:43:44.330 --> 01:43:44.650]
Right.

[01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:46.410]
You know, go to your QA M.

[01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:46.610]
Hello.

[01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:48.630]
Hi, I got a great one.

[01:43:48.970 --> 01:43:49.250]
OK.

[01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.950]
American beauty.

[01:43:51.730 --> 01:43:53.210]
Just reach it to it, but it is good.

[01:43:53.290 --> 01:43:54.050]
And thank you so much.

[01:43:54.130 --> 01:43:55.010]
Just beat him to it, right?

[01:43:55.410 --> 01:43:55.510]
Yes.

[01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:57.250]
And why do I speak in a beauty?

[01:43:57.630 --> 01:43:59.050]
They're showing duty on Channel 4 news.

[01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:00.990]
I still can't get over that.

[01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:03.550]
Don't we all know what crap looks like?

[01:44:03.850 --> 01:44:05.490]
Never we all seem plenty of it in our lives.

[01:44:05.670 --> 01:44:09.410]
We don't need to see baby car seats with crap on it.

[01:44:09.490 --> 01:44:11.210]
OK, you ask holes in Channel 4 news.

[01:44:11.630 --> 01:44:12.590]
Does it all with you, man?

[01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:15.710]
If I say crap on here, oh, GD, here what he said,

[01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:17.930]
but they're showing crap right there on a goddamn news.

[01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:20.150]
In addition to which I think most people are getting ready

[01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:22.490]
or maybe even already digging into their dinner while sitting there watching

[01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:24.330]
the 530 or 6 p.m. news.

[01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:26.590]
I got it since people like to use the word shock,

[01:44:26.590 --> 01:44:28.330]
all the time inappropriately.

[01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.550]

[01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:29.850]
Shock news, Channel 4.

[01:44:29.850 --> 01:44:31.310]
Yeah, Shock news on Channel 4.

[01:44:32.050 --> 01:44:33.190]
They're giving me the real Schmidt.

[01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:35.150]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:36.190]
Hey, Uncle Neil.

[01:44:36.190 --> 01:44:36.570]
How you doing?

[01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:37.530]
Yes, man, another lady.

[01:44:37.870 --> 01:44:39.170]
Oh, I can't get over it.

[01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:40.190]
Yes, I'm here.

[01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:41.150]
I'm always here.

[01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.830]
Hallelujah.

[01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:42.790]
Thank God for you.

[01:44:43.130 --> 01:44:44.530]
Yeah, I have a movie for you, Paul.

[01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:45.890]
Something I totally enjoy.

[01:44:46.130 --> 01:44:47.890]
There are a late from start to finish.

[01:44:48.110 --> 01:44:49.670]
I love the Pirates of Caribbean.

[01:44:50.210 --> 01:44:51.570]
Would Johnny Dez speak at the devil?

[01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:53.270]
He was there last night.

[01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:54.590]
I didn't get to see the Golden Globes.

[01:44:54.630 --> 01:44:55.430]
He was actually there.

[01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:56.270]
Yes, he was.

[01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.830]
He was there.

[01:44:57.010 --> 01:44:57.790]
Came to the country.

[01:44:57.890 --> 01:45:00.090]
Probably he's got his return ticket, you know, hot in his hand.

[01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:03.830]
Yes, but he wasn't wearing that stupid black stripe suit again.

[01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:04.190]
Was he?

[01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:06.830]
Nobody had like the beard in the long hair.

[01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:07.650]
He looked really grubby.

[01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:08.370]
I don't know.

[01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:10.790]
I'm sorry, but to hand him a bar of coast or something.

[01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:14.450]
I'm sorry, you've cleaned that young man up and he is so hot.

[01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:16.830]
He's still, he's still can pass for like 25.

[01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:18.090]
I was really can't.

[01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:19.070]
He's, he's awesome.

[01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:21.330]
So that was an enjoyable movie from start to finish.

[01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:24.250]
Real I would pass him the soap and hope maybe you can hold on to it.

[01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:26.230]
Yeah, well, you want to see him really grungy.

[01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.950]
Go see that movie.

[01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:28.110]
OK, thanks.

[01:45:28.150 --> 01:45:29.070]
Have a lovely day, sir.

[01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.910]
And back to you.

[01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:31.530]
Pirates of the Caribbean Caribbean.

[01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:32.290]
What do you say?

[01:45:32.370 --> 01:45:33.150]
I say Caribbean.

[01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.850]
Put it on there.

[01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:36.790]
Are you like ordering him?

[01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:38.630]
Like always Josh put these on.

[01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:41.110]
Yeah, more good because he can't spell, but that's OK.

[01:45:41.190 --> 01:45:41.510]
We don't mind.

[01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:42.550]
We're not worried about spawning.

[01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:44.610]
Yeah, well, he's in that sports crap.

[01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:45.530]
You know, he's a sports nerd.

[01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:48.830]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60.

[01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:50.010]
Oh, there's the deans.

[01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:51.210]
Your, your concession.

[01:45:51.370 --> 01:45:51.850]
Busy Dean.

[01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:53.670]
Howard Dean shows the play at 610.

[01:45:53.670 --> 01:45:56.730]
And for Schlafer Dean, we that is your privilege.

[01:45:57.090 --> 01:45:58.470]
I have to if I'm going to run for president.

[01:45:58.610 --> 01:45:59.610]
She could be.

[01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:03.290]
I mean, seriously, the thing I think it was they want apology

[01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:04.630]
and I couldn't go a bit to the omission.

[01:46:05.490 --> 01:46:06.450]
He makes Chelsea.

[01:46:06.450 --> 01:46:08.370]
He is the most grotesque thing I have ever.

[01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:10.170]
She makes Chelsea Clinton look good.

[01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:11.230]
That's how obvious she is.

[01:46:12.150 --> 01:46:14.050]
Once again, today, how are we going to get out of here?

[01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:15.110]
We'll take a hike.

[01:46:16.250 --> 01:46:16.570]
WQAM.

[01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:16.830]
Hello.

[01:46:18.850 --> 01:46:19.170]
QAM.

[01:46:20.290 --> 01:46:23.090]
Hey, if you're going to take the list back to 1990,

[01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:25.770]
you've got to put the talent of the lands on there.

[01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:27.690]
Was that post 90?

[01:46:28.530 --> 01:46:30.390]
That was 91 91.

[01:46:30.930 --> 01:46:31.610]
OK, excellent.

[01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:33.230]
We'll have our pack checker verify that.

[01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:34.690]
We'll have our bag checker checker.

[01:46:34.730 --> 01:46:35.450]
Thank you.

[01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:36.690]
Thanks a lot, people.

[01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.950]
Enjoy.

[01:46:37.690 --> 01:46:38.030]
So, a fast.

[01:46:38.290 --> 01:46:41.250]
And I, you know, I really enjoyed my practice.

[01:46:41.630 --> 01:46:42.970]
I was distracted because I'm looking at her.

[01:46:43.110 --> 01:46:45.750]
Now, there's a donkey plus, man, with a tee.

[01:46:45.850 --> 01:46:49.050]
Oh, listen, she'll be doing a weather on Channel 7

[01:46:49.050 --> 01:46:50.010]
in the morning pretty soon.

[01:46:50.210 --> 01:46:50.390]
If you leave it.

[01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:52.390]
You should have hired a stunt double or something.

[01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.730]
God.

[01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:56.870]
I wonder what the first thing that Howard Dean said when he saw her face.

[01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.230]
Yeah.

[01:46:58.750 --> 01:46:59.110]
Huh?

[01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:03.170]
When he writes something in the morning and tastes a look at that, he says, man.

[01:47:04.410 --> 01:47:05.030]
Oh, man.

[01:47:05.610 --> 01:47:05.970]
Good.

[01:47:06.230 --> 01:47:09.510]
God, Alma, can you imagine waking up in the morning and looking at that?

[01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:10.490]
Oh, look at me.

[01:47:11.410 --> 01:47:12.530]
That is gruesome.

[01:47:12.770 --> 01:47:13.270]
Can any race?

[01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:14.090]
To reach its own?

[01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:16.070]
Maybe that's why.

[01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:19.630]
See, nobody, I mean, it would be very politically incorrect and extraordinarily

[01:47:19.630 --> 01:47:22.050]
rude and people would accuse the media of piling on.

[01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:24.970]
But maybe that's the real reason why he has been keeping her in a closet.

[01:47:25.630 --> 01:47:26.010]
Wouldn't you?

[01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:28.270]
You were running for any office and you had a wife that looked like that.

[01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:29.650]
Wouldn't you keep her in the closet?

[01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:30.310]
Absolutely.

[01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:30.890]

[01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.210]
You bet.

[01:47:32.610 --> 01:47:35.130]
From it, it's past noon at 560 WQM.

[01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:36.910]
It's the last mortgage you'll ever need.

[01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:39.370]
It's the only one mortgage from the financial group.

[01:47:39.490 --> 01:47:41.010]
The benefits are incredible.

[01:47:41.170 --> 01:47:41.550]
Incredible.

[01:47:41.930 --> 01:47:42.950]
Zero closing cost.

[01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:47.190]
You pay zero application fee, zero credit bureau fee, zero discounted points.

[01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:50.790]
Get yourself the new low interest rate of just 1.25%.

[01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:54.510]
If you have $100,000, your payments are a mere $334 bucks a month.

[01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:57.770]
If you have a $200,000, your pay only $668 a month.

[01:47:58.050 --> 01:48:00.830]
And don't forget, once you're refinancing to get a new home mortgage from financial group,

[01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:03.710]
you will never, ever pay closing costs again.

[01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:08.030]

[01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:12.390]
further cost or expense.

[01:48:12.710 --> 01:48:16.390]
You pay zero underwriting fee, zero dock fee, zero closing costs.

[01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:18.050]
Even when you move to another property.

[01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:21.430]

[01:48:47.730 --> 01:48:48.450]
Hello, yeah.

[01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:49.930]
I was at it.

[01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:52.010]
Screw up again, did it.

[01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:53.230]
My bad, the last spot.

[01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:55.170]
My, my, and local.

[01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:56.230]
One more please.

[01:48:56.490 --> 01:48:57.470]
What's real by 16?

[01:48:58.090 --> 01:48:59.330]
You ain't a new way.

[01:48:59.730 --> 01:49:00.750]
Hi, this is Sonny Fox.

[01:49:00.970 --> 01:49:02.930]
I listen to you, Rodgers, because I can hear the word asshole.

[01:49:03.130 --> 01:49:03.830]
Hey, asshole.

[01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:09.590]
Do you have a green card?

[01:49:09.770 --> 01:49:11.090]
No. Do you have working papers?

[01:49:11.290 --> 01:49:12.430]
No. Do you have a visa?

It's tremor.

[01:49:27.730 --> 01:49:27.910]
See.

[01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.510]
It's tremor.

[01:49:28.730 --> 01:49:28.930]
See.

[01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.930]

[01:49:32.490 --> 01:49:32.710]
See.

[01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:37.550]
We're in the United States government, and we don't care if you're here illegally.

[01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:41.590]
Because we want you to work 17 hour days for virtually no paid.

[01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:45.030]
While lazy Americans lay on the couch and collect welfare.

[01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:46.470]
It's the American dream.

[01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:51.010]
I love to work hard for no money, and living in a box under the bridge.

[01:49:51.230 --> 01:49:53.070]
Pay for by the committee to re-elect George Bush.

[01:49:53.330 --> 01:49:54.790]
That's the American fucking way.

[01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:55.170]
Exactly.

[01:49:55.610 --> 01:49:58.210]
1217 at 560 WDQM, happy Monday to you.

[01:49:58.270 --> 01:50:00.090]
I think I'm getting a mong out of my system, you know?

[01:50:00.570 --> 01:50:00.970]
Very good.

[01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:02.310]
I think it's coming out.

[01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.730]
I think it's coming out.

[01:50:02.730 --> 01:50:04.310]
I think it's an herb tea in spite of what you said.

[01:50:04.410 --> 01:50:05.690]
I think it like brings it all out.

[01:50:05.850 --> 01:50:06.190]
Herb?

[01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:09.850]
What was the absolute best movie last 13 years?

[01:50:10.110 --> 01:50:12.870]
1990 to 2003 or like right this moment?

[01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:14.810]
Lord of the Rings, we turn to the King.

[01:50:15.590 --> 01:50:15.970]
28.

[01:50:16.690 --> 01:50:18.290]
The Shawshank Redemption 24.

[01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:19.850]
Yeah, I wish I could find that tape.

[01:50:20.050 --> 01:50:20.610]
Jason gave me.

[01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:22.270]
Did you see it?

[01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.930]
Yeah.

[01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.770]
And?

[01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:24.370]
It was adequate.

[01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:27.570]
It was fine.

[01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:28.490]
There was nothing wrong with it.

[01:50:28.570 --> 01:50:30.310]
Like I said, I'm sure glad I lost that tape.

[01:50:31.170 --> 01:50:33.830]
My cousin Vinnie, 19, saving private Ryan, 19.

[01:50:34.210 --> 01:50:35.510]

[01:50:35.970 --> 01:50:37.470]
Bowling for column by in 12.

[01:50:37.650 --> 01:50:38.410]
A must see.

[01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:39.750]
Office base 10.

[01:50:40.170 --> 01:50:41.010]
Schindler's list is.

[01:50:41.010 --> 01:50:42.350]
How did you sneak that to movie?

[01:50:42.410 --> 01:50:43.370]
Oh, real slick.

[01:50:43.690 --> 01:50:44.630]
Oh, God.

[01:50:44.850 --> 01:50:46.870]
Oh, and coincidentally, or maybe not.

[01:50:47.150 --> 01:50:48.570]
It's right tied with forest dump.

[01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:50.290]
Very good.

[01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:52.790]
Also tied with record for a dream, which I take that personally.

[01:50:52.930 --> 01:50:54.230]
Don't not tell you watch it, dude.

[01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:55.270]
What's that?

[01:50:55.650 --> 01:50:56.050]
Schindler's list.

[01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.950]
I will not be watching.

[01:50:57.150 --> 01:50:57.570]
It's about a Nazi.

[01:50:58.370 --> 01:51:01.370]
I already work with Irv Schindler at WKAT 100 years ago.

[01:51:01.530 --> 01:51:01.630]
Okay.

[01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:03.430]
I don't want to see no movie about Irv Schindler.

[01:51:03.630 --> 01:51:03.970]
It's very good.

[01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:05.710]
It's probably still pedaling for just a China.

[01:51:06.030 --> 01:51:11.090]
Oh, and speaking of China, things are getting a little foul in China, you know what I'm saying?

[01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:13.390]
Why is it that Southeast Asia?

[01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:14.510]
Is it lack of cleanliness?

[01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:16.050]
Is it lack of sanitation?

[01:51:16.630 --> 01:51:18.790]
Is it the movement of people that are like our billionaires?

[01:51:19.050 --> 01:51:20.150]
All of those things.

[01:51:20.530 --> 01:51:24.150]
All of these SARS, and now we've got the, what is the bird flu?

[01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.830]
What do they call it?

[01:51:25.730 --> 01:51:26.090]
Avion?

[01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:27.610]
Avion?

[01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:27.870]

[01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:28.770]
The airplane pronounce that.

[01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:30.270]
We'll get sued by the Avion water people.

[01:51:31.930 --> 01:51:33.850]

[01:51:34.610 --> 01:51:35.790]

Graveheart 2.

[01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:39.250]
Casinos got one.

[01:51:40.650 --> 01:51:41.730]
And only one for these.

[01:51:42.450 --> 01:51:43.010]
Good fellows.

[01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:44.610]
What year was good fellows?

[01:51:45.570 --> 01:51:45.890]
90.

[01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:47.910]
Miguel came in, and insisted.

[01:51:48.370 --> 01:51:48.750]
I'll be now.

[01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:49.610]
And that's his kind of movie.

[01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:51.990]
Fight Club 1.

[01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:53.290]
American Beauty 1.

[01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:54.690]
One of the lot of greasy people in it.

[01:51:54.850 --> 01:51:55.430]
Blow 1.

[01:51:55.890 --> 01:51:56.570]

And none for a cold mountain parrots of the Caribbean or Gladiator yet.

[01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:01.530]
Oh, Gladiator, I've seen that one.

[01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:02.130]
Do that.

[01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:06.890]
I'm not talking about, well, Alex said the please add Gladiator, the boss on it.

[01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:08.210]
That's another Mel Gibson movie, right?

[01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.630]
No.

[01:52:09.230 --> 01:52:09.850]
Who's in it?

[01:52:09.970 --> 01:52:10.790]
Russell Crowe.

[01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:11.790]
Oh, Russell Crowe.

[01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:12.810]
Same person, isn't it?

[01:52:12.930 --> 01:52:13.110]
No.

[01:52:13.850 --> 01:52:15.050]
Don't they remind you of each other?

[01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.430]
No.

[01:52:15.650 --> 01:52:16.970]
I mean, Russell Crowe is a much better actor.

[01:52:17.170 --> 01:52:17.450]
He's an islander.

[01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:17.530]

[01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.950]
They're both Australian.

[01:52:18.150 --> 01:52:18.990]
They're both assholes.

[01:52:19.210 --> 01:52:21.030]
They're both from Daananda.

[01:52:21.650 --> 01:52:22.550]
How about Cbiscuit?

[01:52:22.670 --> 01:52:23.350]
Somebody fax his.

[01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:26.270]
He says Cbiscuit is an amazing movie.

[01:52:27.370 --> 01:52:28.110]
You see it?

[01:52:28.230 --> 01:52:28.350]
No.

[01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:29.350]
Well, Cbiscuit.

[01:52:29.630 --> 01:52:30.710]
I'm not going to go see that.

[01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:32.390]
I mean, see, I don't understand.

[01:52:32.590 --> 01:52:34.410]
It's like it's like Lassie come home.

[01:52:34.530 --> 01:52:34.750]
Right.

[01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:40.370]
What was that movie with Liz Taylor, the horse movie, Blackview, your summer battle like these deliberate heart-string polo?

[01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:44.510]
Yeah, it's just, I mean, nobody really cares about Cbiscuit because he raised about 100 years ago.

[01:52:44.710 --> 01:52:48.950]
And it was a wonderful little horse and a little jockey there who used to be Spider-Man and now he's a jockey.

[01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:53.250]
And he wrote a bad race and he fell asleep at the wire and had one race and the guy's bitching him out the trainer.

[01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:55.650]
And I've seen that promo a million times.

[01:52:56.410 --> 01:52:58.710]
But if they had a movie about Secretary, I might see that.

[01:52:59.070 --> 01:52:59.310]
Maybe.

[01:52:59.570 --> 01:53:00.550]
I'm not, you know, possible.

[01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:03.810]
But it's just, it's, I don't know.

[01:53:05.670 --> 01:53:09.250]
You thought I'm saying that with the horse racing person in the first place.

[01:53:09.610 --> 01:53:11.110]
The heartwarming story of the horse.

[01:53:11.490 --> 01:53:11.770]
Right.

[01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:12.230]
Exactly.

[01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:13.630]
I'm just under that crap.

[01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:16.590]
I mean, you know, Lassie come up, ban B, stuff like that.

[01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:18.590]
It's for hearts and flowers people.

[01:53:19.770 --> 01:53:20.490]
WQA, hello.

[01:53:21.090 --> 01:53:21.690]
Hi, guys.

[01:53:21.690 --> 01:53:22.090]
I'm Dr. Neil.

[01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:23.090]
Yes sir, speaking.

[01:53:23.770 --> 01:53:24.870]
I got one for the four.

[01:53:25.210 --> 01:53:25.410]
Okay.

[01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:26.610]
How about G Lee?

[01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.850]
Yeah.

[01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:30.270]
Oh, there's the comedy.

[01:53:30.490 --> 01:53:31.770]
Do not put that on there.

[01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:32.070]
Okay.

[01:53:33.630 --> 01:53:35.070]
Yeah, don't put that on there.

[01:53:35.170 --> 01:53:38.150]
It's just the guys just, you know, trying to start the way you put a few yuck's.

[01:53:38.610 --> 01:53:39.410]
Yeah, yuck, all right.

[01:53:40.170 --> 01:53:42.890]
Man, yuck is the word to both of them.

[01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:45.490]
Ben Offlock and Jelo.

[01:53:46.170 --> 01:53:48.490]
And they still keep trying to pump that.

[01:53:48.510 --> 01:53:48.950]
Oh, I know.

[01:53:49.190 --> 01:53:49.470]
I know.

[01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:52.970]
They still like, I don't think there's anybody who cares anymore.

[01:53:53.070 --> 01:53:54.310]
I think even they care no more.

[01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:55.370]
No, but their publicity people.

[01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:57.470]
Oh, now they're supposed to be official.

[01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:58.610]
Who cares?

[01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:59.870]
Don't just go away.

[01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:00.650]
Don't go away, man.

[01:54:00.850 --> 01:54:01.750]
Just go to hell away.

[01:54:02.710 --> 01:54:03.470]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:54:04.090 --> 01:54:04.530]
Neil.

[01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:05.350]
Yes sir.

[01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:06.830]
I got a good one for you.

[01:54:06.970 --> 01:54:07.310]
All right.

[01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.530]
Nemento.

[01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:10.870]
Hey, Nemento is sensational.

[01:54:11.770 --> 01:54:12.430]
And, man.

[01:54:13.650 --> 01:54:14.250]
See what?

[01:54:14.250 --> 01:54:15.150]
Now, why did you do that?

[01:54:15.490 --> 01:54:15.650]
Too.

[01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:16.470]
Why did he do a pair?

[01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:19.270]
That's what he has in his mind.

[01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:20.010]
What do you say, Snatch?

[01:54:20.110 --> 01:54:21.110]
Maybe that's what he's just thinking about.

[01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:23.590]
Nemento, now don't forget the Easter eggs.

[01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:24.310]
Right.

[01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:28.890]
How many people do you think really, if they never heard us talking about that?

[01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:31.090]
People, you know, they know what we're talking about.

[01:54:31.410 --> 01:54:31.950]

[01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:33.590]
30 people know from the Easter eggs.

[01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:34.010]
Nope.

[01:54:34.290 --> 01:54:37.550]
And I still think it's some kind of a commie pinco conspiracy to drive us all nuts.

[01:54:37.630 --> 01:54:38.150]
The Illuminati.

[01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:39.130]
They, they cooked it up.

[01:54:39.250 --> 01:54:40.550]

She's got a little needle nose, but I like her.

[01:59:33.630 --> 01:59:37.770]
She's a good, although she has an Audi so that she's off and read this read this that she farts a lot.

[02:00:26.690 --> 02:00:27.410]
No, that's not right.

[02:00:27.490 --> 02:00:27.950]
That's the next.

[02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.850]
Oh, that's a good thing.

[02:00:28.890 --> 02:00:29.490]
I didn't do that.

[02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:31.310]
You hear that?

[02:00:31.530 --> 02:00:31.890]
Careful.

[02:00:32.150 --> 02:00:33.990]
You didn't hear me say that coming up next Monday.

[02:00:34.110 --> 02:00:36.630]

[02:00:42.110 --> 02:00:43.090]
This is the wrong copy.

[02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.810]
Damn it.

[02:00:44.010 --> 02:00:44.450]
Oh, I know.

[02:00:44.630 --> 02:00:45.750]
And it's not the wrong copy.

[02:00:45.870 --> 02:00:46.690]
I'm just planning ahead.

[02:00:47.190 --> 02:00:47.850]

[02:02:13.050 --> 02:02:13.750]
Says Roberto.

[02:02:14.210 --> 02:02:14.830]
Very good movie.

Is it?

[02:02:15.670 --> 02:02:15.810]
Yes.

[02:02:16.150 --> 02:02:16.670]
You seen it?

[02:02:16.810 --> 02:02:17.310]
Have it.

[02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:19.090]
You seen Arlington Road?

[02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:19.690]
Yes.

[02:02:20.230 --> 02:02:25.750]
Very good movie and Frank Faxson says the greatest ending of a movie I have ever seen of that up there.

[02:02:27.150 --> 02:02:28.190]
It's stuck it up there.

[02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:29.210]
I've seen many like that.

[02:02:29.210 --> 02:02:33.390]
No, it's like one of the most surprising never-site coming endings.

[02:02:33.570 --> 02:02:33.790]
Really?

[02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:35.650]
Have we discussed this before?

[02:02:35.970 --> 02:02:36.590]
I don't think so.

[02:02:37.290 --> 02:02:37.950]
Arlington Road.

[02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:38.570]
You would like it.

[02:02:38.730 --> 02:02:40.530]
It's a mental movie.

[02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:42.370]
You got to have a brain to understand.

[02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:46.070]
I'm sticking it right over here and right after the show, I'm going to go grab it.

[02:02:46.650 --> 02:02:47.890]
And it better be Dan Good.

[02:02:48.210 --> 02:02:48.930]
It'll be good.

[02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:51.550]
Here's the fact that says oh, Danny DeVino was there last night.

[02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:55.110]
Suck up to Michael Douglas was a little bit even talked about the booze.

[02:02:55.710 --> 02:03:01.230]
Michael Douglas rambled on and on and he just, I mean, he's not right, but he's just, I don't know.

[02:03:01.970 --> 02:03:03.430]
Something about him bugs me, you know.

[02:03:04.250 --> 02:03:04.710]
His height.

[02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:06.790]
No, no, I'm not talking about that.

[02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:11.070]
I'm not talking about the way he looks, but there's just something about him that's a little like Howard Dean.

[02:03:11.730 --> 02:03:13.730]
I like him, but he's a little bit off.

[02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.450]
Feeling the same?

[02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:14.910]
No.

[02:03:15.130 --> 02:03:15.890]
It's hard to explain.

[02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:17.810]
I can't put my thumb on it nor do I want to.

[02:03:19.630 --> 02:03:21.870]
Oh, he's now he's campaigning with the wife.

[02:03:22.090 --> 02:03:22.590]
Bad move.

[02:03:22.590 --> 02:03:25.030]
Just when he looked like he might be making a little bit of comeback.

[02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:28.990]
It's a change, I think, what you have to ask why it's not just that John Kerry's doing well.

[02:03:29.090 --> 02:03:30.310]
I see they're talking about electability.

[02:03:30.490 --> 02:03:32.070]
This is what's on the mind of the electorate.

[02:03:32.210 --> 02:03:34.110]
Okay, please, please keep that in mind.

[02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:35.550]
I know people get very emotional.

[02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:40.710]
They get all whipped up behind a certain person who, you know, touches the right buttons and rings the right bills,

[02:03:40.890 --> 02:03:42.610]
but electability.

[02:03:42.990 --> 02:03:46.270]
We can't afford former years of this fascist regime.

[02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:50.210]
Anyway, Danny DeVino was there sucking up to a Michael.

[02:03:50.210 --> 02:03:52.670]
Maybe that's why they hand him there with Michael Douglas because he was a lot shorter.

[02:03:52.710 --> 02:03:57.650]
He came up to his knee and what did Michael Douglas have to do with cook who's nested?

[02:03:57.750 --> 02:04:00.770]
He produced that was he the, I mean, directed producer something.

[02:04:01.110 --> 02:04:02.470]
He was involved and I forget how.

[02:04:02.530 --> 02:04:06.430]
Yeah, because he was talking about the fact that it was his dad who saw the script and discovered it.

[02:04:06.450 --> 02:04:08.930]
Old break who couldn't make it last night because he was a little shaky.

[02:04:08.930 --> 02:04:11.390]
I also was his dad wanted to be in it.

[02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:15.350]
And I think it was a son, Michael, that said, nah, Jack Nicholson will be better.

[02:04:15.810 --> 02:04:16.390]
And he was.

[02:04:16.650 --> 02:04:17.030]
He was.

[02:04:17.290 --> 02:04:19.330]
Can you imagine Kevin Kirk does this?

[02:04:19.330 --> 02:04:23.170]
No, no, no, no, no.

[02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:24.150]
Is it?

[02:04:24.150 --> 02:04:24.150]

[02:04:24.150 --> 02:04:24.150]

[02:04:24.150 --> 02:04:26.050]
Kevin Spacey Danny DeVino filmed the big kahuna.

[02:04:26.250 --> 02:04:29.130]
It says it has a public popularity of American duty, but it's a great film.

[02:04:29.410 --> 02:04:29.950]
The big kahuna.

[02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:33.410]
I thought it was Robby Young was the big kahuna.

[02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:34.290]
Same.

[02:04:34.610 --> 02:04:35.110]
Stan Creck.

[02:04:35.690 --> 02:04:36.810]
Did you see the big kahuna?

[02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:37.230]
No, no.

[02:04:37.330 --> 02:04:38.510]
Well, get it on that list right away.

[02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:39.710]
Maybe you'll go out and have to get it.

[02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:40.050]
Go on out.

[02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:41.310]
Maybe somebody will have to steal it for you.

[02:04:42.250 --> 02:04:45.870]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on an AT&T line.

[02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:47.830]
What was the absolute best movie?

[02:04:48.010 --> 02:04:52.530]
Not 10, not 100, not 4,000 of the last 13 years, 1990 to right now.

[02:04:53.310 --> 02:04:59.290]
Lord of the Rings, we turn the king 35, the Shawshank Redemption 27, saving prior,

[02:04:59.450 --> 02:05:01.270]
Ryan, Ryan 24.

[02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:08.910]
My cousin Vinnie 19, Glenyari Glen Ross 18, boy for Columbine 14, office space 13,

[02:05:09.410 --> 02:05:12.470]
Shinler's List a dozen, sounds at a Lamb's 9.

[02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:14.470]
I'm surprised, sounds at Lens and Doom better, aren't you?

[02:05:15.170 --> 02:05:16.050]
It's a tough list.

[02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:19.370]
Forrest Dump 8, yeah, it's tough, all right.

[02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:24.670]
Requiem for Dream 6, Brave Heart 4, Magnolia 4, American Beauty 4, usual suspects 4.

[02:05:26.190 --> 02:05:27.190]
Good fellows 3.

[02:05:27.530 --> 02:05:29.110]
Hey, good fellows only has 3, Omega.

[02:05:30.050 --> 02:05:32.430]
Well, his taste is in his Tush, except his wife.

[02:05:34.570 --> 02:05:35.390]
From what I hear.

[02:05:37.590 --> 02:05:39.490]
I hear he's got a lovely wife, Omega.

[02:05:39.610 --> 02:05:40.810]
He has a lovely pregnant wife.

[02:05:40.850 --> 02:05:41.450]
And why not?

[02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:49.330]
Fight Club 3, Paris City Caribbean 3, Casino 2, payback 1, blow 1, 1 person out there

[02:05:49.330 --> 02:05:49.910]
likes blow.

[02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:54.410]
Memento 1, Chicago 1, isn't that the one with a lady Marmalade?

[02:05:54.970 --> 02:05:54.970]

[02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:57.570]
And what was that in Chicago?

[02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:58.630]
Amulam Rouge?

[02:06:00.010 --> 02:06:00.770]
I don't know.

[02:06:01.130 --> 02:06:01.370]
Yeah.

[02:06:01.930 --> 02:06:02.490]
What do you talk about?

[02:06:02.490 --> 02:06:04.330]
The whole thing was about Chicago, you better get with it.

[02:06:04.450 --> 02:06:05.410]
I never saw it.

[02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:09.850]
Glady Inter and Steve Muscoot and enemy at the gates and the life of David Gayle and

[02:06:09.850 --> 02:06:16.130]
Cold Mountain and Arlington Road and Monsters Ball and the big owner each have the big so

[02:06:16.130 --> 02:06:16.950]
far to 220.

[02:06:17.110 --> 02:06:18.830]
But we're just getting this sucker put together now.

[02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:19.270]
Just relax.

[02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:21.330]
Just hop on it.

[02:06:23.210 --> 02:06:23.930]
WQA, hello.

[02:06:24.690 --> 02:06:26.610]
What about politics and everybody say politics?

[02:06:27.230 --> 02:06:28.050]
Nobody said that.

[02:06:28.190 --> 02:06:29.310]
Is that what yours at?

[02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:30.030]
It's recent.

[02:06:30.370 --> 02:06:31.710]
For the 94.

[02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:32.970]
I think you got it.

[02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.530]
OK, thanks.

[02:06:34.110 --> 02:06:35.350]
He did a hated politics.

[02:06:35.690 --> 02:06:39.210]
It was just nothing but it's John Revolta and a bunch of gratuitous senseless violence.

[02:06:39.210 --> 02:06:43.210]
But you know what they put on their french fries in Amsterdam and Holland?

[02:06:44.050 --> 02:06:45.730]
No, what do they put on their french fries?

[02:06:45.730 --> 02:06:46.430]
Couldn't be mayonnaise.

[02:06:46.730 --> 02:06:47.210]
But that, huh?

[02:06:47.550 --> 02:06:48.170]
Oh man.

[02:06:49.090 --> 02:06:52.530]
Speaking of that, I keep telling you about how the food really sucks.

[02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:53.350]
Well, there are a lot of people.

[02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:54.830]
A lot of things that suck in Amsterdam.

[02:06:55.050 --> 02:06:56.110]
Some of them are actually going around.

[02:06:57.330 --> 02:06:58.970]
But the food is so awful.

[02:06:59.110 --> 02:07:00.810]
Maybe that's why they're so big on the french fries.

[02:07:00.970 --> 02:07:05.110]
And they walk around with these big huge paper things.

[02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:06.910]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:07:07.150 --> 02:07:08.810]
Yeah, like cones or something.

[02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:09.690]
Yeah, like that's right.

[02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:12.750]
Like a big paper cone filled with fries.

[02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:13.350]
Hmm.

[02:07:13.530 --> 02:07:14.030]
Sounds yummy.

[02:07:14.730 --> 02:07:15.670]
Oh, man.

[02:07:15.790 --> 02:07:16.410]
Real salty.

[02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:17.890]
I never, well, this one I'm told.

[02:07:18.050 --> 02:07:18.630]
I never had one.

[02:07:19.890 --> 02:07:21.850]
And they have mayonnaise and they got that brown sauce.

[02:07:22.030 --> 02:07:22.550]
They stick on them.

[02:07:22.590 --> 02:07:23.450]
I think it's brown sauce.

[02:07:23.850 --> 02:07:24.770]
Maybe it's from Channel 4.

[02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:25.250]
They got that.

[02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.610]
I don't know.

[02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:29.850]
Because some people told me they taste like crap.

[02:07:30.730 --> 02:07:31.090]
WQAM.

[02:07:31.150 --> 02:07:31.370]
Hello.

[02:07:32.050 --> 02:07:32.730]
Hey Neil.

[02:07:33.110 --> 02:07:33.430]
Yes, sir.

[02:07:33.710 --> 02:07:34.410]
How are you?

[02:07:34.690 --> 02:07:35.210]
I'm pretty good.

[02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:35.890]
How are you?

[02:07:36.330 --> 02:07:36.830]
I'm good.

[02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:37.350]
I'm good.

[02:07:37.630 --> 02:07:41.110]
So I hear you go to answer for the tulips and not the pot.

[02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.750]
Is that true?

[02:07:42.170 --> 02:07:43.130]
The tulips.

[02:07:43.210 --> 02:07:43.330]
Yeah.

[02:07:43.630 --> 02:07:44.090]
Not yours.

[02:07:44.190 --> 02:07:44.350]
Wow.

[02:07:44.710 --> 02:07:45.510]
That's how it's really good.

[02:07:45.770 --> 02:07:46.610]
The tulips.

[02:07:48.130 --> 02:07:48.570]
WQAM.

[02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:48.830]
Hello.

[02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:51.970]
Do you want to speak?

[02:07:52.230 --> 02:07:52.370]
Yes.

[02:07:53.290 --> 02:07:53.730]
Neil?

[02:07:54.190 --> 02:07:54.370]
Yes.

[02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:55.010]
Speaking.

[02:07:55.250 --> 02:07:55.770]
Let me say it again.

[02:07:56.450 --> 02:08:01.690]
The movie that comes to mind that I watch all the time no matter what it seems is, is

[02:08:01.690 --> 02:08:03.210]
it just a technical thing?

[02:08:04.490 --> 02:08:05.130]
What was it?

[02:08:05.190 --> 02:08:06.430]
You cut out.

[02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.630]
Jack.

[02:08:08.150 --> 02:08:08.470]
Yes.

[02:08:08.590 --> 02:08:11.010]
Is it as good as it gets?

[02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:11.630]
As good as it gets?

[02:08:11.630 --> 02:08:11.750]
Yeah.

[02:08:12.070 --> 02:08:12.710]
Jack Nicholson.

[02:08:13.190 --> 02:08:13.650]
Was it you?

[02:08:13.690 --> 02:08:14.830]
Was that the one with Jack Nicholson?

[02:08:15.610 --> 02:08:15.930]
Exactly.

[02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.790]
Okay.

[02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:17.510]
Thanks, pal.

[02:08:17.650 --> 02:08:18.090]
I get a new phone.

[02:08:18.230 --> 02:08:18.390]
Please.

[02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:19.570]
As good as it gets.

[02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:21.210]
Was it the ring of Bell with me?

[02:08:21.390 --> 02:08:21.470]
Nope.

[02:08:22.110 --> 02:08:22.790]
Does that ring any Bell?

[02:08:23.190 --> 02:08:23.510]
No.

[02:08:23.670 --> 02:08:23.850]
Oh.

[02:08:24.190 --> 02:08:24.610]
I'll be damned.

[02:08:25.490 --> 02:08:26.290]
As good as it gets.

[02:08:26.450 --> 02:08:27.910]
I think Jack Nicholson was the one in that.

[02:08:27.970 --> 02:08:28.150]
Is that the one?

[02:08:28.150 --> 02:08:29.690]
It's with Helen Hunt or something.

[02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.090]
I think.

[02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:31.210]
Oh, that one.

[02:08:31.210 --> 02:08:32.270]
I saw that.

[02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.870]
Yeah.

[02:08:33.090 --> 02:08:33.590]
I love Helen Hunt.

[02:08:33.590 --> 02:08:34.530]
I love where she's great.

[02:08:34.710 --> 02:08:35.750]
That was actually a good movie.

[02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:37.370]
Wasn't Helen Hunt in Magnolia, of course?

[02:08:38.370 --> 02:08:39.050]
Was she?

[02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.530]
Yes.

[02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:40.410]
Helen Hunt?

[02:08:41.110 --> 02:08:41.550]
Yeah.

[02:08:42.170 --> 02:08:43.150]
Ever see Helen Hunt?

[02:08:44.170 --> 02:08:44.690]
All the time.

[02:08:45.130 --> 02:08:45.930]
How about the Vice President?

[02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:49.630]
Five-six out of his Ramamanuel from Illinois who said...

[02:08:49.630 --> 02:08:53.230]
Like in in Iowa it was impossible for him to make a stand after Iowa.

[02:08:53.570 --> 02:08:53.730]
Everybody...

[02:08:53.730 --> 02:08:54.410]
I'll get out of here.

[02:08:54.490 --> 02:08:55.950]
He's hockin' with Wesley Clark now.

[02:08:56.250 --> 02:08:58.570]
You know how many chances Wesley Clark has got slim and none?

[02:08:59.670 --> 02:09:01.270]
Although I don't know, I could be wrong about that.

[02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:02.270]
The Clintons are behind him.

[02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:03.630]
They got their finger up his behind.

[02:09:03.690 --> 02:09:04.130]
They're pushing.

[02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:05.130]
They're holding onto a card.

[02:09:05.550 --> 02:09:06.310]
They're pushing stool.

[02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:07.330]
Real hard.

[02:09:08.050 --> 02:09:09.870]
Five-six-seven, oh five-six-tea.

[02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:10.590]
Did I really say that?

[02:09:10.770 --> 02:09:11.810]
Pound five-six-tea on it.

[02:09:11.890 --> 02:09:12.270]
I just...

[02:09:12.270 --> 02:09:12.710]
I'm in coherent.

[02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:13.550]
It's always a good excuse.

[02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:14.430]
Never mind if the weather.

[02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.910]
I'm taking it a lot.

[02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:16.990]
We believe all these cold medications and everything.

[02:09:17.670 --> 02:09:19.210]
Students basically say whatever you want.

[02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:22.270]
Lord of the Rings, Return of the King.

[02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:23.470]
I don't think they're going to top that.

[02:09:23.590 --> 02:09:24.430]
Now, did you see that one?

[02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:25.750]
Is that the latest incarnation?

[02:09:26.290 --> 02:09:26.450]
Yes.

[02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:28.070]
And...

[02:09:28.070 --> 02:09:30.050]
Oh, that's the one that won the award last night.

[02:09:30.170 --> 02:09:30.790]
Right, it's flawless.

[02:09:31.450 --> 02:09:32.130]
Is it really?

[02:09:32.410 --> 02:09:35.150]
It's the most spectacular look and piece of movie making

[02:09:35.150 --> 02:09:36.190]
I've ever seen in my life.

[02:09:36.490 --> 02:09:36.790]
Really?

[02:09:37.090 --> 02:09:37.090]

[02:09:37.890 --> 02:09:39.770]
Based on special effects?

[02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.730]
Based on all of it.

[02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:42.810]
Best good action, the story.

[02:09:43.010 --> 02:09:44.710]
I mean, the story is great, of course, as you know.

[02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:46.470]
And very well, I can keep it.

[02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:47.410]
What do you mean, as I know?

[02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:50.050]
All the meaning you've heard about the books all these years?

[02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:51.030]
The books...

[02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:53.770]
The books have been selling since the 20s.

[02:09:53.850 --> 02:09:54.150]
I mean, it's incredible.

[02:09:54.570 --> 02:09:55.850]
How about the Harry Potter or a survey?

[02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:58.750]
Don't get me, sir.

[02:09:58.750 --> 02:09:59.490]
Well, that's the point.

[02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:02.850]
20 to 1 at 5.60, QAM.

[02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:04.070]

[02:10:04.070 --> 02:10:04.770]
And Lull.

[02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:07.110]

[02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:08.390]

I'm Governor Game.

[02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:21.450]
Sorry, Governor, we have to stop you there.

[02:10:21.630 --> 02:10:23.250]
What are you stopping for as an award?

[02:10:23.930 --> 02:10:25.330]
We had a problem with the lighting.

[02:10:25.330 --> 02:10:26.950]
I'm sorry, I'm fixing it right now.

[02:10:26.970 --> 02:10:28.030]
Yeah, you better fix it.

[02:10:28.110 --> 02:10:29.010]
Come on out, let's go.

[02:10:29.290 --> 02:10:29.610]
Alright, Governor.

[02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:40.570]
Hey, what is going on?

Cut, cut, cut.

[02:10:42.610 --> 02:10:44.530]
I'm sorry, I trapped something.

[02:10:44.670 --> 02:10:46.190]
Lily, please, you have to be careful.

[02:10:46.410 --> 02:10:46.970]
I'm sorry.

[02:10:47.370 --> 02:10:47.690]
Geez!

[02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:49.030]
Sorry, Governor, this is...

[02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:50.730]
Alright, well, let's try it again, okay?

We'll get it this time.

[02:10:52.030 --> 02:10:52.590]
We'll get it this time.

[02:10:52.890 --> 02:10:54.990]
And maybe you want to keep thumbs out of here, huh?

[02:10:54.990 --> 02:10:55.970]

He sneezed.

[02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:08.110]
I'm sorry, I've got a cold.

[02:11:08.450 --> 02:11:09.190]
He has a cold.

[02:11:09.570 --> 02:11:11.430]
For the Lama Maple Syrup!

[02:11:11.610 --> 02:11:12.730]
Get a Kleenex!

[02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:13.770]
I'm sorry.

[02:11:13.970 --> 02:11:15.010]
He's sorry, he has a cold.

I don't have all the time in the world here.

[02:11:18.710 --> 02:11:19.670]

[02:11:32.670 --> 02:11:33.130]
You're about to be...

[02:11:33.130 --> 02:11:33.430]
Hey!

[02:11:33.730 --> 02:11:35.050]
Who's running for the White House here?

[02:11:35.150 --> 02:11:35.610]
You or me?

[02:11:35.890 --> 02:11:36.130]
Cut.

[02:11:36.590 --> 02:11:38.510]
We have to get into the Blacks in the Browns.

[02:11:38.570 --> 02:11:40.830]
Yeah, how many Blacks and Browns are there in Vermont, huh?

[02:11:41.170 --> 02:11:43.470]
The whole fat white rich man on skis!

[02:11:44.290 --> 02:11:46.050]
We're going to talk about Blacks and Browns!

[02:11:46.050 --> 02:11:46.250]
Alright.

[02:11:46.250 --> 02:11:47.710]
Pets that you know are being totally Indians!

[02:11:48.090 --> 02:11:48.470]
What do you want?

[02:11:48.570 --> 02:11:49.350]
You want to feather Indians?

[02:11:49.550 --> 02:11:50.290]
You want to die Indians?

[02:11:50.590 --> 02:11:51.570]
Calm down, please.

[02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:53.390]

You know, there's...

What is going on here?

[02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:09.150]
God.

[02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.830]
Oh.

[02:12:10.150 --> 02:12:10.610]
I'm sorry.

[02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:11.470]
Push me.

[02:12:11.610 --> 02:12:12.350]

[02:12:12.710 --> 02:12:13.890]
Who are you guys working for?

[02:12:14.110 --> 02:12:14.470]
BUSCH!

[02:12:14.570 --> 02:12:15.310]
We fired us.

[02:12:15.490 --> 02:12:16.270]
We'll get it this time.

[02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.990]
We apologize.

[02:12:17.250 --> 02:12:18.410]
If I hear one beep,

[02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:19.910]
you see this, my black pen?

[02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:20.490]
Yes.

[02:12:20.490 --> 02:12:22.070]
It's going to go right here, I.

[02:12:22.350 --> 02:12:22.750]
Hey.

[02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:23.290]
Alright.

[02:12:23.590 --> 02:12:23.950]
Oh, cool.

[02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:25.070]
I don't want to hear anything.

[02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:26.750]
Just clap your clapboard

[02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:27.970]
and just back away.

[02:12:28.210 --> 02:12:29.470]
And let me do it, alright?

[02:12:30.210 --> 02:12:30.390]
Hi.

And I'd like to talk to you about America.

[02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:35.370]
What America needs?

[02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:37.130]
Where America is going?

[02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:40.350]
Where is this commercial going?

[02:12:40.630 --> 02:12:41.950]
Can I get some direction here?

[02:12:42.110 --> 02:12:42.690]
You tell this nice thing.

[02:12:42.690 --> 02:12:42.890]
Hey!

[02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.850]
What did I say?

[02:12:44.130 --> 02:12:45.030]
Don't you say anything?

[02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:45.690]
Can we bring it?

[02:12:45.710 --> 02:12:45.950]
Hey!

[02:12:46.130 --> 02:12:46.610]
See the pen?

[02:12:46.610 --> 02:12:47.750]
Can I?

[02:12:48.330 --> 02:12:48.970]
No talking!

[02:12:49.570 --> 02:12:50.930]
I think we've got it.

[02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:53.550]
1246-14-1-5-60-QM.

[02:12:53.650 --> 02:12:54.830]
P.P. Peppy says,

[02:12:55.190 --> 02:12:56.770]
who A. Gilbert's Grape's was a good movie?

[02:12:58.290 --> 02:12:58.650]
Okay.

[02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:59.270]
I'll take it to work.

[02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.790]
Do you write that down?

[02:13:00.050 --> 02:13:00.850]
I like to part where he said,

[02:13:01.010 --> 02:13:02.350]
I need some action!

[02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:05.130]
Oh, Leo, oh my god.

[02:13:05.250 --> 02:13:07.470]
Leonardo DiCaprio pulled off a stellar performance.

[02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:08.930]
It says, also, um,

[02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:12.350]
see, I'm trying to avoid where they like got more than one.

[02:13:13.770 --> 02:13:14.530]
Here's one that says,

[02:13:14.530 --> 02:13:16.330]
my vote of the best movie last 13 years,

[02:13:16.530 --> 02:13:20.070]
the player, great ensemble cast with multiple complex intertwining stories,

[02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:22.890]
best modern criticism of Hollywood that still applies today.

[02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:24.070]
The player sounds awfully familiar.

[02:13:24.670 --> 02:13:26.550]
Yeah, you wouldn't like it because it has both

[02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:28.530]
whoopi Goldberg and Lyle Lovett in it.

[02:13:29.230 --> 02:13:29.910]
Whoopi Goldberg!

[02:13:30.210 --> 02:13:31.890]
It's a three- rodent's movie about Hollywood.

[02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:32.810]
It was very good.

[02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.950]
Whoopi Goldberg!

[02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:35.630]
Oscar-Killer Ken Robbins.

[02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:36.390]
Robbins.

[02:13:37.090 --> 02:13:38.830]
It says, how can you forget Bob Roberts?

[02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:40.890]
Let's get that on their 1992 qualifies.

[02:13:41.490 --> 02:13:42.170]
Good movie.

[02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:43.590]
Never saw it.

[02:13:43.590 --> 02:13:45.010]
You ever saw Bob Roberts?

[02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:45.930]
I never saw Bob Roberts.

[02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.990]
I got it right here.

[02:13:47.130 --> 02:13:47.910]
I got it on my hand right now.

[02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:48.670]
Oh, I'll lend it to me.

[02:13:48.970 --> 02:13:49.650]
I'm Bobbin on it.

[02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:51.210]
Here's one that says,

[02:13:51.210 --> 02:13:53.010]
and as a huge Star Wars fan,

[02:13:53.130 --> 02:13:54.870]
I would love to say either the Phantom Menace

[02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:55.890]
or the Attack of the Clones,

[02:13:55.890 --> 02:13:56.530]
but I can't.

[02:13:59.550 --> 02:14:02.190]
Which means they sucked hard.

[02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:03.170]
Oh!

[02:14:04.290 --> 02:14:05.030]
What a shame.

[02:14:05.230 --> 02:14:05.850]
Yeah, whatever.

[02:14:06.770 --> 02:14:08.030]
I mean, Star Wars was fine.

[02:14:08.290 --> 02:14:10.190]
You know, the first 45 episodes was great.

[02:14:10.430 --> 02:14:11.550]
And after that, enough already.

[02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:12.050]
Okay.

[02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:14.430]
That's not why they sucked.

[02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:15.890]
How's that little shrimp doing, Bobbin?

[02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:17.350]
He's got a wife, you know.

[02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:18.210]
Who's that?

[02:14:18.610 --> 02:14:20.230]
The little Star Wars guy.

[02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:21.270]
Towards Lucas.

[02:14:21.650 --> 02:14:22.750]
Not George Lucas.

[02:14:23.650 --> 02:14:24.250]
Luke Skywalker.

[02:14:24.710 --> 02:14:25.410]
The Luke Skywalker.

[02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:27.530]
No, what's his name?

[02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:28.830]
Mark Hamill.

[02:14:29.150 --> 02:14:29.750]
Mark Hamill.

[02:14:30.490 --> 02:14:31.070]
What's the remember?

[02:14:31.250 --> 02:14:33.130]
He got that bad wreck in his vet

[02:14:33.130 --> 02:14:35.550]
and started to face all that long, long time ago.

[02:14:35.790 --> 02:14:36.430]
Nobody's wife.

[02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:37.690]
He's got a wife.

[02:14:37.850 --> 02:14:38.870]
It shocks a lot of people.

[02:14:39.210 --> 02:14:40.750]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:42.730]
pound 5, 60 on the 18th.

[02:14:42.730 --> 02:14:43.830]
Do I know those stories, everything?

[02:14:44.330 --> 02:14:44.690]
No, I don't.

[02:14:44.770 --> 02:14:45.190]
2 a.m., hello.

[02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.250]
Two.

[02:14:46.650 --> 02:14:47.150]
Yes, sir.

[02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:48.510]
Yeah, how about the Matrix?

[02:14:49.290 --> 02:14:49.930]
The Matrix.

[02:14:50.130 --> 02:14:50.790]
Now we're talking.

[02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:52.110]
Now part, which one, which part?

[02:14:52.650 --> 02:14:53.550]
The first one, of course.

[02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:54.830]
They messed it up after part two.

[02:14:55.290 --> 02:14:56.310]
Okay, like they always do.

[02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:57.110]
Okay, thanks, pal.

[02:14:57.410 --> 02:14:58.010]
The Matrix.

[02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:59.190]
So now is what is that called?

[02:14:59.350 --> 02:15:00.330]
Is it just the Matrix?

[02:15:00.930 --> 02:15:01.350]
Well, thanks.

[02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.510]

[02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:02.170]
Definitely, good.

[02:15:02.370 --> 02:15:02.930]
Part two, blue.

[02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:05.070]
Well, I'll take your word for it.

[02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:06.430]
That's definitely not my kind of movie.

[02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.850]
No.

[02:15:07.310 --> 02:15:07.630]
Definitely.

[02:15:08.230 --> 02:15:10.870]
Lord of the Rings, we turn it over to the thing in the King.

[02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.450]
40.

[02:15:12.190 --> 02:15:13.670]
Saving private Ryan is God.

[02:15:14.050 --> 02:15:14.610]
3rd man.

[02:15:15.150 --> 02:15:16.750]
Char Shank Redemption is also God.

[02:15:17.190 --> 02:15:17.710]
3rd man.

[02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:19.710]
Do you believe that?

[02:15:21.010 --> 02:15:21.430]
I don't know.

[02:15:21.550 --> 02:15:21.750]
I don't know.

[02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.790]
I don't know.

[02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.850]
I've been here until I was 19.

[02:15:24.110 --> 02:15:25.490]
My cousin Vinnie's still got 19.

[02:15:25.630 --> 02:15:26.930]
Been stuck on 19 a long time.

[02:15:28.450 --> 02:15:29.630]
I guess we ran out of Guido's.

[02:15:30.750 --> 02:15:31.770]
That's all we had, 19.

[02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:33.410]
Guido's.

[02:15:33.610 --> 02:15:33.690]
Right.

[02:15:33.690 --> 02:15:37.710]
Pulling for Columbine 16, office space 13, silence of lambs 13,

[02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:40.310]
chindlers list 13, forest dump 12.

[02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:44.670]
You see, this is what makes me upset about America,

[02:15:44.930 --> 02:15:46.310]
about the world I live in, the planet.

[02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:47.890]
Let's go to Mars right now.

[02:15:48.650 --> 02:15:48.950]
I'm packed.

[02:15:49.670 --> 02:15:51.230]
Forest Gump has got 12.

[02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:54.390]
Good fellows is, directly in for Dream has got 7.

[02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:56.550]
Good fellows 6 and Magnolia 5.

[02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:58.430]
Did the American beauty 5?

[02:15:58.770 --> 02:15:59.010]
Okay.

[02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.470]
Right.

[02:16:01.050 --> 02:16:03.530]
I mean, what kind of a, I don't know what to say.

[02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:06.170]
What kind of a person thought that Forest Gump was the best movie?

[02:16:06.390 --> 02:16:07.810]
I guess somebody doesn't go to a lot of movies.

[02:16:08.210 --> 02:16:09.370]
Maybe that's the only one they saw.

[02:16:09.550 --> 02:16:10.210]
Do you ever think about that?

[02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:12.390]
Or someone with the IQ of Forest Gump.

[02:16:12.490 --> 02:16:13.030]
Forest Gump.

[02:16:13.130 --> 02:16:13.650]
That could be.

[02:16:14.290 --> 02:16:15.010]
Oh, you mean the Bush people.

[02:16:16.930 --> 02:16:19.550]
Forest Gump 12, Brave Heart 7, Requiem for Dream 7.

[02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:21.670]
Good fellow 6, Magnolia 5.

[02:16:22.970 --> 02:16:24.590]
Uh, usual suspects 5.

[02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:25.770]
American beauty 5.

[02:16:26.150 --> 02:16:28.750]
Paul fiction 4, Fight Club 4, Pirates of the Caribbean 4.

[02:16:29.070 --> 02:16:30.770]
Cassino 3, only one for blow.

[02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:34.570]
As good as it gets as go on, I think Jack Nicholson was in that one, right?

[02:16:35.170 --> 02:16:35.970]
With Helen Hunt.

[02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:37.810]
With Helen Hunt.

[02:16:38.610 --> 02:16:40.150]
Payback 1, Gladiator 1.

[02:16:40.450 --> 02:16:42.090]
See Biscuit 1 and after that small potatoes.

[02:16:42.310 --> 02:16:44.430]
Here's the one that says, oh, again, see Biscuit.

[02:16:44.970 --> 02:16:48.990]
Favorite movie last 10 years can't recall ever watching a movie and have the entire theater applauded.

[02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:50.310]
Wow.

[02:16:50.730 --> 02:16:51.230]
I have.

[02:16:52.310 --> 02:16:52.970]
What was that?

[02:16:53.050 --> 02:16:53.610]
What movie was that?

[02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:55.650]
Oh, Lord of the Rings for one.

[02:16:56.550 --> 02:16:57.630]
They applauded the movie.

[02:16:57.850 --> 02:16:57.990]
Sure.

[02:16:58.110 --> 02:16:59.510]
See to me, that's tacky.

[02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:11.770]
I mean, I can see sometimes in a movie there's a scene in the audience because of an audible response like, oh, you know, like, like, a day.

[02:17:13.650 --> 02:17:15.850]
Especially in the Tamarack where there's no refunds.

[02:17:16.050 --> 02:17:17.050]
That was after Shendler's list.

[02:17:18.050 --> 02:17:20.310]
They said, oh, boy.

[02:17:20.830 --> 02:17:25.490]
By the way, it says the life of David Giel was an outstanding film and so you were saying I don't even think it exists, mister.

[02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:26.570]
Never heard of it.

[02:17:26.570 --> 02:17:38.390]
Were they very unpredictable and shocking ending a shocking ending a must see star Kevin Spacey Kate Winslet who finally got away from Leo long enough to do a good movie and Laura Lennie won't be disappointed.

[02:17:38.390 --> 02:17:40.050]
The life of David Giel putting that on my pile.

[02:17:40.170 --> 02:17:40.330]
Okay.

[02:17:40.590 --> 02:17:42.690]
Well, Kevin Spacey's in it can be all bad.

[02:17:42.770 --> 02:17:43.630]
I'm writing it down.

[02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:47.650]
Now in that movie is he in the closet or out during that movie.

[02:17:47.730 --> 02:17:52.150]
I don't know because I think that in Glen Gary Glen Ross, he was like kind of undecided.

[02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:55.570]
He didn't have time to think about it because he was taking so much crap from everybody in the office.

[02:17:56.190 --> 02:17:57.850]
He was definitely taking it in the office.

[02:17:59.030 --> 02:17:59.670]
WQAM, hello.

[02:18:00.610 --> 02:18:01.230]
Hello, Neil.

[02:18:01.550 --> 02:18:01.930]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.730]
How are you, sir?

[02:18:03.050 --> 02:18:03.370]
Pretty good.

[02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:04.910]
Good. Enjoy your show for years.

[02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.610]
Thank you.

[02:18:06.130 --> 02:18:12.250]
I would like, I know you just added full fiction to the list and I believe Silent to the Lambs came out in like nine year 91.

[02:18:12.590 --> 02:18:13.550]
I don't think it was after 93.

[02:18:13.790 --> 02:18:17.010]
Well, we extended to 90 because of Glen Gary Glen Ross.

[02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:19.370]
So we stretched it out 90 to 2004.

[02:18:19.790 --> 02:18:21.050]
Oh, you just throw me off now.

[02:18:21.050 --> 02:18:21.850]
What are you doing in the middle of your children?

[02:18:21.950 --> 02:18:22.310]
That's okay.

[02:18:23.650 --> 02:18:24.490]
Thank you very much.

[02:18:24.490 --> 02:18:25.070]
Thank you very much.

[02:18:25.090 --> 02:18:25.790]
Okay, you too.

[02:18:26.390 --> 02:18:27.570]
Well, he's trying to...

[02:18:30.850 --> 02:18:34.410]
Hey, at least he's trying to like keep us on a straight narrow path here, you know?

[02:18:34.510 --> 02:18:41.210]
So I don't have a bunch of all kinds of glitches on his pole here like somebody trying to tell me that the Mulan Rouge was like Chicago.

[02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:44.910]
I would swear that that was in Chicago.

[02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:46.290]
The whole thing was about you.

[02:18:46.490 --> 02:18:47.270]
I can tell you.

[02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:50.550]
I mean, I wouldn't go to a movie like that because I don't go to musicals.

[02:18:50.550 --> 02:18:51.750]
I can't stand musical.

[02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:54.510]
I believe that Mulan Rouge is about the club in Paris though.

[02:18:55.450 --> 02:18:55.890]
Yeah.

[02:18:56.030 --> 02:18:56.750]
To my understanding.

[02:18:57.070 --> 02:18:57.710]
Paris, Chicago.

[02:18:58.010 --> 02:18:58.510]
Paris, Illinois.

[02:18:58.830 --> 02:18:59.310]
Paris, Hilton.

[02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:02.430]
Well, what does Mulan Rouge have to do with Chicago then?

[02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.190]
Nothing.

[02:19:03.570 --> 02:19:04.150]
You're wrong.

[02:19:04.710 --> 02:19:05.150]
Okay.

[02:19:05.230 --> 02:19:05.550]
You're wrong.

[02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:09.010]
It's about Christina Aguilera.

[02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.470]
Yeah.

[02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:12.150]
And Madonna.

[02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.610]
Oh, wait.

[02:19:13.310 --> 02:19:16.490]
Christina Aguilera, what's that famous pizza place in Chicago?

[02:19:17.770 --> 02:19:18.490]
Where she's going?

[02:19:18.610 --> 02:19:20.390]
All the cheese in the middle of the night, little scissors.

[02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:21.770]
No, it's not a little...

[02:19:21.770 --> 02:19:23.110]
No, where they make the real thick pizza.

[02:19:23.210 --> 02:19:25.910]
So you don't know how your Chicago man, you were there for at least 10 hours.

[02:19:26.910 --> 02:19:27.070]
Yeah.

[02:19:27.870 --> 02:19:28.490]
Thanks, Disney.

[02:19:28.650 --> 02:19:30.910]
You cheap bastard, you cheap skate.

[02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:33.070]
You're a miserable drunk and Irishman, you God.

[02:19:33.550 --> 02:19:34.710]
Everybody hates that, Mike Disney.

[02:19:35.590 --> 02:19:36.870]
And then the coast goes up in it.

[02:19:36.970 --> 02:19:37.530]
Isn't that a joke?

[02:19:37.930 --> 02:19:38.690]
Anybody believe that?

[02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:38.970]
No.

[02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:43.330]
I don't think the other stations should know that key queries have an nervous breakdown over that book.

[02:19:43.590 --> 02:19:45.490]
Why anybody would pay attention to that last book?

[02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:47.270]
God, you got to be a Mulan.

[02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:48.530]
Am I right?

[02:19:48.730 --> 02:19:49.090]
Absolutely.

[02:19:49.370 --> 02:19:50.310]
Even Mul with those numbers.

[02:19:50.510 --> 02:19:52.050]
And no, anybody knows he ain't got squat.

[02:19:52.470 --> 02:19:53.170]
Even he knows that.

[02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:57.270]
Don't forget, in the one o'clock hour, first order of business will be that Michael Mayo column.

[02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.750]
Okay.

[02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:58.030]
Okay.

[02:19:58.170 --> 02:19:59.230]
Well, trembles and so do I.

[02:19:59.470 --> 02:20:00.270]
Good column, Mike.

[02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:03.270]
Good Jewish boy, Mike Mayo, who belongs back on his sports pages.

[02:20:03.490 --> 02:20:04.330]
But he's trying hard.

[02:20:05.010 --> 02:20:06.250]
About two, three times a...

[02:20:06.250 --> 02:20:08.190]
Oh, and yesterday, what the hell was the show?

[02:20:08.190 --> 02:20:11.990]
I was watching and they had Dave Barry on the panel who had...

[02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:13.750]
I didn't say anything even belong there.

[02:20:13.810 --> 02:20:14.890]
It was some political discussion.

[02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:15.630]
Oh, boy.

[02:20:16.490 --> 02:20:18.330]
And Dave Barry was on the panel.

[02:20:18.450 --> 02:20:23.250]
I looked at him and I thought to myself, everything that's wrong about South Florida is sitting right next to him.

[02:20:23.470 --> 02:20:25.750]
When we do the poll for, who's the biggest nebys you ever saw?

[02:20:25.970 --> 02:20:26.950]
Oh, my God.

[02:20:27.610 --> 02:20:29.270]
He makes Bill Gates look like Hercules.

[02:20:31.130 --> 02:20:31.790]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[02:20:32.430 --> 02:20:33.590]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[02:20:33.730 --> 02:20:34.230]
Pretty good, sir.

[02:20:35.050 --> 02:20:35.350]
Good.

[02:20:36.130 --> 02:20:38.370]
Come on, we'll know pizza up in Chicago, first of all.

[02:20:38.390 --> 02:20:39.130]
That's the one, right.

[02:20:39.250 --> 02:20:39.810]
That's one of them, right?

[02:20:40.450 --> 02:20:42.890]
Yeah, listen, how about training day?

[02:20:44.390 --> 02:20:45.030]
Training day?

[02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:46.370]
Training day to movie.

[02:20:46.930 --> 02:20:47.210]
Okay.

[02:20:47.890 --> 02:20:48.510]
Okay, you got on.

[02:20:48.570 --> 02:20:48.570]

[02:20:48.610 --> 02:20:49.090]
You're a good day.

[02:20:49.370 --> 02:20:49.870]
You two, dog.

[02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:51.250]
What do you say, dog?

[02:20:51.410 --> 02:20:51.750]
You see that?

[02:20:51.930 --> 02:20:54.330]
It was a good enough movie you had to be...

[02:20:54.330 --> 02:20:54.450]
How about training?

[02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.750]
Ridiculous ending.

[02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:56.590]
Training spotting?

[02:20:57.410 --> 02:20:57.730]
Yeah.

[02:20:58.050 --> 02:20:58.530]
What about it?

[02:20:58.970 --> 02:20:59.830]
You want to put it on there?

[02:20:59.830 --> 02:21:00.470]
I'm not going to watch it.

[02:21:00.490 --> 02:21:02.510]
I'll put snatch on there before I put train spotting on there.

[02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:03.830]
You'll put snatch on the train?

[02:21:05.170 --> 02:21:06.450]
Or will it be spotting?

[02:21:06.490 --> 02:21:07.210]
Snatch on the train.

[02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.930]
Yeah.

[02:21:08.310 --> 02:21:08.890]
Snatch a train.

[02:21:08.910 --> 02:21:12.130]
Well, so what do you mean you'll put it on before these people are making these suggestions?

[02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:13.610]
Okay, and I'm making suggestions.

[02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:14.530]
Put them on there.

[02:21:14.570 --> 02:21:15.790]
Don't like giving us an argument there.

[02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:19.210]
See, this is the problem when you deal with a militant, hard-ass little spick.

[02:21:19.450 --> 02:21:19.690]
Yeah.

[02:21:20.050 --> 02:21:21.130]
A guava-loven spick.

[02:21:21.150 --> 02:21:22.070]
Who said train spotting?

[02:21:22.390 --> 02:21:22.650]
I did.

[02:21:22.850 --> 02:21:22.950]
Oh.

[02:21:23.450 --> 02:21:24.090]
You don't think...

[02:21:24.090 --> 02:21:26.450]
You're the one that was always telling me I had a worst of it.

[02:21:26.610 --> 02:21:27.190]
I thought you hated it.

[02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:28.390]
Oh, god.

[02:21:28.830 --> 02:21:29.090]
Oh.

[02:21:29.450 --> 02:21:30.470]
Get your head out of that.

[02:21:30.810 --> 02:21:31.570]
Oh, man.

[02:21:32.130 --> 02:21:32.930]
And it gets worse.

[02:21:32.930 --> 02:21:35.850]
He had his arm and air up to his goddamn armpit.

[02:21:35.850 --> 02:21:37.250]
You missed the bus scene.

[02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:38.790]
That movie was the pits.

[02:21:38.930 --> 02:21:40.150]
I don't want to even hear about it.

[02:21:40.330 --> 02:21:42.750]
It's sitting in my cupboard and my cabinet right in the other room.

[02:21:42.890 --> 02:21:44.270]
So he craps in the bed, right?

[02:21:44.290 --> 02:21:45.830]
Oh, I don't want to hear about crap.

[02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:47.710]
I'll watch channel 4 if I want to see crap.

[02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.250]
Okay?

[02:21:48.570 --> 02:21:49.750]
I don't want to see crap.

[02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:51.690]
Bound emptying diarrhea episode.

[02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:53.290]
Even my mother would be embarrassed by that.

[02:21:53.330 --> 02:21:55.650]
And she's just dying to see crap, especially in her bowl.

[02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:58.270]
But then she's going to watch them all up, right?

[02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.150]
Yeah.

[02:21:59.330 --> 02:22:00.330]
And then he's going down.

[02:22:00.330 --> 02:22:01.710]
I don't want to hear about it.

[02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:03.030]
Oh, Jesus.

[02:22:03.390 --> 02:22:04.130]
Everybody's having breakfast.

[02:22:04.170 --> 02:22:05.370]
So why don't you want to put that on there?

[02:22:05.530 --> 02:22:06.210]
Oh, we can put it on there.

[02:22:06.390 --> 02:22:07.310]
Of course I want to put it on there.

[02:22:07.410 --> 02:22:08.210]
I was just being a hard ass.

[02:22:08.610 --> 02:22:09.450]
Yeah, as usual.

[02:22:09.690 --> 02:22:09.890]
Sure.

[02:22:10.210 --> 02:22:10.430]
Why not?

[02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:12.150]
Lord of the Rings, we turned the King 42.

[02:23:25.150 --> 02:23:25.150]

And всех was more than faithful to her.

[02:23:25.250 --> 02:23:25.650]
Do you understand she's going to have to vote?

[02:23:25.650 --> 02:23:25.850]
Oh, no!

[02:23:25.850 --> 02:23:26.410]
And all other workers.

[02:23:27.890 --> 02:23:27.890]

[02:23:27.890 --> 02:23:28.450]

[02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:17.670]
I'm just coming.

[02:26:18.890 --> 02:26:21.950]
Sure I may be out of my mind.

[02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:31.230]
Eating more and not working out. Wish me luck losing weight while I'm

[02:26:46.850 --> 02:26:47.170]
doing it.

[02:26:47.170 --> 02:26:50.030]
Yeah kind of a porky look on his face last night he was there I think Billy Jo

[02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:54.230]
on believe I saw him. Yeah. What was he doing there? I was he doing it. He's a celebrity.

[02:26:54.770 --> 02:26:58.870]
Is he I see and Eric I don't was there I'll say it again was the idol he was

[02:26:58.870 --> 02:27:04.850]
I don't know. Reservoir dogs 1992 quentin Tarantino. Yeah that's on there we

[02:27:04.850 --> 02:27:08.770]
put it on it talked about that 80 million times you seen it yeah and very

[02:27:08.770 --> 02:27:10.150]
quenching. Very quenching.

[02:27:11.310 --> 02:27:14.530]
Shaw Shank Redemption is so overrated says this fact it's totally

[02:27:14.530 --> 02:27:20.570]
simp ass movie. Wow poor guy who didn't do it goes to prison but banging crooked

[02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:25.210]
warden escape all it sounds like Moa with that the opian Anthony thing.

[02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:30.290]
Everybody lives happily ever after it blows so freaking predictable it says if

[02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:33.630]
every person prison ever made every prison movie ever made was edited down and

[02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:36.810]
up with Shaw Shank Redemption. Thank God I didn't watch it. Very nice. I know

[02:27:36.810 --> 02:27:39.390]
I just you'll never give it back. That's why I only gave it an adequate it

[02:27:39.390 --> 02:27:44.430]
not a lot of surprises. And this is my favorite facts of the entire year even

[02:27:44.430 --> 02:27:48.830]
though it's only the 26th. Good Michael Mayo column in the Sun sent a local

[02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:55.170]
section. By the way don't forget to read that Michael Mayo column. Oh what I

[02:27:55.170 --> 02:27:58.330]
do with that I think I lost oh here it is. I mean how many times that I

[02:27:58.330 --> 02:28:02.950]
mentioned I was going to read that today. About 30 men. Yeah sure it was

[02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:08.930]
deliberate. I see. Well thanks for the chuckle it was good. Michael Mayo

[02:28:08.930 --> 02:28:13.450]
writes in yesterday's scum sentinel is it appropriate for a fundamentalist

[02:28:13.450 --> 02:28:17.110]
preacher to screen potential judges by asking if they're Godfaring individuals

[02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:21.470]
and is it appropriate for a self-described prayer warrior someone who says this

[02:28:21.470 --> 02:28:24.810]
country was founded on Christianity to even be on the state committee that

[02:28:24.810 --> 02:28:29.390]
nominates local judges. Welcome to governor Jeb Bush's Florida. Old

[02:28:29.390 --> 02:28:33.330]
fashion fire and bermstone is in notion such as separation of church and state

[02:28:33.330 --> 02:28:37.710]
are out. Last month we had governor Bush dedicated the nation's first faith

[02:28:37.710 --> 02:28:41.750]
faith-based prison the Laughty correction institution by saying I can't

[02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:44.670]
think of a better place to reflect on the awesome love of our Lord Jesus

[02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:48.530]
than to be here at Laughty correctional. Jesus Christ. Good Laughty Miss

[02:28:48.530 --> 02:28:52.430]
or whatever. Almost 800 inmates will try to rehabilitate your prayer and

[02:28:52.430 --> 02:28:56.470]
religious studies. Now we have the case of the Reverend O'Neill Dozier

[02:28:56.470 --> 02:28:59.830]
founder of the worldwide Christian Center in Poppano Beach who's asked

[02:28:59.830 --> 02:29:03.490]
judicial candidates about the religious beliefs while serving on the 17th

[02:29:03.490 --> 02:29:08.530]
judicial circle. Circuit judicial nominating committee. I didn't know there was a

[02:29:08.530 --> 02:29:12.230]
judicial circuit judicial nominating committee. You don't have to be a rocket

[02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:15.650]
scientist or a political scientist. Another something just not kosher about

[02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:20.610]
this my sense. Water Blake and other member of the Broward JNC said he saw nothing

[02:29:20.610 --> 02:29:24.290]
wrong with those you're asking candidates if they were God fearing. Said

[02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:27.450]
Blake I think it's an extremely important question because it has to deal with

[02:29:27.450 --> 02:29:31.250]
values. I think you can also ask a person whether it goes to church on Sunday

[02:29:31.250 --> 02:29:36.230]
or sitting on Friday nights. And what about atheists? Somebody might be an atheist

[02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:39.390]
and that's fine and somebody might be Islamic and that's fine. That's their God

[02:29:39.390 --> 02:29:43.030]
Blake said would it discourage me from approving that person? Absolutely not.

[02:29:43.470 --> 02:29:47.290]
An atheist might have more values than a person that goes to church which just proves

[02:29:47.290 --> 02:29:51.210]
that the question is irrelevant. I'm deeply concerned. Said Todd Iranavitt,

[02:29:51.250 --> 02:29:54.250]
say mommy attorney, passed president of the Florida bar. The governor should

[02:29:54.250 --> 02:29:58.230]
immediately appoint an impartial commission to review the conduct of JNC member

[02:29:58.230 --> 02:30:02.950]
Dozier in order to ensure the integrity of the process. By his own quotes he indicates

[02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:07.930]
he has no concept of the separation of church and state. But Bush's general

[02:30:07.930 --> 02:30:13.230]
counsel, Raquel Rodriguez, last week stated that Dozier's place on the committee

[02:30:13.230 --> 02:30:16.870]
is safe. In response to a letter from state representative Dan Gilbert,

[02:30:17.310 --> 02:30:20.490]
Rodriguez wrote that the nominations process in the 17th Circuit is fair and

[02:30:20.490 --> 02:30:24.170]
appropriate and that Dozier has assured me he will not ask such questions again.

[02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:28.850]
She said that no judicial candidate is formally complained. On Friday Dozier said,

[02:30:28.950 --> 02:30:32.150]
I'm not talking about the JNC anymore. I want you all to leave me alone just

[02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:35.930]
get off my back. Who are you trying to satisfy now? The homosexuals, the liberals

[02:30:35.930 --> 02:30:40.190]
because they don't like me, you people need to quit. Homosexuals, who said anything

[02:30:40.190 --> 02:30:45.570]
about homosexuals. Antigay Redrick is part of Dozier's routine and religious

[02:30:45.570 --> 02:30:49.410]
conference last year he called homosexuality something so nasty and disgusting it

[02:30:49.410 --> 02:30:55.090]
makes God want to vomit. Pushing down the church state wall is another. He's

[02:30:55.090 --> 02:30:58.350]
threatening to sue Pompo Beach if he can't invoke Jesus name during benedictions

[02:30:58.350 --> 02:31:01.910]
at commission here at meetings. Dozier has the right to believe what he wants but

[02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:05.850]
why would anybody want him on a government committee? Dozier who has a law degree

[02:31:05.850 --> 02:31:08.670]
has been on the nine member committee that screens potential judges and

[02:31:08.670 --> 02:31:12.890]
browers since 2001. When vacancy and eventual rises the committee interviews

[02:31:12.890 --> 02:31:15.510]
candidates and forwards a list of three finalists to the governor who makes a

[02:31:15.510 --> 02:31:19.770]
selection. The processes become more worrisome since the governor got final say

[02:31:19.770 --> 02:31:23.910]
over all JNC appointees in 2001 before then the Florida bar and the governor

[02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:27.610]
each appointed three members and that group in turn selected three others but now the

[02:31:27.610 --> 02:31:30.770]
governor can pack the screening committees and the bench with like-minded souls.

[02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:34.190]
Who knows what agenda is they're pushing behind the closed doors of deliberations?

[02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:38.970]
I'm fearing something today but I'm not sure if it's God's his Michael mail. Very

[02:31:38.970 --> 02:31:42.990]
good. I didn't read that right for a sentence I'm fearing something today but it's

[02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:48.110]
sure not God. Got it. Sorry Mike. Scooted it all up in the last line. Well good

[02:31:48.110 --> 02:31:53.490]
column. And keep in mind 44% of you morons out there to Jews in the state of

[02:31:53.490 --> 02:31:59.310]
Florida voted for Jeb Bush. Oh brother. Talk about a death wish maybe those

[02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:05.090]
of the Jews for Jesus. That could be Jewish for Yashke man. Okay, getting back to

[02:32:05.090 --> 02:32:07.570]
our poll please because I'm almost running out of voice. I think I did pretty

[02:32:07.570 --> 02:32:12.410]
good. Now we'll turn it over to George. He was the absolute best movie

[02:32:12.410 --> 02:32:17.830]
the past 13 years 1990-2003 which one which one of these or some other ones?

[02:32:18.930 --> 02:32:23.530]
Lord of the Rings we turn to the King 45. It must be sensational. It is.

[02:32:23.850 --> 02:32:27.310]
We'll never see it. Thought twice. Saving for well you made up for me.

[02:32:27.310 --> 02:32:31.630]
Saving private Ryan 32. Tad with the Shawshake Redemption 32. I hear it's just like a

[02:32:31.630 --> 02:32:34.690]
re-hatch of all the other prison movies. Yeah.

[02:32:34.830 --> 02:32:39.370]
12th Fiction 26. Glenn Geary Glenn Ross Glenn Hill 23. My cousin Vinny 22.

[02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:44.190]
Morning for column by 19. Silence of Lam 17. Office space 15.

[02:32:45.190 --> 02:32:49.690]
Now is that when you said you seen? I saw it at a grand not bad. It's a comedy and

[02:32:49.690 --> 02:32:54.030]
it was cute. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to rave about it. It was fine.

[02:32:54.570 --> 02:32:57.950]
Shindler's list is tied with Forest Gump and quite frankly because I've heard you talk about

[02:32:57.950 --> 02:33:01.010]
Shindler's list so often. But I think about Shindler's list. I always think about

[02:33:01.010 --> 02:33:06.430]
Forest Gump and the same breath. No. 13. Good fellows. 10. American Beauty's only got 9.

[02:33:06.530 --> 02:33:11.490]
That's criminal. Yes. Brave Heart 8. Usual Suspects 8. Requiem for dream only 7.

[02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:14.950]
It's been stuck on 7 a long time. Man, your taste is in your touch, folks.

[02:33:15.850 --> 02:33:19.510]
Magnolia only 5. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. And you want to know why I don't think

[02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:22.930]
and most people have seen either one of those. Correct. Am I right? You're right.

[02:33:22.930 --> 02:33:27.730]
And why? I don't know. Well, Magnolia can understand.

[02:33:31.050 --> 02:33:36.450]
Oh. Casino for power to the Caribbean for Fight Club 4. Matrix 3. Gladiator 3.

[02:33:37.050 --> 02:33:41.110]
The big Kahuna's got a pair. Payback one and everything else is even

[02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:44.750]
Seamus gets only got one. Thank God. I'm just I'm not in those cornball movies,

[02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:47.790]
man. You know why a lot of people haven't seen Magnolia? Why is that? Because it's cool.

[02:33:48.290 --> 02:33:55.590]
Magnolia. Nobody's going to run out like maybe some fat chicks run out to see movie called Magnolia.

[02:33:55.670 --> 02:34:00.110]
I see. So in other words, men won't go see Magnolia. You know how the you do.

[02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:03.170]
How about office space? How about on that's a great name. It's a movie flower.

[02:34:03.450 --> 02:34:06.910]
It's a gay asked flower. Men are going to run out to go see movie named up a gay asked flower.

[02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:10.770]
Magnolia is a gay flower. I mean, if it was named Pansy, I could understand it.

[02:34:10.930 --> 02:34:15.130]
Same same difference. If it was called Blood and Guts, the juror then they'd run out and see it.

[02:34:15.130 --> 02:34:19.130]
Yeah. How about if it was called Braveheart? That sounds pretty corny to me.

[02:34:19.290 --> 02:34:22.050]
There's a little gay sounding title there. Yeah. It's not telling the gay.

[02:34:22.270 --> 02:34:24.610]
Is that Mel Gibson? I don't know what's his name. That's Mel.

[02:34:25.090 --> 02:34:27.950]
Oh, don't tell him that. But it's violent. Bloody gory guts. Good.

[02:34:28.130 --> 02:34:30.590]
And Braveheart. Hopefully some of his lot of guts. Oh, yeah. You see.

[02:34:30.590 --> 02:34:36.810]
I'm the true man. What was it? The true man.

[02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:40.150]
Oh, but don't put it down. Don't you know how that was? Yeah.

[02:34:40.450 --> 02:34:43.130]
That's that. We're not putting you on there. Even if it's a good one.

[02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:46.370]
Why didn't put that on there? It's okay. We liked him, Carrie, right? Yes.

[02:34:46.670 --> 02:34:49.810]
He's kind of scary, but not like John Kerry. Anything good about that movie?

[02:34:49.890 --> 02:34:53.070]
And certainly not like Howard Dean's wife. Boy, she is. Wow.

[02:34:53.430 --> 02:34:55.950]
Woo. We know. No, I don't do it.

[02:34:57.490 --> 02:34:58.190]
WQA, I'm hello.

[02:34:58.790 --> 02:35:02.050]
Yeah. Yes, sir. Hey, how's it going? Pretty good. Good.

[02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:06.450]
Good. I get one of these stupid phone lines that it was phone rings like 20 times in it.

[02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:11.310]
Disconnecting. I call back and it says you're called busy. What's up?

[02:35:12.010 --> 02:35:17.210]
Similar stuff, man. What's up? You use the pull and go back home where you're seeking that Rayman on there?

[02:35:17.850 --> 02:35:21.390]
Can't do it. Can't do it, Pali. Please. No.

[02:35:21.710 --> 02:35:31.250]
All right. Sorry. Rayman 1989, I guess. Well, I mean, we can keep pushing it back and pushing it back with just the 10. Huh?

[02:35:31.690 --> 02:35:36.590]
Tonight. Well, no, I mean, we did. We did leave the gap. We cut it off at 80. The last pull. Right.

[02:35:38.870 --> 02:35:44.430]
See what I'm saying? So maybe one day when it's really desperate, we'll do a pull like, you know, from 80 to 90. Okay.

[02:35:45.210 --> 02:35:51.750]
Okay. Like tomorrow. No, I'm just kidding. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 TNT Verizon Wireless Land.

[02:35:52.010 --> 02:35:56.350]
Mad Dog, who we had a report was a little bit tipsy on the sports show last night.

[02:35:57.050 --> 02:36:04.590]
I can't keep track of which channel. So sure. So even tipsy. I don't think that. I don't think so.

[02:36:04.590 --> 02:36:10.450]
I don't know what that's in here under. I know you got it there. Just relax. There's the Joe and Bo Show. I love that.

[02:36:11.010 --> 02:36:18.890]
In fact, maybe Joe has been a tough season for jet fans. What does it mean to you now on the team struggling?

[02:36:20.090 --> 02:36:27.770]
I want to kiss you. I couldn't care less about the team struggling. And I want to kiss you. Thanks Joe.

[02:36:27.770 --> 02:36:34.510]
Yeah. You're smarter than Joe David. Part of the Ford decade team. We'll see these guys in half time.

[02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:43.150]
I want to give you a kiss. Yeah. They're struggling. He's such a moron. Man. It's just, oh, God, as he dumped.

[02:36:44.170 --> 02:36:48.870]
He could play, but he's sure a moron. 500 after one at 5 60. And of course, he was a little bit.

[02:36:49.390 --> 02:36:53.510]
He's so maybe the mad dog was just honoring old Willie Joe. Joe Willie Joe's Willie.

[02:36:54.490 --> 02:37:03.790]
And maybe you try to emulate him on the channel 10 last night. If you're in a really happy dead end job underpaid, well, maybe see this thing with new years, I'm going to cross that out.

[02:37:03.850 --> 02:37:10.250]
Don't you think could you please? I just I'm tired of a Todd direct not wanting to write any new copies making a fortune off all these accounts.

[02:37:10.390 --> 02:37:17.190]
You're a robber, Todd. All you are is a you're a grave robber. Quave Wappa. You're just stealing whatever they give you on that check man. You're stealing it.

[02:38:41.550 --> 02:38:45.950]
He's really making way.

Because leave us to me. This is a free.

[02:39:09.650 --> 02:39:21.690]
1 17 at 5 60 WQM. Here's somebody says I'd like to suggest Ellie confidential is my favorite movie the past decade also it says. I'll vote for Dave very a thousand times as the worst of Miami if you had a poll about it.

[02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:27.510]
He's a total asshole who thinks it's high comedy that South Florida's run by a bunch of corrupt. No speaking English fascists.

[02:39:30.990 --> 02:39:38.610]
OK, well it is and he thinks it's funny. Really funny Dave. Sadly, he's one of people surprised. He's wrote text and he's an idiot. Never said anything funny in his life. Ever.

[02:39:39.070 --> 02:39:41.750]
And his columns are in newspapers around the world syndicated.

[02:39:42.650 --> 02:39:53.370]
But then again, so is somebody else we know. Beautiful mind somebody says how can we have gotten this far out of the show in one o'clock hour because we don't have beautiful minds.

[02:39:53.850 --> 02:39:56.650]
I must be it. I'll get that on there right away.

[02:39:58.070 --> 02:40:05.350]
And let me say it again. Watch the whole thing don't wish muck like I was. No, it's it starts really slow right and it's not what you think it is.

[02:40:05.370 --> 02:40:11.410]
Kind of like Moe show it starts off very slow. Absolutely, but I'm like Moe show it actually picks up some steam later on.

[02:40:12.210 --> 02:40:15.450]
As opposed to Moe show which we chop off as soon as we can. Absolutely.

[02:40:16.310 --> 02:40:20.290]
48 for Lord of the Rings. It's a beautiful thing. The return of the king.

[02:40:21.810 --> 02:40:24.810]
48 nobody's going to touch it. Think? No.

[02:40:25.490 --> 02:40:33.370]
Shawshank Redemption 37. Paul fiction 36. Now those top, although I did see Paul fiction. I was going to say the top three I would never see, but I already seen Paul

[02:40:33.370 --> 02:40:37.930]
fiction. It's too late. Paul fiction might give it a run for number one. It might.

[02:40:38.510 --> 02:40:44.870]
A lot of people like that gratuitous violence and they love hearing about the mayonnaise on the fries and the Amsterdam thousands and thousands of times.

[02:40:46.130 --> 02:40:51.850]
Saving private Ryan 34. Glenn Gary Glen Ross 23. My cousin Vinnie 22.

[02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:57.470]
Vowling for column by 21. What was that other mat day? And we started to say about two hours ago.

[02:40:57.610 --> 02:41:00.070]
The one that we can't you can ever think of the name for born identity.

[02:41:00.910 --> 02:41:04.850]
The born identity that's VO you are any. It's good. Boring identity.

[02:41:05.150 --> 02:41:09.910]
Did you see it? No, I'm good. I'm a list. I'll watch. Good. You know, I almost did the other day. Good.

[02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:15.470]
Not the wrong with it. He's good. I know you don't like him. Cut it on cable, but it was a half oversight.

[02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:18.730]
Didn't. My cousin Vinnie's got 22.

[02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:26.370]
Boring for column by 21. Well, that right there. That should tell you a lot about America. My cousin Vinnie 22. Boring for column by 21.

[02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:30.510]
Doesn't that tell you what you need to know? Of course, nobody. Not too many people are seeing Boring for column by it.

[02:41:30.930 --> 02:41:34.910]
And you want to know why? Because they had to go out and rent it or buy it. Right.

[02:41:37.010 --> 02:41:44.550]
Sound as a lamb 17 or office space 15. For his dump and chindlers list and good fellows 14 of peace.

[02:41:45.490 --> 02:41:51.690]
American beauty nine Braveheart eight usual suspects eight. Requiem for dreams only got seven. Magnolia got another one's got six.

[02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:59.790]
Don't listen to George. Okay. It's just propaganda. You should really get over your anti-submitted. He doesn't like the fact that there's like a bag.

[02:41:59.790 --> 02:42:03.790]
Six minute is a fact character when you make me see one of the best segments in the movie. What are you talking about?

[02:42:03.890 --> 02:42:10.110]
Also the guy from life in which I never think of his name. Hardy Johnson. It's not already Johnson. It's not even close to arty Johnson.

[02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:14.190]
He's he's he's Johnson for the bartenders Johnson, but it ain't already Johnson.

[02:42:15.330 --> 02:42:16.470]
That would be Q a.m. Hello.

[02:42:17.890 --> 02:42:26.630]
Yeah, sir. How you doing? Pretty good. I got one nominated movie. Okay. How about spun spun? You ever heard of it? Yes, I have.

[02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:37.130]
You did. I have heard you didn't like it. I didn't see it. Okay. Well, I have got a great day. I got to like that echo. We had an echo in it like spun.

[02:42:37.370 --> 02:42:48.750]
Is that like Alan Greenspun? How are Dean? How are Dean the other day? I said Alan Greenspan out of going and he'd later in the day said, well, I don't think so. Really? Yeah. Well, he you know his advisors, his handlers.

[02:42:48.750 --> 02:43:03.650]
They're handling him. They're handling him right on a right out of contention. WQ a.m. Hello. Yeah, for your poll groundhog day. Groundhog day. There you go. Can't beat that. Right? What's not to like, man? Come on.

[02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:14.430]
Have a few yucks. Putting it on there. Sure. It's your why not? I never said WQ a.m. Hello. Hey, Mr. Rogers. Yes, sir. Mr. caller.

[02:43:14.430 --> 02:43:24.090]
Hey, it's the donut man. The donut guy. Okay. How you feeling? Pretty good. All right. Hey, I want to add to the list face off.

[02:43:24.730 --> 02:43:35.390]
Face off was in 1997 with Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. Sounds like a hockey movie. No, I'm just kidding. I know you are, sir. But no, excellent.

[02:43:36.830 --> 02:43:51.750]
What went into directing it and what came out of it phenomenal? Right. Okay. Well, we got you down. Thanks a lot. Take care. Good. Good. Voice there. I don't think I've ever heard a movie more universally panned than face off. Well, he liked it. Okay.

[02:43:52.790 --> 02:44:02.370]
See you're making fun of that guy. He likes so. I can make you see it. No. Did I see it? No. No. Are you going to see it? Got you. I don't know. Oh, like I said, probably not.

[02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:10.710]
Now, one thing I will say and maybe I'm mellowing my old and my ancient age, but I watched that thing last night a little bit of it. The golden gloves, the hour.

[02:44:11.310 --> 02:44:18.450]
I mean, for me to watch an hour in a word show is just. It's my mind. Cause first of all, I didn't see any of those movies. Now one of them, not one.

[02:44:19.210 --> 02:44:24.990]
And I watch it for the movies, although they show their clips. It's kind of interesting. But I watched it for the people.

[02:44:24.990 --> 02:44:37.730]
And I was sitting there thinking to myself. See, number one, it's the media again, who harmed these people. And we, you know, we have to know whether this one's a son of a bitch or whether this one is supposedly divorced 45 times.

[02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:48.770]
And what difference is that make these people provide a lot of entertainment? And I'll grant you that it's just, you know, it's just a suck fest where they sit around, you know, panning each other on a back and sucking up a lot of booze.

[02:44:48.770 --> 02:44:55.890]
But nevertheless, they provide a lot of entertainment. There's a lot of work that goes into making a movie. I mean, a tremendous amount of work that goes into a real good movie.

[02:44:56.390 --> 02:45:06.730]
And most people don't realize that. They just take it for granted. You know what I'm saying? Oh, yeah. That's why Magnolia, for example, for getting about the ending or whatever. Hey, I just use that. That's a bad example.

[02:45:10.810 --> 02:45:18.410]
I mean, there's so much that when the writing of that story and the characters and every, every person was every soundtrack.

[02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:31.790]
My God, it was unbelievable. All the acting and the make right, editing because the editing was great in that movie. Right. The asked to ask part was edited best. Wow. I could have gone for more. I heard it was breast by test.

[02:45:31.790 --> 02:45:42.330]
But anyway, you like Rick and for dream, but you won't watch it. You're hard asked people out there. Oh, well, we know her. That Miguel saw it. He didn't like it. Well, there's proof right there. Hey, right. I like this better.

[02:45:46.830 --> 02:45:53.310]
You know who should be forced to watch that movie? Your mom rush. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He was getting a few more.

[02:45:53.310 --> 02:45:57.910]
She can't. Yeah, pop a couple more right. Someone will have to go to parallel porn.

[02:46:01.470 --> 02:46:08.290]
What's the song? Oh, I know what it is. Amy man. Mm-hmm. Do I have that in here? Oh, yeah, I do have that. You want to?

[02:46:08.770 --> 02:46:14.290]
What? I figure for it. Like with Amy man.

[02:46:16.810 --> 02:46:27.750]
And I love Amy man. She is great. Even though you don't like that movie. I'm telling you folks, take my word for it.

[02:46:27.790 --> 02:46:33.710]
Go out and write me a little kill a whole day. I'm like in a weekend when it's really boring. Like after the Super Bowl. And there's no more football.

[02:46:34.850 --> 02:46:42.790]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line WQM. Hello. That's how I like to add a movie to the.

[02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:58.590]
Go right ahead sir. Go ahead. I see go right ahead. Yeah, the. Legend of the fall. Legends of the palm. No, legends of the fall. Legend of the fall. Yeah, I actually saw that.

[02:46:58.790 --> 02:47:03.610]
I know that's shocking, but I actually saw that. I was very good. Thank you. Legends of the palm. I mean the fall. Okay.

[02:47:04.210 --> 02:47:10.210]
What's the legend of the palm? Wasn't that the moment Michael Keynes hand in the day on that? That might be on the call. Legend of the fall might be older than 1990.

[02:47:10.550 --> 02:47:14.650]
You looking at it, taking a puke at it. Good movie. Checker is checking the facts. Uh oh.

[02:47:15.930 --> 02:47:20.170]
53 for Florida. The Pulp Fiction is moving to the second. 94. 94. 94. Fine.

[02:47:21.570 --> 02:47:25.250]
Legend of the fall is good. Pulp Fiction will win. That's my prediction. You'll be upset.

[02:47:26.190 --> 02:47:34.970]
Oh, whatever. Yeah, you're pulling for Lord of the Rings. You ran to that crap and that Indiana Jones. But yeah, it was good. They were good. Van Gary Glen Ross was there.

[02:47:35.010 --> 02:47:45.210]
There's nothing wrong with that movie. Not a damn thing. flawless. I love Shelley man. He's the best. Shelley the machine. Shelley the machine. Oh, God.

[02:47:45.610 --> 02:47:51.510]
You want to give some of it away by. I know you don't know because it's just too good. The ending is too good.

[02:47:52.090 --> 02:47:57.970]
See, that's why when you when you have a movie and there's like some mediocre performances like Godfather 3 and that's why everybody rips it.

[02:47:58.050 --> 02:48:06.790]
Oh, gee, you don't want to see that one. Uh and it's unfortunate because it destroys the whole thing. But when you have a movie, but there's a whole bunch of top name people. Right.

[02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:13.710]
And all their performances are all brilliant like network, for example. Look at all the people that were in there. Right. All started unbelievable. Robert Duvall.

[02:48:13.770 --> 02:48:19.730]
I want you to be holding in fade. Dunno way and uh, Ned Bady. Right. My God. You can't beat it with a stick.

[02:48:21.770 --> 02:48:28.090]
And a lot of people like you said won't watch it because it's a time thing because now they come to accept these each. Channel seven news. And I think it was always like this.

[02:48:28.090 --> 02:48:33.170]
All this hyper ventilating hysterical Ricky Tiki Sanchez is on there. Foming at the mouth about the news.

[02:48:34.710 --> 02:48:39.250]
So it's not a big deal to them. 26 after one at 560 WQ ML.

[02:48:39.370 --> 02:48:44.270]
I think it what is a big deal is carpeting those things that call carpets on your floor. You spent a lot of money on them.

[02:48:44.450 --> 02:48:48.810]
But if they're starting to get a little bit schmutzy, maybe after the holidays, they need some cleaning. They need to be brightened up.

And if you're a fan of the city, you'll be glad you did 1-800-248-5071.

[02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:41.690]
Oh no, I don't want to attach to my...

[02:51:42.170 --> 02:51:43.030]
They don't say it?

[02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:44.630]
Might plug me up a little bit.

[02:51:45.310 --> 02:51:46.430]
Here's the facts I don't understand.

[02:51:46.610 --> 02:51:48.250]
It says, Matt Damon's rounder is...

[02:51:48.250 --> 02:51:48.930]
And then it says, Schmidt.

[02:51:50.270 --> 02:51:51.610]
Now is that who sent a twist, Todd Schmidt?

[02:51:52.450 --> 02:51:54.810]
I don't get it. There's a movie called Rounder's I Never Said.

[02:51:54.870 --> 02:51:56.410]
Right. Well let's put it on there.

[02:51:56.470 --> 02:51:58.410]
I don't know. Maybe he's saying the movie is Schmidt or...

[02:51:58.410 --> 02:51:59.130]
I don't know. I don't know.

[02:51:59.370 --> 02:52:00.390]
Maybe his name was Schmidt.

[02:52:00.490 --> 02:52:02.590]
Or Todd. Todd Dreck.

[02:52:03.710 --> 02:52:06.450]
By orders of Alan Greenspan, confident lost jobs will be replaced.

[02:52:06.450 --> 02:52:06.850]
They're just driving.

[02:52:07.270 --> 02:52:09.010]
Yeah, overseas somewhere by much of Indian...

[02:52:09.010 --> 02:52:09.170]
Right.

[02:52:09.290 --> 02:52:10.410]
...the Chinese people.

[02:52:11.550 --> 02:52:13.250]
Or busy spreading that Yenth virus.

[02:52:14.550 --> 02:52:18.190]
5-670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:52:18.730 --> 02:52:19.590]
What was...

[02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:20.010]
Look at that.

[02:52:20.170 --> 02:52:22.090]
9-11 Commission holding a two-day hearing in Washington.

[02:52:22.390 --> 02:52:23.430]
We're going to find out what really happened.

[02:52:23.570 --> 02:52:23.650]
Oh!

[02:52:23.790 --> 02:52:24.390]
No. Never.

[02:52:25.570 --> 02:52:30.730]
Just like, you know, the person that was complaining about the fact that David Kasey's

[02:52:30.730 --> 02:52:32.930]
there's no weapons of mass destruction and now blaming it on the CIA.

[02:52:33.310 --> 02:52:34.070]
That's old news.

[02:52:35.370 --> 02:52:41.630]
The CIA already said they told the Bush-Mistory before his inaugural address of 2000 and whatever it was, too.

[02:52:43.070 --> 02:52:45.410]
That there was all bad information.

[02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:46.130]
It was full of crap.

[02:52:46.210 --> 02:52:50.630]
He still goes on on the worldwide TV and, you know, fills this crap to the public.

[02:52:53.370 --> 02:52:55.530]
Speaking of crap, guess who's on CNN right now?

[02:52:56.590 --> 02:52:56.990]
I can see that.

[02:52:56.990 --> 02:52:58.050]
So there's a lot of...

[02:52:58.050 --> 02:52:59.210]
There now we...

[02:52:59.210 --> 02:53:00.030]
Or one of the...

[02:53:00.030 --> 02:53:01.130]
I'm in for Jew Lieberman.

[02:53:01.270 --> 02:53:04.270]
If they take it off and go to a high for a summer, we're going to get lost.

[02:53:05.490 --> 02:53:06.550]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:53:07.050 --> 02:53:07.450]
Oh, yeah.

[02:53:08.030 --> 02:53:08.950]
My name is Alvin.

[02:53:09.170 --> 02:53:11.290]
I had a couple of movies where we'll need us to call them.

[02:53:18.290 --> 02:53:19.290]
Oh, man.

[02:53:20.070 --> 02:53:21.110]
I love it.

[02:53:21.570 --> 02:53:22.050]
Let's see.

[02:53:22.230 --> 02:53:24.450]
Absolute Best Movie is...

[02:53:24.450 --> 02:53:24.870]
Falling Down.

[02:53:25.510 --> 02:53:28.030]
1993 starring Michael Douglas directed by Joel Schumacher.

[02:53:28.810 --> 02:53:29.450]
Says Keith and Boca.

[02:53:29.570 --> 02:53:30.010]
Thank you, Keith.

[02:53:30.190 --> 02:53:30.890]
We're going to fall down.

[02:53:30.890 --> 02:53:31.490]
We're going to put it down.

[02:53:32.130 --> 02:53:33.490]
How about all the fall down?

[02:53:33.630 --> 02:53:35.710]
That's too old to call them all to be before we got that thing in his head?

[02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:36.730]
By the way, don't waste your time.

[02:53:37.290 --> 02:53:37.610]
With what?

[02:53:37.890 --> 02:53:38.250]
Falling Down.

[02:53:38.730 --> 02:53:38.870]
Oh.

[02:53:39.170 --> 02:53:39.690]
Michael Douglas.

[02:53:39.950 --> 02:53:40.110]
Yeah.

[02:53:40.910 --> 02:53:41.270]
Oh, man.

[02:53:41.270 --> 02:53:41.270]

[02:53:41.270 --> 02:53:41.270]

[02:53:41.270 --> 02:53:41.270]

[02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:43.130]
He's been in some good movies.

[02:53:43.310 --> 02:53:44.230]
I can only think of one.

[02:53:44.650 --> 02:53:45.010]
Which one?

[02:53:45.630 --> 02:53:46.150]
I don't know.

[02:53:47.090 --> 02:53:47.810]
Basic instinct.

[02:53:48.470 --> 02:53:49.570]
Basic instinct was good.

[02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:50.010]
Yeah.

[02:53:51.510 --> 02:53:52.950]
Like I said, I can only think of...

[02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:53.270]
Fatal attraction.

[02:53:53.490 --> 02:53:54.550]
Fatal attraction was excellent.

[02:53:54.670 --> 02:53:55.350]
I can only think of two.

[02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:56.850]
I thought that he'd get a few weeks ago.

[02:53:57.010 --> 02:53:57.390]
Fatal attraction.

[02:53:57.890 --> 02:53:58.470]
That's one of those...

[02:53:58.950 --> 02:54:00.130]
You can't turn it off.

[02:54:00.470 --> 02:54:00.550]
Right.

[02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:02.130]
Let's see.

[02:54:02.250 --> 02:54:02.930]
Here we go.

[02:54:03.010 --> 02:54:04.410]
There's a good one from Todd and Key Largo.

[02:54:04.570 --> 02:54:05.130]
Boogie Nights.

[02:54:05.530 --> 02:54:05.670]
Right.

[02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:06.510]
How could we forget?

[02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:07.890]
How could we forget that packet?

[02:54:08.010 --> 02:54:08.850]
That's an instant classic.

[02:54:09.270 --> 02:54:09.450]
Right.

[02:54:09.450 --> 02:54:10.150]
Boogie Nights.

[02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:12.770]
That was the only good movie that Burr Reynolds ever made after deliverance.

[02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.950]
Right.

[02:54:13.350 --> 02:54:13.950]
Boogie Nights.

[02:54:15.010 --> 02:54:15.410]
Phenomenon.

[02:54:15.450 --> 02:54:17.550]
The lovely, untalented, uh, Markey Mark.

[02:54:17.850 --> 02:54:19.890]
And his ex-Marx The Spot has prosthesis.

[02:54:20.230 --> 02:54:20.790]
There's another movie.

[02:54:20.830 --> 02:54:21.030]
Nothing.

[02:54:21.170 --> 02:54:22.230]
You can't find anything wrong with it.

[02:54:22.250 --> 02:54:22.890]
What's that prosthesis?

[02:54:23.230 --> 02:54:23.470]
Yeah.

[02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:24.090]
Boogie Nights.

[02:54:24.250 --> 02:54:24.730]
Good story.

[02:54:24.910 --> 02:54:25.590]
Good, uh, acting.

[02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:26.570]
Acting is great.

[02:54:27.070 --> 02:54:27.950]
And got a lot of laughs.

[02:54:28.230 --> 02:54:28.770]
All the way to the end.

[02:54:29.190 --> 02:54:29.390]
Right.

[02:54:29.810 --> 02:54:30.730]
Even his hairpiece looked good.

[02:54:31.190 --> 02:54:31.270]
Right.

[02:54:31.550 --> 02:54:32.650]
567.0560.

[02:54:33.290 --> 02:54:35.710]
£560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:54:35.950 --> 02:54:36.790]
Tomorrow we're going to be asking,

[02:54:36.890 --> 02:54:38.870]
where do we get free meals now that Burton Jack's closed?

[02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:41.130]
WDQA Am.

[02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:41.510]

[02:54:43.250 --> 02:54:43.930]
QA Am.

[02:54:44.290 --> 02:54:44.710]
Yes, sir.

[02:54:45.450 --> 02:54:45.890]
Hello.

[02:54:46.330 --> 02:54:46.690]
Speaking.

[02:54:48.610 --> 02:54:49.050]
Speaking.

[02:54:49.470 --> 02:54:49.910]
Yes.

[02:54:50.110 --> 02:54:50.330]
Hello.

[02:54:51.570 --> 02:54:51.570]

[02:54:51.570 --> 02:54:53.670]
You know what I was saying about Schmidt.

[02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:56.670]
Jack Nicholson.

[02:54:57.010 --> 02:54:57.170]
Right.

[02:54:57.690 --> 02:54:58.390]
About Schmidt.

[02:54:58.830 --> 02:54:59.270]
A box met.

[02:54:59.410 --> 02:54:59.630]
Okay.

[02:54:59.930 --> 02:55:00.510]
Only one though.

[02:55:01.570 --> 02:55:03.210]
Is everybody was trying to say about Schmidt?

[02:55:03.850 --> 02:55:04.910]
You want to put that on there, actually?

[02:55:05.090 --> 02:55:06.170]
I think Jack Nicholson was in it.

[02:55:06.470 --> 02:55:06.710]
Yes.

[02:55:08.490 --> 02:55:11.610]
How many movies in the last five years of Jack Nicholson made by that?

[02:55:11.830 --> 02:55:12.470]
Third man.

[02:55:12.550 --> 02:55:12.750]
Man.

[02:55:12.930 --> 02:55:13.910]
He just pops up everywhere.

[02:55:14.610 --> 02:55:16.390]
He was on his best behavior last night.

[02:55:16.510 --> 02:55:18.150]
I always get a chuckle on the Jack.

[02:55:18.330 --> 02:55:19.290]
But he was very quiet.

[02:55:20.350 --> 02:55:21.730]
He doesn't have to really say anything.

[02:55:21.850 --> 02:55:23.230]
All he's going to do is give it that Schmidt eat and look.

[02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:24.430]
They painted by the breath.

[02:55:24.930 --> 02:55:26.270]
Is that what it is?

[02:55:29.330 --> 02:55:30.030]
Oh, look at that.

[02:55:30.030 --> 02:55:33.550]
The White House is vowing out to review the pre-war intelligence.

[02:55:33.890 --> 02:55:34.570]
There you go.

[02:55:34.950 --> 02:55:37.730]
There's the big breakthrough that we all been waiting for, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:55:37.890 --> 02:55:38.130]
Okay.

[02:55:38.290 --> 02:55:39.630]
While all these kids are dying over there.

[02:55:39.930 --> 02:55:43.650]
The White House is promising to review the pre-war intelligence to see it just maybe.

[02:55:44.230 --> 02:55:46.610]
If maybe they were given a bum steer, okay?

[02:55:47.310 --> 02:55:48.330]
The seemingly one runs well.

[02:55:48.530 --> 02:55:51.870]
So he knew exactly where 30% of them chemical and biological weapons were.

[02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:53.930]
Maybe he was just getting a little bit carried away.

[02:55:54.310 --> 02:55:57.450]
When Colin Cancer Powell sat there in front of the whole world of the United Nations

[02:55:57.450 --> 02:56:00.250]
and held up their maps and told everybody this is where they are.

[02:56:00.390 --> 02:56:00.950]
We know where they are.

[02:56:01.070 --> 02:56:01.750]
We're going to go get them.

[02:56:01.950 --> 02:56:03.750]
And maybe he was just like making a lot of crap up.

[02:56:03.750 --> 02:56:06.810]
Just embellishing it just that we bit.

[02:56:07.010 --> 02:56:08.150]
Don't forget the cartoon pictures.

[02:56:08.890 --> 02:56:08.910]
Right.

[02:56:09.390 --> 02:56:10.790]
11 points ahead of Howard Dean.

[02:56:11.050 --> 02:56:11.190]
See?

[02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:12.170]
And all the pens out.

[02:56:12.630 --> 02:56:14.450]
So this is one of those primaries tomorrow.

[02:56:14.670 --> 02:56:17.190]
If you're optimistic, if you're still a Dean person, if you're hanging on desperately,

[02:56:17.830 --> 02:56:19.850]
you can look at that Zogby and Reuters poll and say,

[02:56:19.950 --> 02:56:21.990]
oh my god, he's making a big comeback, Ohio.

[02:56:22.650 --> 02:56:22.810]
Yeah.

[02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:27.630]
But if you, you know, if you're for somebody else, then my winning election, like maybe John Kerry or John Edwards.

[02:56:28.370 --> 02:56:30.290]
Edwards ain't doing that good in New Hampshire, but why would he?

[02:56:30.510 --> 02:56:30.690]
You know?

[02:56:31.030 --> 02:56:31.210]
Right.

[02:56:31.210 --> 02:56:34.390]
But Southern, as you wouldn't expect to all that great there, all the time,

[02:56:34.450 --> 02:56:35.170]
well, John McCain's not a Southern.

[02:56:35.290 --> 02:56:35.990]
He's from the Southwest.

[02:56:37.650 --> 02:56:37.750]
Right.

[02:56:37.810 --> 02:56:38.790]
Did he be Bush in New Hampshire?

[02:56:39.450 --> 02:56:40.210]
In the Republican primary?

[02:56:40.330 --> 02:56:40.710]
Yes, he did.

[02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.990]
He did.

[02:56:42.050 --> 02:56:44.210]
Then he was buried under a mountain of Bush money.

[02:56:44.610 --> 02:56:46.830]
But you'll see what's going to happen in South Carolina, man.

[02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:48.790]
I'm just telling you right now.

[02:56:50.430 --> 02:56:51.650]
Maybe Edwards is the guy, you know?

[02:56:52.810 --> 02:56:56.090]
I think anybody with a brain that has any, any, even cares.

[02:56:56.270 --> 02:56:59.330]
How can anybody not care unless you just think you have to be, you have to be,

[02:56:59.330 --> 02:57:02.090]
you know, who would not care about this election?

[02:57:02.090 --> 02:57:05.390]
Even if you never create about politics before and you think it's boring and they're all a bunch of crooks,

[02:57:05.390 --> 02:57:07.230]
which they are, the people who are obsessed with.

[02:57:07.330 --> 02:57:07.650]
Pants.

[02:57:07.870 --> 02:57:08.470]
Yeah, they don't care.

[02:57:09.190 --> 02:57:11.190]
Because the ball games will always be there, right?

[02:57:11.650 --> 02:57:11.910]
Sure.

[02:57:12.010 --> 02:57:12.950]
You always beat a lot of balls.

[02:57:13.170 --> 02:57:15.750]
They might, yours might be gone, but somebody will always have some balls.

[02:57:15.990 --> 02:57:16.210]
Pants.

[02:57:17.970 --> 02:57:22.750]
I mean, can you imagine the political astuteness and awareness of those people outside that building?

[02:57:24.050 --> 02:57:27.250]
People are still rubbing, they're doing their OJ blow up doll at night.

[02:57:27.250 --> 02:57:28.430]
And, well, Robert's political.

[02:57:29.810 --> 02:57:30.910]
And that's the problem.

[02:57:31.430 --> 02:57:33.670]
By the way, don't forget, he's got to be gone by election day.

[02:57:34.130 --> 02:57:35.130]
I mean, out of the control.

[02:57:35.910 --> 02:57:36.650]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[02:57:37.250 --> 02:57:37.430]
New.

[02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:38.350]
Yes, sir.

[02:57:39.030 --> 02:57:40.110]
What about Scarface?

[02:57:40.690 --> 02:57:41.630]
Scarface is excellent.

[02:57:41.710 --> 02:57:42.110]
What year was that?

[02:57:42.190 --> 02:57:42.610]
About 76?

[02:57:42.890 --> 02:57:43.270]
Like 81.

[02:57:44.030 --> 02:57:44.650]
Yes, ancient movement.

[02:57:45.390 --> 02:57:45.830]
Scarface.

[02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.730]
What do you mean, Scarface?

[02:57:47.170 --> 02:57:47.890]
Just bend down.

[02:57:49.650 --> 02:57:52.210]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[02:57:52.770 --> 02:57:53.730]
And Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:57:54.390 --> 02:57:55.110]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[02:57:57.090 --> 02:57:57.830]
Yes, sir.

[02:57:58.370 --> 02:57:59.070]
Hello, Pali.

[02:57:59.510 --> 02:58:00.510]
How you doing, Pali?

[02:58:02.010 --> 02:58:04.150]
Road to tradition, over the time, Hank.

[02:58:05.490 --> 02:58:07.610]
And, bend this like back home.

[02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:08.750]
Good small movie.

[02:58:09.450 --> 02:58:09.690]
OK.

[02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:11.430]
Road to tradition.

[02:58:11.550 --> 02:58:11.950]
Road to hell.

[02:58:12.050 --> 02:58:12.670]
OK, we got it.

[02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:14.810]
And, uh, pack a lies.

[02:58:15.230 --> 02:58:16.090]
Hi, Pali.

[02:58:20.230 --> 02:58:22.250]
5670560, pound 560.

[02:58:22.390 --> 02:58:23.250]
Hi, Pali.

[02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:25.050]
On the AT&T, Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:58:25.090 --> 02:58:25.090]

[02:58:25.090 --> 02:58:25.090]

[02:58:25.090 --> 02:58:25.090]

[02:58:25.090 --> 02:58:25.090]

[02:58:25.090 --> 02:58:25.090]

[02:58:25.090 --> 02:58:25.090]

[02:58:25.090 --> 02:58:25.090]

[02:58:25.090 --> 02:58:25.910]
What is your title of the world?

[02:58:26.030 --> 02:58:26.650]
What is he talking about?

[02:58:27.030 --> 02:58:27.290]
I don't know.

[02:58:27.710 --> 02:58:28.010]
I don't either.

[02:58:28.130 --> 02:58:28.230]
I don't know.

[02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:28.230]

[02:58:28.470 --> 02:58:28.890]
It's good.

[02:58:28.990 --> 02:58:30.330]
The audience is kind of spastic there.

[02:58:30.350 --> 02:58:32.730]
I like that because I feel like way anywhere at the ass end of this cold.

[02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:34.290]
You know, you feel a little bit out of it.

[02:58:34.410 --> 02:58:34.730]
Mm-hmm.

[02:58:35.810 --> 02:58:36.770]
A little inquire.

[02:58:36.910 --> 02:58:39.330]
Thank God for this cinnamon herbal tea and spiderweat, George said.

[02:58:39.750 --> 02:58:41.890]
This celestial caffeine-free herbal tea.

[02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:44.070]
It's the only reason that you didn't mind to have him do a half of the show.

[02:58:45.090 --> 02:58:46.390]
Well, like I said, I love that stuff.

[02:58:47.710 --> 02:58:49.030]
Ah, man, it's a mahaia.

[02:58:49.470 --> 02:58:50.450]
You know who would say it's a mahaia?

[02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.830]
No.

[02:58:51.310 --> 02:58:51.830]
Oh, yeah.

[02:58:52.890 --> 02:58:54.270]
Howardine's wife would say it's a mahaia.

[02:58:54.310 --> 02:58:55.950]
I'm going to play that again after the break.

[02:58:56.130 --> 02:58:57.450]
I'm obsessed with that.

[02:58:57.630 --> 02:58:58.330]
And I know you are too.

[02:58:58.950 --> 02:58:59.610]
She's a hoot.

[02:59:00.930 --> 02:59:02.190]
And boy, what a par-shame, man.

[02:59:02.310 --> 02:59:03.650]
Oh, God, is she grotesque?

[02:59:04.390 --> 02:59:07.970]
If somebody would have told me that she would look worse than Chelsea Clinton.

[02:59:08.190 --> 02:59:09.710]
I'd say you've got to be Schmidt and me, man.

[02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:12.390]
Nobody, nobody looks worse than Chelsea Clinton.

[02:59:13.370 --> 02:59:16.230]
Even so, if he a corporal alas, that would her triple-sized nose.

[02:59:16.950 --> 02:59:18.390]
I think she didn't get a nose job.

[02:59:18.430 --> 02:59:20.830]
The only thing is as opposed to like reducing the enlarge.

[02:59:20.830 --> 02:59:21.590]
They enlarged.

[02:59:21.650 --> 02:59:22.370]
They added one on.

[02:59:22.590 --> 02:59:23.070]
They anchored.

[02:59:23.230 --> 02:59:23.830]
They twisted it.

[02:59:23.890 --> 02:59:24.270]
They anchored.

[02:59:24.310 --> 02:59:24.950]
They pulled it out.

[02:59:25.250 --> 02:59:26.710]
So she really sticks out in the crowd.

[02:59:27.190 --> 02:59:29.350]
And I'm glad she didn't win because even if she did a great job,

[02:59:29.550 --> 02:59:30.010]
what does she do?

[02:59:30.090 --> 02:59:30.850]
She directed that movie?

[02:59:31.050 --> 02:59:31.570]
What movie was it?

[02:59:31.970 --> 02:59:31.970]

[02:59:32.050 --> 02:59:32.830]
Whatever it was.

[02:59:34.110 --> 02:59:37.670]
But just in general, principal, because she screwed up Godfather 3 so bad.

[02:59:37.810 --> 02:59:40.250]
And she waited till the end of the movie to take a bullet in the chest.

[02:59:40.250 --> 02:59:42.090]
I figured, I'm glad you didn't get it so fear.

[02:59:42.310 --> 02:59:43.450]
She went all the way to the only one.

[02:59:44.030 --> 02:59:44.390]
Oh, I know.

[02:59:45.130 --> 02:59:45.810]
Trying to canole.

[02:59:46.670 --> 02:59:48.730]
Armstrog, Toyota of Homestead, is where it's at.

[02:59:48.730 --> 02:59:49.750]
That man locally owned an operator.

[02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:51.970]
They've been treating people right and making great deals for years.

[02:59:52.130 --> 02:59:53.010]
They're unbeatable.

[03:01:42.290 --> 03:01:44.230]
Stop that crapkerbiss and I look like a Shayna Puneum.

[03:01:44.610 --> 03:01:46.110]
Stop that crapkerbiss and I look like a Shayna Puneum.

[03:01:46.110 --> 03:01:46.270]
Stop that crapkerbiss and I look like a Shayna Puneum.

[03:01:46.270 --> 03:01:46.910]
Stop that crapkerbiss and I look like a Shayna Puneum.

[03:01:46.910 --> 03:01:50.230]

Stop that crapkerons.

[03:02:11.270 --> 03:02:12.270]
Stop that crapkerons.

[03:02:12.270 --> 03:02:12.870]
mouth.

[03:02:13.870 --> 03:02:16.190]
I spent 23 years with the shagots.

[03:02:16.530 --> 03:02:19.410]
Most of the time he's a man, but on occasion I hate him.

[03:02:19.890 --> 03:02:22.970]
I think my husband Howie would make for a very good president.

[03:02:23.390 --> 03:02:27.270]
One of the things I'm a little pealed about is that Howie doesn't let us have a TV.

[03:02:27.570 --> 03:02:28.670]
I want to watch Section of City.

[03:02:28.990 --> 03:02:32.630]
I got to schlep down to campaign headquarters or to the croggers to watch on some tiny

[03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:33.550]
black and white set.

[03:02:33.850 --> 03:02:35.850]
I have never seen any program in color.

[03:02:36.190 --> 03:02:37.190]
So I'm no Jackie Kennedy.

[03:02:37.770 --> 03:02:39.590]
Hell, if you look at me, I'm no Ted Kennedy.

[03:02:40.050 --> 03:02:40.770]
I don't learn makeup.

[03:02:40.770 --> 03:02:42.850]
I'm like a whisker away from being amish.

[03:02:43.130 --> 03:02:45.190]
Don't expect to see much more of me during the campaign.

[03:02:45.550 --> 03:02:49.650]
The only reason I'm addressing you today is because I was able to chew through my restraints.

[03:02:49.910 --> 03:02:53.950]
Anyway, Gazagazon, that's here this for Dr. Julie Steinberg over and out.

[03:02:54.170 --> 03:02:56.290]
Pete, for a by the committee to elect John Kerry President.

[03:02:56.450 --> 03:02:56.890]
All right.

[03:02:57.250 --> 03:02:57.690]
146.

[03:02:57.770 --> 03:03:00.490]
You know the other one I absolutely love almost as much as that one.

[03:03:00.890 --> 03:03:01.710]
Yeah, what is this?

[03:03:02.230 --> 03:03:08.870]
In an effort to attract younger viewers, C-SPAN now offers a brand new reality show, Skydiving

[03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:09.830]
with Howie Dean.

[03:03:09.830 --> 03:03:15.070]
Join Howard Dean as he jets across the United States jumping out over some of his favorite

[03:03:15.070 --> 03:03:15.550]
states.

[03:03:16.890 --> 03:03:22.630]
California, Texas, New York, South Dakota, Oregon, Michigan.

[03:03:23.090 --> 03:03:26.010]
And then we're going to watch it in DC to take back the White House.

[03:03:26.110 --> 03:03:32.270]
And coming soon to Washington DC, Sharon Ranamo is Skydiving with Howie Dean premiering

[03:03:32.270 --> 03:03:33.810]
this week on C-SPAN.

[03:03:36.010 --> 03:03:37.630]
147 and 560.

[03:03:40.250 --> 03:03:40.970]
It's the best.

[03:03:41.650 --> 03:03:44.250]
Anyway, how about the big Lebowski spelled wrong, but nevertheless?

[03:03:44.550 --> 03:03:44.710]
All right.

[03:03:44.850 --> 03:03:45.490]
Still haven't seen it.

[03:03:45.790 --> 03:03:46.430]
Stick it on there.

[03:03:47.130 --> 03:03:48.310]
What's the one that you on, oh, wait a minute.

[03:03:48.390 --> 03:03:49.030]
That was Beaner Boyd.

[03:03:49.050 --> 03:03:49.470]
It was tell me.

[03:03:49.710 --> 03:03:51.190]
I see that enough to see.

[03:03:51.290 --> 03:03:51.410]
Yeah.

[03:03:51.750 --> 03:03:52.070]
Okay.

[03:03:52.230 --> 03:03:53.050]
Well, I still haven't seen it.

[03:03:53.070 --> 03:03:53.470]
I won't.

[03:03:53.950 --> 03:03:55.730]
What's that other one I was looking for last week?

[03:03:55.930 --> 03:03:57.150]
Well, there's so damn many of these.

[03:03:57.310 --> 03:03:57.430]
I know.

[03:03:57.610 --> 03:03:57.910]
I don't know.

[03:03:58.130 --> 03:03:58.310]
God.

[03:03:58.950 --> 03:04:00.410]
And somebody says snatch with Brad Pitt.

[03:04:00.490 --> 03:04:02.370]
Now, did you get snatch on the list?

[03:04:03.330 --> 03:04:05.090]
No, it is now.

[03:04:06.030 --> 03:04:06.830]
It got snatch.

[03:04:07.310 --> 03:04:07.770]
We got the list.

[03:04:08.110 --> 03:04:08.650]
It was very good.

[03:04:09.090 --> 03:04:12.890]
It says here, first of all, did you know that when you don't, when you go screenless,

[03:04:12.890 --> 03:04:17.150]
which is all this year, and I think next year too, and someone dials the number and

[03:04:17.150 --> 03:04:21.110]
when it doesn't get picked up at some point, it disconnects with recording from a sound

[03:04:21.110 --> 03:04:22.270]
that says bell, soft sucks.

[03:04:22.510 --> 03:04:23.530]
It would like any other service.

[03:04:23.850 --> 03:04:27.090]
Probably it would just keep bringing forever, which is what it should do.

[03:04:27.330 --> 03:04:27.550]
Right.

[03:04:27.990 --> 03:04:29.570]
But with this thing, it just disconnects.

[03:04:29.570 --> 03:04:31.970]
So it makes screenless more difficult, especially on line one.

[03:04:32.070 --> 03:04:33.070]
It has like a quick disconnect.

[03:04:33.430 --> 03:04:36.530]
But we're just kissing the ground that it works at all because between our engineering

[03:04:36.530 --> 03:04:38.730]
department and Bell South, we'll take anything, right?

[03:04:38.930 --> 03:04:39.690]
Bell South sucks.

[03:04:39.930 --> 03:04:41.230]
Don't say bell South sucks.

[03:04:41.450 --> 03:04:41.570]
Right.

[03:04:42.290 --> 03:04:43.270]
Somebody QA and hello.

[03:04:44.130 --> 03:04:44.550]
Hello.

[03:04:44.670 --> 03:04:44.670]

[03:04:44.990 --> 03:04:45.350]
Yes, sir.

[03:04:45.750 --> 03:04:46.210]
All right.

[03:04:46.470 --> 03:04:46.790]
Who's this?

[03:04:47.130 --> 03:04:47.730]
This is Neil.

[03:04:48.050 --> 03:04:48.550]
Neil Roger?

[03:04:48.890 --> 03:04:49.350]
Yes, sir.

[03:04:49.550 --> 03:04:49.990]
Looks like me.

[03:04:50.310 --> 03:04:51.670]
Hey, just Tommy Boy.

[03:04:51.730 --> 03:04:52.410]
What about Tommy Boy?

[03:04:53.110 --> 03:04:53.730]
Tommy Boy.

[03:04:55.030 --> 03:04:55.850]
Tommy Boy.

[03:04:56.830 --> 03:04:57.250]
Existing.

[03:04:58.090 --> 03:04:59.330]
Get out of here.

[03:05:00.130 --> 03:05:00.970]
You're an idiot.

[03:05:01.150 --> 03:05:01.810]
You're an idiot.

[03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:02.550]
You're an idiot.

[03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:06.110]
56670560.

[03:05:06.290 --> 03:05:06.830]
It was a good call.

[03:05:07.450 --> 03:05:10.690]
0560 on the AT&T and Verizon Marles on that was Todd Rex kid.

[03:05:11.330 --> 03:05:11.750]
You're an idiot.

[03:05:12.270 --> 03:05:12.470]
Yeah.

[03:05:12.810 --> 03:05:13.270]
Do you like that?

[03:05:14.810 --> 03:05:15.170]
WDQM.

[03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.370]
Hello.

[03:05:16.410 --> 03:05:17.710]
Hey, I got another movie from Neil.

[03:05:18.110 --> 03:05:18.650]
Yes, sir.

[03:05:19.390 --> 03:05:19.590]
Yeah.

[03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:20.810]
How about a Terminator 2?

[03:05:21.490 --> 03:05:22.150]
Terminator 2.

[03:05:22.290 --> 03:05:23.170]
Now we're talking, baby.

[03:05:23.330 --> 03:05:23.810]
All right.

[03:05:24.010 --> 03:05:24.790]
I'll see it in California.

[03:05:25.430 --> 03:05:25.910]
Terminator 2.

[03:05:26.010 --> 03:05:26.490]
Get it on there.

[03:05:27.150 --> 03:05:28.730]
See, don't be knocking that guy before.

[03:05:28.850 --> 03:05:29.790]
At least it was something different.

[03:05:30.170 --> 03:05:31.270]
I'm not knocking him.

[03:05:31.310 --> 03:05:32.110]
No, I like that.

[03:05:32.230 --> 03:05:32.930]
I like something different.

[03:05:33.170 --> 03:05:36.150]
It's called the same old, tired crap.

[03:05:36.810 --> 03:05:39.610]
And then, of course, Dave Friedman who denies that he faxes the nice thing.

[03:05:40.430 --> 03:05:41.090]
Oh, yeah, that way.

[03:05:41.270 --> 03:05:41.890]
Did he really?

[03:05:42.050 --> 03:05:42.190]
Yeah.

[03:05:42.530 --> 03:05:43.770]
Well, never, never see it.

[03:05:43.870 --> 03:05:44.730]
Never see the light of the day.

[03:05:44.910 --> 03:05:45.170]
Stop it, Dave.

[03:05:45.170 --> 03:05:46.230]
Bye-bye, Dave Friedman.

[03:05:46.430 --> 03:05:46.830]
Go away.

[03:05:47.110 --> 03:05:47.770]
Stop it, Dave.

[03:05:47.850 --> 03:05:49.150]
Fat Boy, don't want to come out and play.

[03:05:49.430 --> 03:05:50.470]
Not even this fat boy either.

[03:05:51.070 --> 03:05:52.070]
You know what I'm going to have for lunch today?

[03:05:52.810 --> 03:05:53.190]
Fat Boy?

[03:05:53.630 --> 03:05:53.950]
Spaghetti.

[03:05:54.910 --> 03:05:55.430]
Don't do it.

[03:05:55.430 --> 03:05:55.710]
Why?

[03:05:55.930 --> 03:05:56.270]
Don't want to come out.

[03:05:56.270 --> 03:05:59.390]
No, I'm not going to have like a gigantic person that's going to, you know, bulk me all

[03:05:59.390 --> 03:05:59.530]
up.

[03:05:59.570 --> 03:05:59.850]
It doesn't matter.

[03:05:59.910 --> 03:06:03.450]
It's going to spark your appetite and you're going to get a bunch of ice cream in my appetite.

[03:06:03.630 --> 03:06:04.290]
Oh, when you come to the mall.

[03:06:04.290 --> 03:06:04.950]
I have no ice cream.

[03:06:05.050 --> 03:06:07.390]
I've got your two solid days on Atkins, baby.

[03:06:07.570 --> 03:06:07.950]
Two days.

[03:06:08.210 --> 03:06:09.450]
Swimming in the middle of the rest.

[03:06:10.350 --> 03:06:10.350]

[03:06:10.410 --> 03:06:13.930]
I need like sliced up hot dogs, sliced up wienies in my sauce.

[03:06:14.310 --> 03:06:15.010]
Maybe a little raggula.

[03:06:15.010 --> 03:06:15.190]
Yeah.

[03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:16.490]
And some nice pasta.

[03:06:16.690 --> 03:06:17.210]
That's how good.

[03:06:17.490 --> 03:06:20.750]
With like lots of parmesan cheese on there, like somebody we know would say parmesan.

[03:06:21.310 --> 03:06:22.490]
It's the season for parmesan.

[03:06:22.890 --> 03:06:23.650]
I don't know why.

[03:06:23.650 --> 03:06:24.810]
I just, I'm just in the mood for that.

[03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:26.590]
Now, a lot of times I'll see that and never happens.

[03:06:26.790 --> 03:06:26.950]
Good.

[03:06:27.790 --> 03:06:28.510]
What do you mean good?

[03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:31.470]
It's better than going out and getting a bunch of Nestle's third ice cream and just shovel

[03:06:31.470 --> 03:06:32.170]
it down my throat.

[03:06:32.370 --> 03:06:34.150]
A bunch of those Rogers almond.

[03:06:34.930 --> 03:06:36.470]
What are those almond-crispy candies?

[03:06:36.650 --> 03:06:37.110]
What do they call them?

[03:06:37.890 --> 03:06:38.590]
No almond brittle.

[03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:39.430]
Oh, man.

[03:06:40.150 --> 03:06:40.510]
Wow.

[03:06:41.170 --> 03:06:46.230]
If you want to die with a big smile on your face, go online, rogerscandys.ca or whatever it is.

[03:06:46.550 --> 03:06:47.350]
Oh, brother.

[03:06:48.050 --> 03:06:49.830]
I guarantee you that dark almond brittle.

[03:06:51.290 --> 03:06:52.470]
It'll just send you to heaven.

[03:06:53.870 --> 03:06:58.250]
What was the absolute best movie the last 13 years, 1990 to write this second?

[03:06:58.350 --> 03:06:59.150]
Okay, right now.

[03:06:59.750 --> 03:07:01.650]
I'm going to tell you a lot of good ones got left off this list.

[03:07:01.770 --> 03:07:02.710]
I'm pretty p.o.d about that.

[03:07:03.570 --> 03:07:03.770]
Are you?

[03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:05.230]
Lord of the Rings, we turn to the King.

[03:07:05.370 --> 03:07:06.010]
How's your thing?

[03:07:06.250 --> 03:07:07.850]
56 as in Q56.

[03:07:08.810 --> 03:07:09.730]
Pulp fiction, Fitty.

[03:07:10.830 --> 03:07:12.510]
I still think Pulp Fishing is going on by.

[03:07:13.430 --> 03:07:13.930]
You don't?

[03:07:14.110 --> 03:07:14.510]
No, I do.

[03:07:14.730 --> 03:07:15.010]
I agree.

[03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:15.370]
I do.

[03:07:15.370 --> 03:07:19.850]
Trash Agrenifction 44, Saving Priorion 38, Glen Gary Glen Ross 25.

[03:07:19.930 --> 03:07:22.390]
I am so pleased that that's doing so great.

[03:07:22.730 --> 03:07:24.450]
I think we can take part of the credit for that.

[03:07:24.630 --> 03:07:25.130]
That's all us.

[03:07:25.890 --> 03:07:29.310]
Well, you wonder why I say that is because in the past, we've asked about some of these movies.

[03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:30.690]
And not as many people seen it.

[03:07:30.790 --> 03:07:32.470]
But since we were in hyping it, they'd like it.

[03:07:33.350 --> 03:07:42.430]
Holding for Columbine 24, my cousin Vinnie 23,000, Salam's 23, 4 is dump 17, good fellow 17, office space 16,

[03:07:42.830 --> 03:07:44.370]
Schindler's List 14.

[03:07:45.890 --> 03:07:48.110]
All those years I worked with Erf Schindler, I never knew he had one.

[03:07:49.110 --> 03:07:50.010]
Or a list, either.

[03:07:50.890 --> 03:07:54.610]
American Beauty 12, Braveheart 11, and after that it's all single digits.

[03:07:55.050 --> 03:07:56.510]
Requiem's got eight, Magnolia 7.

[03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:59.310]
Hey, listen, what can I tell you?

[03:07:59.430 --> 03:08:01.850]
Okay, more people in the McDonald's than a Ruth Chris, right?

[03:08:03.070 --> 03:08:03.210]
Right.

[03:08:04.170 --> 03:08:05.070]
Let me say it again.

[03:08:05.710 --> 03:08:06.650]
Oh, look at that.

[03:08:06.790 --> 03:08:08.170]
It's a multi color.

[03:08:08.290 --> 03:08:09.370]
It's like the Neapolitan.

[03:08:09.370 --> 03:08:09.370]

[03:08:10.870 --> 03:08:12.230]
It's like Neapolitan ice cream.

[03:08:12.250 --> 03:08:13.210]
It's got tricolored.

[03:08:13.670 --> 03:08:18.070]
The documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock did that supersized me documentary film.

[03:08:18.610 --> 03:08:21.130]
And it all about him eating at McDonald's every day for a month.

[03:08:21.570 --> 03:08:24.550]
And in one month he gained 25 pounds.

[03:08:24.650 --> 03:08:25.630]
We could have done better than that.

[03:08:25.990 --> 03:08:28.390]
And I just can't imagine why there's so many fat thugs walking around.

[03:08:28.510 --> 03:08:31.090]
My and look all the way.

[03:08:31.090 --> 03:08:32.610]
This is 420560.

[03:08:33.090 --> 03:08:34.730]
You ain't way, yeah.

[03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:40.470]
What's the way to sing God Bless America and face these in a G-string up here?

[03:08:40.610 --> 03:08:41.430]
I'll do it.

[03:08:41.710 --> 03:08:42.310]
Sadabu Sain.

[03:08:42.610 --> 03:08:44.530]
You know him from Operation Desert Storm.

[03:08:44.790 --> 03:08:48.070]
He owned for me an Iraqi leader and gasping his own people.

[03:08:48.330 --> 03:08:51.430]
So we thought it'd be funny if we go ahead and send Daxid.

[03:08:51.770 --> 03:08:55.930]
It grabs Sadabu Sain out of his bunker posing as an army ranger.

[03:08:56.290 --> 03:08:57.570]
I mean, Sadabu Sain.

[03:08:57.930 --> 03:08:59.130]
What do you think you are?

[03:08:59.970 --> 03:09:00.950]
Sadabu Sain.

[03:09:01.330 --> 03:09:03.590]
You're in for a world of pain, my man.

[03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:05.110]
What a thought down here.

[03:09:05.270 --> 03:09:06.070]
I smell like ass.

[03:09:06.370 --> 03:09:08.490]
I wonder if the bitches would be offended by my stink.

[03:09:09.750 --> 03:09:10.370]
What is it?

[03:09:10.530 --> 03:09:11.190]
That is Kusar.

[03:09:11.250 --> 03:09:11.650]
Let me in.

[03:09:11.710 --> 03:09:13.030]
The infidels are my tail.

[03:09:13.390 --> 03:09:14.410]
So it's gay, because that's you.

[03:09:14.770 --> 03:09:15.130]
His alive.

[03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:17.390]
Smells like acid here.

[03:09:17.470 --> 03:09:17.730]
Yeah.

[03:09:18.110 --> 03:09:19.570]
That elacid's army right here.

[03:09:19.590 --> 03:09:19.810]
No.

[03:09:19.950 --> 03:09:20.270]
Get back.

[03:09:21.010 --> 03:09:21.210]
No.

[03:09:21.870 --> 03:09:21.870]

[03:09:22.350 --> 03:09:25.510]
AJ, I want you to tell him that we're going to put him under the jurisdiction of the Iraqi government.

[03:09:25.670 --> 03:09:26.230]
Go, go, go, go.

[03:09:26.350 --> 03:09:28.490]
You're now under the jurisdiction of the Iraqi government.

[03:09:28.750 --> 03:09:28.950]
No.

[03:09:29.530 --> 03:09:29.870]
No.

[03:09:30.410 --> 03:09:30.890]
I dex.

[03:09:31.070 --> 03:09:32.590]
I want you to go in and start taking them.

[03:09:32.590 --> 03:09:32.890]
No.

[03:09:33.450 --> 03:09:33.850]
No.

[03:09:34.030 --> 03:09:35.310]
No, no, not that they did it.

[03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.930]
No.

[03:09:36.070 --> 03:09:36.790]
What the hell?

[03:09:37.830 --> 03:09:38.210]
No, BJ.

[03:09:38.590 --> 03:09:41.690]
I want you to tell Sadabu, as soon as we're out of the bunker that we're removing his testicles.

[03:09:42.470 --> 03:09:46.730]
Hussein, upon the exit of this hall, your testicles will be removed.

[03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.270]
No.

[03:09:49.550 --> 03:09:50.810]
BJ, go through with the knife.

[03:09:50.890 --> 03:09:51.350]
I'm coming right now.

[03:09:51.370 --> 03:09:52.150]
All right, Sadabu.

[03:09:52.710 --> 03:09:53.770]
Here we go.

[03:09:54.410 --> 03:09:54.810]
No.

[03:09:56.690 --> 03:09:56.910]
No.

[03:09:57.130 --> 03:09:57.150]
No.

[03:09:57.150 --> 03:09:59.210]
It was hard to think we should start with first, huh?

[03:09:59.950 --> 03:10:02.270]
I asked you to mother fuckers.

[03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:03.510]
I knew you'd get me.

[03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:07.850]
Last night I was in a cell phone with you watching you put out the gas.

[03:10:08.110 --> 03:10:09.470]
I said you'll never get me.

[03:10:09.730 --> 03:10:10.350]
You did.

[03:10:10.690 --> 03:10:11.550]
You scum.

[03:10:11.610 --> 03:10:12.650]
You have to pick up.

[03:10:12.850 --> 03:10:14.250]
I was going to pick up too.

[03:10:14.490 --> 03:10:15.910]
This guy came here.

[03:10:16.990 --> 03:10:18.450]
157 at 560 W.

[03:10:18.570 --> 03:10:19.430]
He came a little bit friend of.

[03:10:19.630 --> 03:10:19.750]
Wow.

[03:10:20.590 --> 03:10:25.230]
Christina Aguilera, Maya, Pink, Lil Kim and Missy Elliott.

[03:10:25.950 --> 03:10:26.430]
Okay.

[03:10:26.930 --> 03:10:27.770]
Lady Marmalade.

[03:10:28.130 --> 03:10:28.610]
All right.

[03:10:28.610 --> 03:10:28.710]
Okay.

[03:10:28.810 --> 03:10:32.710]
If I could tell you how much I hate that song, and especially the video, because when it

[03:10:32.710 --> 03:10:33.510]
was out, I was in Europe.

[03:10:33.610 --> 03:10:35.050]
I guess it was the summer, a couple of years ago.

[03:10:35.970 --> 03:10:39.690]
And here we have one of those 8,000 music video channels.

[03:10:39.870 --> 03:10:41.670]
Here we have a couple of like, you know how many times an hour?

[03:10:41.730 --> 03:10:42.570]
About third man.

[03:10:42.790 --> 03:10:45.390]
Over and over and over and over.

[03:10:46.510 --> 03:10:49.810]
I mean, I don't want that crap in the first place, but Jesus, good God.

[03:10:50.550 --> 03:10:53.610]
And you do, and you flip from one to another, and it would be just starting on air.

[03:10:53.730 --> 03:10:54.030]
Here too.

[03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:55.430]
For no good God.

[03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:55.890]
Here we go.

[03:10:55.890 --> 03:10:58.370]
And we have a couple of different videos, like every channel.

[03:10:58.650 --> 03:10:58.890]
How many?

[03:10:59.090 --> 03:10:59.830]
The weather channel.

[03:11:00.010 --> 03:11:00.370]
Wait a minute.

[03:11:00.530 --> 03:11:01.270]
A channel 7 news.

[03:11:01.930 --> 03:11:05.630]
Hey, it was about a place in Chicago called Mulan Rouge, where they served pizza.

[03:11:06.290 --> 03:11:10.610]
It was about, yeah, when it serves that big, thick, crushed Chicago pizza, a red black man,

[03:11:10.610 --> 03:11:10.970]
they moved.

[03:11:10.990 --> 03:11:14.270]
At any rate, what was the absolute best movie last 13 years?

[03:11:14.370 --> 03:11:18.710]
Now, a lot of them didn't make it on here because we come a lot of time yakin' and yakin'

[03:11:20.810 --> 03:11:22.390]
because it's just fall because he's slow.

[03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:24.330]
Why is it his fault?

[03:11:24.750 --> 03:11:25.510]
Oh, I just saying that.

[03:11:25.750 --> 03:11:27.090]
Just in general, principal, why not?

[03:11:27.330 --> 03:11:27.990]
Blame him for a lot.

[03:11:28.230 --> 03:11:28.390]
Why not?

[03:11:28.750 --> 03:11:32.930]
Last 13 years, 1990 to 2003, we got a pretty awesome list here.

[03:11:33.230 --> 03:11:34.670]
We got a pretty impressive list we're building.

[03:11:34.890 --> 03:11:36.670]
We've got 476 votes.

[03:11:37.770 --> 03:11:38.990]
We don't have Tommy.

[03:11:40.630 --> 03:11:42.110]
Lord of the Rings, return of the King.

[03:11:42.330 --> 03:11:43.990]
Let's take a look at your thing, 59.

[03:11:45.250 --> 03:11:46.090]
Oh, it's speaking of Rhyman.

[03:11:47.890 --> 03:11:48.570]
What's his name?

[03:11:48.770 --> 03:11:49.310]
Lionel Tate?

[03:11:49.830 --> 03:11:50.010]
Yeah.

[03:11:50.110 --> 03:11:50.550]
Don't be late.

[03:11:51.110 --> 03:11:52.850]
Today he might be his date for getting on.
