[00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.000]
We love those mollins baby. They are really on rock solid

[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.460]
Oh, go go go go

[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.580]
Oh, go go go go

[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.820]
Oh, yeah

[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.360]
Sports 20 old 5C

[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.140]
WQAM

[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.680]
Miami Ford Lutter Day

[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.140]
The church over there folks

[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.760]
Oh, right

[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.360]
I don't know how many of those who need that to

[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.160]
It's the

[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.120]
Meele Router

[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.560]
See ya

[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.840]
What happened?

[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.820]
So what?

[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.060]
The old 5CM

[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.580]
Don't hear that

[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.720]
Where are you going?

[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.700]
Where are you going?

[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.680]
Where are you going?

[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.160]
Where are you going?

[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.960]
Where are you going?

[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.760]
Like Jackson

[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.680]
I can hear you

[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.480]
No, don't find it

[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.240]
You can't find it

[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.660]
What's going on?

[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.840]
I'll do some more glimpses

[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.820]
Make them scream nice and loud

[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.040]
Get me some wires and those bad dreams happening

[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.820]
I don't care if they hate

[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.800]
From my rack to be used

[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.100]
Use you to the torture

[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.500]
Cause they're just named their game

[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.280]
In the past it had to be worse with Saddam

[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980]
Who's saved

[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.840]
Oh, Williams said they died

[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.260]
To Ford Paul

[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.060]
Oh, cricket, how can you do this?

[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.860]
I want to stroke your legs

[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.780]
And slip your track with my breezy nose

[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.520]
You've got those hopeless whips

[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.780]
Now I'm pulling up my thigh

[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.840]
For the season

[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.320]
You dashed my hopes of family bliss

[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.480]
Here's well open my eyes

[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.560]
For no apparent reason

[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.300]
I'm like bustle of the bush

[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.640]
There's a way see me

[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.960]
In my trailer

[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.900]
And then I fight you no longer here

[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.140]
You've got the thing I like

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.620]
That's a failure

[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.260]
And the heart's full of all the sports queers

[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.300]
I don't want to fit the sides

[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.300]
That is the illusion

[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.640]
It's your choice I've walked in my mouth

[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.700]
Of the capital of the sides

[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.880]
Back to life's for whole radio

[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.660]
Don't leave us like this

[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.680]
Now only shak sons we can give

[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.660]
I'm dying out of here

[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.820]
10-0-2-5-60-WQM

[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.460]
What are we going to do about Ricky and Shaq

[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.680]
And Shaq and Ricky and all of this crap

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.360]
Man, what are we going to do about that cry line?

[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.360]
Oh, yeah

[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.240]
Boy, we better keep this thing cranked up all the time

[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.360]
We're going to do

[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.100]
1380 votes on George's Purgas

[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.520]
If we get the Marlins and the Phillies

[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.720]
And let me tell you let's tip our hats to those Marlins

[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.240]
Because they're not here to help us in this last rating book

[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.380]
Not only are we number one on QAM

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.360]
We're number one by about 400 miles

[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.400]
Even a morning show, what a morning's number two

[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.540]
But when's the last time mornings were number two, huh?

[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.260]
In men?

[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.980]
I don't know

[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.440]
In a long time since I think before Abe Lincoln was a baby

[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.480]
But at any rate, we kicked some serious ass

[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.680]
And the Marlins at night, 7pm to midnight

[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.300]
And leave it to Fatboy came in this morning to point this out

[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.620]
But before he pointed that out, he said

[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.000]
Hi, I'm Tally

[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.820]
But anyway, that kind of like through my day off a little bit

[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.100]
But the 7am midnight, let's see who's number one at night

[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.840]
It's hot, I believe, hot 105

[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.900]
Do we care?

[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.600]
Oh, yeah, hot 105

[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.760]
They must have the Marlin game in Blackies

[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.900]
In the bubonics

[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.440]
How about that Barack Obama for Emperor, I say

[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.080]
Man, that guy is great, you didn't see him

[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.400]
I didn't, I saw all the highlights

[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.680]
Oh, he's good

[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.500]
And he's articulate

[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.240]
And he's everything that you dark folks ought to be

[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.580]
An order was spired to be

[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.380]
This business is about what he talks white

[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.800]
You know what kind of crap is that?

[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.220]
He's articulate, he speaks like a human being, he's great

[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.660]
He's going to be president someday, you mark it down

[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.100]
Read it on your armpit

[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.920]
A market name

[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.540]
QBA, look at this, WQBA was number 21 in the winter book

[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.460]
You know, like when there's no baseball going on

[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.000]
Right, I had a 1.1 share

[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.240]
In this spring book that just came out yesterday

[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.780]
There's second with a 6.5 share at night

[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.780]
Because they got the Marlins in Espanol

[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.540]
And QM which has the Marlins in English

[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.220]
A 6.1 from 19th from tied for 19th at number 3

[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.040]
At night

[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.000]
Oh, yeah

[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.580]
We got the Marlins in the Phillies

[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.200]
As the Marlins try to complete a four game sweep against a team that they own

[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.120]
They fill it up your Phillies

[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.800]
At 12, 13, 13 in the afternoon, one o'clock is the game time

[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.460]
Don't worry about a little rain, okay?

[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.500]
Don't worry about a little rain, I'm worried about it because boy, that would be bad

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.880]
But they'll get that game in because it's a huge game and it means a lot

[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.680]
And they want to get in plus it when you have an early game like that

[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.040]
Zach, what was that game that they postponed because the rain ended about three in the morning

[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.180]
A couple weeks ago, remember that?

[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.280]
Yeah

[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.100]
Maybe maybe a little longer than that

[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.980]
No, they had a game that went on for what? You don't pay attention to the Marlins?

[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.220]
Oh, yeah, sometimes

[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.260]
What?

[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.440]
Josh Cordis isn't here today because he got to with Dave and Boring trying to put you up a little bit before the game doing his Marlins work

[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.200]
So we got Fats that crants in there today who came to you with us

[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.600]
I mean came to run the board which is why the open I guess was screwed up

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.120]
A little bit

[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.760]
Was it playing but I just couldn't hear it as ethodial?

[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.040]
Yeah

[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.780]
It was playing but the right button wasn't pressed there for you to hear it

[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.420]
I see, well it does make a difference

[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.720]
1380 votes on Little George's pool yesterday. What is the stupidest religion in the world?

[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.820]
I would say all day above would be my vote. I don't see that on here. No, it's not because that would be cop out. Come on. Pick one

[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.420]
Oh, so I voted for our Christianity

[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.340]
All right

[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.500]
Because that whole nailed in Jesus on the cross and drinking his blood thing

[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.800]
That's just kind of like that kind of like leaves me limp

[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.240]
You know what?

[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.420]
Eating the wafer and eating his body reminds me that all you can eat in those things that Phil did

[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.180]
You know what I mean?

[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.840]
Are you sure?

[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.160]
Yeah, I might even play that. That would give a lot of good news

[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.360]
This is nutritious though, you know.

[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.340]
Anyway, the stupidest religion in the world is Scientology 387. Yeah

[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.060]
You people that are watch yourselves all you voted, they're going to be monitoring your mail listening in on your phone calls

[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.300]
And that's what I voted for

[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.340]
Make it up nasty. Oh, George is a pick it on the Scientologist

[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.000]
You better watch your Tom Cruise and John Revoltamister and Lisa Marie Flair Pressley

[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.540]
At every chance.

[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.640]
The alley she might sit on me

[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.480]
You only wish

[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.900]
No

[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.380]
Yeah, come on

[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.500]
In the alley

[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.380]
Yeah, I see the reason

[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.460]
That's the reason why we got Cameron Diaz behind the big critin

[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.360]
That is a fine fine photo

[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.160]
She's wet and she's all wet. She's in the water and she's like just soap and wet

[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.600]
And there's a boobies right there. John asked Rob, they're going to be too happy if you sit there and linger

[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.420]
Depending on what you do with your finger

[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.000]
But just take a look at Cameron Diaz if you're over the age of 100 and it's not going to get too emotional

[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.340]
Don't take any Ciala survivor stuff like that. Well, you won't need to

[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.240]
Beep

[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.560]
Good picture

[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.860]
So there's Cameron Diaz behind the big critin

[00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.580]
And I got she was born August 30th 1972 in San Diego, California. Everybody knows Cameron Diaz

[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:07.920]
Wasps is her new movie that she's making right now. Shrek 3 for 2006 in her shoes

[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:15.080]
But she's she's got 85,000 project going on right now. She was the voice of Princess Fiona in Shrek 2

[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.860]
Charlie's Angels full throttle gangs of New York, but she's been in the eight-minute movies. Everybody knows Cameron Diaz

[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.060]
So on some days looks pretty name good other days. That's a good one. Right. No, I agree. Yeah. She's got her good moments in bed

[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.880]
But then again who doesn't well a lot of us don't have a good one. That's her thing. She said it a lot. Yeah

[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.980]
Now sometimes she looks really hot and other times kind of like loop war or another time like Luke Skywalker

[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.240]
Fundamental Christianity was second the second stupidest religion in the world 255

[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.320]
Your whole business is 158

[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.060]
Santadilla 153 we are probably out of play. I bet you did the cafeteria Santoria

[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:57.360]
No, why not I forgot would it kill some good time Islam 119 oh man don't be saying that Islam

[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.240]
You got to have your own it's nice having your own flying carpet

[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.380]
I don't want to pick on it because every every one of these religious has got the most stupidity out of things that they

[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:12.600]
They get people do things by wrote no by just buying neurotic repetition whether it's hailed Mary's or falling down on the carpet

[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.500]
And do it all right flags and laying themselves with chains. That's my favorite. That didn't get on here

[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:23.660]
Oh shintoism is last place only two because nobody knows what that is right Islam 119 Catholicism 70

[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.880]
But you better admire all the chakis there the beads or all the

[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.840]
Oh man a chain there. It's great

[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.040]
Christianity 62 just not including of course well run to the bill like it's just run to the ordinary

[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.820]
Ordinarily in Christianity where we don't have all those other bills and theory of all those and bangles and beads

[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.340]
Like the Catholic Church

[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.660]
Kabbalah cabala yeah 57 it's good enough for Brittany out to be good enough for everybody please

[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.680]
Mormon 56 and we don't have any more monocles anymore. Thanks to you keep picking on them

[00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:00.880]
We have a more leave on it's about one number one. No, yeah, huh the Mormons are great. They're nice

[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.940]
They're nice and in a crispy clean. They were nice white shirts and ties on their

[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:10.100]
Bicycles and a few other day or step right and try to give you a song and dance about Joseph Smith and Paul Rhyme in New York

[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:16.000]
Never been to Palmyra, New York. No don't you don't want to no matter who you are or where you are you don't want to go there

[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.020]
I've never been there, but I know where it is and believe me you don't want to go to even El Myron, New York is better enough

[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:26.440]
But Palmyra the Amish 33 and of course we can pick on them all we want because he can't listen to the radio

[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.860]
They can look at it. They just can't vote it. No, oh, listen to somebody else's radio

[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.980]
So if you have an array of exited in your omics, we apologize for for fucally if you hear us from the outside

[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.220]
I apologize. So need you are. Judy is in the 17th

[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.100]
Oi! You should have separated to put Orthodox Judy on my show

[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.160]
I know you're the top, okay?

[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.500]
We'll be the sisters and you should know from your former accountant there, right? I want my own gear

[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.380]
I want to forget that day when we first started on the station we surely thereafter were down in the second floor

[00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.200]
And George's accountant was in Orthodox Jew brought in the Tiffilin

[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.040]
Right, right. And practically cut off your circulation and almost kill little George right back in the studio

[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.200]
with his Tiffilin

[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.040]
Judy is in 17 Hinduism 7 which we don't know too much about at least I don't

[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.640]
All I can know is that those Indian people really smell

[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:22.100]
No, not all of them. Some of them are very... The Indian people are wonderful people just like the senator said in the Godfather 2

[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.700]
They're wonderful people but, yeah, for anything

[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.240]
Was that in Godfather 2 or 1?

[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.020]
2, that was in 2 because the senator wasn't in Godfather 1

[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.320]
I hope that was about Vegas and about the... Yes indeed

[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.940]
And then he was in bed with a hooker and they came in like...

[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.960]
I don't know what it was before, I don't know what it was

[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.940]
Buddhism 4

[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.720]
Which they were all here, I told you the... what's his name?

[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.060]
Was here a few weeks ago?

[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:46.940]
Dali Yada

[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.460]
Dali Lama was here

[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.600]
And everybody was out on the streets singing hello Dali and it was very boring

[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.260]
And they all wear the same purple things but that's sash

[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.140]
And Chintawism is in last place too with nearly 1400 votes on

[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.280]
Stupid religion which is certainly redundant, no question about that

[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.160]
Because people generally are weak and they want to be led by the Noah's and fed a son of dance

[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.320]
And you're going to live eternally with the...

[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.920]
The Muslims have the thing with the Seven Virgins all of a sudden a crap

[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.680]
Believe me, once they put your ass in a box that's it boys and girls

[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.560]
You better have a great time right now, there's no doubt about it

[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.880]
Well, how do you know any... I know, trust me

[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.880]
Thank God!

[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.600]
Noes

[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.320]
Here's today's poll

[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.800]
Well, I don't want to spend a lot of time on these ratings

[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.780]
Today's poll, I do have a choice

[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.380]
You never would have thought of it but I got a good choice

[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.780]
What do you think is the most underrated actress, movie or TV of all time?

[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.480]
You know who I picked?

[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.320]
Who'd you pick?

[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.740]
Jean Stapleton

[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.400]
Well down

[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.540]
Do you want to know why?

[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.760]
Well, I know why

[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.960]
Now, what do you think of all in the fan?

[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.620]
And I'm not saying that's all I think of a rest because she's been a lot of good things

[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:48.940]
Right

[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.920]
Which is... she's a brilliant, articular woman

[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:52.680]
Yes

[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.840]
And she speaks like a real person

[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.820]
But then again when you see all in the family, almost everybody with all in the family

[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.000]
And she always thinks of Carol O'Connor, Archie Bunker, right?

[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:00.660]
Right

[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:05.420]
And she's overlooked but her acting and that show is just fantastic

[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:05.940]
And pivotal

[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.540]
And poetic

[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.200]
She was what was all about, right?

[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.500]
Okay, well, how do you mean to say eat it anymore?

[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.340]
Oh, I'm sorry

[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.120]
I apologize

[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.140]
Jean Stapleton, you got a choice?

[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.120]
Underrated actress?

[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.400]
I'm thinking about a couple of good ones but I want to think it over

[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.520]
Okay, ponder it

[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.280]
So we'll get some more from the audience for that

[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.040]
That's our poll today

[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.360]
We're only here on 1230 so we better talk real fast

[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.300]
And play a lot of spots

[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:29.860]
What?

[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:30.860]
What?

[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.520]
Well, we got them

[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.680]
Hey, let me tell you right now boys and girls, we kicked some serious ass net book yesterday

[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.240]
We got some bonus money coming

[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.740]
We're number one

[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.880]
Come up with a set of serious bonus money coming because we...

[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.380]
And thanks to the audience again, we don't want to thank them profusely for wiring these days

[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.840]
I mean for helping us out

[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.240]
Whatever the hell it was

[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.300]
Whatever it was, we'll take it

[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.740]
Even Moan Gildey

[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.580]
Well, we don't know the hour by hour but you will in a few days I'll be on vacation

[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.940]
But you'll be able to ponder that whole thing next week when the hour next time

[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:05.200]
And pass it along and find out whether it was Mo or Joe or maybe it was we just had our Mojo work in the morning

[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.400]
And the afternoon was number one

[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:07.840]
Right?

[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.980]
And we had just a humongous age here, number one by a mile

[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.420]
Right, by threefold points

[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.240]
Alright

[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.880]
Let's see, look for the QM van today at 11 o'clock at the shell station on the street

[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.940]
Do not get gas there please, that shell gas

[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.940]
Just west of I-95, stop by to pick up a pair of tickets to see the Marlin Fille game

[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.660]
Oh, look at this, look at this

[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.860]
Oh, this Miguel man

[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.240]
Stop by to pick up a pair of tickets to see the Marlin Fille's game tonight at the Pro

[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.620]
I just finished promoting the game as it won a clock and...

[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.960]
Oh, this Miguel and not only that he's got all those free tickets he free loaded from me

[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.400]
Oh Miguel, what about your football man?

[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.820]
Yeah, that's an amazing wonder here

[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.420]
Then who did it?

[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.400]
I don't know, right?

[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.360]
Some idiot

[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.060]
You're an idiot Frank, whoever you are

[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.120]
He's a good guy

[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.700]
Well, okay, he's a good guy, he's an idiot

[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.780]
Maybe the presidency would guide out it, but he might be, but that's also an idiot

[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.280]
When you're moving or renovating, that's the best time to dial 1-800 mattress

[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.860]
Make that first-nighter dream house heavily with a brand new top quality brand name mattress from dial amatris

And dial amatris is on time, 99.7% of the time

[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.660]
Nobody's 100% perfect, but that's pretty dang close

And nobody's got a better selection of queen and king size mattress head ready for immediate delivery than dial amatris

[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.120]
1-800-MATTRES

[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.120]
And my name is Loh, this is 420-0-5-6-2-1

[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.340]
Only in the Banana Republic baby, only in Miami

[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:08.020]
Billy, time for your animal, or jeez mom, none other animal

[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.600]
Kids just hate getting animals, and mom's a giving them

[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.540]
But now there's a brand new animal that kids just love, introducing new animal animals

[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.860]
That candy coated chocolate animal that makes getting cleaned out fun

[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.480]
Hey mom, can I have another animal?

[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.360]
I don't know Billy, that makes your third animal today

[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.820]
Please, well, okay, cool, and this time I want a green one

[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.020]
Oh, sorry son, I took all the green ones

[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.140]
I did my two boys

[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.040]
New, M and animals, melts in your butt, not in your head

[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:45.400]
10, 18, and 5, 60, WQM, Happy Thursday, two years, so these two sheets, so that you just sent me a WY with these socks, we already know that

[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.780]
What is this supposed to be?

[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.020]
I don't know, my boy brought them in for me

[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.580]
Oh, I figured it was from my high boy

[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.780]
WYOD, oh I hate that station

[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:58.820]
It really is, it doesn't mean anything, just a butt out, okay, big butt out, fat boy

[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.360]
WY was he winning the tank, big time in his book

[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.320]
I mean big, big time, look at that midday

[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.960]
Midday is number one with an 8.0 share in the men's 2554R target demographic

[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.600]
And WYOD dropping like a rock

[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.340]
I can't even find him, where the hell are they?

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.600]
Oh, there they are, they're on the second page

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:26.780]
From a 6.4, number three in men in a winter rating book, in a spring book they drop all the way to a tie for 9th with a 3.6

[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:32.420]
A disaster, an unmitigated disaster, WYOD in the mornings they went through the four

[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:37.800]
And in the afternoons, the Schmidtmeister, whatever the hell his name is

[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.700]
Went from number two with a 5.9 and a winter book to a 4.9

[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:41.700]

[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]
Number two, number nine, the afternoon they're dropping off the face of the globe

[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.540]
Because all that right wing crap is falling out of fashion

[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.120]
Rush and rush light and rush junior, all about forget about it

[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.460]
And evidently everybody has

[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.440]
The lovely thing to see

[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:01.240]
Joan Blondell says somebody, well there you go, I remember that picture we had a Joan Blondell last week I think it was

[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.600]
To the week before, right?

[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.380]
It says Joan Blondell is my nominee, is the most underrated actress, very very underrated, great assets

[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.460]
And a fantastic attitude and a head of her time

[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.080]
This is the same fact she had a fact about the perky breast in the last time

[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.600]
Okay, thank you very much to Joan Blondell fan out there

[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.780]
We'll get the few for the poll

[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.960]
So we did the men the best actor last to two day

[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.760]
We could go to the two day

[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.320]
And we've been postponing this one forever

[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.400]
Never, I sure hope we get some names on here otherwise it's going to be a very limited poll if it gets my breath

[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.080]
Now let's see if this other promo is on here is as screwed up as the first one

[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.100]
Now what's the deal? When they go by the shell station a lot of the clock this morning

[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.780]
Are they going to get free tickets for this afternoon's violent league game or why?

[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.260]
I don't know

[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.260]
And during the beginning of that break I couldn't hear the...

[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.960]
I mean we're having a little bit of a rocky time here to get girls

[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.580]
Huh? That was Zach again

[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.120]
Zach again, huh?

[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.580]
The only thing I discovered about Zach here is one talent it's called eating

[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.020]
That's it, that's...

[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.340]
For example when I asked him before about the ball game thing

[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.180]
When you were on vacation everything you asked Zach you get the same answer

[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.760]
What? What is it?

[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.160]
Yeah, yeah, that's it, huh?

[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.100]
I'm busy eating, man

[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.040]
Don't be bugging me, I'm eating over here

[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.880]
He discarded those up and Josh was playing those

[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:10.700]
Right

[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.560]
What a joke

[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.900]
We gotta be good at something

[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.960]
Yeah, that's right, he's good at it man

[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.400]
He can clean the plate clean the table

[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.840]
I'll be watching him to do it here in a minute

[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.720]
Anybody drops a few crumbs on the floor he'll clean that up for you too man

[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.160]
He'll lick it right up that's what the clearance told me

[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.880]
So at any rate we got the poor Zach sitting in there he's just waiting for lunch

[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.840]
Who's bringing the food today?

[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:30.880]
How is it?

[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.740]
Oh, how is this bringing food again?

[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.200]
They're great how is we love that the bacon all the let's not over do it

[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.760]
All over getting a little tired of how is let's get to somebody else in there

[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.600]
And joint president the imported beer and QM 6 to 8 tonight to win Dixie located in a

[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.200]
67-01 Southwest 40th Street in Miami

[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.480]

The day county good luck to you

[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.440]
5 6 7 0 5 60 this is a first story before we get to these calls and names for the

[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.380]
Pull them whatever else we're gonna do in this very brief next couple of hours

[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.860]
That we got for the way time is slipping away already not bad all right

[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.600]
Oh

[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:16.380]
Man love these short shows president George W. Bush is taking powerful anti-depressant

[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:21.800]
Drugs to control his erratic behavior depression and paranoia capital Hill

[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.380]
Blue has learned this is a great website capital Hill blue and they're not

[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.520]
Like liberal and not conservative they're like right down the middle but they rip

[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.280]
Everybody who deserves it which is a lot of people

[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.320]
The prescription drugs administered by Colonel Richard J. TUB the White House

[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.380]
Position can impair the president's mental faculties and decrease both his

[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.420]
Physical capabilities and his ability to respond to a crisis administration aids

[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.840]
Admitted privately his mental faculties as limited as they already are

[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.860]
It's a double-edged sword says one a we can't even fly off the handle if this light is provocation

[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.860]
But we also need a president who is alert mentally

[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.680]
TUB prescribed the anti-depressants after a clearly upset bush

[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.760]
Stormdorf stage on July a three fusing to answer reporters questioned about his

[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:08.280]
Relationship with indicted and run executive Kenny lay keep those mother

[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.040]
Efferves away from me he screamed in an aid backstage if you can't I'll find someone who can

[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.100]
How do you like that?

[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.400]
Now how come the mainstream media hasn't been reporting this so I come

[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.820]
We have to read about this in capital Hill blue which is on our website

[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.780]
Now seriously how come the mainstream media is reporting this how come Wolf Blitzquake isn't on their

[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.020]
Shouting this from the rooftops and Dan rather and Tom broke up with his bad freaking speedsteep factor

[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:36.080]
I mean we saw the video clip of him storming off the stage and that's the end of it that's all you hear

[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.100]
Because it's bad for business it's bad for the bushmeister and for our Nazi leaders

[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.520]
Keep those mother efforts away from me he screamed if you can't I'll find someone who can

[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.540]
Bush's mental stability has become the topic of Washington whispers in recent months

[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.780]
Capital Hill blue first reported on the 4th of June 4th about increasing concern among

[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.140]
One house aides over the president's wide mood swings and obscene outbursts

[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:02.040]
This is the man who was going to bring morality and decency back to a Washington and his vice president's

[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:08.700]
Drap and f bombs and Congress in the Senate and this mother effort is Drap and mother effort words all over the place

[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.060]
I've seen out for it's how do you like that?

[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.820]
Damn it all those EOP loyalists dismissed to be ports is anti-bush propaganda

[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.720]
The reports were later confirmed by prominent George Washington University site

[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:26.140]
The kindest doctor Justin Frank in his book Bush on the couch inside the mind of the president

[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.740]
Dr. Frank diagnosed the president as a paranoid megalomaniac and untreated alcoholic

[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:38.180]
Whose lifelong streak of sadism ranging from childhood pranks like using firecrackers to explode frogs

[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:43.780]
To insulting journalists gloting over state executions and pumping his hand gleefully before the bombing of Baghdad

[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.280]
Showcase bushes instabilities in other words he's a raving lunatic

[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.920]
I just mentioned this if you think about voting this year

[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.200]
I was really very unsettled by him and I started watching everything he didn't

[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.880]
Reading what he wrote and watching him on videotape I felt he was disturbed Dr. Frank said

[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.160]
He fits the profile of a former drinker whose alcoholism has been arrested but not treated

[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:11.220]
Dr. Frank's conclusions have been praised by other prominent psychokers including Dr. James Grotsdine

[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.240]
Professor at UCLA Medical Center and Dr. Irvin Yalom

[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.180]
Shalom Yalom, MD professor emeritus at Stanford University Medical School

[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.900]
Sounds like a couple of years lost to me

[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:27.500]
The doctor is also worried about the wisdom of getting powerful anti-depressant drug to a person with an history of chemical dependency

[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.020]
You following this? Yep, Bush isn't an admitted alcoholic

[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.720]
Although we never saw treatment in a formal program and stories about his cocaine use as a younger man

[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:44.580]
Stories about his cocaine use as a younger man haunted his campaigns for Texas governor in his first campaign for president

[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.900]
President Bush is an untreated alcoholic with paranoid and megalomaniate tendencies Dr. Frank Gads

[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.180]
The White House did not return phone calls seeking comment on this article

[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.220]
Although the exact drugs Bush takes to control his depression behavior are not known

[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:04.840]
White House sources say they are powerful medications designed to bring his erratic actions under control

[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:11.960]
While Colonel Todd regularly releases a synopsis of the president's annual physical details of the president's

[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:18.140]
Health and Aid drugs and treatment emergency are not public record are guarded zealously by the secret of cagray of AIDS that surround ill president

[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.520]
Veteran White House watchers say the ability to control information about Bush's health

[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:32.400]
Either physical or mental is similar to Ronald Reagan's second term when AIDS managed to conceal a president's increasing memory lapses that single the onslaught of Alzheimer's disease

[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:41.500]
It also brings back memories of Richard Nixon's final days when the assumed resigned president wandered the halls and talked to portraits of former presidents

[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:48.500]
The stories didn't emerge until after Nixon left orifice one long time GOP consultant who for obvious reasons has not to be identified

[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.840]
So he's advising his Republican congressional candidates to keep their distance from Bush

[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:57.500]
We have to face the real pot. Oh, this is this is the best paragraph I've ever read on the air

[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.300]
Okay, I want you to open up all right ears. Okay, let me get it out open up every year

[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.800]
Orifice in your body right now and listen work clearly

[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.060]
We have to face the very real possibility that the president of the United States is loony tunes these are family

[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.100]
That's not good for my candidates. It's not good for the party and certainly not good for the country

[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.780]
That's a long time Republican political consultant who said

[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:24.920]
El Presidente is loony tunes and by the way Walter Lance and Mike Lance aren't too happy about that either

[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.360]
Wow 27 after 10 at 5. So basically public QAN

My name is local and you're a sports radio 560-C-A-U-A-M

[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.980]
The way comes where she plays

[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.500]
The okay one on the street

[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.200]
Who's like a tree had it made?

[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.480]
So do you want a day?

[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.940]
And you know who you were again?

[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.960]

Why did you want to be so late?

[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.720]
I didn't know the Ronald Rennth grade

[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.300]
The Ronald Rennth

[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.440]
Happy to be here 560-W-DQ-A-M

[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.200]
Happy Thursday we're kicking ass man

[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.340]
We're number one by 50 million miles and we'll enjoy it while it lasts

[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.700]
Another couple of months

[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.580]
Anyway Elmer says, please who's Helen Mirren?

[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.560]
Helen Mirren has been in the million movies

[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.900]
Going all the way back to the 60s

[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.940]
I stuck that on there, that was my choice

[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.180]
Jean Stable and 7, Helen Mirren 2

[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.320]
And Francis McDorman's got a pair

[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.740]
And Joan Blondell's got one

[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.160]
And Joan Allen's got none

[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.980]
Elmer says both excellent actresses who barely get any publicity

[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.360]
Joan Allen, Francis McDorman

[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.200]
We'll get a lot more names on the list eventually

[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.360]
But I got some heavy fixture for I like this fact you just sent me

[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.600]
Thanks whoever sent this in

[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.980]
And it's also from Capitol Hill Blue

[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.200]
In line with what I just read

[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.500]
Let me just read that last paragraph of the previous one before I know it's seriously

[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.220]
I just see you know what really pisses me off about the Democrats

[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.200]
This whole approach that they're using I didn't see how sharp it was last time

[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.080]
But I guess he really pushed you and asked you if I did

[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.520]
I thought you mean clear enough of it yes

[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.400]
This business of wow we don't want to appear to be shrill and make it personal

[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.600]
Bull crap, okay?

[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.140]
This is one of the problems of the Democrats

[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.160]
So this is a goody-to-shoot kind of

[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.940]
I watched Edward speech last night I'll be very honest with it was okay

[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.120]
And then the reporters come on afterward

[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.220]
Oh the crowd is an apprenzy and he really

[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.180]
Electrified the crowd

[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.140]
It was okay, I didn't say a damn thing to be honest with it

[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.660]
Right, I mean he's fine he's okay

[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.580]
He sure is better than his mother I mean his wife

[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.100]
We have to face the very real possibility that the president of the United States is

[00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.820]
Loonie Tunes says this long time Republican political consultant

[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.260]
That's not good for my candidates it's not good for the party

[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.740]
And certainly not good for the country

[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:11.220]
We're advising our Republican congressional candidates to keep their distance from the Bushmeister

[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.120]
Now Theresa Hampton and William McDamish right in the Capitol Hill blue today

[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.480]
A Sullen president George W. Bush is withdrawing more and more from AIDS and senior staff

[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:29.020]
Abu Gharr recreating into a private paranoid world where only the ardent loyalists are welcome

[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:36.180]
Cabinet officials senior White House AIDS and leaders on Capitol Hill complained privately about the increasing lack of face time with the president

[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:41.160]
And campaign advisors are worried about the depressed president may not be up to the rigors of a temporary election campaign

[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:41.640]
Good

[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.820]
Yes, there are concerns of top Republican political advisor admitted privately Wednesday

[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:54.460]
The George W. Bush we see today is not the same gregarious backslaping president of old he's moody, distrustful and withdrawn

[00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:03.440]
Bush's erratic behavior and sharp mood swings led White House position Colonel Richard tub to put the president on powerful anti-depressant drugs with his past law

[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:09.680]
This is a president known for his ability to charm people one-on-one since the staff member to House Speaker Denny Hasdard not anymore

[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:18.080]
White House AIDS say Bush is retreated into a tightly controlled environment where only top political advisors like Carl Rove and Kiran Hughes are allowed

[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.500]
Even White House chief of staff and new card complaints he has less and less access to the president

[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:31.940]
Among cabinet members only Attorney General John Ascroft a fundamentalist lunatic who shares many of Bush and strict religious convictions remains part of the inner circle

[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:38.860]
White House AIDS called Bush and Ascroft the blue brothers because like the mythical movie characters both believe they're on a mission from God

[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.360]
Homeland Security Secretary Tom Rage demand most responsible for waiting America's war on terrorism

[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.400]
Complaints to staff that he gets very little time with a president gets most of his marching orders lately from Ascroft

[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:57.720]
Some on religious staff write privately that Ascroft is Bush's him or a reference to Heinrich Himmler chief of the SS under Adolf Hitler

[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:06.220]
Too many make the mistake of thinking Dick Cheney's the real power of Bush administration says one senior Homeland Security they're wrong

[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.620]
It's Ascroft and that is reason enough for all of us to be very very afraid

[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.940]
How do you like that it's Ascroft be afraid be very afraid

[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.360]
Wow

[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:21.100]
While Vice President Cheney remains part of Bush's tight inner circle defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld has fallen out of favor

[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:27.500]
Tells his staff that no matter what happens in November I'm out of here good be afraid be very afraid

[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.540]
Speaking of Heinrich Himmler, there's a Hermann Gehring for he's out of here

[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:36.220]
White House AIDS say the West Wings been overtaken by a siege mentality where phone calls and emails are monitored

[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.200]
And everyone is under suspicion for disloyalty to the crown

[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.680]
I was questioned about an email I sent out on my personal email account from Holmes has one staff member

[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:50.660]
When I asked how they got access to my personal email account I was told that when I came to work at the White House I gave up any right to privacy

[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.560]
Another staffer was questioned why she once stated to register Democrat

[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.840]
He voted for Bush in 2000 she said but that didn't seem to matter

[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.480]
Mary Madeline is married to James Carvella and that's all right

[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.860]
But suddenly my royal royalties questioned because a former boyfriend was a Democrat

[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.900]
Madeline a Republican political operative and advisor to the Bush campaign is the wife of former

[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.240]
Clinton about political strategist the bald head of James Carvella

[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.600]
Sorry he's a little bit loony tuned

[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.380]
Okay let's get some access to John here and not get so heavy duty

[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.120]
And we find out are we given Marlon tickets away from the staff news game or not?

[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.360]

[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.440]

[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:05.440]

[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.500]
It's going to be a disaster

[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.840]
What do I think of the Ricky situation?

[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.060]

I'm tired of hearing

Maybe we should have paid attention a little bit more to the facts we chose to ignore

[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:53.140]

He said sadly this long time Republican political consultant

[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.420]
That's not good for my candidates it's not good for the party

[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.900]
It's certainly not good for the country is what he said

[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.700]
I just thought I'd mention it again like on every break

[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.720]
Of course some of us are totally surprised by that

[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.040]
Somebody says Linda Blair which is interesting because we were just a listing

[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.680]
And I was watching her this morning on screen TV with everything about us

[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.660]
This is just one two three I corrected their spelling for the poll

[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:15.120]
Oh okay Linda Blair it says does Gellie qualify for your poll?

[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.500]
Because I'll change my voter for you

[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.700]
Gellie don't be qualifying okay you don't have the right parts

[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.600]
Is that what that Israel mode tells me?

[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.320]
Anyway Homeland Security Authority shut down the Port of Palm Beach

[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.220]
And evacuated surrounded neighborhoods yesterday after polly stopped two men of Middle Eastern descent

[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.700]
Who were driving from the seaport authority said

[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.820]
And they smiled by Curry is what I'm hearing

[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.520]
My kid Curry

[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.060]
FBI agents question the men and released them because they've been misidentified

[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.480]
And done absolutely nothing wrong in agency spokesman said

[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.900]
But of course we always are wondering are you sure?

[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.140]
We hope at the end of the day this will turn out to be just a very good exercise

[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.740]
Revivore of each mayor Michael Brown be saying

[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.320]
The incident started about 3 30 yesterday afternoon

[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.740]
My review of a speech police pulled over a car speeding in the 1700 block of old Dixie highway

[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.080]
The car carried three men to a Middle Eastern descent police said

[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.700]
Middle Eastern oh my god

[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.980]
Police ran a background check and the Arabic name of the driver popped up on a terrorist watch list

[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:15.640]
It popped up as a person of interest by law enforcement police spokesman Roseanne Brown said

[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.780]
When question further the men appear to evasive and change their answers to the same question

[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.880]
It just raised a lot of suspicions men told police

[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.980]
They have left three containers at the port considered one of the country's biggest terrorist targets

[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.720]
Along with the next door F.P.N.L. generating station

[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.200]
That's when the US Coast Guard closed down the port

[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:39.120]
Television stations broke in after ntalk shows to evoke the T-word

[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.280]
Had terrorist returned to the same county traversed by 12 of 19 men involved in the 9-11 attacks

[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.180]
Apparently the answer is no

[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:46.840]
Apparently not

[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:53.280]
By 5 p.m. law enforcement officials announced that the men in question was not the person on the terrorist list

[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.000]
By 6.15 they reopened the port

[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.520]
The men were US citizens of Jordanian descent who were shipping furniture by boat to the US Virgin Islands

[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.380]
How do you like that?

[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.220]
The FBI would not release their identities because they didn't do nothing wrong

[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:08.640]
And they don't want to have like a whole bunch of you folks out there chasing down just because they happen to be from Jordan

[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.840]
And a bunch of brown skin Arabs

[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.140]
Right? Right

[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.220]
So leave me alone

[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.820]
Where are they? For the time being

[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.360]
Mother up there somewhere in Jupiter

[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.520]
5.670560

[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.640]
Maybe we'll get some more names for our poll today the most underrated actress or maybe not

[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.540]

It's about all the Ben and Jerry's ice cream that you're selling in the grocery store

Put in a pile and burned it and replaced the hog in the odds

[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.580]
Because he says Ben and Jerry's supports some sort of advertising of that

[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.720]
Well I've lost 11.5 pounds in the ice cream so we don't really care

[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.920]

[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.460]

And all these people have to get his convention and they get really loud or

[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.920]
It really blows me away that people get so excited over this

[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.820]

This guy's all bent out of shape because people aren't getting whipped up enthusiastic about something that they care about

And I don't I don't want to hear anymore whining complaining okay

[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:48.880]
Fine choice.

If anybody were to say, give me the top 10 actresses of all time,

[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.460]
very few people would say, Tad your shower.

[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.020]
But Rocky, the Godfather, all three parts.

[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:57.700]
Yep.

[00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.560]
Now they will fear you.

[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.480]
She's great.

[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.280]
What else do we like her in?

[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.420]
She's in the know a few things.

[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:06.580]
Yes, she has.

[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:07.140]
But I forget.

[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.660]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.320]
I'm so glad I asked.

[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.460]
Well, no, I don't know.

[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:12.900]
I can't remember.

[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.700]
I've seen her around the blind.

[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.200]
Really things.

[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:15.620]
We could do.

[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:16.700]
Good old Connie.

[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:19.060]
1056.

[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.700]
And what about, what's her name?

[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:21.380]
Diane Keaton.

[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.140]
Is she underrated?

[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.900]
No, she's highly rated.

[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:25.920]
Yeah.

[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.320]
That's why I ask.

[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.920]
Because these seven people would say, well, how about Fei Dunway?

[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:30.500]
Well, of course not.

[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.360]
She's highly rated.

[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.840]
In fact, maybe in some cases, a little overrated.

[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.240]
Oh, I love Fei Dunway.

[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.060]
She was great at network.

[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.200]
But then again, I'm the only person who ever saw that movie.

[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:39.740]
Right?

[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:43.080]
I don't even know why I keep talking about network and how it feel and all that.

[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.520]
One of the great movies ever of all time.

[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.920]
And none of you can post out there.

[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:47.280]

[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.480]
Love it all too.

[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.300]
That's all those by the way that Franks you sent me.

[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.280]
It's interesting the practice tank connection with Mohammed Ahtah and the money that was

[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.920]
wired in 9-11 all this other stuff.

[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:29.780]
But it's an old spur.

[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:30.720]
Thank you very much anyway.

[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.120]
And I don't have to go back to the other four pages.

[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.660]
No, please don't.

[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:38.040]
I just had something extraordinarily important to pass along and just slipped my mind.

[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:41.440]
It was just like the end of the world it was so name important and it just slipped away.

[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.800]
Oh, and here's something important.

[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.020]
Don't forget to join George's this Saturday to report a repo motorsport segue.

[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:51.380]
A block north of San Colerwood on Dixie highway registered when a free segue human transportation device

[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.400]
not much you need the only one on your blocked ab one.

[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.260]
QMQDs will be there plus food provided by Atlantic City Sub-Turret Hour used to make the difference.

[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.020]
I'm here in a room or even here in Toronto that I was no longer in Atlantic City Sub.

[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.100]
Did you know that?

[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.100]
Cannot possibly be true.

[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.520]
Gene stapled and is kicking some serious ass.

[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.260]
You go eat it.

[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:13.480]
Oh, I shouldn't have said that was accurate.

[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:15.280]
88 votes.

[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:18.420]
Gene stable in 46 Francis McDormand 14.

[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.000]
And I was underrated actress radio or TV all time.

[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.220]
Helen Mirren 12th.

[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.100]
Joan Blondell 6th.

[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.300]
Tadja Shares got four already.

[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.280]
We love Tadja Shares.

[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.700]
Joan Allen 3, Linda Blair 3 and it's nobody else got nothing.

[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:30.920]
567 05 60.

[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:34.900]
Count 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.800]
Don't forget the very wildly popular Florida Marlins at 1230 with a pregame show.

[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.840]
Phillies at the Marlins at 105 is if Marlins will wrap up a four game sweep.

[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:43.940]
Well, I know what it was.

[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.500]
I was going to look during the break on the radar.

[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:47.460]
Look out the window that sitting right there by it.

[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.280]
Oh, look at that.

[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:54.240]
Well, I just don't want any thunderstorms that are developing around 12 o'clock or 1215.

[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.920]
So we wind up with some kind of old against been called off.

[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.060]
They're going to play that game if they have to wait till midnight.

[00:50:59.060 --> 00:50:59.540]
All right.

[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:07.740]
Because I'm sure that Dave Ann Boring will just absolutely tickle your fancy with some assimilating story before the ballgame.

[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.760]
We are like a long rangel.

[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.420]
I think like a good long nap would be good.

[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.420]
WDQ Ann, hello.

[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.560]
WDQ Ann, hello.

[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.500]
I have the absolute definitive answer, Neil, for the ball question.

[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.060]
Absolutely.

[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:21.600]

[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.120]
Michelle Nichols, O'Houra from Star Trek.

[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:31.640]
Just think of all the years she had that little thing in her ear, always trying to handle Starfleet command.

[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.840]
That was unrecognized genius.

[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:35.660]
Fun?

[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:36.780]
Dailyable.

[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.400]
Okay, whatever you say.

[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.800]
Got it?

[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.840]
Oh, whatever that was.

[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:41.980]
Natalie Portman.

[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:42.960]
No, it says just kidding.

[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.260]
Seriously, Emma Thompson.

[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.200]
I'll put Natalie Portman under what's wrong with that?

[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.460]
Yeah, put him both under Natalie Portman and Emma Thompson.

[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.420]
Why is that just kidding?

[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.540]
I don't understand that.

[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.700]
But that's okay.

[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.720]
Just to help you kill a little bit of boredom, that's what we're trying to do because...

[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.780]
I have no right to say that.

[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:57.540]
We can empathize.

[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.900]
Those of us who spent a lot of time in Starfleet Da far too much time.

[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.100]
Michael Jackson accused him of imprisoning Boy and making video.

[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:07.760]
Do you see this?

[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:08.180]
Yes.

[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.280]
Talk about it yesterday?

[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:09.980]
No.

[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.100]
Then I will now.

[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.300]
A prosecutor said to get a pop star Michael Jackson enticed the young boy that imprisoned him

[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.600]
and his family and forced him to make a video absolving him of molestation claims.

[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:25.260]
The fire-read court presentation by Deputy District Attorney Gordon Ockin-Claus wasn't

[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:28.760]
at the Jackie Kennedy family, the Ockin-Claus wasn't at them?

[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.640]
I thought that was that thing that you and Zach were talking about.

[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.460]
No, no, seriously, that was their name.

[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.360]
That was her maiden name.

[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:41.460]
Jacklyn Bouvier Ockin-Claus or somebody who...

[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:42.620]
Somebody tell us who that is.

[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.340]
Offie Coleman?

[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.180]
Shut up.

[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:45.780]
Company.

[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:51.980]
This seriously, that man is as useless as Humano's breast on a ballpoint pen.

[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:58.700]
Attorney District Attorney Gordon Ockin-Claus disclosed for the first time the prosecution's theory of its conspiracy case against Jackson.

[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:03.420]
Clinton, he panicked after a TV show threatened to destroy his career by linking him with obsession with young boys.

[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.520]
Ockin-Claus made his allegation of the hearing about the defense most to dismiss the case.

[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:13.220]
The fact that Mr. Jackson rationalized this behavior on national television was his downfall Ockin-Claus.

[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:19.780]
It represented a complete and utter ruin of his empire, made him an object of an international loathing and scorn.

[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:26.580]
Ockin-Claus said that Jackson said his private jet to take the family to his Neverland ranch and worse them away to vacations and luxury resorts.

[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:34.060]
Defense attorney Thomas Mesero Jr. derided the entire prosecution cases absurd on its face and demanded dismissal ball charges.

[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.160]
Jackson was not in court.

[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:41.960]
In a TV documentary broadcast in February 2003, Jackson defended his habit of letting children sleep in his bed as sweet.

[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.420]
And non-social, the accuser was seen in the video.

[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:46.140]
You're taken to be.

[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:56.260]
Ockin-Claus detailing a number of the over-adxing the indictment which have been kept secret until now suggests that Jackson actually lured the alleged victim to his bed after the video was shown on television.

[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:03.300]
The person Jackson perceived could put out public relations fire with John Doe and his family to prosecute her, said referring to the alleged victim.

[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:11.900]
If he could get them on tape describing Mr. Jackson as a wonderful person that would quell this fire, Ockin-Claus had then Jackson then began to witness the young boy with booze.

[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.880]
Everybody wants to get saved and live forever drink somebody Jesus to.

[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.840]
Clicce of it for a squeeze.

[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:20.840]
Exactly.

[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.060]
Right out of Jesus to a toe cheese.

[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.000]
5, 6, 7, 0.

[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.580]
I wonder if Jesus had toe jam, you think?

[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.800]
Are you kidding or they're all back in the day man?

[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.840]
No, it's sandals and back in those days where name like nasty sandals walking around in the desert.

[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:33.440]
Golly.

[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:34.040]
Who?

[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:36.020]
Probably had corns too.

[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.200]
How long is it going?

[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.280]
Too bad they didn't have Dr. Shoals back in the day.

[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:43.120]
WQA Am Hello.

[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.960]
You know I got one for you Paul.

[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:45.720]
Yes sir.

[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.900]
Paul Dez from the Chambalona world.

[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:57.960]
Is Dave Endware ready yet?

[00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:59.680]
How about the moves to you? Is he ready?

[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.260]
WQA Am Hello.

[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000]
I know how are you?

[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:04.720]
I'm great.

[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.680]
Do you like James Garner as an actor?

[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.040]
He's okay.

[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.800]
Did you see him in that movie?

[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:11.980]
The notebook is pretty good.

[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:12.540]
No.

[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.220]
Especially the very handle and they both die together.

[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:16.160]
That's pretty good.

[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.080]
Oh don't do that now.

[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:19.580]
Okay.

[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.240]
I guess nobody else is going to see it now either.

[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.500]
What does that have to do with anything?

[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.900]
I guess we're going back to Lassooth again, doing the actors again.

[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.280]
In fact, he should have been on there.

[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.280]
I thought a somebody else should have been on it.

[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.240]
Let's last weekend, it slipped my mind.

[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.180]
Oh you know who it was?

[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.040]
I give up.

[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.080]
Because we did that before with the thing with the actors.

[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:36.960]
Joseph Cotton.

[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:37.560]
Yeah.

[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.500]
I realize that's only for old parts like me and Volka Brian,

[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:41.680]
all of you know who that is.

[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:42.100]
Yeah.

[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:43.900]
You don't agree?

[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.640]
No, I like Josie Cotton.

[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:46.700]
I'm saying that song Johnny.

[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:47.760]
No, no, no, seriously.

[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:49.700]
Joseph Cotton, you know who that is.

[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:50.460]
I do.

[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:54.880]
He was in lots and lots of great movies and he was a fabulous, fabulous actor.

[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:58.260]
And yet if you ask people to top 10, 20 actors of all time,

[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.460]
probably almost nobody would mention Joseph Cotton,

[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.780]
because most of us remember that our did.

[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.120]
Somebody QAM Hello.

[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:05.620]
Neil?

[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:06.520]
Yes sir.

[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:07.860]
Neil, how are you today?

[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:08.940]
Sensational.

[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.380]
Go ahead, my...

[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.060]
Same...

[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.860]
Same here I'm not happy to add.

[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.700]
I have nothing but compliments and good news for you buddy.

[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.300]
Okay.

[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.680]
Hey, I'm heading out of South Florida.

[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.760]
All I do enjoy coming down here occasionally.

[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.760]
B, I'm literally like north of Cocoa Beach

[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.920]
and still getting your signal pretty well,

[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:27.960]
which is kind of a rarity.

[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.740]
I don't know, maybe the wind is blowing on the right direction.

[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:33.460]
No, George Corsa went out there and peed on the tower over last weekend.

[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.280]
No, I've still got you clear as a proverbial bell.

[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:38.560]
That's why it's coming in so good.

[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.500]
And I had to ask a little bit of what I'm hearing.

[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.040]
Well, places heading back to a hot topic of the day today.

[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:47.680]
South Carolina.

[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.560]
Oh boy, don't get me no Ben and Jerry's there man.

[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:55.340]
Actually the truth about South Carolina is I'll give you a couple examples.

[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:59.760]
I was in New York State, not too popular in the rural stopping ground.

[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:01.180]
Buffalo Rochester area.

[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.660]
Oh, don't say Buffalo and Rochester in the same breath please.

[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.800]
This Rochesterians get a very peered about that.

[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:09.540]
Yeah, it's all my brother lives there so an engine.

[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:15.960]
And you know, a New York state, you can't use a cell phone in Florida,

[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.360]
you can't smoke in a bar.

[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:21.460]
You know, what thing about South Carolina is we may burn across or two,

[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:25.300]
but you know there's still a few civil liberties that they still allow us to have.

[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:29.580]
So you know, you know, they only did was they stepped into some of those civil liberties

[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:31.980]
you're talking about for things like civil rights and things like that.

[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.340]
So you know, it's good for that.

[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.980]
You know, you know, it's given take.

[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:36.840]
Yeah.

[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.560]
And lastly, my vote for underrated actress.

[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:42.380]
Yes.

[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:46.720]
I mean, she's more known for her popularity, I guess other than her acting,

[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:51.500]
actressing ability, but can I add a math name into the list?

[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:52.740]
Oh, not her.

[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:53.500]
No, no thanks.

[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.580]
I knew it would end sooner or later.

[00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.640]
Jennifer Tilly or Amanda Plummer.

[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:00.700]
I put them both on there.

[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.840]
Okay, two good choices there I would say.

[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:08.220]
No, Kim DeKristhover Plummer or Liquid Plummer.

[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:13.360]
567 or Mr. Plummer, pound 560 on a 18T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.840]
Don't forget we got the Marlin Game of 1230 pregame.

[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:19.700]
You got the Humper after the game, the 7th known from whatever the game ends till 7th.

[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.480]
Then we got the Brock Solid.

[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.860]
They set it at 7 to 10, which we apologize profusely for that,

[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:26.600]
because you don't belong on the year for 10 seconds.

[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.740]
And any chance at 10 o'clock tonight, a star set it on up for you,

[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:31.880]
including the ballgame on there.

[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.020]
And they will play that game.

[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:33.720]
Trust me.

[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.240]
It may be raining like buckets full wherever the hell you are.

[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:37.560]
We don't care, all right?

[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.420]
Don't play the whole game in a rain.

[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:40.780]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:41.960]
Yeah, Neil, please.

[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:42.800]
Speaking.

[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:43.820]
Neil.

[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.900]
I'll nominate Louise Fletcher.

[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:48.960]
Oh, what a good choice.

[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:49.580]
Okay.

[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:50.460]
I love her.

[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:50.860]
Thank you.

[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:51.180]
Uh-huh.

[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.940]
Louise Fletcher, that's a magnificent choice.

[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:53.640]
Nurse Ratchet.

[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:55.040]
I'm sorry, Miss Ratchet.

[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.920]
She was Nurse Ratchet, but he called her Miss Ratchet, right?

[00:58:58.020 --> 00:58:58.260]
She did.

[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:00.340]
And now he was firing on her ass.

[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:02.380]
And that was so that that's my favorite scene in that movie.

[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.860]
Well, no, there's so many great scenes.

[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:05.740]
Can't pick just one.

[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:06.480]
Do you see fruit?

[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:08.180]
Yes, I do.

[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:08.640]
That was good.

[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.100]
And of course, I want my singer with Miss Ratchet.

[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.380]
Chesswick, he just died.

[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:13.920]
What a shame.

[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:18.560]
And so did Jason Miller, who played this morning on Scream TV.

[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:19.800]
You heard the audio out of that thing.

[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.660]
I was watching about the Exorcist, all three movies.

[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:26.120]
And the interview Jason Miller played father Damien Curris, or guess what, he died too.

[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:27.980]
A lot of that going around.

[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.900]
I've lost 11 and a half pounds in last three weeks and two days.

[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.960]
And down to 188, man, I'm feeling great.

[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:33.540]
I'm doing it.

[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.320]
My blood sugar was sensational.

[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.060]
I'm eliminated almost all my blood sugar medication to take like a half a pill.

[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:43.000]
And my blood pressure was fantastic and sensational.

[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:47.400]
By the time I get back to town, the end of August, I'm going to be a shadow of my former self.

[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:52.000]
And people like Zach and Fat Boy and Beast like that are going to say, oh gee, how did you do that?

[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.120]
Well, my mother died is what it was.

[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.340]
So there's something to think about, George.

[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:57.980]
Uh-huh.

[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:59.140]
I think you know what I'm all done.

[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.780]
But I'm sure you have many other neuroses.

[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.700]
George saw that story about the least baby food with a rice and a wistening gtube.

[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.020]
I didn't happen a couple of years ago.

[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.740]
We don't do baby food.

[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.920]
But it's good to start it.

[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.240]
1113 at 560 WQM.

[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.380]
Hey, the deals are heating up now.

[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.760]
And the 2004 model year is winding down.

[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.340]

They're fantastic to business with.

[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.320]
Their service departments have been laid to late.

Locked up.

[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.240]
Locked up.

[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:00.640]
Locked up.

[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.180]
Maltes do it live.

[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.820]
In court, she will strive.

[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:31.060]
She'll be in the house.

[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:34.800]
She'll be in the house.

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:34.800]

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:34.800]

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:34.800]

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:34.800]

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:34.800]

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:34.800]

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:34.800]

[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:34.800]

[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:58.400]
She'll be in the house.

[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.780]
She'll be in the house.

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:04.780]

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:04.780]

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:04.780]

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:04.780]

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:04.780]

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:04.780]

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:04.780]

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.440]
She'll be in the house.

[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.780]
She'll be in the house.

[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.200]
She'll be in the house.

[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:14.760]
She'll be doing top.

[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.260]
She'll be doing top.

[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.960]
One of the 19 to 560s, that was going to be another great one for our poll.

[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.900]
How did we take this long to get to this?

[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.720]
Let me give you a clue.

[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.360]
Ellen Burston.

[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:32.900]
Of course.

[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.240]
She's Burston.

[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:35.560]
How could we forget her?

[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.160]
Out of sight, out of mind.

[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:38.400]
One of the best.

[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.960]
Speaking of the exorcist, see how the exorcist keeps coming back over and over again.

[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.420]
You can't get away from that baby.

[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:46.320]
Linda Blair is mourning on Scream TV.

[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.560]
Then we have somebody nominate the Linda Blair for the thing we're doing here.

[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:51.080]
Right?

[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:52.360]
Right.

[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.440]
How come I can't for all there it is, it's under EX.

[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.340]
Sorry, no.

[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.820]
I beg your pardon?

[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.880]
I'm choking on my sandwich here.

[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.140]
Well, maybe we need an exorcism.

[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.120]
If you're born to tears this weekend, go to a...

[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:12.980]
Yes, syndicated.

[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:13.460]
What's that?

[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.620]
Go to one of those video stores.

[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.700]
Do not go to Blockbuster because we hit them like poison in the end of the movies.

[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.680]
And they censor all of your crap.

[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.700]
But go to a real video store and pick up the exorcist.

[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.340]
Do not get exorcist 2 or 3 God forbid.

[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.280]
George C. Scott plays the Elegia Cobbroll in the Exorcist 3, which really pisses me off.

[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.040]
Because George C. Scott, who used to be a great actor, then became a real...

[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:35.820]
Is he dead, I hope?

[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.060]
Yes.

[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:38.100]
Is he?

[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:39.900]
Right, we talked about it.

[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:40.760]
Oh, good.

[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:44.140]
Because I mean, that's a terrible thing to say, but I'm just...

[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:44.980]
I got tired of him.

[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.960]
And what was his Trish van der Van der Mir, van der Veeer, whatever his wife's name,

[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.140]
the young broad that he murdered?

[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:51.840]
Van der Mir.

[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.880]
And he just...

[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.240]
He became a legend in his own mind.

[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.600]
He just got to be really very marginal.

[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:01.260]
And for him to play a role that was played by Elegia Cobb,

[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:04.760]
the time that he did Exorcist 3, but now George C. Scott is...

[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.820]
So what comes around goes around.

[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.440]
He ain't no lead-j-cobb.

[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:08.940]
I'm not sure what anybody...

[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.700]
Oh, you couldn't say that.

[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.600]
George C. Scott won the great actor's of all time.

[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.400]
Yeah, your mama.

[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.360]
He was good in the hospital and Patton.

[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.040]
And what was the movie with that really cheesy movie Reds?

[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:19.560]
Was that it?

[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.720]
I never saw Reds with Warren Beatty.

[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.660]
No, no, maybe it wasn't Reds.

[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:28.780]
It was the one with Timothy Hutton, where he was a military school.

[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.120]
Oh, Dips.

[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.740]
Taps, hats, reds, blues, whatever.

[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.720]
Everybody was in that one.

[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:34.360]
Tom Cruise.

[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:35.880]
He was...

[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.480]
I don't know.

[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:37.740]
Oh, he was also...

[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.400]
Yeah, the porn movie.

[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.440]
The porn movie he was in.

[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.480]
He was in a firestarter.

[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.520]
No, it was the porn movie he was in, where his daughter was in a hardcore.

[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:44.400]
Hardcore.

[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:44.920]
Hardcore, very good.

[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.340]
We liked George C. Scott until he became a fool.

[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.900]
He became a fat and sloppy and a real fool.

[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.820]
But when you get fat and sloppy, people like laugh at you, you know what I mean?

[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:53.200]
Exactly.

[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:54.720]
Exactly.

[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.740]
Chris B. Cream, speak of that.

[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:58.500]
I don't like Getsack.

[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.040]
Oh, I hear Jennifer Jason leave somebody.

[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.100]
Says, get that on the right away.

[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:01.600]
She's on the right.

[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:01.740]
She's on the right.

[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:04.360]
Chris B. Cream, facing SEC probe.

[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.220]
Now, how many donuts do you think are like in a box?

[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:09.280]
Are there like a dozen?

[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.240]
Depends on the box, but typically, yeah.

[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.520]
And a Chris B. Cream box.

[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.340]
I bet you, if you brought a dozen, Chris B. Cream's in there right now.

[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:17.540]
The Josh could eat him by noon.

[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:18.920]
If he was here.

[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:20.060]
Where'd he go?

[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:21.760]
To the baseball game.

[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:24.440]
I mean, I was saying...

[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.560]
I mean, I was saying Josh was in there.

[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.680]
By then, what will we do with the other 35 minutes?

[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:30.460]
Yeah.

[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.520]
Chris B. Cream donuts said today that the Securities and the Exchange Commission is conducting

[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:39.560]
an informal inquiry into its earnings warning and the companies repurchase their franchises.

[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.420]
How do you like that?

[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:41.880]
Not our friends at Chris B. Cream.

[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:46.840]
Chris B. Cream has no higher priority than the confidence of our shareholders, customers,

[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.420]
and employees, said Chairman and Chief Executive Scott live in good.

[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:54.920]
While we're confident in our practices, we understand and respect the SEC's responsibilities.

[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.680]
We'll continue to cooperate fully throughout this process.

[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:01.980]
In May, Chris B. Cream reported that it lost $24.4 million in the first quarter.

[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:04.560]
Its first quarterly loss is going public in 2000.

[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:08.760]
And of course, they're blaming all of this because of the high-calorie treats,

[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.320]
which the company attributes in part to the low-carb-die phenomenon.

[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.880]
People want low-carb, but supposedly before the end of the year,

[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.600]
they're coming out with low-carb donuts, supposedly.

[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.100]
Wow. Those are the taste really good.

[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.380]
What's the further you have?

[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.500]
The announcement drove its stock price down.

[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.800]
On several shareholders lawsuits, we're suddenly filed against the company

[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.380]
and morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange today,

[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:31.500]
Chris B. Cream shares were down a little over $2 or 11% at $16.65.

[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.760]
And you can buy a lot of donuts for $16.65.

[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.520]
And bring them over there to Zack.

[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.200]
He'll die with a real big smile on his purse.

[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:39.800]
Hurry.

[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:41.920]
Woffee last.

[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:42.700]
Damn.

[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.380]
That's it. Bring in a couple of dozen Chris B. Creams for Zack.

[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:46.520]
Now for anybody else,

[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:50.280]
and why don't you have a Zack attack right there in the studio, where I'm Josh's chair?

[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:53.460]
Of course, you know, when you die, you do something else under chair too,

[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:54.740]
but we don't want to get into that.

[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:55.940]
You fall.

[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:56.440]
Think into that.

[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.240]
Look at W.I.O.D. the way they're dying.

[01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.180]
Rating came out yesterday.

[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.820]
George gave me like a little thumbnail rundown in the fact that we kicked some unbelievable bloody ass

[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:06.060]
in the spring rating book, thank goodness.

[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.380]
We're number one, damn it.

[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.380]
We bet you're sweet ass.

[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.560]
Now why do I have, I thought I had this all put together here.

[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.960]
Well, I see, this is persons 25.

[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.120]
Well, we don't care about that.

[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.640]
How many women we got listening?

[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:18.700]
About 30 men.

[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.520]
We have any women listening.

[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.040]
And isn't it kind of, it's almost scandalous.

[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:27.640]
When we started on QAM with a show, we had, you know, about our 1.5 to 2 share of women

[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.200]
in 2554, which is what we usually had in I.O.D., you know, maybe a 2 share.

[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.840]
Which isn't great, right?

[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:36.860]
But women don't listen to AM radio number one, and number two, it's a sports station.

[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:41.340]
But, well, I'm going to tell you, if we got a, I don't know, when a whole book comes in,

[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:42.060]
we'll take a look at that.

[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.160]
I bet you we don't even have a 0.5 in women.

[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:45.320]
Right?

[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:52.120]
Speaking of a 0.5, your good friend, Jeff DeForest has got a 0.5 on KIFTL, a 50.

[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:53.760]
Whatever they call it, I think?

[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:54.520]
Live, 85.

[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:55.620]
Live, 85.

[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.360]
And that's how many people they got listening, 85, and some of them are alive.

[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.060]
So these ones got a 0.5.

[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.680]
And Bill O'Reilly.

[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:05.880]
The O'Reilly, I know what I was going to say before, and I forgot about it.

[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.940]
It was about Al Franken being on last night speaking of whiny people.

[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.920]
Aaron Brown, how's this for a Quinoa?

[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:18.680]
Well, Aaron Brown and Al Franken, I have never seen, ah, ah, ah.

[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.000]
Well, why do you think I have people out of Florida, come and say, ah, ah.

[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:24.020]
Good, golly Miss Molly.

[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:29.040]
A lot of people like Al Franken is a humorous, is a writer, is all of these things, but man, as a broadcaster,

[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:31.580]
even if somebody could just speak, right?

[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:38.160]
Well, even Bob Woodward seems lively compared to Al Franken with his secretary.

[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:44.600]
Holy moly, Al Franken is a whiny and just can't speak and he's not.

[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.520]
He wasn't even responding to the question there.

[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:50.120]
He went through this long pond where I thought I was going to go into a coma,

[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.820]
and then finally, even whiny Aaron Brown, while getting back to the question,

[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:55.180]
was you didn't answer Al?

[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:56.540]
Oh, man.

[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.540]
Anyway, anybody else said he was, oh, I know what we want to talk about,

[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:03.560]
which I don't know if you mentioned it yesterday, but Paul and Nancy had run.

[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:04.460]
They suck.

[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:07.200]
Huh?

[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.140]
You're slushed?

[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.780]
Yeah, I'm going to mention that after the, I want to talk just a little bit about this,

[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.600]
because it's not a trend, it's a full rating book, and I know the audience out there

[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.720]
love and don't give a flying craft.

[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.180]
I mentioned it in passing, wouldn't it?

[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.800]
Right, Paul and Old Ron, even Jinks and Tinks, they're from Jacksonville,

[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.860]
and they're like, the advice guys, even Lexington Schmecks,

[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:28.540]
pinch red, even they'd be that Paul and Old Ron, that's quite a, that's quite a day in the,

[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:29.560]
out of the box, yeah.

[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.820]
Right out of the box, which is, what's in the box?

[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.140]
26th past 11 at 5, 60 W, come on, by the way, Ben Affleck,

[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:39.980]
and all those rumors about Ben Affleck and Matt Damon,

[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.260]
it's because I got a call they told me, I'm already through there true,

[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.340]
no, I didn't start them.

[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.680]
No, they're true.

[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.040]
Okay, I'm positive.

[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.820]
I mean, Ben Affleck, who's been all over the Democratic Convention like a stink on Schmitt,

[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.080]
I mean, he's been, he's just a flamer.

[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.080]
When you, when you see these phony celebrity romances, like,

[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:00.480]
somebody will tell us also who Nick Carter supposedly was hanging with here lately,

[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.520]
he was going to, well, marry, I don't remember who was, ridiculous thing.

[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.840]
Nick Carter, floats like a butterfly,

[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:08.880]
stinks like a Ben Affleck, huh?

[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.000]
Things like a thing?

[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:10.640]
Yeah.

[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.100]
Hey, if you're tired of hearing about the low-carb epidemic that's going on,

[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.860]
I know certainly that people at Krispy Kremey too happy about it.

[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.760]
If you try to cook for it and then wasted money,

[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.980]
hated the food and didn't even get the results you were looking for,

[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:24.700]
we've talked you about balance for life for some time now as a very intelligent alternative.

[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.900]
They've come with an unbelievable way.

[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.380]
They're able to afford the program for five dollars off the regular daily price.

[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.300]
Now, this is not a special list, this is for real.

[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.700]
A lifetime membership, too, balanced for life.

[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:39.100]
Anytime you want to enjoy their service, you can resign at the membership price.

[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.860]
What if I told you that you could have a company prepare you three delicious meals

[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:44.320]
and two great snacks every day?

[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:48.920]
What if I told you that all the meals are based on the successful zone diet by Brian Sears?

[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.300]
What if I told you to even deliver right to your doorstep?

[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.140]
What if I told you that they give you a menu so you can make your own choices?

[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:56.220]
And by the way, they're the only company that does that.

[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.720]
What if I told you that you will lose weight, that you will lower your cholesterol,

[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:03.340]
that you will lower your blood pressure and it will help your diabetes as well?

[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.340]
It may sound good to me, too, but it is true because we got loads and loads of people in this audience

[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:10.520]
and all over the place who are losing weight like crazy with balance for life.

[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.180]
In fact, people on balance for life are losing an average of 15 pounds a month.

[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.280]
You could sure afford to lose 15 pounds a month.

[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:16.960]
Couldn't you, Zach?

[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:17.980]
Yep.

[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:19.140]
So why?

[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.940]
You are such a fat turd.

[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:29.140]
Why wait, call right now, toll free, call 1-866-225-4543.

[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:36.680]
That's 1-866-225-4543 or even easier, check them on the web at balanceforlife.com.

[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.180]
We are sports radio fighters.

[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:42.800]
UAM.

[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:45.960]
Seven-night on CBS.

[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.860]
Eat it, it is back from the dead.

[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.640]
It's the 20th anniversary of all in the family.

[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.540]
Oh, looky death.

[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.840]
If you name John Jallow-Weez.

[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.240]
Daddy, don't be such a pro.

[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.880]
See, now what have happened to my little girl?

[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.080]
Look at you.

[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.800]
Why don't you push yourself away from the table, huh?

[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:05.820]
Maybe you have a salad once in a while.

[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:10.420]
Daddy, don't you know how many the worst people have never had a decent meal?

[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.640]
Again, with its charity Spirits.

[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.140]
Well, it's true.

[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.760]
So why don't you send them the bones from the turkey your head for breakfast?

[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.900]
I want a bowl.

[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.940]
Oh, I feel warm and happy.

[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:23.940]
Oh, gee!

[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.460]
I feel good!

[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.460]
Do you think that you are, gee, was pushing up days?

[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.020]
Oh, no, I want you.

[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:34.040]
The land's definitely so with all the bad trees.

[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.580]
You seem so bad to me.

[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.640]
Who was it back there, baby?

[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:40.220]
It was today, you know, he didn't get me in a bid.

[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.200]
Like playing a hammer, sorry, all in the family.

[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.660]
Seven-night on CBS.

[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:49.100]
Rock to you by IBS Home Carstine in school,

[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.460]
where you can learn auto mechanics,

[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:52.620]
deadly dance.

[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.520]
Oh, that's it.

[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.940]
You guys will show more fair.

[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:58.840]
They love Jean Stamble not hitting it right now.

[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.520]
It's 11.30.30.QA, and we got less than an hour to go.

[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:02.740]
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:03.940]
Till tomorrow I'm free game show.

[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.200]
I'm looking at the Miami radar, and we got good news.

[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:07.900]
Oh, right.

[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.460]
Oh, yeah, I just came up from the outside.

[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.100]
Well, not outside, but, you know, by a window.

[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:11.800]
Right.

[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:12.460]
Blue skies.

[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:13.540]
It's fine.

[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:14.180]
Blue skies.

[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.360]
The game is on, baby.

[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.260]
In fact, the huge blob arena went through it.

[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.700]
It's like heading for Cuba right now.

[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.920]
I think it's going to take a big dump right on Fidel's ass.

[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:25.720]
And off to the east and southeast, it's like,

[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.780]
just a little scattered smear over like the Bahamas here,

[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:30.540]
and nothing.

[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.160]
Because I'm looking at the old fruit loop on there right now.

[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.080]
No more tickets at the Shell Station.

[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.100]
You can forget about that.

[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.980]
Don't forget to join Presidenti imported beer and QM today.

[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.600]
6-8 at the Wind Dixie tonight.

[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.220]
67-01 South-40th Street Miami stop by to spin the wheel for more Marlin tickets.

[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:46.480]
And other prizes.

[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:49.180]
6 o'clock tonight at Wind Dixie at 67th Bird Road.

[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.340]
And thank you, whoever affects this information in.

[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.640]
Hugh Okenklaus was the step brother of Jackie,

[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:59.420]
who we at Kennedy, say, I told you, that was it all in the family.

[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:03.400]
And I think also, Gord Vidal was related somewhat,

[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.720]
because he was related to her as well.

[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:08.000]
And all those blue nose aristocrats from New England.

[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.780]
She was a slut.

[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.320]
We have to face the very real possibility that the president of the United States

[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.040]
is looming tunes, as a long time,

[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.360]
as a view of people of a political consultant,

[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.620]
who, for obvious reasons, asked not to be identified.

[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.720]
That's not good for my candidates.

[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.800]
It's not good for the party.

[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.160]
And certainly not good for the country.

[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:24.860]
He said, in other words,

[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.820]
and they're giving them all kinds of medication

[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.680]
to try to calm his ass down.

[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.340]
During the break there, I heard my cell phone ringing in the other room.

[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.620]
I thought, who would have what would be calling me?

[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.460]
And I go in there and look at the number.

[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:37.540]
It's an 800 number.

[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:38.640]
Yeah.

[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:39.620]
How about that?

[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:42.180]
Solicitors calling on my freaking cell phone,

[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:44.420]
which are very rarely used.

[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:46.380]
How do you like their maples?

[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:47.480]
They get you everywhere.

[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:47.960]
How about going?

[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.880]
Gene Stable, then, got 67.

[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.460]
Nobody's going to catch eat it.

[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.300]
Francis McDormand, 27, the most underrated actress,

[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:57.480]
movie or TV all time.

[01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.880]
Helen Mirren, 16, Natalie Portman, 10,

[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.740]
Joan Bladell, 8, Emma Thompson, 6,

[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:03.080]
Talia Sharers, got 7.

[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:05.900]
Jennifer Tilly's got the 7.

[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.060]
Linda Blair's got the 5.

[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:09.120]
Joan Allen 4.

[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.300]
Jennifer Gation Lee 4.

[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:11.120]
Linda Hamilton 3.

[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.620]
Amanda Plummer 2.

[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.100]
Penelope Ann Miller 2.

[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.540]
Ellen Verstens only got 1.

[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:16.680]
Scarlett Johnson 1.

[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.960]
Luis Pledge, you don't have any.

[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.100]
Oh my God.

[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.060]
That is scandalous.

[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.080]
Don't you think it is?

[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.860]
They probably don't know who that is.

[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:24.780]
They don't know.

[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.080]
Well, why not?

[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.060]
They're stupid.

[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:28.140]
Oh, I see.

[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.120]
5.670560, pound 560 on the 18 and T in Verizon Wireless Line,

[01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:37.440]
lost record of vote in 02 Florida Race Concerns 04,

[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:38.760]
races of concern.

[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.480]
I'm sure you talked about this.

[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:41.940]
Oh, yeah, at late.

[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:46.140]
Almost all the electronic records from the first widespread use of

[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.160]
touchscreen voting in Dave County have been lost,

[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.240]
stoking concerns that the machines are unreliable as the

[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.640]
presidential election draws near.

[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:57.680]
The records disappeared after two computer system crashes

[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.300]
last year.

[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:01.780]
County of Elections official said leaving no audit trail for

[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:04.040]
the 2002 gubernatorial primary.

[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:07.040]
A citizens group uncovered the loss earlier this month after

[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.620]
requesting all audit data from that election.

[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.480]
A county official said a new backup system would prevent electronic voting data

[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.440]
from being lost in the future.

[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:18.740]
But members of the citizens group, Miami data election reform coalition

[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:22.700]
said the malfunction understored the vulnerability of electronic voting records

[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.700]
and wiped out data that might have shed light on what problems

[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:28.140]
if any still existed with touchscreen machines in Dave County.

[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.140]
The group supplied the results of its request of the New York Times.

[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.160]
This shows that unless we do something now or it may be very well

[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.700]
be too late, Florida said it toward being the next Florida.

[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.800]
Kind of worded the well.

[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:46.680]
In other words, I said, leader Rodriguez Taseff,

[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.280]
an attorney who's chairwoman of the coalition.

[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:50.240]
Florida said it toward being the next Florida.

[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:51.500]
Alrighty then.

[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.160]
Well, as she didn't say very well,

[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.380]
in other words, it's going to be the same crap we had four hours ago.

[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.040]
That would mean that I stopped.

[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.040]
After he disputed 2000 presidential election,

[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:01.820]
anyway, Michael Moore says he's going to be scrutinizing Florida elections.

[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:02.760]
He's coming on down.

[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.260]
In fact, you better watch it, Jack, because I would stock up on

[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:09.160]
my crispy creams right now because once Michael Moore gets in town,

[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:11.080]
there won't be any leftover for you.

[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.000]
I guarantee that could be seldom told that make a fortune.

[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:14.660]
You can bet your fan ass on that.

[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.120]
Fahrenheit and I love until maker Michael Moore promised yesterday

[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.900]
to train his cameras on Florida Duck on Election Day

[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:23.440]
to prevent a repeat of what some Democrats call the

[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.600]
stolen election of 2000.

[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:26.120]
I am committed.

[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:26.820]
I'm coming to Florida.

[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:29.300]
Moore said to loud cheers from Democrats at the Florida delegation

[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.260]
breakfast in Boston.

[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.860]
Together we will guarantee to every Floridaian that their vote will be counted this year.

[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:37.280]
Moore's promise comes amid mounting criticism and concerns

[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.840]
about the accuracy of the touchscreen voting machines.

[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:44.640]
That replaced Florida's punch card ballots and questioned about Florida's ability

[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:48.020]
to hold fair elections four years after the debacle of 2000.

[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:52.960]
In Boston Democrats listed a litany of complaints about Florida's election system this year,

[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:56.540]
ranging from criticism of the state's creation of a new possible fell on voter list

[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:59.560]
by containing accuracies, the concerns about electronic voting machines

[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:03.240]
that do not have paper trails that can be manually recounted into allegations of

[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.380]
voter intimidation in 2000.

[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:11.220]
In Dave County, County officials confirmed a report in the New York Times yesterday

[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.740]
that the electronic records of the Democratic Humanitrile Primary

[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:16.680]
between General Reno and Bill McBride have been largely lost because of

[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.140]
the 2003 competitor, a computer credit like a dissent.

[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:24.620]
And, until a hazy governor, Jeff Bush, took notice and assigned his own

[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:28.300]
press secretary to handle the criticism, state election officials are headed

[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:29.320]
today to investigate.

[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:33.460]
Right, he wants to investigate, like sending the frauds to grab the chicken

[01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:36.780]
to that fat ass governor of yours who how anybody could have voted for

[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:39.140]
at Schmuck just boggles the mind.

[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.680]
How is that possible that anybody could have been so stupid?

[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:46.140]
Now, if you notice since you don't know who he is even,

[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:50.560]
but we didn't have one call about Barack Obama, right?

[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.140]
Who will be president one day?

[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.700]
I'm telling you that right now, or at least vice president, for start.

[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:00.620]
His speech on Tuesday night was send, stationally, was great.

[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:01.600]
What's your courtesy?

[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.000]
You should assume it.

[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.060]
WQA, and hello.

[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:06.160]
Hi, Neil.

[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:06.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.100]
You can't listen to Joe Rose, the end of Joe Rose's show today.

[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:10.680]
No.

[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:14.300]
He, uh, that's Tony Guy, we're trying to promote his thing.

[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.600]
Oh, it's Reverend Jones again.

[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:17.960]
How do you like it?

[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.620]
Now he's talking about himself in the third person.

[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:23.640]
Woo-hoo.

[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:24.720]
That's Tony Guy.

[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:27.720]
Well, listen, he's probably looking in the mirror right now.

[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.920]
Find a way our friends, the Dick Fimbler said, don't ever come back to

[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.640]
Pumpkin O' Parker, they'll horse whip you, OK?

[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.340]
They'll send Mickey McNickle after you with a whip.

[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.340]
Oh, I'm speaking of obnoxious people.

[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.460]
But what's interesting is that in an era,

[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.020]
in a something that's a great pull question.

[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:43.760]
Maybe you want to do that.

[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.520]
Who's the most obnoxious person on TV?

[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.240]
Richard Quest, Mo Rocco, there are two new ones for it.

[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:48.960]
Oh, God.

[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:52.540]
You've got to see a Mo Rocco that is.

[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.460]
Zach, have you seen that creature on there?

[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:56.200]
Yep.

[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.720]
20-chall-noon at 560.

[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.860]
Now do you understand what it was like to that WQR on vacation?

[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:04.860]
I didn't show it, Zach.

[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:05.360]
Do you understand?

[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:05.840]
Nope.

[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:06.760]
Yep.

[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:07.580]
You know?

[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:08.500]
Yep.

[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:10.880]
Wow.

[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.000]
Anyway, if your hair is fallen out in trumps or maybe just,

[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.380]
you've got a little ball spot growing and you want to fill it in,

[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:16.780]
look great.

[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.080]
Charles Alfieur, it can do either.

[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.340]
In fact, if your bald is a bowling ball,

[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:23.760]
Charles is the guy you want to see because for more than 35 long,

[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.000]
excruciating years, Charles has been taking care of guys' heads.

[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.820]
He's appeared on Good Morning America.

[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.920]
They're today showing CBS Morning News, introducing his pan-ded hair system.

[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.960]
That's the best looking in the university.

[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.340]
And most amazing natural-hirline system ever invented.

[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:39.920]
Keep in mind the most critical area of any hair system of any piece is that

[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:40.520]
hairline.

[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.000]
If it looks real like it's real hair growing out of your scalp,

[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.180]
it looks like a munch.

[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:47.020]
If it looks like a munch rat's out on your head or it looks like a munch

[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:50.620]
of straw that fell out of a barn while they just laughed their ass off at you.

[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.360]
And Charlie gives you this 30-day guarantee.

[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:54.920]
Dr. D'Man.

[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:58.060]
You try his system for a month if you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells.

[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:00.120]
But return it for a full refund.

[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.760]
So you have nothing loose but that ugly ball spot that makes you look old and not so great.

[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:09.180]
And Charlie also services and repairs existing hair systems while you wait, including shampoo and trim.

[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.080]
So don't wait, call Charlie Day and change your life forever toll free.

[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.200]
It's 1-800-321-2413.

[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:17.080]
Forget about those toes and potions, those dead munch crats.

[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.240]
You want to look really like a munch.

[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.100]
This is the way to do it.

[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.760]
Call Chuck Alphierry 1-800-321-2413.

[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:25.720]
Log on to their world famous website, chowlsalphierry.com.

[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.240]
I am little.

[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:30.560]
This is 420-0-86.

[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.060]
You weigh in.

[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.340]
Suck it in and hold it.

[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:42.600]
Ricky Williams said goodbye to football.

[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:46.880]
Ricky, how can you do this?

[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:53.700]
I want to stroke your legs and slip your track with my greasy nose.

[01:22:53.980 --> 01:23:01.640]
But if you rather slow-cased cliff now I'm pulling up my line for the season.

[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.960]
Dash my hopes of memory through.

[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:08.640]
Here's well open my eyes.

[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:12.400]
For no, with their reason.

[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:15.940]
I like bustle-tivered news.

[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:20.800]
There's a way, see, to my trailer.

[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:25.400]
And then I find you no longer here.

[01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:30.460]
You've got to take my life as a failure.

[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:34.940]
And hold the hearts of all those force-quakes.

[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:38.060]
And hold those fist and sides.

[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.040]
How did they become?

[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.540]
It's your toes I've walked in by now.

[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.560]
All they have no hope for sides.

[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:50.980]
Back to life's full-way hero.

[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.140]
It was like this.

[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:00.400]
Now only Sharks won't sleep in the sea.

[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.180]
Fourteen to noon.

[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.500]
At five sixty W.M.E.

[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:07.720]
It's a beautiful thing.

[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:09.680]
Ricky, and who do you care about the most?

[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.560]
I would say neither one of you won.

[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:13.280]
Is that new?

[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:14.280]
Yeah.

[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:15.900]
It's probably down in your lobby.

[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:16.680]
I'm sure you have it.

[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.740]
I doubt it.

[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:20.980]
Oh, and by the way, speaking of actors and actresses, actor Anthony Anderson.

[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:21.820]
You know who that is?

[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:25.720]
Oh, he appeared in films Me, Myself, and Irene, and Barbershop.

[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:26.220]
Black dude.

[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:26.840]
Okay.

[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.140]
All right, yeah, I don't know who that is.

[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.740]
He was charged yesterday with aggravated rape.

[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.780]
After a woman told her 30, she was assaulted on the set of a movie.

[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:38.660]
Anderson, 33, and Wayne Whitterspoon, 42, both of L.A.,

[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:41.600]
were taken into custody to the Internet after the woman reported the assault.

[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:45.900]
Said Steve Schurr, the relation to the former dolphin coach,

[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.600]
Shelby County Sheriff's Department and Public Affairs Officer,

[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.480]
Anderson was in Memphis shooting a film title, Hustle and Flow.

[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.000]
Whitterspoon was working on the film's crew.

[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.100]
Charging and refining against both men yesterday afternoon,

[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.160]
Schurr said Bond was expected to be set at 20 grand for each man.

[01:24:59.260 --> 01:24:59.960]
They'll be here in general.

[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:02.600]
Sessions Court this morning quoted Jennifer Donalds,

[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.840]
Communications Director for the Shelby County DA's office.

[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:08.500]
Schurr said the crew had been shooting at the Shelby County Correctional Center,

[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:12.160]
a work farm for jail inmates, and the assault allegedly occurred at the state,

[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:14.340]
at the site, at the production unit, too, today.

[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:16.660]
Schurr said an extra toll, that could be,

[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:19.100]
that she was lured into a production trailer by Whitterspoon.

[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.860]
She told authorities that Anderson was already in the trailer,

[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.560]
and that both men sexually assaulted her, Schurr said.

[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:28.020]
Witnesses reported seeing the woman leave the trailer screaming,

[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.000]
and without any clothes on, huh?

[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:30.960]
Screaming.

[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.520]
Kind of like that, that hacking guy.

[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.180]
Is that man he's right or something?

[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:37.860]
Yeah, why not do that?

[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:38.840]
I don't know. I like that one.

[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:39.660]
I just felt like it.

[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:41.760]
What's his name?

[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:41.820]

[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:42.720]
It's Jeffrey Hacking.

[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:43.240]
What's his name?

[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:44.280]
Michael Hacking.

[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.320]
O.J. Hacking.

[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.380]
The woman was taken by hospital authorities,

[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.580]
would not say if she had been released.

[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.380]
Spurr said for Anderson, their late release,

[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:52.980]
the brief statement went, they sang the actor absolutely dies,

[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.600]
the heinous, heinous charges that were made against him.

[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.320]
He's a happily married family man, who's never been accused of such crap.

[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:02.380]
In addition, 19 movie critics, Anderson co-created and started a TV sitcom,

[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:04.400]
all about the Anderson's on the WWE channel.

[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:05.480]
Got the other on it.

[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.040]
There you go.

[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.060]
Another famous actor in trouble.

[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:11.160]
Another unusual?

[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:12.600]
Oh, yeah, never happens.

[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:18.000]
5'6'7'0'5'60, pound 5'60' on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.700]
Things are setting up just fantastic for this afternoon's ballgame.

[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:24.360]
See, had parents in there getting all, all bent out of shape.

[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:27.340]
Oh, it's raining and I think we may have to do an extra hour and a half.

[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.800]
No chance, sweetheart.

[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.140]
No chance.

[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:34.760]
But as much chance am I doing that today is you getting laid some time this year.

[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.800]
I'm Josh Beckett.

[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.540]
WDQ Am, hello.

[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.100]
I'm Dr. Neal.

[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:40.760]
Speaking.

[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.340]
Oh, hi, Neal.

[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:48.240]
Just called to confirm that yes indeed, Ira no longer said the Atlantic should be here.

[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.740]
Oh, no, are you kidding me?

[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.740]
About 45 days ago.

[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:52.820]
I'll be them.

[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.920]
I haven't found out where he's moved on to.

[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:00.960]
But second thing I wanted to ask is, you've seen Fahrenheit 9.11.

[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:01.860]
Yes, stop.

[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:08.380]
Why is it that there were no senators that showed up to sign all these people's predictions?

[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:10.760]
You mean including John Edwards and John Kerry?

[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.980]
Yes, Nelson and everybody else.

[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.100]
I mean, any senator could assign that, right?

[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:17.420]
Yeah.

[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:19.140]
I guess the one.

[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:19.960]
No balls, man.

[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:20.560]
No balls.

[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.060]
No, man.

[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:22.620]
Where is Nelson?

[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:23.160]
Right.

[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:24.720]
It's unbelievable.

[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:26.600]
We got Neal, too, man.

[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:29.000]
And when I, and Ira, I'll let you know.

[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.260]
Give me a big kiss for us.

[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:30.900]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:31.200]
Yeah.

[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:32.400]
Where was Bill Nelson?

[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.960]
Where was Bobby Graham?

[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:36.000]
That's it.

[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.900]
It's kind of the same philosophy now.

[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.600]
You know, the Democratic Party decided, well, we don't want to continue doing this.

[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.360]
And for the good of the country, we'll just let it go.

[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:42.700]
Right.

[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:46.960]
And of course, there was Gore himself standing up there presiding over the session.

[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.940]
Did that not make you want to cry?

[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.380]
It made you want to scream.

[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:50.860]
Not cry.

[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:51.820]
It made you want to scream.

[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.300]
What is wrong with you, man?

[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:57.700]
And he's gabbling in the shouting them down and shutting them up, etc. and so on.

[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.160]
While they're trying to do like a real cubic servant say, hey, this.

[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:01.560]
This was a fraud, baby.

[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.140]
That's a problem.

[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.140]
I mean, you want, if you're a, you know, to the left of Hitler, then you certainly are probably

[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:12.020]
going to vote for Kerry or at least to hope that he wins.

[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:15.200]
But the fact that the matter is the Democratic Party for all the hoopla this week

[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.900]
at the convention is so weak need and yellow, yellow belly, then libert and all these other things.

[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.560]
Which is why they're trying, oh, we don't want to make any personal attacks.

[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:25.680]
We don't want to be shrill and throw.

[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:26.160]
Why not?

[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:30.480]
If there's been a time in history of this country where we've got this rampant fascism going on,

[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.760]
where we have an illegal war based on a pack of lies that there's no question about,

[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.060]
then it's right now.

[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.320]
And instead, well, we want to rise above that and provide a positive message.

[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.100]
It was why Edwards was on there last night.

[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:46.700]
And for all the hoopla about it, I didn't hear anything new.

[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.160]
I didn't hear anything really strong.

[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.420]
I just, you know, he looks fine.

[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.980]
You know, he looks like a guy.

[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.880]
He does a canned spam speedy.

[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:57.020]
Looks like a 51-year-old guy who looks about 40.

[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.420]
Okay, more power to him, especially when his wife was about 51 looking 80.

[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.300]
When she comes on there with her Teresa Heinz hairdo,

[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:07.920]
and I do think that Teresa may have been heavily medicated when she made her speech on Tuesday night.

[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:08.520]
Ah, who cares?

[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.020]
That's the rumor.

[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.440]
That hair man has just got to go.

[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:13.160]
Of course, when he worth a billion dollars, right.

[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:18.640]
She said she don't look her hair ain't quite as good as what's on Edwards' wife thing.

[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:20.140]
Oh, I don't know.

[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:20.480]
Bill.

[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.100]
Yeah, Bill is Bill's, but he's trying to catch up as what she said.

[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:26.480]
That was bad.

[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:29.600]
How come they make the Heinz ketchup now and those upside down bottles?

[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:30.600]
How many years they've been doing that?

[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:31.500]
About 30, man.

[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.360]
That's the greatest idea since sliced bread.

[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:33.820]
Yeah.

[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.120]
They make it bottles upside down with it.

[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:36.820]
At least with the baby.

[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.260]
Don't get that watery stuff at the top.

[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:39.900]
Oh, really?

[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:40.340]
Yeah.

[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:41.240]
Ah.

[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:42.980]
See, I don't eat ketchup.

[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:43.800]
Do you want to know why?

[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.200]
The ketchup's for oil?

[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:45.960]
No.

[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.440]
It's loaded with, oh, carbs.

[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:49.300]
Sugar.

[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:49.820]
Yeah.

[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.160]
That's what carbs is loaded with sugar.

[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:56.620]
In fact, if you look on the label on Heinz ketchup or, uh, hunts or any other ones, you'll

[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.320]
find a lot of azucada in there.

[01:29:58.620 --> 01:29:59.680]
But I don't eat sugar anymore.

[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:00.760]
No more.

[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:01.940]
I just mentioned that.

[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:02.760]
I want to get Zach upset.

[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:04.120]
I don't eat sugar at all.

[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:05.600]
I love sugar.

[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:07.040]
I love sugar.

[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:07.040]

[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:08.440]
You're going to die.

[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.460]
We'll bring you a couple of flowers.

[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.780]
You'll say, you know, he was a pretty good guy.

[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.360]
He didn't have much to say and he couldn't speak.

[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:17.260]
Because, is, see, your vocal cords are being, the reason you have such trouble speaking is

[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:21.020]
because your vocal cords are being choked by a sea of fat inside your throat.

[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.400]
We'll get a nice bouquet of doda's for his conversation.

[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.220]
Yeah, that would be good.

[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:26.920]
We'll get a crispy cream bouquet to stick right on your tombstone.

[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:27.420]
How's that?

[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:28.800]
I like it.

[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:30.260]
Watch your back, Zach.

[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:31.680]
I want to tell you that right now.

[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:32.160]
Absolutely.

[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.520]
56670560, pound 560 on it.

[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.520]
Is anybody going to talk about Barack Obama?

[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:39.860]
Man.

[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:45.260]
I saw a cartoon where it was, I guess it was in the National Post-It this morning, where, uh,

[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:46.640]
they showed a picture of the TV.

[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.680]
He was on, and there was, uh, Obama speaking of the convention here tonight.

[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:53.740]
And one of the president's aides at San Diego, all it looks like they finally found Obama.

[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:57.640]
Oh, for real.

[01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:59.400]
Yeah, we had to think about it.

[01:30:59.400 --> 01:30:59.980]
I was like, oh, for like a boy.

[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:00.300]
Yeah.

[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:00.640]
Huh?

[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:03.800]
Well, what do you know Obama from Osano?

[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:04.780]
From Abu Garo.

[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:05.540]
Right now, either.

[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:06.780]
WQA and Hello.

[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:08.600]
Hey, you know how you doing?

[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:09.640]
Pretty good, Palli.

[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:15.160]
Uh, I met you guys many moves ago when I was a good looking young man at the objorge's age.

[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.660]
Back in college, just every way.

[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:17.700]
You bought a core vet from us.

[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:18.620]
Okay, great.

[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.400]
Uh, just come on, let you get on your own.

[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:24.960]
One thing that's on my mind, I was in my love house last night, I was watching Spanish TV.

[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:29.300]
And they got, uh, all these marbles, candidates are out there.

[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:31.240]
And my god, what up?

[01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:33.340]
Deca Cards, we got the shoes from here in Miami.

[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:35.360]
All right, Papa Wampalu.

[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:35.860]
Yeah.

[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:38.080]
I want to hear your views on that.

[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:40.300]
I'll hang up on, see what you think about that.

[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:40.960]
Okay.

[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:41.740]
I don't.

[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.440]
567-0560.

[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:49.440]
I think that got one to date.

[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:50.980]
Yeah.

[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.040]
What was that all about?

[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:52.500]
He met me.

[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.660]
He sold me a card collection, uh, the collection or whatever, a core vet.

[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.720]
I don't think I ever bought a core vet at the collection.

[01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:00.020]
Now, what he said, or would he say some sort of relief to you?

[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:00.460]
Or whatever?

[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:01.500]
Whatever he said.

[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:03.440]
I kind of tune it out when you're being picked up, you know.

[01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:04.600]
I see.

[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:09.120]
And excuse fouling bushes busted by the 9-11 reports is Robert's year.

[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.280]
Do I have time to read this whole thing?

[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:10.880]
Not now, I know.

[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:11.680]
Maybe in the last 10.

[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:14.480]
We only got like 35 minutes into a free game show.

[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:15.380]
Oh, no.

[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:17.740]
I think we're getting screwed in tattoo.

[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:18.280]
Oh.

[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:19.660]
That's bad.

[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:21.100]
Anybody believe it?

[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:21.340]
No.

[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:21.840]
No, you're right.

[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:26.300]
Hey, listen, we deserve, like I said, a little less work, a lot more money.

[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.080]
Everybody made bonus this time.

[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:32.880]
Even Clarex are a little league program director, so that you got a bonus.

[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:33.680]
Don't point this one.

[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:34.100]
Finger at me.

[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:34.880]
Yeah.

[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:37.740]
It's not a finger suite, all right.

[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:39.380]
I felt like a finger.

[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.360]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.860]
And here I thought that was on vacation.

[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:46.540]
Pound 5, 60 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.560]
Don't forget to join Little George this Saturday.

[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:50.800]
Big big event happening Saturday.

[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.180]
I'm not even not sure why, but I guess there's been a lot of money.

[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:54.000]
So I think they are, yeah.

[01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:54.600]
Okay.

[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:59.880]
Well, if there's been a lot of money, we're here to promote and give all kinds of freebies and encourage and et cetera.

[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:06.560]
Join George Saturday, two-till-forward, Revis Motorsports Segway, a block north of Sanford Road on Dixie Highway.

[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:08.960]
We're registered in a free Segway human transportation device.

[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:13.840]
The QM QIs will be there, plus food provided by Atlantic City Sub's, where I were used to make the difference,

[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.860]
but regardless, they're not the food is still pretty dang good, and it's free there anyway.

[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:20.400]
So get there early before all of those are going to chop up the free food.

[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:25.120]
Four minutes till noon at QM, I've been telling you about a laser recharge, the toner recharge,

[01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:27.060]
cartridge specialist for the past few weeks.

[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:30.300]
A lot of you called 1-800, oh, and by the way, before I do the spot.

[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.340]
Oh, yes, she did begin.

[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:37.660]
If you have something to do, you can leave now because in the noon to 12-30 hour we have nothing but spots.

[01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:38.960]
We have three breaks to enter again.

[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.660]
Proving beyond a shadow of a doubt, all we want is the money, baby, and we're still number one.

[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.720]
They still love us so much, they can't turn it off.

[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:50.380]
We got spots up the old ass.

[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:56.780]
I haven't told you about a laser recharge, the toner recharge, cartridge specialist for the past few weeks on the show.

[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:02.320]
A lot of you have called 1-800-287-9212, which we're glad to hear, and you've saved a lot of money on your printing an orphysi.

[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.600]
For those of you who haven't called yet, what are you waiting for?

[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:13.900]
A laser recharge is about ink jets, thermocarbon paper, supplies, and provides service-important and maintenance for most-makes and models of machines to make them run just like brand new again.

[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:23.460]
When you call 1-800-287-9212, you'll talk to just Bob, the sole owner has been supplied the Mrs. and South Florida with what they need, in most cases within 24 hours.

[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:34.480]
A laser recharge can save you up to 50% on new cartridges as compared to depot pricing, and I want you to keep in mind that all the cartridges sold by A laser recharge are remanufactured, not refilled.

[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:37.980]
Just about anybody can send you cheap refilled cartridges, but you only get what you pay for.

[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:46.880]
Remanufactured cartridges are the only smart way to go, and A laser carries a complete line of cartridges for printers, copiers, and faxes along with brothers and Xerox drums too.

[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:52.140]
A laser recharge is probably the individualized service-offer way, no questions asked, satisfaction guarantee.

[01:34:52.740 --> 01:35:01.240]
So if you need toner cartridges, all of these things just pick up that phone and call just Bob at A laser recharge at 1-800-287-9212.

[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:05.880]
That's 1-800-287-9212 around a wicked way, but it's A laser recharge.com.

[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:12.520]
Why am I in the world? We are support-video-5-6-6-0-UAM.

[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:19.300]
Perala, it beat at 12-1 hour on WQ-AM.

[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:16.160]
Perala, it beat at 12-1 hour on WQ-AM.

[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:32.200]
Perala, it beat at 12-1 hour on WQ-AM.

[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:38.860]
Perala, it beat at 12-1 hour on WQ-AM.

[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.500]
Perala, it beat at 12-1 hour on WQ-AM.

[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:08.780]
Perala, it beat at 12-1 hour on WQ-AM.

[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:09.540]
Ppeta gag in written Presby, Incheon.

[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:11.140]
P.Publet's sit down and win over Tito tilo sell it out and 아니면 use a assertive

[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:12.480]
excuse Lord Lindsay ensured that about 100-215 left to come on WQ-AM in the ganzu of чаke,

[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:12.480]

[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.740]
Ricky's and he shaved his head.

[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:20.140]
In fact, the herald today is going to be very fine 2004 March photo here, Ricky Williams,

[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:23.580]
who is looking almost human there, pretty good for Ricky.

[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:28.240]
Even if retired dolphin running back, Ricky Williams changes his mind to the starts of

[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:28.860]
return of football.

[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.000]
The season says the herald will be forced to serve a four games suspension after failing

[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.440]
a third drug test for use of the Wicked Wee.

[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.360]
Oh my God.

[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.020]
Williams admitted today that marijuana played a large role in his retirement that he originally

[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:44.640]
indicated that he learned of a third failed test and upcoming suspension just days before

[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:48.600]
informing Coach Dave Wons state of his decision to retire in football.

[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.020]
Williams said however there were a hundred reasons for his retirement, maybe not a hundred

[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:53.420]
probably.

[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:57.960]
He said a hundred for his retirement that is desire to continue smoking marijuana without

[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.760]
inhibition was merely one of them.

[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:03.220]
He said it was not addicted to the drug but merely that he didn't believe in government

[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:04.580]
NFL laws banning it.

[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:08.100]
He said he'd already decided to quit football even before testing positive for a second

[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:09.020]
time for marriage.

[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:12.220]
A wini useless last season in Korea, $650,000 fine.

[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:16.120]
He's appealing that fine, fight a New York argue with KSP for an arbiter with his attorney

[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.940]
that received work last week that his appeal had been denied.

[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:23.740]
While the appeal was pending, Williams said he continued smoking marijuana while I'm

[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:27.900]
tour with Rucker Lenny Kravitz and Europe to say in Europe, oh and Europe, the group

[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:30.220]
Europe, and failed a third test upon his return.

[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.700]
See if they would have written with your group, your assistant what do you say?

[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:36.320]
They screwed it up.

[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:40.200]
He said he'd been using a masking agent to cleanse the system of being randomly tested

[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.340]
for two seasons but said he didn't even bother before the last test after returning from

[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:44.560]
Europe.

[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.000]
So you see it is from Europe.

[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:48.460]
That's what it's supposed to say there.

[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.900]
What a hero screwed up bad man.

[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:51.600]
You can't even figure out what the other is trying to write.

[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.280]
Idiots.

[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.840]
God you're a bunch of modiconies.

[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:56.620]
I didn't quit football because I failed a drug test.

[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:59.700]
He said I failed a drug test because I was ready to quit football.

[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.440]
In other words, he didn't give a flying crap.

[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:02.180]
How do you like that?

[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:02.520]
Right.

[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:05.980]
He's smoking up a storm and don't give a crap who don't like it.

[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:08.600]

[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.160]

[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:30.240]
What do you mean?

[01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:38.340]

[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:52.600]
Of the results of his appeal at the NFL's drug rules didn't run him off but rather merely reinforced that his lifestyle

[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.780]
Didn't belong in for the regimented world of football

[01:39:54.780 --> 01:40:00.120]
Williams who suffers from social anxiety disorder was a spokesperson for the antidepressant

[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:22.900]
Nice going, Edith.

[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:28.960]
Francis McDormand 35, Jennifer Jason Lee 22, Helen Mirren has got 20.

[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:34.860]
Natalie Portman 18, Jennifer Tilly 16, Emma Thompson 13, Tanya Shire 11.

[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.200]
Now they will fear her.

[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.560]
Joan Londell 11.

[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:39.280]
I'm sure that's spelled wrong.

[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:41.100]
Linda Blair 7, huh?

[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.360]
I'm sure it's spelled wrong too.

[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:45.600]
Linda Blair 7, Linda Hamilton 7, Amanda Plummer 7.

[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:51.400]
Joan Allen 7, Ellen Burston 4, Penelope Ann Miller 4, Scarlett Johansson has got 3.

[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:54.280]
Luis Fletcher's only got a pair out of 271 votes.

[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:55.280]
I can't believe that.

[01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:58.500]
But that's our audience you know what I'm saying?

[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:00.100]
That's yeah.

[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.060]
I guess we got to do another break.

[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:08.840]
As Dominic Q.M. gives New Lean to the expression No Show.

[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.300]
Another break already?

[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:11.220]
There you go.

[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:12.800]
Hey listen, we have no shame.

[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:13.340]
We don't care.

[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:16.360]
This is the one place where the Gimitier is exactly the way it is.

[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:17.940]
Right up front, honest on the line.

[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:20.300]
There is no time to be doing any kind of a show.

[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:20.940]
We're going to pre-test.

[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:22.380]
Maybe we'll take one quick call.

[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:23.740]
Like line 9 is always a winner.

[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:24.340]
Q.A.M.

[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:25.600]
Hey Neil.

[01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:26.460]
Yes sir.

[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:29.900]
What are these reports about Howard coming to Q.A.M.?

[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:31.380]
It's all over the internet right now.

[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:32.280]
Says who?

[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.200]
Alladff.com and fmqb.com?

[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:37.300]
Howard David.

[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:38.840]
No Howard Stern.

[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:39.860]
Never heard that.

[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:41.900]
Now check it out.

[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:43.840]
Okay, when in doubt we'll check it out.

[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:44.380]
How do you like that?

[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:44.880]
Have you heard that?

[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:45.860]
For what?

[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:48.200]
Howard David's coming to Q.A.M.

[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:49.300]
No, the new improved.

[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:51.700]
I have no idea.

[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:54.460]
It's all over the internet so the chances are it's probably a full of credit.

[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:54.880]
Maybe the Howard.

[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.420]
He's got a whole new attitude along with his whole new dude.

[01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:58.360]
What is that?

[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:02.400]
He's like a totally different person since the head shaving incident.

[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:03.260]
Mo Howard David.

[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:04.220]
I'm telling you.

[01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:05.900]
He's upbeat, friendly.

[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:07.780]
He's beat up.

[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:08.540]
Well that's good news.

[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:10.240]
Yeah.

[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:13.040]
Maybe he was like Sanson and reverse.

[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:15.540]
Maybe he was like the haircut done it like Ricky Williams.

[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:16.880]
Look, he finally wised up.

[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:18.860]
It's good enough for Ricky and for Shepton.

[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.640]
It's good enough for Mo, am I right?

[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:20.960]
Absolutely.

He wears extra large pants and I love him in France.

[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.660]
